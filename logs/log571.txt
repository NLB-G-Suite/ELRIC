The penis will not grow or shrink for excessive use or lack of use because it is not a muscle, the only growth that occurs is from the blood filling the spongy tissue upon erection

He's hot a little list! He's got a little list!
So scootaloo, what are we doing here?
(discovers a small ruby near stairwell)
alexxm, yardwork. That pretty much establishes that Lando won't be around, and Freeman won't be hiring Ruckus for it either.
I have a list of all the things I don't give a rats arse about.
Scoot-Scootaloo: they really saved your *plot :P
A list? What's the list for?
those girls saved his ASS
he's gonna read my little dashie? but I'm not prepared
Kammerjunk I don't, to long :/

Mega Man X is my entire fucking childhood.

Scoot-Scootaloo: Check my PM with THAT sequitis

MOO!
I did not play any Mega Man game.
Or Megaman.
Whichever.
umg. Ilivid fuck off
When Mega Man X2 came out for the Wii I literally came.

11,01One of the most annoying things about SR3 was the help that never shut up.

Howdy yall
Who would build a platform like that in the first place?
da old platforms
whody!
ooh
quick man
i mean howdy
quick man is hell
Vordox yes, but but the visuals, big complex invirontment and number of possible moves is just too big in modern games that I don't think there can be the same amount of self learning possible like in older games
xxMoopyxx: Salve.
11,01Lol.
eeyup
Lil_B: Graphics are overrated.
dem mighty hammers
PAWNCH!
Roll abuse
Lil_B: Bull crap

This video was awesome when it first came out.
He's right though, old games didn't shove useless help down your throat
mega man x is an amazing game
It still is.
Lil_B: yes
if you havent played it... I feel sorry for you
GENIUS
Lil_B: I think self learning will be a big part of that
JUMPNSHOOTMAN!
its obvious that this guy likes megaman x alot
who wouldnt
Commensiot
I can recognize every scene in this video. What level, where it is, and what is coming out to kill you. I fucking love this game.
Aladdin, that game was annoying.
yes
well it was probably his childhood
Alchemist I hope so, I have seen the Trailer on VGA and nobody understood it XD, the creator has 3 pHDs, 2 of which are Masters, I hope I can wrap my head around it
I love Egoraptor's work.

I have Megaman X on the SNES in fact

Seriously, I would -love- playing on the Oddysey.

We need to watch the chat version of episodes
i got this song on my ipod :)
Nittany_Discord: I wasn't in the Mane 6 rooms at this point. I was spared the flood.
11,01Aww :<
11,01Every room flooded.
Nittany_Discord: Not regulars.
11,01I think I was in RD when that happened.
one of my favorite PMVs
11,01Or main.
sounds alot diffrent from oringinal
I wasen't a brony when this episode came out. I became a brony the weekend "A Friend in Deed" aired. But my first epiosde was Lesson Zero :P
hmm can you use your mic on these chat rooms
Kammerjunk mention this room in mane no more
MadSurge: btw im actually playing skyrim right now. and apparently i cant pickpocket children lol
Nope
1,11...that voice....is that RD?
If we could that would be cool
Something that always made me wonder.... The Elements of Harmony are repesented by a Rainbow right?... And a Rainbow has seven colors... But there are only 6 listed elements... :|
A Friend in Deed is indeed an awesome episode
Silly filly, I just said regulars. Nopony joined, eh?
pony_3803: Nope.avi
I was already watching ponies when that episode aired, but I hadn't caught up
Nittany_Discord: Was #bronystate open at that episode? I thought that was after the main room was closed on live airings.
John Madden.
k
11,01It's Fall-Out Boy except they changed the pitch.
Silverscreen: its modulated to sound like it
Not ReAl!
Half and half on this point.
football
>.>
twi_sprinkler_GS17: Bethesda's children are invincible, don't you know?
1,11oh.
there we go
1,11Well, they did a good job.
ICARUS
Not with the right mods they're not!
Rarity killed the Wonderbolts
11,01Might have done it to prevent copyright claiming.
poor Spitfire
seems legit, Nittany_Discord
the wonderbolts never do anything
dat purfact mur Dr
MadSurge: Oo interesting. i also remember in WoW kids dont have a death animation. for the best i guess
Silverscreen: it's the Offspring, not Fallout Boy
11,01Kammerjunk: I don't remember when we started closing main during pony eps.
Fair 'nuff.
11,01Offspring. Whatever.
hmmm
Fallout boy...I can only think of vault boy
Rainbow should have been put into the Wonderbolts then
a) this is a style of music known as NightCore
Ugh. i got to run to the pharmacy...
Rainbow is just too awesome to be in the Wonderbolts
also, its Offspring - your gonna go far kid
dat tripzy
8,6mane started to get muted during the episodes about 2/3 of the way through s2
Ah.
So much dubstep of this scene
kirzstryfe why
its wonderful
Regulars seems like a exclusive club
kirzstryfe: Mhhm
GarrettBrony: Too much chat :P
So was that all you guys reacted to derpy whooves and when she spkoed
Man, how busy is this site going to be on Season 3 episode 1
11,01I smiled.
oh shit
I suppose it's what the name says. For regulars.
mitamaking: It's gonna be crazy
so busy it wont be up? mitamaking
mitamaking its going to be crazy
Probably because it kinda is.
mitamaking I expect the internet will break.
well, when I saw derpy talking, I was not used to background ponies yet
Nittany_Discord: pretty much :D
8,6because it's a bit difficult to moderate 4k people in a single channel
mitamaking: its gonna be worse than a DDoS
so I did nothing
hey mario_pony
I mean I couldn't even pull up the video during the season 2 finale, I had to jump to BronyTV
And that's how all the side chatrooms we're born ^^
Also, INB4 main chat flood when BMN starts.
kirzstryfe I know. during the season 2 finale. no pony could even be heard with all the people in it
didnt we have like, 6K people on here once, or was I just imagining that >.>
Hi xmasskills
cowvarkian: Probably not.
ok
and i have pesterchum now
cowvarkian you are not imagining things
cowvarkian i think that might have been the finale
mario_pony: nice!!
Rarity chat 4 life
mitamaking: I just went to the Spike channel (no chat)
Ikr.
mario_pony: im on it now message me im arsenicSwordsman
kk
I go to rainbowdash because its the closest room for me to click on
I always forget what it's like on BMN until it actually happens, and then this channel becomes validated.

you can make your own channels in the TV
:P
so i guess you could
BlazeAngel: How is your Eye?
YEP :D I survived
Spell-of-Gaming, alexxm: It's simple really. Just go into the broadcasting folder in your Sims 2 folder and place an .avi file there.
In sonic history, Robotnik only won once
KaitothePony: At least you had chi-oh, wait:P
good to hear that

how do you makes videos like this?
good afternoon thegreatandpowerfult
sUp TheGreatAndPowerfulT
my favorite type of music is music from the medieval ages and from the 20's till the 80's :)

Shrek?
Eddmario: The space core does nothing but waste space in your inventory
Oh no.
Fallout: Online sounds like somethnig you wont see.
If you do
Its gonna be a pay to play
Nittany_Discord: Oh shit >.<
SploogeTheFish: Well, there was that thing they won the rights to do.

I had a Shrek toy which LITERALLY spilled slime. :I

Eddmario: You know Metal Arms?
SploogeTheFish: Know it? I still own a copy of it!
Eddmario: Same here
SploogeTheFish: nope,it was beacuse the original the people working on the fallout online wore also the makers of the original fallouts,but bethesda bought the rights and bye bye fallout online,they decide to scrap the project :'(
Now, I don't know where it went and I don't even think it works completly...
I miss Megaman
SpadeMagnes[R]: who doesn't ?
Why do you want a fallout online? Cant you play like , the new Mmos that is coming out? Perfect world or what its called
Eddmario: The creators of the game, I think they went bankrupt due to their Underrated game, Metal Arms
I really wanted Rockman Online
Meh, the only Megaman games I've played are Battle Network 3 and an emulation of Battle Network 4.
11,01BlazeAngel: I'll pray for a miracle.

You have to take medicine to keep your body from killing the foriegn organ
sergio_scriptor: Fallout 3 and NV suck, if you've ever played Fallout 1 and 2. Bethesda scrapped the original story completely.
Nittany_Discord: ever heard of a glass eye?......

The Great Medic
Nittany_Discord, BlazeAngel: If they can replace corneas, they can replace the full eye
As for eye surgery, that's all very case-to-case. Eyes are delicate, there's no straight answer until they work out the kinks in that optic camera.
I love Charlie Chaplin.-
medic
RobertRevenge: the others fallout games wore a diferent experience,and to be honest i prefer the bethesda fallout,even the story and experience i think it's better,they defenatly improved the old games in A LOT
Medic Chaplin
why does TF always lead to ponies, and ponies always lead to TF?
Whoever's streaming, check your internet connection
Kammerjunk: i always vote "the gold rush" for B-Movie :)
11,01Full eye is harder. Have to deal with the optic nerve.
I hate DeathClaws
im playing this in BO lobby and lets see how they act
O.o
so wise
OohShiny: So many bronies play TF2, and so many TF2 players are bronies.
sergio_scriptor: Better story? In Bethesda game, lolnope
sergio_scriptor: I prefered them as an RPG game rather than a fps with turn-based capabilities.
And why does this speech make so much sense?
role playing game game
"sniff"
How the HELL did we get from the Sonic Rainboom scene from a PMV to this?
this speach... *tear*
The medic is the kindest man on earth
SpadeMagnes[R]: Because he's the Medic
Spademages: It's charlie Chaplins greatest moment
Seriously why does this speech make me feel so much
...Is it bad if I've memorised this speech by heart?

What a day. Been shopping. Found artichokes at 99 cents-- grabbed one. Picked up three blindbags on a whim-- two BG ponies and Rainbow Dash. (luck.) How are you guys?

RaveBrony: Any of the first 4 Pokemon movies, or the Digimon movie
How the hell does Gruntilda have grade A plutonium in Clanker's cavern?
BlazeAngel: Ill look it up :)
8,6then I'd suggest getting off the irc and focusing :p

Young Frankenstein had an 8/10 on imdb. I shouldn't have been B, imoo.

deal with it
I love the random Ask Princess Molestia pics

Ask Princess Molestia and Gamer Luna is hilarious
Dat video.
alexxm: a little video called " 10th doctor: the musical" uses this song when the master makes his second apperance so,now i always see the master when i ear this song :|
aaaaaa
like babes in toyland? kirzstryfe
Eddmario: O.o
8,6Young Frankenstein is a B because it's a cult flick
kirzstryfe: You forgot any film by Ed Wood.
8,6babes got WMC'd, so that's the answer there :p
sergio_scriptor ok then
Quick_Thinker i'm sure they can recognize eminen
kirzstryfe: But i dont know any :( it would be nice to fully fill out the survey for once :D
Young Frankenstein is not a cult flick
kirzstryfe I ave important scholarships that I will lose the support of if I'm not perfect, I can't afford to lose them, which mean I can't afford a partial
how about blazing saddles >.>
what's the name of this vid?
o_o
mic the microphone ?
kirzstryfe: Mel Brooks considers Young Frankenstien his best work.
cowvarkian: That's another good movie that's considered "B"
i know they can but im trying to find bronys in BO maybe even get a brohoof from oone so this song really fucks up all my efforts
8,6pick any Sci-Fi original movie, always a safe choice for a B
Blazing Saddles was an A movie here
cowvarkian: for b movie ? sure
That was...the weirdest video
lol suck
cowvarkian: I don't think it's been long enough. Probably same with Spaceballs
My brain is full of buck

Dken2021: Hmmm... Nah!

So does anypony here play SW:TOR?
I'll admit, I think Twilight's kinda cute
Because I want to know if it's fun after level 15.
I play WoW, sorry
What is the point of dancing games
CORRI SCAPPA C'E' IL NEMESIIIIS
touhou reimu
8,6people still play TOR? :3
Eddmario: Im with you on that ^^
kirzstryfe: It's like WoW, BUT WITH LIGHTSABERS.
never saw touhou project
Or so I gather.
kirzstryfe: Funny you should say that, because it's numbers are dropping. Hard
You mean the TORtanic? (Sorry, had to do it)
8,6I know what it is :P
hey everypony how are ya?
I PLAY THE OLD REPUBLIC THE RPG NOT THE MMOROPG
Kammerjunk: i heard it gets boring after a short while
Royal: I like that name.
CAZZO DI PORTA C'E' IL NEMESIS
Kammerjunk: i had to pay money to play the game AFTER i bought it from the store ? NO THANKS :|
wow
What happened with the new SW:TOR?
can can
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony how've you been
I mean, you know how everyone has a cartoon character they have sort of a crush on? She's mine.
name of vid??????????????
I wish I could pick the Black Panther mini series for B.
I stopped playing WoW a short while ago.
Did it bomb?
I heard TOR was just WoW with lasers and passed
Its going F2P soon :D
and for some reason, mips is really laggy on my end, stupid ISP
sergio_scriptor: That's pretty much how most MMOs work, yeah.
I'm just upset it won't have online play or the ability to swap between Mickey or Oswald.
8,6TOR crashed hard after what, 3 months?
endurance u said u_u
I hope I didnt scare ya with my face to face man face kirzstryfe. Demodemoman demodemoman demoman
kirzstryfe: More like, 2 and a half.

Also, this vid needs to be the commercial for the show around the time that season 3 premieres
Blazeangel: yes
Everything seems to be copying wow now adays
name of vid please??????????? :[ :) :| :O
whats this video called?
Bioware is sadware. They haven't made anything of real polish since Mass Effect 2.
SpadeMagnes[R]: ...And WoW is copying everything else.
Not that WoW is the paragon of MMO's
80's star wasr arcade game is best arcade game
my little can can
im good just ordered Dark Souls (Ps3) so that should be here by Tues at least :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: Would vinyl be open?
logan endurance pmv mashup
BlazeAngel: Whenever you cook breakfast you'll be a demopan.
LoGaN: This part, or the whole thing?
oo-o-o-o--o-o--o-o
But every MMO is trying to be WoW
And they fail
Kammerjunk: except that WoW was first
Meanwhile: :P
yay ya y ay ay ayayay
twi_sprinkler_GS17: Everquest.
My favorite was the vocaloid one <3

SploogeTheFish: Everyone with a Gamecube
Even thought WoW is starting to tank. Which is a good thing in my opinion.
BUT where is my MLP MMO?! * Throws money at screen* Gimme!!
SpadeMagnes[R]: Actually, that's not true. I know of an MMO that's unintentionally trying to be TF2
I can pull of a demoman Cosplay if I get a tan now, eh Meanwhile?
i grew up with luigis mansion
MaxTheSwedishBrony: They're working on it.
SploogeTheFish it was too short

SpadeMagnes[R] as if the game wasn't eaasy enough
This video screams suicide in my ears. Lol.
Saigneur: Np.
i hated the star coins in 3d land
stop being cute pinkie
Kammerjunk: not familiar with that term
Tovler: Only the Wii version, and I know from personal experience that it's fucking impossible to play in multiplayer
I'm sorry, someone tagged my name but I couldn't find it.
LALALALALALALALALALALALALALALSALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA

Yes, I didn't miss the movie night.
Antology plz
Sweet.
ANTHOLOGY!!!
2 twilight : it's about time
other videos
ah yeah the anthology :D
dat music is awesome anyway
Why does bowser never give up?
twi_sprinkler_GS17: Basically, it means shooting lighting out of your crotch every time you level up makes you feel good. Bit more nuanced, but then I would have to go into detail, and that takes too long for my attention span.
Scoot-Scootaloo the first of the sequel?
i suck at gaming so i suck at getting star coins
So awesome Picture/video
Scoot-Scootaloo: Play BOTH Anthologies back-to-back. Screw the Friday Movie Night
*or
One game he fucking DIED
00,03lolno
All this song makes me thing of....IS SAINTS ROW 3
Eddmario: No way.
and became a zombie
How long is the Anthrology?
<Kammerjunk> That's how I feel whenever I play Infamous.
anthology is 82 minutes
Movie night is one of the many soul-parts of Bronystate. I FUCKING LOVE MOVIE NIGHTS, WOO!
MASF123 15 minutes long
20 minutes
MASF123: it's over 9000 seconds
MASF123: 50 minutes
the second part I mean
SpadeMagnes[R] he takes his lessons fro mDr. Wily
MASF123: The first is about half an hour. The sequal is about an hour and a half
Heck-- Anthology II is practially a movie in itself-- it's certainly longer than a few shown here!
how long is 9000 seconds
New Super Mario Brothers is the only game where bowser actually dies
this one is Anthology II
Kencolt: Too bad it isn't as good.
So, what movie will be today?
isn't it?
He gets revived though
Donkeys.
Kandarihu: well what i know is that wow was made brilliantly, and was very enjoyable. nowadays its suckish, but wow is being copied more than it copies
Jackass
wooh!
Chocobunny: check the newsletter pahe.
just kidding it's more than an hour
JACKASS.
Chocobunny: page*
dumb bronies???
Eddmario: Well, they hate NSMB because every game is exactly the same (even though other sequels are forgiven, it seems)
but this video is only 53 minute
hello my name is Twilight,and this is jackass
Kandarihu: but anyway, have you played TOR?
XD
You know what I dont get?
A movie is the movie today?
Meanwhile: I LIKED Anthology II... especially the end. That was EPIC.
NEVER NEVER NEVER.

Vinyl Scratch has purple eyes now, RUINED FOREVER!
MaxTheSwedishBrony: Yeah, I can't wait until LOE gets out.

Scoot-Scootaloo: Ballad of the Brony rocked.
Scoot-Scootaloo I got bored around the first 10 minutes.

Trixxie is prob gonna be a nice filly next season Tho

Anyone ever have that feeling when your playing a game where your so tired your forgetting entire chunks of gameplay that you just played seconds ago?
Quick_Thinker: At first, I thought this was just a random PMV. But then I got to thinking that MAYBE, them saying "twilight" also time MAY be related to the fact that it features Twilight for a reason.

To get to the Moon, you need to pay 1000 bits, which at the current exchange rate falls in the ballpark of "a lot of money".

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The name of the main protagonist, Gru, appears to be taken from the Russian Military Intelligence agency GRU. GRU is an acronym for Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye (roughly translates to Main Intelligent Department/Directorate), the foreign military intelligence directorate of the Russian Armed Forces. It is the largest Russian intelligence agency, six times
Ouch... :(
