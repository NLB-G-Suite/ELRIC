One of the best manga's I've read
nuuuuuuuu
I don't want chibi vampires to harass me
Modesty Schmodesty
MAy I suggest we watch Hetali: Axis Powers sometime?
Teacher <3<3<3 Just gotta love her
It's like a younger more evil Cherilee
Serenity: appeal shmappeal
HETALIA?!
Nononononono.
British appeal is everything
Spectrum_Rush: why?
Spell-of-Gaming: It's not Chibi Vampires
sagas: tab fail
Spell-of-Gaming: Watch the Opening of Karin
THERE SHE IS
STRING KATANA GIRL <3
Vordox: Have you by chance read "Cheerilee's Garden"?
sagas: No
Do. Not. Start. That. Fucking. Arguement. Again.
Vordox: Very good Cheerilee fic

Thrackerzod: Sweden will be here forever :P
DOUCHE
Nittany_Discord: Damnit!
Vordox true
11,01Vordox: It's grimdark. Don't read it if you hate that.
Spike his hair and the Would be Axel :D
*that
11,01It's Cupcakes with Cheerilee and the kids.
Nittany_Discord: I've seen worse things in my life, REAL STUFF that makes you go insane...
ohai Nittany_Discord
Vordox: Talking horses?
Vordox sweden and all of its eight sheep :P jk
Nittany_Discord: I'm not phased by such fictional things
Spell-of-Gaming: Why? Link what?
Pony grimdark fanfics are just bullshit horror
Nittany_Discord: Wait..what??
Thrackerzod: Grrr :P
Nittany_Discord: you ruine it....
you idiot D:
PEACE OUT
INb4 everyone goes "HOLY CRAP"
seeya pony1553
Nittany_Discord: I wanted to read his reaction when he found out on his own
11,01sagas: Well...sorry...
Vordox: Then read it! Its good
sagas: No
If I had to pick someone to kill me, it would rather be not a pony.
Vordox: why?
/me 11,01liked Cheerilee's Garden
Spell-of-Gaming: You'd pick me, because I specialise in killing people
sagas: Cause I've read something similiar so many times I'm bored of it
Quick and painless too
um what?
But my choice would be Kyubey. 〓3
why does he keep calling her a thing?
Or better yet, nice boats. 〓3
otakon: Remember Mad Pireou?
Vordox: oh
Vordox: Fine. I think of it like SAW meets Cutie Mark Crusaders. Its kinda funny
sagas: Decter
Dexter*
Vordox: What about it?
so protect it by nearly killing her?
sagas: It made it so mainstream it's boring. :)
Mutiliation
okay this guy is a asshole
he shouldve offered to shake his hand
Vordox: Hell no! Dexter is awesome.
Whoever thought of the name "Cheerilee's Garden" took a misunderstanding of Cheerilee's cutie mark
twilight_sprinkle: Only magical things
otakon: the dress lost its protect
Vordox: ? wouldnt he dispell him?
Zawan: it seems so
oh crap
Vordox: And he doesnt kill in messed up ways. He just gives a quick knife plunge
darn those people should talk forever.... when are they fighting?
FIRE!
twilight_sprinkle: Humans are not magical
red hair=fire mage
Hi Everypony!
Pyro!
Thrackerzod: it's nearly a given
Toasty.
sagas: Watch his "friends" then :P
hi Capfluttershy
hiya Capfluttershy
Ohai Capfluttershy :)
Vordox: but doesnt he have the ability to dipsell anything?
sagas: I don't kill in messed up ways, either blow their brains out with a shotgun, or I could blow them up altogether with a rocket launcher ;0
twilight_sprinkle: No, only magic
Remember: The illustration of ponies' cutie marks are not always to be taken literally.
DAMN
NOT ded
Serenity: okay then....
ofc he's not dead
it's the goddamn second ep
Vordox: well yeah, thats what im saying, he shouldve shook his hand and too khis ability away
Vordox: or would it only give bad luck?
yes way
it would be a DAMN short series to kill the main in two eps
twilight_sprinkle: Humans = Not magic
otakon: Saves them time animating
Badass :D
Block
00,10long incantation meens deep shit
Vordox: Still not that bad...
Shouldn't it be his left hand, since traditionally the left hand is the bad one?
The Walking Church makes more sense now.
Tbh the power to negate other powers is pretty...well, overpowered/
Vordox: not SAW bad or "Cheerilee's Garden" bad
fire
twilight_sprinkle: No, he cannot grab magic cause it doesn't exist...
XD
Cheerilee's cutie mark means "happiness". Therefore, "Cheerilee's Garden" is bullshit.
ttack him while he chants
and then Hiroshima attack
*Attack
Innocentus?
once again for all to see
sagas: Bored of it :P Prefer quality
That means they're innocent, right?
Vordox: but hes dispelling it right now
SUCK IT CANADA
Yeah his power is too overpowered
ponies don't be killin one another.
twilight_sprinkle: OH really?
they only love.
what is this?
And then I jump in and slice him in half with a phaseblade
because ponies.
sagas why are you hating on Canada?
Vordox: well yeah, looks like it
Vordox: fine. It does portray Cheerilee as an interesting character though
magic is magic!
WHAT IS THIS?
Canadian_Brony: we beat you just recently
Canadian_Brony: 4-3
I have a theory when a pony loses or forgets his/her special talent, their cutie mark would disappear.
sagas: Canon works = The Truth of the characters, Fanon = Only if used correctly, and Killing is not one of them
o.o
His right hand is more powerful than his left, if you know what i mean
Vordox: I didnt say it was cannon
:|
08,01sagas: what?
sagas: I know, mbut I do not see it as fanon either
so she reset to basic huh?
asshole
could be.
sagas our country's representing athletes were defeated by yours. Big deal.
>.<
Shut up bitch, I'm killing someone here!
Vordox: I said it gave Cheerilee an interesting personality
I have no classes today~

He has 700 freaking defence, that can only protect you against 20% damage
He literally lost balance of gravity in that case.
WE DO NOT NEED YOU TO SPELL ONEESAMA

Seriously, 22 year old girl that looks like she's 10 in a bunny costume that refers to herself in the third person AS Sensei and smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.
Nittany_Discord: funny, my gf's nick was Bunny_Maid_Luna :D

Anime

A certain tall Styles

he speaks LIES
i already dig a cave :p just telling you what it was the first night
D:
You cant use science when dealing with magic
Telling you to hide in the floor.

Paper clips

Oh, it doesn't work? Then why not wear something a bit more....practical?
Meanwhile ohhh i see
CriticKitten, because
they break down doors on hard dificulty
Ah. There you go then.
Why does that lady have half her pants missing?
Also what is with that brown-haired girl with the unrealistically designed chestline?

This new zombie map is tough
Discord gender swapping
Commodore64, the cheat code is quite complicated to disable it
Honest
Discord: Genderswap rule

The elements of piracy

That should be amazing.

CaptainGanjalf: More like element of improvisation, or randomness :p

pony1553, apparently it does cause i just got it upgraded
ELZABTH
wow they dont hear the shots going off????
JackofApples: I'd say he's more like Discord, but whatever floats your boat
11,01You be clean and dead when I'm through with you!
Commodore_Phoenix if it's top 11, it's the nostalgia critic
11,02I can't believe they added Jack Sparrow to the Pirates of the Carribean ride and replaced it with the music from the movie...
ouch
NOW THIS IS IRONY!!!!
good thing there small targets
CabinboyKen2021, good point
Commodore_Phoenix A l i s t e r will kill me for this.......From the Nostalgia Critic
11,01Suddenly hands.

HAAAAAAAAAANDS!
I love this theme.

It's a weak wooden door, come on
Commodore64 they also added that mist screen with Davy Jones/Blackbeard at the beginning
Ow
Just push it
Vivix press play on Tape :)
ME THUMB JUST GOT CUT OFF!! DAMN UNDEAD PIRATES
F*** YEAH I LOVE THIS THEME
Sigh.
/me meanwhile Captain_Maid_Discord fights with Commodore64, steals his treasure
11,01Dead.
The elements of piracy. dishonesty, mutiny, PARLAY, Pirate laugh, theft and unloyalty. The 6th is a mystery.
Stupid wigs are stupid
11,02Funny how they did that and I have yet to see Eddie Murphy in the Haunted Mansion...
Woo! Commodore games
Jack enabled God mode
Commodore64 Cause no one familiarizes it with the old movie anymore
Well coming from Nostalgia Critic it's not really impressive
crunchy
O.O
THE OW HAS BEEN DOUBLED
wat a tweest
TWIST
JACK?!?!?!
interesting indeed
well that was unexpected
Fucking....amazing.
skelington jack is king of the pirates!
/me escapes with the treasure
Because no one remembers Eddie Murphy's character to put in the ride
Like a Captain
So none of them can die :D
fighting is kinda pointless now
Im back!
NOW FIGHT
And i don't know whats going on cause i lag
11,02...old movie?
HAND
11,01Don't think Haunted Mansion did well enough to warrant a change?
lawl
hit that hand
Not old
Lyra would buy that hand
ITS ALIVE! THE HANDS ALIVE!
go hand go!
11,01Unhand him!
OH YEAH!!! I'M FEELING LIKE A PIRATE NOW!
Yes she would
hand wants to murder :D
the hand lives
Commodore64 The first pirates of the carribean?
that hand reminds of the game blood
one handed 100
RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYE SOCKITS
Instead they did one better and put in the new bride and new Hitchhiking Ghosts animations
LOL
lol
11,01Captain-Dark92Enigma: But are you a maid pirate?
LAWL
Props to the special effects guys. This fight must have been a doozy with the constant switching between mortal and zombie forms
so epic
Why is ur name blue?
11,02There was no old movie, this /is/ the first movie they ever created that had to do with the Pirates of the Carribean. The movie is based on the ride.
Especially epic with the music
such a great word
PAWNCH
Arrrr
Why name blue?
Captain_Maid_Discord point taken......but i'm still a captain!
11,02But they changed the ride to reflect the movie more...which was dumb and ruined the nostalgia factor :/
Commodore64 You haven't seen it then
owned by a boat
Hammertime!
And then they stuck Jack and Barbossa in the ride
or not
Fail.
Wow
NO!
Ile de la muerta is basically a recreation of the disney ride, the cave with the gold and stuff

The best way to use the gallows is with a good drop, that way their neck snaps and they die right away

ANOTHER yay
GhostPirateLeCh-Barbossa/10
Narolas: The two that followed are a bit TOO complex, that's the problem. Especially in the third, where no one's word can be taken and there's too many twists.
Who's running this?
00,10Oh thought you ment will
what is the second movie?
skeletal monkey/10

Slept through too much /10
SWAG/20% Cooler lol
I'm not really giving it away.
3/µ
CriticKitten: Inteed.
CriticKitten: I guess it's a matter of preference then, i really like complex movies, first one is too predictable. never seen the fourth one though, glad to know he's good, i should watch it
LadyCanary: Inorite. It's so full of energy. :D
This music <3 <3
Jack SWAGrow/10
?!WHOS RUNNING THE MOVIE!?

Dasher that would be the Lt. there

Hi
Commodore64: Creeeeeeepy, sir.
Makes me want to kick a few asses.
Lt?

Captain_Maid_Discord: Not really, if one looked at the Wiki before the other movies came out
Well...I'm off to bed now. Bye everyone!
Dasher well the one with Lt. in his name
Bye turtle

so indiana jones next?
I'm gonna get some fuckin' tea/10
yus
No watch The MIst
YO HO YO HO A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME!!!
We don't really skip credits anymore
Narolas: I like complex movies too, but the second and third are structurally a lot weaker as films. The twists are rather poorly executed and are too numerous, making it tough to follow at times, and the third makes some especially STUPID errors.
No watch The Mist
11,01Pirate_Maiddox: What is that?
I love that specific track, god.
!!!!No watch The Mist
Its creepah!
11,01A feather duster sword and maid apron?
Captain_Maid_Discord: Well I figured, Duster and a apron, Cap'tn.
LOTR next/
holy crap, the more people leave, the less lag i have
Why skip the credits when they have awesome music?
ehr mehr gerd...mervers!
11,01Works.
Narolas: But I'll save those rants for their premiere nights later this week.
CriticKitten: Hm, they were less good on some levels, you're right.
Thought we neede' a symbo' or something, Cap.
SecondMate_er_Maid hey, these people worked their butts off on this movie, and all they ask is for you to look at their names going horazontally up
it's a duster and an upside-down headcrab
long time since i've seen this
@Narolas hi
Equestrian Computers: the size of an entire room.
:D
How do dat?
kirzstryfe: yup
yay Captain_Maid_Discord now you have a jolly roger of your own
CriticKitten: I dimly remember the ending of the third kind of annoyed me, but it's been a while so I don't really remember.
Dasher: Hi ?
I`m making the credits walk the plank
Narolas: Hi
Dead Man's Chest is next?
How rude kirzstryfe
there weh go
F*** YEAH for awesome music/10
Dasher: trolol
Helicopter pilot
:S u mad?
Dasher, Narolas: HI
By the way, who did the music for this movie again?
Bet Meanwhile can't say ded with a pirate accent.
FirstMate_Reikim: The third movie has so many bits that annoy me it's hard to count them all. Yet I still maintain that it's a good film, which goes to show that the good stuff was VERY good.
hans zmmer
YAR WE BE DEEEEAAAAD LADS.
yay Hans ZSimmer
CriticKitten: Pirates is indeed one of the best things to come out of Disney in recent years.
No Good Captain_Maid_Discord ?
/me hands Meanwhile a sack of dubloons
yeah kluase to
FirstMate_Reikim and then they decide to milk it out more
/me spends it on pleasurable company.
hello
11,01Pirate_Maiddox: It's fine though it's hard to tell that the white thing is an apron.
my computer froze for a second
CriticKitten: That's a better way to put it, it has failures, but it's still very enjoyable, and i really like long-term story arcs and complex background. The first one begins and ends, it doesn't feel open (which is normal, they weren't planning sequels yet)
o_o
Hmmm
Mm Mt.Dew
Not on this ship, sir.
Captain_Maid_Discord, can you pass a few rounds of chocolate rain?
Ponies47: helllo
11,01Sure
Not entirely sure where you'd find such pleasurable company either.
YES;)
Gokai ni,Ikuze! *turn key* GOKAIGER! Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger. :$

How does karaoke lead to spaghetti?
no idea
:3
XylemTube: Raiders of the Lost Ark
sweet
One is an amusing pastime involving people singing badly from animated song lyrics.
/me mines Obsidian
Microphones have wires, spaghetti is wirelike. Therefore karaoke is spaghetti.
The other is a dish involving pasta and tomato sauce.
GONDOR IS ON THE MOON?
Hi everypony.
Which movie already played tonight?
But where is the tomato sauce?
so i guess this is our next set of trillogies then?
/me sighs "everytime"

Without sauce there is no spaghetti. Your argument is invalid
Ohi ZappyTheUnicorn

I see nothing flawe about that logic
Oh, Pirates of the Carribean?
LOL
SIR YOUR LOGIC IS FUNDAMENTALLY QUESTIONABLE AND THEREFORE I WILL QUESTION IT.
XD
fools!
I have hair. Potatos do not have hair. Therefore I am not a potato.
lol
YAY!!
I am potentially a peach, however.
Onions have hair, you have hair. Therefore you are an onion.
TASTE THE RAINBOW, MUDA FUKA
And onions ask questions.
Therefore I may ask questions.
Onions do not ask questions. They just make people cry.
you have layers, onions have layers
YES I IS!!!:[

1 Yotta Dollar

Indy? cool
Which one is this?
Ryunosuke: It's his OC, forgot the name.
lost arch
00,10and yeah nit your player is streching the film to fit
first one
Reikim, my favorite is the crystal skull JK

magmablock: raiders
magmablock should be the first one
11,01I stretched it to fit output.
Excellent, that's my favorite one
it has the scenes from the pony episode
M/-0+ T x Google
mlp :3
well, unstretch it
right in the first ten minutes
I'll be Bach
where's Daring Do when you need her?
My favorite is The Crystal Skull because I'm lonely and attention seeking.
twilight is pretty tiny
But it's all stretchy, and the desktop ponies are covering up part of it.
Nitt, should probably leave it in widescreen...we don't need a tall, skinny Harrison Ford.
...
its frozen
:o
Nittany_Discord so where watching dareing do
what is happening now?
11,01Thrackerzod: Yes.
Stream was frozen tonight

Now we're ready.
Oh, Daring Do. Nice touch
appriopriate ponu
*pony
Hell yeah! Lets do this! :D

Kinda saw Daring Do coming
LadyCanary: Is it?? :o
LadyCanary: Raiders of the Lost Ark? Then yes. Otherwise no.

Nittany_Discord: Cold Front looks cool as a sprite
Nittany_Discord: Where did you get it? :'(
11,01Watch him make a tornado.

woah
11,01Custom-made.
woah:O
Awesome! :D

Now that's impressive
...
o____o
Nittany_Discord: You made it yourself? :o
Can we get a less distracting pony?
11,01Some nice person offered to make him for me.
If so, Tell Me How!
what's with this pony?
Nitt you are one lucky bastard, I hope you know that.
11,01Starting movie.
Awwww
Nittany_Discord: You are so lucky to have someone make that for you :P
11,01I know.
00,10it's ok Nittany_Discord you can say vordox made it now
FINALLY
Where are all the nice people when i want them...
Vordox made them?
11,01OK.
Yay

Dime for Darring DOO

yeah Nittany_Discord most of us know allready
Alright! 16:9 FTW
here we go!
yay
Time for some Dari... *ahem* Harris- .. no no no Indiana Jones :)
Hello everypony
Dammit he's not here, I wanted to give him a brohoof.
11,01He made all of the Bronystate OCs.
IDIADA JODES
I knew vordox made it. tbh he told he is the maker of alot of the OC sprites for the mods
namechnage complete, thats better!
Also why am I the last to know these things all the time
Suddenly, poor Vordox gets PM about how to make OC ponies..
Lil_B: you helped him right?
Great, I've once again won the honour of being last to know something -.-
Nittany_Discord lol, vordox told me "a Tornado... of all the things!"
What was it this time?
FirstMaidSabershy, Or requests.
Daring Do doesn't DO much, does she?
Spectrum_Indy no, he only teached me
Oh by the way, Pluto isn't a planet anymore.
Vordox and the OC ponies.
11,01Vordox said that my OC was the hardest to make.
i wonder why
/me facepalms
ahhhhhhhhh
:s
Wow you really are last to know everything.
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
00,10ponies dont do much in sleep mode
Humanized Daring Do is best archeologist.
reminds me of UHF
BATS! My one weakness!
Spectrum_Indy but I made Superbrony64's one (although he has no animation yet)
There's a certain quality of the wingflapping.
nyj7u
I'd be annoyed at him screaming but I'm saving that annoyance for Temple of Doom
Y U NO Giggle at the Ghostie?:O
Well I'm ready now
Curse of my entire existence.
11,01Vordox might do Maid Discord for me.
You know what, I have never seen this movie before!
Lil_B: good good
Inb4 people make Tom jokes when we get to the boulder chase scene
Eat tasted it
I didn't even understand innuendoes until long after all my friends. Led to several incredibly awkward moments that I only recently understood.
Eulshy you've been missing out
he tasted it
Jones shoulda got his wing fixed
dat Japanese text
Pfft.
Oh. New desktop pony. who dat?
Nor have I seen the second one
11,01I wonder if DP has been updated.
so, new theory, the changelings are actually the crystal ponies, but were corrupted somehow
Indy McJimmies
...HNGGGGGGGGG
Wow, I'm THAT distracted?
Great, now Meanwhile's laughing at me.
Daygon: lots of poisons are deadly only if applied directly to the bloodstream
inb4 dat theme
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand my lady parts.
But then, he's always laughing at me.
Discord Its still on 1.41
WHIP LASH!!
I was laughing at you anyway.

/me ovaries explode.
Yeah exactly.
Can you make Daring Do run with Indiana Jones at the boulder part
Barbetos: its Nittany's oc

LadyMarion thats painfull
derpy_indy I see

I have this feeling
The shrine of the SIIILVER monkey
Daring do is totally checking Nittany's oc out.
that I might as well stick my head under a rock.
=P
new toys are branded "crystal empire", so that half-negates it
Tijuana_Tovler: nice one
xD
Still, NOT GOOD ENOUGH
http://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/a.jpg MEANWHILE IN TEAM FORTRESS 2
beware of temple guards guarding 3 specific rooms
since the toys are out now
Nobody's come out alive because I've never tried
If I'm going to find out everything this late, I might as well stop trying.
nice

I have no fear of spiders, but if there were a whole bunch of spiders on my jacket, I'd take off my jacket.

I'd throw that jacket off the ground and try to shake the spiders off.

Wata noob
It's a good thing this place isin't rigged with Lava
Nittany_Discord: really thats him?
Well it's not like I needed that leg anyway.
wow
*sproing*
Kandarihu: they mightve bitten you when you move your hand to take it off
There must be a pattern here...
magmablock: Better question- How does a trap that is hundreds of years old still function properly
He is smart :$

Dont step on the diamonds

Stop the run, can't sotp the ryn
twilight_sprinkle, they don't attack aggressively, though. They spin webs and wait for bugs to fly into their webs so they can catch them, wrap them in webbing, and then drink the bug's blood. They don't just jump out and bite any giant hand that comes near them like a videogame monster.
Today is not his day
Aw damn

Lil_B yea, he had that silly mustchace
/me backs away slowly ._.
Nittany_Discord: Who made your OC on Desktop Ponies?
Good on ya, lyncast :)
Hitler was actually obssessed with occult artifacts. Fun fact.
^-^
Hitler made an unwieldly mess of his military, so he tries to make up for it with superweapons and otherworldly powers.
Mount Herod? No, it was Mount Sinai!
Turns out, most girls in the army like girls
lol
My best friend got a girlfrend yesterday...14th.. and ive only had 1.... =_(\

Kandarihu: He gave them stormtrooper training. Time travel.
DrGanjalf|Adventurer: sounds awesome
Wimbledon?
I'm sexting my ex.
Ew
RaveBrony: There there, I've never had anyone ever.

Let's not.

HAHHHAHAHAHAHA LETS NOT lyncast :|
lyncast: But then I wouldn't have anything to add to the conversation :<
Daygon about as long as a movie
RaveBrony: sorry to hear that man :/
OMG A giant stick! :O
RaiderReikim, I saw something about it on a documentary on Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Hitler managed his army about as well as he managed his soul.
ok 6_9
Oh, those post gaveme a sad :(
Kandarihu: He was a devout catholic.
these ancient civilizations have very specific rituals
I'm so legendarily bad at dealing with people that it's something of an in-joke among everyone I know that I'm socially inept.
Kandarihu: Sure you aren't thinking of Henry the 8th?
those guys are probably nazi spies
theres that music
I'll be all of your special somepony
Meanwhile, yes I'm sure.
d'aww lyncast <3
The ark was a refrigator that could survive even nuclear exploasions
lol
i get that reference
Kandarihu: Brush up on your nazi Germany, mm'k.
Hey im scootaloo
lyncast: Sorry, I'll pass. I'm still trying; got one girl I'm hoping maybe likes me :)
but I'm sure your special somepony would mind that lyncast
FunFact: Hitler was also looking for the spear that Jesus was stab by. And he succeed, if i remember
im scootaloo
Chicken
Kandarihu: could you give a source. i should have heard of it when he did that
the ark of the covenant betrayed shiva!
Xaiden|X-Play: heh :P
im a chicken
Daring is still looking at that colt flank
She's not a cool pegasister like me yet
yes you are
DrGanjalf|Adventurer: Lance of Longinus? (inb4 someone makes the appropriate Eva reference)
It's okay if it stays in the fandom
Or you could get a girlfriend.
RaiderReikim: yep
And a job.
Fou_Lou, not right now. I'll have to do some looking up on that myself for something linkable.
scootaloo is in the house
x but that requires work
yall already know what its about
So does not being shit.
Meanwhile: Himmler was in some theosophic order...got Hitler and most of the others interested too. their whole race ideology came from theosophic writings
guards that seem stressed that tailor fitted my pain
RaiderReikim: Dude, if you like her, tell her. Last year there was a Girl I liked but I never asked her out, now shes living across the country and all I can do is think of what could'e been
i structures in my brain i can spit at your dame
this 50 cent
Oh Indy~

"I'm a PIRATE, AARRGGH!"
This is consistent with Jewish tradition. Supposedly, they actually HAVE the original Ark...and only one priest is allowed to be near it, and he must constantly purify himself. Everyone's always afraid he'll have a heart attack in the chamber and they won't be able to get him out because nobody else is allowed in...anyway, he speaks to the Ark, and supposedly it's a direct line with God.
Dr_Jones: but it didnt work when i did it
