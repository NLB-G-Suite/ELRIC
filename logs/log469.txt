Nothing is wrong with furries.
Have I missed anything important?
I know a furry IRL myself, and he's a nice fellow.
When is comic con this year?
09,01as in, the fandom has a very bad name...for a reason
09,01everyone does tend to represent groups by the most batshit of their integrants
gotta go, boss is back :)
09,01eh, in all honesty, I dislike pretty much all communities, I only like you guys. That's why you don't see me around much

Saturn: I thought it was made out of coke?
The saturday ponies have been moved back to 10 am EST.

05i dont like football. handegg is watchable to some degree but hockey if anything. Esports however is a completly different thing
08,01RaveBrony: heh, well, there is sometimes that problem. i did occasionally have people requesting "happy endings", but mostly i just dealt with them by asking them to leave
08,01or just politely saying "this is not that kind of massage"
E-sports are awesome to watch.
Saturn: XD
lol
Saturn: Implying you dont want that kind of massage
tell him to just keep left clicking

05well thats it for me
11,01Sumica: Glad they defeated it.
You go get a good sleep! :3

with my chair
I remember dis episode!
takes a while to get off the ground though
MOUSCADET
like the plot line
I remember hearing somewhere they were rebooting this or making a sequel or something.
