CrazyCherry... One day has got to suck for the rest of the days to be great. Trust me... I've been getting alot of bad days, but... There has been great ones along the way.
CrazyCherry: its like Wall says. We have our bad days. They come, they rain on our parade, and they go. It's the good days afterwards that really count. They are what you should focus on and look toward. You're not gonna lose those good times just because you had a bad one

09,01funny
09,01because his recommendation was
09,01"JUST USE THE 100 HEAT TAUNT EXPLOIT THING"
XD Sounds like something he would say.
09,01and I was like "NO THAT'S FOR SCRUBS"
09,01"BUT THEY'RE BROKEN"
09,01"STILL"
D:

apparently this is happening http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/05/exclusive-preview-the-2012-special-edition-my-little-pony/1#.T8Zd2dVYtu5
LadyAvenger: herro <3 ^_^
Hey RAWRity
...She's beautiful, RAWRity ;3;
Invi: How were the Abi Klausuren?
I'm back.
Well Welcome back WallDives
I did NOT see that coming.
hello everyone
Like...wow.
Hey Cypresswolf
Ohai Cypresswolf|Work
Hey Cypresswolf|Work!
RAWRity: It's so lovely :D But I want a Photo Finish one ;_;
inb4 those things sell for hundeds of dollars on ebay.
hey Cypresswolf|Work have you heard about the derpy toy
N4X except for math they were all easy. Actually, math was easy too, but my brain derped during that. We get the results at the 06.06.
alexxm: for comic con? Yes - I want one ^_^
Invi : I'll just wish you good luck from now on and press both my thumbs :D
It's gonna go for like elleventy billion dollars.
shame i'm in england Cypresswolf|Work
alexxm: is that a one of a kind or a limited thing
N4X thank you :)
limited i think Cypresswolf|Work just for comicon
I mean, I thought the White Celestia, Trixie, and Vinyl toys were gonna be it, but then...THAT
Invi : How was the...mouthly part? :D
Fuu what do you even say for it?! And I want to take English LK
come on Ragna... kick Noel's ass...
N4X it is at the 13. or the 14.6. I still need to read all 4 books ^^
Lagna wins...
as long as the derpy plush/doll doesnt wind up like the Lyra plush.
...OH GOD WallDives
MY FREAKING EYES
cause shit like that is why we cant have nice things.
WallDives please don't remind me of that
Midnight_Tempest what thats noel i thought she used guns and wasn't like that robot chick form the first game
If Derpy does get a plush like that, I'm no longer a brony. Period.
Do those limited special comic con specials often find they're way to ebay?
WallDives that is why people think we are freaks
WallDives : Lyra Toy?!
WUT?!
N4X don't ask
alexxm: its noel in the continuum shift extend story, she was kidnapped and turned into Nu-12
N4X you don't wanna know
N4X, dont ask, giggle is your friend.
Invi : actually...
thanks Midnight_Tempest
N4X: It's a plush that's meant for you to fuck.
O_O
WHAT?!
LA LAL LA Stoooooop ;_____;
09,01you mean Mu-12
There I saved your time.
bu...wu...why?!
yeah Mu-12... i get my symbols wrong sometimes
Was this actually by HASBRO?!
N4X, hell no.
/me facehoof
09,01was it really?
N4X to make people think we're freaks no someone on 4chan i think
09,01I thought it was just a seam from the design and whatnot
14hi Nick
O_O
i thought it was just a large hand puppet
Hello people, I be back from the hell known as pre-exam 'revision'.
wb RankWinner ^^
Hey you actually called yourself Lagna :D I approve of that
09,01but eh
09,01Furries
Hello RankWinner.
Honestly, clopping to a pony? Please. That's kinda...nasty. o_o kinda gives a bad name even more to the fandom.
hai viri
>_< whats wrong with furries... im a furry...
Oh pony I need some food to chew this see ya
14how is?
09,01eh, I don't have a problem with individual furries
Midnight_Tempest: *pets you* but you seem quite nice ^_^
Nothing is wrong with furries.
Have I missed anything important?
09,01but furries in general, well, youshould know what the problem is
I know a furry IRL myself, and he's a nice fellow.
When is comic con this year?
LagnatheStreamedge: Yeah, damned freaks watching cartoons as adults.
09,01as in, the fandom has a very bad name...for a reason
I've found strangely enough that the NSFW community in the brony community are NICER than the SFW community.
A person is smart. People are idiotic, panic'y bigots.
09,01everyone does tend to represent groups by the most batshit of their integrants
yeah, i understand what you mean Lagna... but you cant say blame furries when it was obviously just a sick fan of the show...
Blerg, it all depends on who you call a 'furry'. My friend calls hismelf a fury and just because he likes anthromorphic art, it's hardly something deplorable.
Still. Suprised we didn't see that earlier. A good quarter of the fan work is... you know.
RankWinner: You mean like 99% of furries then?
gotta go, boss is back :)
09,01eh, in all honesty, I dislike pretty much all communities, I only like you guys. That's why you don't see me around much
bye Cypresswolf|Work
09,01I'm just naturally a lone wolf
Bye skye
XP
Chrysalis: the new pack for ME3 is up
<3 I like you too DCD ^____^
everyone has the wrong idea of furries... like how people have the wrong idea of bronies... dont be fucking haters because there are a few bad apples... ffs...
Gamers for good is coming up.
:D RX-78-SweetieBot!!!!
we like you DCD ^_^
Hai LadyAvenger
Midnight_Tempest: +1 on that one.
I tolerate you guys. I dont like most fandoms...
Yep xles, just like how most bronies dislik- Ooooo Paradox stream is starting
RX-78-SweetieBot i'm still settin my computer back up at my parents
hey RX-78-SweetieBot hows your day been
09,01not hatin', I got some furry friends, but let's face it, furries have bad rep
Ohai LadyAvenger ^_^ i presume you saw the Avengers right? XD
At least, the mario marathon is going to be on in june.
RankWinner: ;)
Anyone gonna watch it?
IKR
Indeed.
as have my parents
cause they opened it
08,01Chrysalis: hi
?
LagnatheStreamedge: this fight is tricky as anything, it seems
LagnatheStreamedge: Very bad rep, and not for any good reason. They've spent the past 20 years trying to rectify certain incidents in the early 90s that nopony is proud about.
If anybody cares about the indie/good game scene then here's a reminder: the Paradox press stream-thingy is starting, well, now.
08,01hey Sylandest1
whats the differance between the unlimited characters and they're normal selves
08,01LadyAvenger!
08,01<3
Bronystate herder hat for BUCK
man I'm tired
09,01eh, all fandoms are batshit, that's why I'm not a fandom person
okay...
08,01Chrysalis: diditarrivediditarrivediditarrive??!!
09,01Furries get a lot of flak because they're pretty much the largets fandom ever
"All the ponies in this fandom are CRAZY!"
08,01i just woke up a few hours ago
09,01*largest
08,01so not bad so far
LadyAvenger!
08,01i used to be a furry
so yeah, my parents now know im a brony
But then you t- no
08,01then i took an arrow to the knee
If you want the true colours of the furry fandom, read this: unclekage.livejournal.com/140420.html
but havnt said anything...
And how, LagnatheStreamedge. o3o my bf HATES bronies, but respects me and cares for me anyway.
FUCKING NINJAD
also, they opened my god damn post
Ohai Litwick
09,01again, association
08,01but srsly, i was a furry when i was about 18 - 20
lol, otherkin
And thank you chrome for nomming my protocols, again. *grunt*
08,01actually, must have been a bit longer than that
frikkin school computer :/
I guess it was just a phase.
fun
Like my weeaboo phase @_@
08,01twilight_sprinkler: i disliked where the community was heading
...
LadyAvenger, true story.
Oh... Weeaboo phases. :D
08,01twilight_sprinkler: when i started in the community, it was very very different from what it is today
yeah well its those people that ruin fandoms Lagna... but im done with this, im in a bad mood now...
RX-78-SweetieBot i think i just came a little
Never had a weeaboo phase. Because I have common sense.
08,01it was actually a bit like today's brony community
it is rediculously overpowered
/me pats Midnight_Tempest on the back
05And the shroud of darkness once again was lifted.
08,01alexxm: 25
05hi folks
:D Wreky!!!!!!
heya Wrek
awesome
Hey Wrek!
/me huggles Wreky <3
hi Wrek.
hey Wrek hows your day been
moin Wrek
09,01all fandoms are ruined. Jesus, even Phoenix Wright.
08,01in fact, i must have been abotu 16 or so when i started in the furry fandom
so it will get nerfed eventually
0520 out of 30 pages written
Hey Wrek. Mandows.
05i cant bea ssed to do more today
hay Wrek
09,01that's why you shouldn't do fandoms, just like what you like
^
also a new shotgun that works like an electric flamethrower
09,01befriend who you wish to befriend
LagnatheStreamedge: Whachu be saying about Pheonix Wright?
09,01that's pretty much how I roll
:O
05hi LadyAvenger! :D
LagnatheStreamedge can't you do both?
Preach it, LagnatheStreamedge
09,01COUGH PHOENIX WRIGHT KINK MEME COUGH
their fandom is really rabid.
otakon loves it, I havent gotten it yet
/me facehoof
Hiiii Wreky
<3
05if the stream is free i wouldnt mind to draw some
05need to relax
05or play D3
05anything
05to get rid of this shit
howdy, Wrek!
and dont get started on the GS5 madness.
GS5? O3O
You okay, Wrek?
05nope
What's GS5, WallDives
09,01I don't really consider myself a brony per se...I used to, before the fandom went to crap as well. I guess it was a reality check, nothing really lasts.
Gyakuten Saiban 5 (aka Ace Atoorney 5)
I hope that shit sorts itself out somehow, Wrek. :S
Attorny^
Ahhh.
Attorney^
howdy everypony!
Or, the "Alleged Gyuken Saiban 5"
09,01I think this place is pretty much the last bastion on what I used to like
05LagnatheStreamedge: i went the otehr way, still considered myself a brony but the others as douches
moin Magical_pablez94
Clearly WallDives is an Ace Atoony.

LadyAvenger: you realize now that you will have to post pics of said cosplay

Nope, Wrek D: I havent played the other Diablo games.
Sylandest: counting the upcoming ones... i'll have 10 tests in 11 days :O i'm pretty tired :D

Invi: eeyep. i'm gonna kill my teachers...

I once had 5 tests and two essays for 4 days...
Magical_pablez94 they planned a conspiracy

CCCP: hi
geeky-brony: Them books...
alexxm: I had to work saturday...XD I was not able to attend
Read a book.
ok TheRainbowDash
Among kid's cartoons, which ine carried on the longest (most seasons/episodes)?
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
Giger4444: probably Dora xD
Giger4444: Hmm....I think Looney Tunes?
take a look its in a book reading rainbow
And among cartoons which started in the 90s?
Giger4444: hopfully in the future fim wil be one of those
What...:D
lets hope FiM becomes like the Simpsons... IT NEVER ENDS
what :D
even if it would suck..
did you guys hear that
That's a bit flawed because the Simpsons sucks.
alexxm: I did.
Meanwhile: oh y
MeanWhile: ya*
TheRainbowDash have you heard about the derpy toy
It would end up like that.....
Meanwhile: Wait, how is it? Pretty much the best cartoon ever.
0,14What is this place filled with so many sentries?
but it would take 14 seasons before that happened
/me explodes in flurff
:)
CCCP: Yeah, Im just curious whats the average. I mean I think Samurai Jack was awesome, yet it only had 4 seasons.
alexxm: I believe so, just a little bit of it though.
:$
It's an amazing Wor-what is with the sentries?
all over Skylands
x3
thats because samurai jack knew when to end
TheRainbowDash: It used to be, during it's earlier seasons, now it's so done to death that it makes me want to stick forks in my ears.
so did avatar
Meanwhile: why in your ears?
Avatar ended great
Ears are comfy.
CCCP: Though Samurai Jack wasnt nearly as well known/popular as MLP:FiM
CCCP: Why any part of me.
prince lemon
Giger4444: ikr
They make nice shells.
Prince lemon bring back your yellow on white text :)
Meanwhile: I watched the new seasons, and it is still good quality, not as good of the older seasons, that is apparent, but at least it didn't fully die out, like the new Looney Tunes Show on Cartoon Network. Now that is a disaster beyond means.
OMFG!!! DAT LINK!!!!!!!!!!!! <#
TheRainbowDash: i like it
TheRainbowDash: No show should last as long as The Simpsons has.
It's outright bad.
how bad is it TheRainbowDash i didn't know there was a new one
I miss King of the Hill
0,14All good things must come to an end, because they keep going on, it'll suck.
Exactly.
Darkts3: I just feel that it's more like a new sitcom, which is definitely not of Looney Tunes material.

Ritz on the Putting
i don't get cartoon network Darkts3
alexxm: Its not completely horrible :P
i like cheese pizza
alexxm: Just to say that the animation and the voice actin is good, but the plot and the concept feels way too much like a new sitcom that came up out of FOX or whatever. Seems out of place among where it used to stand.

CCCP, I always say the same thing but I always find out that I know more than I give myself credit for.
what will you be up to on those days then TheRainbowDash
pikorar: i guess
Well, TheRainbowDash, after today, no more French, of course. After tomorrow, no more math, but I still have Computer Programming. In my engineering class, we're reviewing a TON.
CCCP you might want to get some last minute studying in tonight
alexxm: For the remainder of the school year, nothing much. Just fun and games, I guess. And then my promotion on the 6th of June, and then, over.
alexxm: i will
I don't cram. It's too stressful.
Hey everypony! :#

pikorar: Ah, so cool. I already finished my Math and Foreign Language Finals also, so we do nothing left, pretty much.

I didn't know you couldn't have alcohol after giving blood, guess I should have known though...
but i bet these are sold in the gaming bar in sydney blunty once reviewed. a bar with liquore solely themed around gaming
(batponies are dragon ponies O_O)
Irish_Pony: i'll talk to him when he'll be online...:D
pikorar: Nope. I have to drink fluids like a bitch... Speaking of which, I need another water.
they also have consoles built into the the walltables
so you can game and drink
GilDash: feeding a famly of vaps
LC and a few others just dont prefer hugging. I dont see whats wrong with that
Magical_pablez94: Your honest to god gonna be talking to a mod head on? You sir...*hooves over a barrel* deserve some Irish pride
i wanna go there. i wanna go to australia only so i can get drunk in that bar. playing games while getting hammered with liquor inspired by those games
You should get some iron in your diet, GilDash, makes your body produce blood much faster.

GarrettBrony, maybe I didn't get some of the cunt-discussion context. To answer your question, in my opinion there are more important qualities to look for in a partner than gender.
i like sad things XD
Holy buck this fanfic I'm reading is HILARIOUS!!!
Wait..what?
???
RainbowAsh: For example, skin. I always date girls with skin.
Biglaw: Really?
brb
well put RainbowAsh Troll wont stand a chance dealing with you
i like my girls to have skin
I like my girls to be ponie fans
Where are all the wolves?
Nest episode?
my chat derped, who pined me?
pinged*
Petrified_Discord, skin is a big plus, It's a lot of work to clean up after them otherwise.
:D
Gender isnt an important quality?....I mustve missed the big part of the convo...
GarrettBrony, why thank you. ^^
Melts wood? :O
It melts wood.
so that was the first episode i've seen, and i add'ed the buck out of paying any kind of attention to it :)

Calcos323: A porn with a plot!
TheCanterlotTimes: Are you new here? I dont think ive seen you around before O.o
TheCanterlotTimes, Luna is a fine choice. Do you prefer the Luna from the end of the pilot, or the season 2 one?
Dark_Horst: Now you do lol
hey everypony Im back from World Of Tanks and GOD was it crazy...
SirGanjalf: He's like if the Joker was annoying instead of cool, and looked like Ocelot from Metal Gear Solid 3 only not as cool as him either.

SirGanjalf: :D
05just a few notes:
051: this show contains nudity and violence. if you dont appreciate such then turn off the stream. but dont complain about it.
052: I am very dissapointed how this chat behaves when say boobs are on stream. you seem to think you can behave however you like jsut cause its on stream. dont. atleast act mature.
Wrek, about 1: You forgot gratudious amounts of sex
I don't mind the violence. I do mind the nudity, but the main reason I'm not watching this is because of continuity.
but the chat is really queit isn't it Wrek?
Wrek: maybe overlay a "TVMA" watermark
I just realized that I'm not coming back unless it's movie night. Some of the other things are like TV: they get a bit repetitive at times. Won't be back till friday for the movie night.
GarrettBrony: Well, it was on mute, +m at that time.
Where was Gondor when you needed just a few notes?
Axe?
You know, you'd think it wouldn't phase us by now. >.>
I thought the chat was paused :O
How much complaining has there been on this IRC about violence?
and it does get a bit ridiculous
Ponies47: It was on mute.
+m
you might have to restart the "experiment" where you kick/ban people for being immature.
:D :D!!
he's got the beat
dat beat
ok
oooooh thats why i was kicked back then
/me rocks out to beat
drums
lol
/me realized that he complained without meaning to.
/me dances
TheRainbowDash: I see
What a beat bro.
Dem beats
Sorry about that.
bewbs :P
let me guess... Game of Thrones is on the stream?
/me bangs on the drums
I thank you for trying to get me to like these shows, but they're not my favorites.
sorry
Ponies47: When it is on mute, only mods can talk.
DD no references unless they are on sc reen
The best armies/navys were the ones that played drums during battle
Midnight_Tempest, yes.
Lol! :D
lol
dat friendhip
OF COURSE!
Woah..:D
and then shit like that happens and my stream goes pause
bye everybody
TheRainbowDash: I see
I heard once that in German TV, violence is more taboo than sexuality. Is that true?
Best buddies.

It depends on where you go in the US. Some places are incredibly stupid (Kansas), others are much smarter (The states that border Canada)
GoT.
HEIL HITLER!

/me 11,01pews
lol I saw! D: like 22C right?
improbability missiles eh?

Even localised and mixed with two unrelated animes, Macross is still pretty much Macross.
/me is awesome
Thats actually not warm enough for me now XD
13The other day it reached 25C apparently xD
00,10nice how they used an explosion to save on animationg the transformation
ROBOPAWNCH
I haven't talked all day...
I actually want to know where they find people who dub bad anime.
TtTtTtTtTtTtTtTtTTtTtTtTtTTTtTt
yes it is
I'll be back in about 10-15 Minutes. Gonna go take a shower.
Why did you stream on april 14th? Derpy?
Seriously, I wasn't in Bronystate talking like usual.... weird..
make that 0-5 minutes :P
"I have no idea what's happening here." You say that a lot, don't you? :|
FlareChaser|Octavia, but you were on a streak, you could have beaten fluttershy's record for silence...
kidnapping a superior officer? Rewarded
13Normally people would want to go out and enjoy the nice weather and such, but I was all "nope too warm, staying indoors"
gtg bye
dat explosion
WallDives: damn.
Yes. She IS having a psychotic break of sorts.
i spend 30 minutes on the shower and i only clean 4 places
Oh, I know.
FlareChaser|Octavia, I'm sorry, that was harsh.
WallDives: :'(
13Seeya Rawra :3
Oh good Robotron
"But I didnt wanna live.." :<
dat anger management
So does the US Netflix still have Robotech? The Canadian version had the show picked off, and I'm still annoyed about it.
Wow, it's a young Dr. Claw.
Faiaiaiaiaght!
I'll get you next time GADGET
Who does he think he is-- Rainbow Dash?
Minmay
:<
Thanks narrator man
classy narrator
Robotech is on Youtube, IIRC.
I am older than Minmay by 1 year
god, my internet hates me. it /always/ lags its ass off when good stuff is being streamed
00,10it's also on hulu
Hulu sucks
why? its all the same shit, GarrettBrony
Someday, we should stream Macross Plus.
Bronystate is better than Hulu
^
00,10well yeah
25C, not bad, about the minimum amount for me XD
Compared to the original, this opening theme seems to shout "HOORAY FOR WAR"!
I think this should be obvious, GarrettBrony
can we watch deadman wonderland next?
it is
I remember way back when, when I would try to watch anime on Hulu and they would only have like 5 episodes from 5 different points in the series.
00,10yes cause saying ma kuuuuu rossssssssss over and over says much of any thing
brbrbrbrbrbr
It was dumb.
7Haibye, Arti.
The Theme song reminds me of the Spaceballs theme
This actually may be a Spaceballs spin-off
11,01Pods
Spaceballs: the Animated Series
I love that series
there is an animated spaceballs series?
Starship troopers by Robert Heinlein
00,10uhhhhhh yeah no
00,10this came out ages before spaceballs
cachi01|PS3: There was. It was HORRIBLE.
Brazil scored. USA 1:4 BRA, (88')

The Celestia Game of cat and mouse
>refresh due to freesef
Bweep Bweep Bweep

Oh yeah, Zentraedi are ginormous. Huh. This makes things rather hard to explain in Macross Plus...
00,10nah they explain it Reikim
Sumica: How so?
Sumica are you streaming
Reikim: just keep watching.

11,01This picture is guaranteed to give you a seizure.
I am 17 and I am not a Lootenit yet

hello KaitoThePony.
suddenly no medal, as he mentions the medal
owait
you're talking about the film
00,10Reikim2 it comes later on

Oh don't worry big bro. It was a mistake.
00,10trolololol

As bad a rep as Macek gets, this dub isn't all THAT bad.
Aurora and Kyu are gonna try come to England at some point, hopefully next year or the year after :3
I have McDonalds... -_-
and thats the final, USA got beat down pretty bad.
get used to it Admiral.
Oh, this scene!
00,10they had some awsome toys for this show too.
well im off c u latter everypony
Sumica: Weren't they licensed by Bandai, just like Gundam?
bye aceofspades.
00,10hasbro made them
00,03Hasbro makes all the things
dat face
What many fns don't take into account is that Macesk was NOT trying for an exact dub. At the time, you couldn't syndicate any series with less than 65 episodes-- that being the magic number for 5 eps a week and laswting 13 week, one quarter of a year.
Dat Scoot-Scootaloo
Ah, Hasbro. Just as good, because Transformers.
00,03Evening, y'all~

Eeyup.
00,10But yeah the toys were well made too. I still have my rick hunter model veratech
Nittany_Discord: All the way from headquarters!
Bitch be stealing his man.
it must be broken
00,10then again they were made of metal too
11,01Reikim2: Lol.

Toy transforming planes? Made from metal and not practice? Blasphemy.
red alert! We don't see anything! At least they're getting more genre savvy on the bridge

I could make a joke here, but I'll hold back.

runways. in space
ahem
Last ditch effort?
Plus shipping.
:P
03Yeah I know shipping
03well
03using Celga it's gonna be doub le that
All physics geeks, please disregard the fact that they're using planes in space.
03Celga is a ripoff
03I bought a CD from Amazon Japan
03that cost like $9
03ended up paying $40 to get it to me
03>_>
indeed
03but it's the only site I know that will buy Japanese stuff and ship them to wherever XD
get some action
it irks me but I will get over it
Reikim: They use planes in space because Japan.
Good lord. Robotech?
Screw physics, I have a transforming plane!
I do too
:p
my bro is so douchebag i think i will write a song about his douchebagess and then i will write a book and then a movie about the book
Maybe the wings are parsing through thruster exhaust.
03So do I
03my sister and I had this discussion the other day about why it's called root beer
03she thought it actually had beer in it XD

03<Articuno> I was wondering what the "root" weas <- it's made from sassafrass (sp) roots, that's why
bbl school
MahBoi777: lookout below!!!!
They weren't bad while they stuck to the show.
/me crashes into mah
Enter Khyron.
Max is a badass who almost upstages the protagonist. In this kind of show, his survivability rate just halved.
sasparella?
LOL @ that name
AHH
03and the 'beer' part was just because they wanted people to try drinking soda during prohibition
03same goes with ginger ale
03it's just ginger soda, really
Nah, Max was a joke by the animators.
00,10like they ever run out of missles in this show
Reikim: Actually, a MAJOR part of the show is that Rick's a leader, and a hero, but Max is a better pilot.
HEY Spectrum_Rush!
He's so much better than his commander.
lol Sumica
VF-1J, into action!
That's what she said.

Dear Princesss Celestia, Today I learned that when you have friends it's great but when it's time to leave them it's not that easy. I shall miss my classmates from middle school but there will be plenty of other ponies to be friends with. Your student, Ponies47
My Little Pony, My Little Pony, aaaah aaaah aah aaaaaaaaah

But the angry girlfriend is a civilian.
Dear Princess Celestia: TOday I learned that it's the guy with the wierd hair and the glasses that is best at giant alien slaughter. Not sure what that has to do withg friendship, but just figured you'd want to know.

meh this show was ok when i was younger
RAWRity: I hope to God that was a typo.
see, the reason i thought this was originally Japanese is because of the theme song. The pronunciation of "Lyoko"
with my chair
Sumica: Which ep are we on?
Sumica are you streaming?
I remember dis episode!
