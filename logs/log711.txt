It was good
Great! I can't wait to watch that end-of-the-world film with the name and the people.
um..........
it was okay
whuh
8.5/10
wasn't bad.. 9.5/10 :)
This movie made me cry, very hard to do. 10/10
9/10
8.5/10
i liked
11,0110/10.
I'd give it a 10/10 I see no point in where this Movie wqas bad
this film reminds me i made the right choise
7/10
10/10
ponies/10
10/10
8/10
I say
Actually, 9/10
8/10
This movie really is good
And this movie is really, really good. Honestly, tis one of my favorites.
10 / 10
I still don't see anything special in this film, it's graphical, and forcefully touching... Same as before, I give it 6/10
10/10 creepy as shit...
I thought it was good, evendo I didn't really understand everything
erm
The child-eater?
I would explain it, but that would be a paragraph
child eater was creepy
T_T
Calmate senor
spanish movies/10
and now we switch from an 8/10 movie to a 8/10 pony episode to a 3/10 movie
/me grabs an extuinghuiser
I thought that those were some of the most epic movie moments
This was a good movie, ahead of its time
2012 is 8/10 atleast thats my opinion
But I can understand why it wouldn't appeal to some people.
Also, I had to sleep on a couch after I watched this with my Ex, she didn't like my "meh" reaction.
it was a bit farfetcht but eh, it wasn't bad
2012, isnt that bad in my opinion. atleast it has slight fact behind it. but then again. opinions.
brb
I enjoyed the movie.
but opinions, opinions. That's all there is.
2012 isnt bad
its just boring

08,01android > ios
spot on Saturn
once jailbroken it brings them to the level of android :P
^
boxxybabee ftw!!
a jailbreak is necessary for live wallpapers on iOS
iphones are usually faster than android
08,01twilight_sprinkle: define faster
Why cant I see anything?!
like literally
WHY CANT I SEE ANYTHING?!
08,01as in smoothness of interface, or responsiveness of operation?
I'm waiting for iOS 6 :I
iOS 6 jailbreak, I mean
http://images.4chan.org/a/src/1351376317018.png kill everything
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i disagree on the second, actually
Saturn: Which version of android? Which phone? (hope I'm not being too nosy) && (I'm waiting for it to load)
08,01SafariMonkey: ICS on a Desire Z
STREAM
MUUUUUSICC!
'Tavi :3
STREAAAAAAAAAM
this music conflicts with my techno
wooo classical~
GigabitHarmonie~
Saturn: Nice, I have ICS too
:)
in terms of the display
Oh, is the podcast on now?
08,01i cannot survive without a keyboard on my phone
This is pre-show
08,01so i <3 my Desire Z
k
:) that music is wonderlul
wasnt the retina display only in name and wasnt technially a retina display?
I've actually formed a proof that YOLO > capre diem
Android easily wins when iPhone isn't jailbroken
