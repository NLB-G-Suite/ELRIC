Kandarihu: At least you only have two weeks of fasting left.
That game needs more pony!
A DODO
no way
the pails are back?

VenHur: Same here. Everyone is doing it for that reason

/me kills himself
cowvarkian: you can stand it or just sit there, but how can you enjoy it XD
YES
I think all the MLP theme songs are the same starting off. It's just after the My LIttle Pony part it changes
ValtheJean y r u so awesome?

cuddly_kittehs: because I can? I dunno
To quote AVGN............i rather had a bufallo take a diarrhea dump in my ear, i rather eat the rotten asshole of a roadkilled skunk and down it with beer, IT FUCKING SUCKS, IT SUCKING FUCKS, IT FUKING FUCKS, IT SUCKING SUCKS................and i don't like it.

cuddly_kittehs: (\

Maybe they can't speak and they talk Garfield style
Is it bad that I can't breathe from laughter?
cuddly_kittehs: Because like 10 people made it
I'm uhh.. gonna go jump into a volcano.
NOOOOOO!!! THIS IS TOO MUUUUUCH!!
OH GOD IT'S EVEN WORSE!
lolbrb
IT BURNS!
cuddly_kittehs: production budget = under 100 dollars
Talking WITHOUT MOVING THEIR MOUTHS
And only 3 of them were animators
G 3.6 :D
God the animation is so bad, their mouths dont even move.
WHERE ARE THE SOUND EFFECTS?
oh noes it raining
who did the voice acting
the worst possible thing
This is making me want to play on a motorway...
oh no.
Ok honestly, is there no animation at all?
Oh no rainbow dash go sort it out
cuddly_kittehs: and some anti bronies say that G4 has crap animation.......they haven't seen this SHIT
BronyinJapan: horrible animation, no sound effects AND it's insipid...
look at it! LOOK AT IT! FEEL IT! THE PAIN
I can't watch it

cowvarkian: but still, people who work on NO buget, pepople who simple make flash animations make nice peacies
trololol thats a terrible storyline
Viral: Newborn Cuties :D
Metronome: We are watching Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman

cuddly_kittehs: meh

...Phew... [sighs a breath of fresh air]
*childrens
lol
Pinkie dressed as Haruko
cowvarkin I was going to say thing hahha.
dat pinkie <3
Rainbow Dash is Ryu
2,14 newsflash, FiM is for kids too. And 20 or so years from now people will view it the same way
i want these games :O must have them
Parappa the Rappa <3
derpy is winning
dat hadouken
Fluttershy is Dan Hibiki
Snow: Ah. I always assume male, it's not far off (86%)
ValtheJean: true
otakon: RD is Phoenix Wright?
ValtheJean: supposedly
totally wish to find the game
ValtheJean: yeah but the difference is FiM isn't utter drivel that's so simple it falls flat
EAT YOUR PEA, PINKIEPIE!
Serenity: no Ryu
Snow: My apologies.
WHY CAN'T THIS GAME BE REAL, DAMN IT?! [whyuno face]
2,14 except they aren't utterly drivel, you're just viewing it through tinted glasses
SafariMonkey: appologies accepted
2,14 and 20 years from now FiM will be seen the same way
yes i got a perfect!!!
11,023.5 is like using Windows ME and saying people don't appreciate it because it's Windows.
ValtheJean: wait... so the no mouth movement, telepathic ponies weren't utter drivel?
So true^
3.5 is bad.
2,14 that's not 3.5
the end
Oh god
2,14 3.5 is twinkle wish adventure
2,14 you're thinking of 3.6
Love this video.
ValtheJean: oh, I'm fine with 3.5
lol i saw almost all of season 1 in one night
11,02LOVE AND TOLERATE
NewSuperBronyU|AFK: bugger off
ValtheJean: eh maybe but it's so saccharine sweet it's just too damn much. There is no character, no conflict no ENGAGEMENT. G4 has those things at least even if it IS meant for kids primarily. It's like how jiggling keys entertain a baby and reading a good book.
PeachStreak does approve slightly
11,02cowvarkian: :<
second day being brony and ive already learned alot...mabye too much
NewSuperBronyU|AFK: sorry
all past generations are bad. except for g1 that one is okay
Lunacorn: yeah welcome, stay away from R34
11,02;~; okies, I'll leave
NewSuperBronyU|AFK: ._.
filly cherilee
NewSuperBronyU|AFK: NO DON'T!
2,14 otakon: you saying that means you haven't actually WATCHED any of it, or refused to actually pay attention
...Windows ME was the very first Windows I used...
...Sue me.
Lunacorn: dont listen to otakon! r34 is awesome!
otakon: yeah i just wish i could forget about the cloppers and whatnot
Lunacorn: beware - not all the links posted are sane one >_>
t?
ValtheJean: I have watched it, remember we streamed that damn Twinkle Star movie like three times now. It had no conflict and it was insipid.
Lunacorn: My condolances.
cachi01: ikr
ValtheJean: now G1 on the other hand was more enjoyable
2,14 then the latter applies
im ok with g1, i dont like it i dont hate it
yeah when i became brony i was like ohai! and all the sudden omg derpy clopping r34 colgate toothpaste celestia bananas
2,14 your refusal to see things doesn't bother me, there's just not much else to talk about

Yes, I firgured that.
inb4 film
Caramell is a Swedish group. Again, a one hit wonder. the "dance" is from a japanese four-frame loop someone made-- whih went viral. Caramell was so taken by the silly short that the official music video incorporated the dance.
so?
Alrighty

I remeber when i used to think that Cabrone was another word for sir.

how many people are working on it?
Also, i haven't played Penumbra(made by the same people), which isn't that scary.
XylemTube: lol hola cabron xD
Dat CGI
Stormman3100 not really, you said "It isn't scary "and not "I don't find it scary" or something similar
Mandragora?
I know for sure there is at least 2 people
What in the blue fuck is that

[12:00:16] <+Chuki_dori> and then turn the screw till it heats up
[12:00:54] <+Chuki_dori> The more spikes and distortion the better
[12:01:04] <+Chuki_dori> as this should heat it up more
And compared to Amnesia.

Mindblown ^^

Giving a shit is for people without shades.

hmmm
they need snaipers
Badass captin is badass
Snow: They need stealth fighters :3
they need the girl and her eternal reward
Lil_B: they are lugers arent they?
looks like it
double tap
BladedWings I can't say for sure, but the generall shapoe seems similar

They need a precision orbital strike.

Last night, someone outright spoiled two events at the end of the movie.
hey sketch_Toku_Brony
Kandarihu: did he get kicked/banned?

11,01Not going to like this next part.

MadSurge, not sure

I KNEW IT
Now let me check if that damn tf2 works....
he's getting shot
I hate needles too...
cuddly_kittehs: Is the problem that you can't connect to any servers?
and doesnt reset mah game
cuddly_kittehs: "hl2.exe blah blah blah..."?
This movie is full of former SCIENCE
Oh. goddammit
LOLOL http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=eab_1325755693
If it ain't workin', science goo?
kammerjunk: no, i have connected and nearly got into 18 games
kammerjunk EVERY SINGLE TIME, it reset to the main menu
Oh. I can't connect to any Source game. It's just stuck on "Connecting to server..."
Cheese it's been a month since the last time I was here... What's new?
Even my own.

I think it's a Ginger-root
Hopefully they fix the zombie spawn rate/ server balance
11,01Sounded like he said "What you wish."
cuddly_kittehs: oh, i have that too.
....oh no
this and crashes:|
one does not simply leave this place
How old is that commercial lol
That's a lie.
Oh sure. Ignore your caring daughter and defer authority to your war-criminal husband.
LIES
Magic = sqrt(friendship)
SHIT
It's about to hurt for you allright
ded
See what happens when you screw with magic?
dont know
old
SirGanjalf: hopefully they fix it. in the meanwhile, you can go play Left for dead 2 for free for the weekend
why can't i log in at "Bogy" anymore? :o
SirGanjalf: :) steam is being nice
Bogy: Because there is a Bogy.
yeah, think i'll do that
Bogy1:*
Kammerjunk: so if there is negative Magic, friendship gets very complex?
Kammerjunk, yes but why xD
well this is not ending well
Dead
:(
walk like a badass
ded
11,01No fear.
To be clear, the doctor euthanized the P.O.W. so that he wouldn't be tortured again.
cuddly_kittehs: what's you steam nick, maybe we can play together later?
Yea, kill the only doctor within miles
Did the chat server just derp out for anyone else?
Jon Marston fall
Dat ThePillowship|Store
it's the kids fault for being a tool...
:'(
..........
And now his wife has no way to deliver the baby properly....NICE JOB IDIOT.
diddutz: Very complex. It's because fr = ma(sq)
SirGanjalf: cuddly_kittehs
The chat derped on me too
Only doctor within miles and wife is in labor
>wife is dying
lol his face in the water is priceless haha
kill the docter when ya need him...
well
>kills only doctor around
Ikr =_=
GENIUS
CriticKitten: eh, how hard could it be? She'lls just poop the baby out, right?
Kandarihu: that's how franquist women worked. Clean the house, shit babies, love your man forever.
sí! mi capitan
chat derped
dumb captain
copy that cuddly_kittehs
--all that blood
SirGanjalf: :D yay more steam people. one day i may have the same amout of friends as skype: 47
Dumb captin

SirGanjalf: Its why i never turn on my skype to "online" >_
Wife is dead
cuddly_kitteh: make that 2 more steam people
the baby is burned? :O
;_;
ur wife is ded
Domo: if I was a woman I'd be scared shitless :(
So he kills the only real competent medical person, JUST as his baby is being born. Idjit.
Snow: yay!
MadSurge: lol o~o
bronies :D
SCREW THE WOMAN I GOT MY BABBI
42
how come this was the A-movie?
He just wants Mini Me.
Snow what?= I heard Steam?
anyone stoked for AC3?
the answer to life, the universe, and everything; 42
Because it's highly critically acclaimed.
^
Lil_B: People getting my steam name :P
PONY: 'cuz this movie is *brilliant*
ohey PONY long time no see
He's like dr Evil, but... evil.
O hai
I hope this movie lasts longer
PONY: cause its an awesome movie
thats why
Dr. insano is best.....EHHHH?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcgd62wBzM1r2jf9ro1_500.jpg
This movie deserves an award or something
Creepy ass monsters, and the scariest thing in the movie is this guy
DerpyMuffins: I think it did received plenty.
cuddly_kittehs Dr. Insano :) somebody likes Spoony
RAWRity: you just did not make a yo momma joke
I know Pan is good, but for some reason I find it's status as A-movie highly questionable... Partly because it's Spanish.
Lil_B: /)
RAWRity: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
cuddly_kittehs (\
cachi01: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEEEIII
PONY: deliberatedly.
Language is no barrier to a movie's quality. We've had foreign A-movies here before.
^
PONY: that is incredibly stupid
isnt guillermo del toro mexican?
RAWRity, was not the main reason.
Nah, i think he's spanish
PONY: I think it's because this had a US release. I think forgein movie with no US release is an auto B I think
he knows
§
YE GUILLERMO DEL TORO IS MEXICAN =D
DUN DUN DUUUUN
AND HE IS FROM MY CITY =D
okay, J_E_Smith71 makes sense.
I wonder if he's still planing to make that Lovecraft-based movie...
I'd watch that.
inb4 gets shot, again, its a guess
crap, L4D2 is taking FOREVER to dowload. Saints row was at like, 2% by now!
oh, my bad then
Or maybe I wouldn't. I'd probably go mad watching it.
SirGanjalf I think it was scrapped,because Universal didn't have a lot of financial success lately
lol
Or my screen is doing that glitch where i dont see the progress bar
and this is where i came in last night ^_^
The international releases as a barrier, makes a lot of sense.
TAKA ME WID YOU!
'oh I can't take you' 5 seconds later *takes with her*
Flyboy: You are gud jump?
Flyboy: that yogscast reffrence :D

SirGanjalf: and this was an average Franquist unfortunately :(
Screw your rope.
pro
NICE
I'm off, you take care Ayejay.
finally
Yeah Mercedes~! <33
apparently guillermo del toro is making a frankenstein movie
PWNED
badass
SirGanjalf : I haven't read the story that the movie's based on yet,but PG-13 for a Lovecraft-movie sounds like a disaster just waiting to happen.
go for the kill bitch!
Daaayum
bye Jmo
and guess who is going to be frankenstein
Bye, Jmo. :)
Bye Jmo!

§b
SirGanjalf: that's true

Wouldn't it be lol if the Faun killed them off? :P
the russians are coming! the russians are coming!
No ponies were harmed in the making of this film.
^^
Sniping pro
that guy lied
every horse is a pony by law.
Iwa: I'm actually waiting for the faun to become involved in the battle
why would it change it's mind
FOR NARNIA!!!
SATAN RETURNS

BoulderDash: wrong movie :P

sup, horned, foreign dude?
Satyr or minutaor?
minotaur*
Its a faun
Oh.
He's roman
finally my internet got fix apparently
creepy voice is a go
love that shot
Well, that explains who the baby was in the wall painting.
Technically, satyrs are half goats, fauns are half deers.
It's the true King of Spain (11th Century)
Oh, so -that's- why it's called Pan's Labyrinth.
joker style
11,01Ow.
lol
Why so serious?
ouchouchouch
^^
why do i laugh?
xD
IEUW NO
let's put a smile on that face
This guy can double for the Joker
/me doesnt look
how did he survive the back and near-heart-Stab?
okay..
now he just needs to get the other side done to match
11,01He's half Jack Nicholson now.
why not ask the paramedic?
Hire this guy for the next Batman film.
He's a demi-Joker, now
Wait, Is That CG?
it's not that funny. but luckily we're only half joker... ahh joking
I would have expected him to cut the other side to make it symmetrical
guy has some balls.
ping me when its over
Its Scarface
Eli: Do ho ho.
Snow: Will do.
Now we know who the Joker really is
11,01Good.
hi Eli :)
hi Lil_B
You know, he should see a doctor about this... except that he KILLED THE ONLY ONE!

Besides, this is a much better way than falling into a bunch of chemicals.

11,01It's today.
Snow: Oh, I thought you meant the entire film.
And to be honest, that wasn't even all that graphic.
he better only speak with the right side of his mauth now... like Silvester Stallone
Didn't that guy get shot about 3 times? :P
:O
shoot
nope
5
Lil_B: :|
It seems longer, the first time you see it. I think because it's so unexpectedly graphic.
we're leaving together!
Iaw this guy has 4 wounds ^^
KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY

cachi01: because she seemed to have been partially driven by her personal desire to get away from the world, and she disreegareded what might happen to her mother when doing that mandrake stuff
dem portals
@snow, discord much?XD
Blood of the innocent...BAM
Is It can bees hugs tiem now plz?
So for the record, Mercedes and the baby lived.
it's obvious what's going to happen
Science time
twilight_sprinkle: um, the mandrake stuff was to KEEP HER MOTHER ALIVE
twilight_sprinkle: themandrake was going to save her mother...
what film is this?
inb4 nether portal
Pans labyrint
RAWRity: yeah, if you choose to believe a random creepy faun thing yo dont know
Dat song. ;_;
14C:
Blood of the innocent
she ain't innocent
I have a theory.
She made Sacrifice
magic
Tennis Ball from BFGI: ........O_O........are.....you....SERIOUS......DX
MadSurge: well, not my blood then, ive seen some shit i regret
She innocent again
twilight_sprinkle: then by that logic we can say that he was lying about the blood of an innocent.
She was resonsible for atleast 2 deaths
princess of the underworld? :S
She the man now, dog.
DerpyMuffins: and sacrifice
RAWRity: We can see that, but She couldnt have known
See?
wat
loyalty
And then she woke up.
twilight_sprinkle: so your entire argument for why she shouldn't meet the Faun's rules is that the Faun could be a liar.
^
Faun was good all along
So the blood of the innocent thing was a lie too. :P
dat hell
She died and gone to heaven
sacrfice yourselve, obtain royalty
the underworld is pretty happy
That when 2012 happens all the bronies and pegasisters on earth get saved by celestia and transported to equestria as ponies. Would that be awesome?
CriticKitten, no.
ikt
So how is this the underworld?
ikr*
At Least She Die Happy :):):)
2nd best pony: OH COME ON
would it?
RAWRity: and youre argument is that thats impossible? seems very much possible to me, i wouldt trust it, and most people wouldnt
turtlegod98: make it happen
Kandarihu: Clearly was, they just SAID it was. :P
Turtlegod, if that happens will we roommates? :D
turtlegod98: all you must do is beleive my freind, its what i try and do
Domo perhaps it's some genric spainish word for afterlife
JT: The underworld is commonly seen as bad, but in several mythologies the underworld shares pure bliss with rooms off ultimate despair :3
turtlegod98, for science!
Well I guess she's reached the end of her life's PAN!
Kammerjunk: no, she went out with a smile and the world got a greedy general :(
turtlegod98: Probably not. I haven't gone a day without modern technology for the last 10 years.
turtlegod98: I dunno. I like having fingers.
'for many centuries' ?
what about after that?
twilight_sprinkle: no, my argument is that if we assume the Faun is lying about the mandrake, he could also be lying about needing to be the blood of the innocent.
i'll try do it for my friendchips
turtlegod98: in my mind, i know it cant be true. in my heart, i beleive it is
:'(
Honestly, although freaky as hell, this was a very good movie.
1+ flyboy
9.5/10
It was good
Great! I can't wait to watch that end-of-the-world film with the name and the people.
Kandarihu: Her innocence was irrelevant. They said it was her willingness to give her own blood rather than another's.
um..........
it was okay
whuh
Total Recall Ending /10
8.5/10
wasn't bad.. 9.5/10 :)
That creepy pedo guy with the feast was creepy
RAWRity: yes,, he couldve been? we found out affter she died, but he couldve easily been lying
This movie made me cry, very hard to do. 10/10
9/10
8.5/10
i liked
11,0110/10.
Superb. Once seen, never forgotten.
I'd give it a 10/10 I see no point in where this Movie wqas bad
this film reminds me i made the right choise
7/10
10/10
ponies/10
10/10
8/10
I say
yay spanish movie :)
Actually, 9/10
8/10
This movie really is good
And this movie is really, really good. Honestly, tis one of my favorites.
10 / 10
I didn't watch half the film, so I can't give it a proper rating/10
I still don't see anything special in this film, it's graphical, and forcefully touching... Same as before, I give it 6/10
so what was the point of that creepy child-eating guy, just for some bonus trippiness or what?
that captain was a badass
RAWRity: he just didn't specify what qualified as "blood of the innocent"
10/10 creepy as shit...
that i would rather die to save a friend.
what PONY said
I thought it was good, evendo I didn't really understand everything
erm
The child-eater?
twilight_sprinkle: how is it you continually make arguments that are so full of holes and double-think that even Big Brother would balk?
Thank you twilight_sprinkle, finally somepony agrees.
I would explain it, but that would be a paragraph
child eater was creepy
T_T
2,14 calm yourself RAWRity
LochNessCheez: IKR?
RAWRity: and how is it that you can never come up with a counter-argument
Calmate senor
2,14 everyone can have an opinion, even if it's poor. Let's not start flame wars
spanish movies/10
and now we switch from an 8/10 movie to a 8/10 pony episode to a 3/10 movie
i just the major turn off for me was a critic say this was as good as LotR's, which made me sick. because its the wronest sentance commited to the printed word :[
I can understand your rating, PONY, I just don't agree. It's honestly a very good movie. Tells its story well.
twilight_sprinkle: kinda, but probably to make you realize that even a monster like that was childplay next to the psycho captain
/me grabs an extuinghuiser
/me throws water to flame wars
im ready for the flame war
I thought that those were some of the most epic movie moments
Well, 2012 was rated what, 5.5/10? I dunno, it was rated too high.
This was a good movie, ahead of its time
RAWRity: you always run ot of things to say and just answer "well youre dumb and your opinion is dumb, im so smart"
2012 is 8/10 atleast thats my opinion
But I can understand why it wouldn't appeal to some people.
Also, I had to sleep on a couch after I watched this with my Ex, she didn't like my "meh" reaction.
11,01Going to +m if a flame war starts.
it was a bit farfetcht but eh, it wasn't bad
2012, isnt that bad in my opinion. atleast it has slight fact behind it. but then again. opinions.
brb
I enjoyed the movie.
but opinions, opinions. That's all there is.
2012 isnt bad
Squallken: don't take critics seriously, it'sa all a matter of opinions
its just boring
twilight_sprinkle: because when I, or anyone else presents a deconstruction of your argument, you immediately deny it as us just being assholes.
it's still art.
REALLY BORING
2,14 just for that behavior, I'm skipping the credits :P no pretty music for you
Here comes the +m
Nittany_Discord: +m?
^
hi everypony
MadSurge: hm well thats iterestingactually
NOOO
yay do it
Squallken: Depends on what they meant. It's not really a fantasy movie in the same vein as LOTR so I'd really not bother comparing them against each other.
I remember seeing a review for 2012 that had to point out: Now imagine if this was directed by Michael Bay
11,01Snow: it's a chat channel mode.
ValtheJean I'll make my own pretty music !
hai BroPony|MEDIC
lol I saw your desktop for a sec

All hiding from the child eater
RAWRity: or after that, for that matter
Suddenly ponies.

CriticKitten: so many children were scarred by this "fantasy" movie
bridle gossip?
ok, I'm out during this epü, see you in 2012 :D

ah ok
RAWRity: please provide the quote of me calling you an asshole, i beg of you

very possible
zombies should be canon
2,14 stopit
2,14 stop it now
2,14 drop it or I'm banning
+m - Huddle in regulars
ValtheJean: talk to the to people who are fighting <_<
Squallken: But I'd say it's a movie that is as good at what it was trying to do as LOTR did at what it was trying to do. They both have different roles and different stories, and they both do it very well.
Oh.
Here comes the ban
evil
Who's getting ban?
ValtheJean Did I see the rainbow dash colour scheme on your desktop?

Shes an evil enchantress she does evil dances, when you look into her eyes she puts you in trances. and what will she do, she will cook up an evil brew and gobble you up in a big tasty stew. soooo, WATCH OUT!
cuddly_kittehs, Maybe we can play together sometimes when it's done? xD
Oh my gosh, LIFE IS THERE!

yep, but didn't that got B too ?
Note; "supernaturals" is a real book

Still, one thing I wonder: Is the wobbly horn supposed to inhibit her magic?
twilight_sprinkle: I only know one "horn" joke, but that's not very appropriate.

With the CMC they didn't use their normal stock art. Instead they used a fan art image of them with their cutie marks.

Zecora is secretly Michael Bay

Yup.
Buffer for A film.
00,10Results are bufffffffffer

Buffer has 100% on IMDB
The only way to win is not to play at all.
11,01And 10/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.
00,10we had that one recently
2,14 jeez
00,10Welcome back
Oh, there we go.
2,14 okay fuck my router
00,10master of suspence
I'd rather not do that to your router Caramel.
2,14 hardy har har
:)
2,14 oh dear god...
2,14 I don't even..
Is it just me, or does Caramel and Val have extremely similar colours?
13that doesn't sound good
2,14 B movie is #70...Reactor...with Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus
11,01They are the same person.
13oh god...

0,14eenope
2,14 well fuck my life
11,01I think you dropped before you got A out.
2,14 A movie was a personal favorite of mine
2,14 #28, Polydunami with 12 Angry Men
12 Angry Men.
Why 12?
if vals like it is Totally_Rigged
Why not 13?
13jury movie
2,14 because it's a Jury
I do like the choice of B film.
Baker's dozen!
08,01woah woah woah
I know, I know!
2,14 and in a Jury, you have 12 people
08,01you're doing the lottery without me?
Totally_Rigged: You had that kick coming.
08,01you cads!
was worth it
Totally.
2,14 Pony Ep #1 goes to number 87
And then everypony thought Gigabit didn't know what 12 Angry Men was.
2,14 Otakon with Sisterhooves Social
Sisterhooves Social!
and then otakon wins
Socialist Sisterhooves!
2,14 and our final pony ep goes to:
0,14RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGED
08,01aw, he's not here so i can't congratkick him
2,14 #45, Rookeealding with Baby Cakes
otakon's name somehow manages to go mentioned without someone getting kicked.
0,14man, I can't wait for B movie next wekk
0,14*week
2,14 that's all folks, thanks for playing
2,14 I can -_-
0,14WE'RE ALL IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT
11,01Sounds like a Sci-Fi Channel movie.
0,14It is
11,01Figures.
08,01it's funny, i was gonna vote for Mega Shark this week
Where was Gondor when Meanwhiles wasn't here
Otakon win, see Totally rigged
LOL, an Asylum film for B? HELLS YES. That's gonna rock.
oooh. 12 Angry Men is good. I'm sure the chat will hate it though, and spend a good hour arguing legal issues without actually knowing what they're talking about.
08,01but i decided to vote for Tron instead
/me 14pets the silence.
0,14oh god, the delicious tears that will ensue
where was Gondor when teh Discovery Channel will invade B movie
also, I want to go hug otakon for choosing Sisterhooves Social
i want to see dat b movie .D
Hm. Civ3 music? Never did play the third one. Played the second one, though.
WHAT ARE THE MOVIES AAAAHHH
I love the Mega Shark movies
/me 08,01likes 12 Angry Men
*:D
Booo jury movies are boring
oAo
12 Angry Men is good.
>.>
...
I found waldo
08,01d3rb_: i voted Tron Legacy for A and Tron for B
sounds like gay porn though
lul Mega shark vs Giant octopus sounds promising
Dammit, missed voting <.<
GigabitHarmonie is right, why not 13?
2,14 an incredibly good movie followed by....wut....
:D awesome
lol Eli
A "so bad it's good" movie.
It's an Aslyum film.
so 12 angry men and.... what?
*Asylum.
12 Angry Men: a film that takes place entirely in a single room, over the course of a few hours, and has a total of 12 speaking roles.
I can't wait for B film next week.
did I miss 2012
MadSurge: This isn't.
Sundaysmile: Not yet.
CriticKitten: all my hope is gone then...
Caramel: and incredibly ridiculous movie
twilight_sprinkle: I have seen it, it is so cool
It's up next
ah
WHAT IS THE B FILM SFDG FDLJVLNDJ
Sundaysmile: 2012 in 10 minutes.
08,012012 Angry Men
Gaston: mega shark vs giant octopus
nope, its after intermission c:
nope Sundaysmile
08,01i'd watch it.
Caramel: a catastrophic disaster
For those who don't know, Asylum are the guys who made Titanic 2.
thank you
DerpyMuffins knows what's up!
ta muchly everypony
ok bye lol
RAWRity: normaly i would say that sounds lame, but i've seen carnage and it was great
you missed creepy childeater pedo guy though Sundaysmile
welp
Slen: the mega shark one?
wat
So it's guaranteed to be a total shitfest
Hello GigabitHarmonie :)
that shark movie sounded promising
I'll keep voting schindler's list
im watching next week
brb
MadSurge: :)
hi
i think i'll lurk in the chat, I can't sit through 2012 again x_x
twilight_sprinkle: yes
cya
Slen: heh ok
Dat SuperBrony64.
Freaky Pinkie o_o
Domo: you can turn off the stream though
08,01LochNessCheez: honestly, that's unfair
Naaaaauuuuuuughty Pinkie
otakon won? do-over
08,01not all creepy childeaters are pedophiles.
twilight_sprinkle: the shark jumps like really high out of the water and eats a jet liner.
08,01some just like eating children
The Smooz !
I'm amazed there's not a critic who specifically reviews SyFy special films. You could make a career outta that shit. >_>
08,01and what's wrong with that?
2,14 god...just stop
I just know that the minute I choose a troll choice for a or b that i'll get picked just cause karma
Yup, can't have that.
I need to start sending in entries
Smooze is best villain.
Its quiet today :/
Slen: brilliant :D
2,14 so many implied inuendos and...just...just stop
you could see it in his pictures
08,01i mean, how many of us can honestly say that at one point we've not wanted to literally make babycakes?
String_Shredder: the nutritional kind
2,14 ENOUGH
13done now
Sorry to be so idle, I'm always busy IRL these days, hoping it will settle down soon.
What's a baby cake? o.o
2,14 ENOUGH with this chat, move ON
MOVING ALONG~
OK
Caramel's Jimmies have been rustled.
WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE ON, IT HURTS

Bye, HeavyWeaPony_Guy. :)
Bye HeavyWeaPony_Guy
Kammerjunk even the cloud backed files ?
bye HeavyWeaPony_Guy
Because this election is more important than ponies.
Good morning everyone :)
it had a couple of segments I already saw but the others....just wow
I disagree Kandarihu
GigabitHarmonie: You're still taking the emails for this week's question, right?
cause those save your configurations and stuff
ohai AdamTheDuck
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Goddammit. Well, it's not like I'll be doing anything important on Steam any time soon.
This music reminds me of Spore.
Hi, AdamTheDuck. :)
whenever otakon wins something in the lottery for now on, an /akick is necessary
Kandarihu: and you can't watch an episode while also being informed about the election?
08,01tonight, i'm in a bit of an odd mood
Heya AdamTheDuck :)
08,01you know the song "I Throw It On The Ground"?
indeed
I vote in favor of that.
what about it?
08,01i keep singing that to the words "I push it to the stack"
Agreed
AJIsAwesome: Yes! So you better email them in!
/me 08,01is writing a compiler tonight
GigabitHarmonie: OKay. Thanks. :)
Is 2012 up on now?
RAWRity, I plan to break my fast the day after.

J_E_Smith: okay. :)

J_E_Smith: but this was a movie?
2012?
11,01It's "This Year."
2.5 hours of of dumb, but fun
is dis 2012?
13space
:o

13the final frontier
yes
Michael: Yeap 2012
I love dat movie.
So yeah,2012.I'm definitely not gonna sit through the whole thing. I'm not very interested in the movie, and aso the original Fright Night is on tonight...
11,01This is a dumb but fun movie.
you inverted the roles :(
if only this had better music
Nittany_Discord, This year is going to be perfect
*also
13i see val is watching in full screen :3
2012 again? did't we watch it before?
is this "Core"?
Some Guy next Yeah "Let's watch a Movie about last year, to recap what happened"
00,10they lied it's only 2010
the kind of year of which I've dreamed since I was small
Wait did I miss pans laberyth?
11,012012 has sucked so far TBH.
13soulrider95: no but you should vote for The Core also
common guys who sended me that commission :o??
I haven't seen this one yet. So I will watch it fully.
2,14 believe it or not, it's not fullscreen
unfortunately yes RustyMeat
Naga
The neutrinos are mutating
awww :(
2,14 the damn thing is just my entire monitor's length
movie's stating to show it's age
:P
13minival is just that tiny?
The movie may be dumb or awesome on your point of view but hey at least we get some fun chat discussion
So Indians discovered the end of the world?
at least it's not "The core"
:3
Caramel: dis is one of my all time favs :L3
00,10FORESHADOWING!
:3
ti-Ta-Nic
PONY, the Brony Movie Night is always rerun on Saturdays for Europeans
your hilariois
13hey The Core is dumber and more fun than 2012 :3
11,01Yes Sumica.
*hilarious
TUNAK TUNAK TUNAK DADADA
:say wub you <3
wub you <3
**youre
STRANGE ISINT IT
^_^
Shizuka: but the black guy dies
11,01The Core and 2012 are about the same in my opinion.
Shizuka: sorry, I won't give up until The Transformers: The Movie is the A choice
actually, i think the core made more sense at times than 2012
damnit now I'll never find out :/
I don't remember this part of the movie.
SPOILER ALERT: DISASTERS COMING UP
less plotholes filled with bullshit
00,10nonsence Shizuka this movie has so many more silly locations
Kandarihu, I am aware... i have been coming to this site for a year and I only come here Saturdays, for I am an euroBrony
Shizuka: WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE BLACK GUY
00,10and president obama
13yeah but in The Core the Colosseum gets blown up by lightning
meh
and angela merkel
11,01Oh, yeah Shizuka.
PONY, my apologies, then.
A copper mine? Pft screw that, I mine orichalcum these days, I'm Lvl 80 bish. :| *self-5 for GW2 ref*
Shizuka: in 2012 neutrinos mutate
My headphones keep clicking.
2012 6_9
13evidently that short dialogue isn't plot relevant >>
Kandarihu, you forgot meh :'(
The neutrinos are mutating! They're heating up the earth!
NOT THE NEUTRINOS
"The neutrinos are causing a physical reaction"
we're dooomed
13that IS impossible, but if you can accept that premise, the rest of the movie follows
14I've got nothing to do this weekend. ouo
I know virtually nothing about pphysics but I suspect that's bullshit.
'mutated'
/me 13hugs sumica~
11,01Microwaves can heat rock?
I can forgive janky science if the rest of the movie makes up for it. I enjoyed Sunshine, even if the "restart the sun with a nuclear bomb" plot is ridiculous.
Microwaves are magical
Shizuka: they had an antonov flying a rollercoaster pattern
hey
yay for science
whats this movie i know it
planes of that size do not move like that
2013
13Dark_Horst: but The Core has a Sailor Moon reference
7Peasant
ithas?
never noticed
13yup
1.7 million dollars. Wow, that's a lot of money. Except not really that much for a senator or high-level staff.
13it also has harvey dent
13check and mate :3
lol
....it has Harvey Dent?
Wow, there will be a diana Krall concert at budapest in november. I might even go if I have the money.
11,01He plays the snooty scientist, right?
14whut
11,01In The Core.
Yeah sorry, I think it does win, then.
13no no he's the main
This Sentor looks like an ass
wait, we were talking about what movie was better or which one made less sense?
i forgot
11,01Oh OK.
whats this movie called agian?
11,01Need to watch that again.
2012, Maid_RainBow
Maid_RainBow: 2012
14I have a song stuck in my head. :B
13the black guy did one of the dogs in Up
I'm hungry, let's go get mcdonalds! :)
Nittany_Discord:Some microwaves are approximately at the resonant frequency of water, so they interact most with water. If this is the same but for commom rock crystals, the same could happen.
It's a trap!
Also there are hydrous minerals.
Shizuka: I thought the other guy was the main character.
11,01Neutrinos can only morph into other neutrinos.
True LordDerpington
13aaron eckhart and hilary swank are the leads for The Core, or at least they survive to the end
revolution!
Hey look, it's Detriot
NO G8
Oh, wait, it's not?
no pony G8?
2010.
Nittany_Discord neutrinos are as similar as 3s, they are identical
13NO D8, ONLY D20
Wtf is G8?
generation 8 xD
08,01i remember when The Core came out
thats accurate toi the last G8 meeting I remember
What song?
d20 is best d. d10 is close second.
08,01me and my brother wanted to go to the cinema; he wanted to see The Core, i wanted to see Hercules
08,01we couldn't agree, so we just went separately
I think you made the right choice.
08,01fuckin' splitter.
Hercules had so many facts wrong
13also he said it wrong, it should be misters president
DerpyMuffins, an annual conference of the 8 most economically powerful nations in the world.
13or messrs president, not sure how the plural of mister works
Obama looks stressed
oh, the woman is Germany? I'm ok with it, she's prettier than our reall Concellor xD
G8 sucks.
it's the end of the world, as we know it ~
Lil_B: True that
00,10this damn project is good for us
11,01I'd make a political joke here, but I can't.
00,10we can have dam tours with dam pictures
Chinese Democracy
I'm hacing the feeling this movie is called 2012
13sumica has big dam plans :3
spoil spoil
13he's reading twilight
It's in monies.
one billion monies
"Reading is for eggheads"
yay for €
in euros? :O
If G8 were gen 8, extrapolation of gens 1-4 on a polynomial would lead to the conclusion that it would probably be AWESOME!

Hope that Celestia comes saving us XD
Shizu: Because it drives up the conspiracy theorist's rating of the film. Quick, tie it to 9/11 too, the ratings will clearly be so high! >_>
try to save miself
Shizuka: Is it a big, 10-gallon hat?

Dat cenorship
11,01Sonny: You know who that is?
I say there's aliens on venus
The mayan makin' the calendar was like "I don't want to spend my life like this." then he stopped making the calendar on the date of December 21st 2012, once they saw the calendar guy not making the calendar, the other mayans said "Why did you stop?" He said, "Because... um... The world ends on December 21st 2012." Then the other mayans said "Oh okay." The end.
Nittany_Discord: No I just found it funny, sombody you know?
11,01It's an OC pony named Sandy.
Slen: It doesn't stop at that date. :P
Nittany_Discord: is it yours? It looks cute :)
they say they found another Calendar

Dec 21 just marks some manner of cataclysm according to them.

our calendar ends on the 31st of december
twilight_sprinkle, :P
My mother goes outside to work on the lawn all the time. She never gets bit by bugs. When I go outside to work on the lawn, the bugs eat me for breakfast lunch and dinner.
twilight_sprinkle: I think he meant split. As in, split the brat in 2. :P
I think 2012 will happen.
caus there is always a date for the end of the world, anyone know the next end of the world date ? (after 12 december 2012)
AJIsAwesome: dayum
It's already been happening for almost 11 months
only less than 2 monnths until end of the world :D
what a coincidence

AJIsAwesome: i know you know :P
hmm
i dont know whjy that happened
sounds good Nittany_Discord
I know you know I know. :3

CriticKitten: true, they shoulnt expect the audience to break down over it,although a little compassion is normal altho i didnt feel it towards him either in this case, idk why
Accidentally packed World files to World.rar
Why hello Shizuka
Slen, the file is deleted. Everything just ceases to exist. I'm talking about an eruption in the game.

Sonny: Planet is corrupted. Cannot recover contents.

twilight_sprinkle: Because you barely knew him. He's only been onscreen once prior to that, IIRC. It's possible but not easy to feel sorry for a guy who you haven't seen.
hey guys i took a screenshot of the first youtube comment in the world want to see?
Kandarihu: You think the file is deleted, but what is happening in this movie happens when you delete the world.

This movie is full of symbolism isnt it?
Oh bummin 'el
DO YOU SEE???
artist: I said that I made a sketch for your commission but it's not finished yet :p
Nittany_Discord yes, but they imply that what ever happened is so ginourmus, that even on sea the wave is big
CriticKitten: symbolism, where?
How is he still alive?
artist: I had do do another one first
Sonny: show me sketchy?
Honestly
11,01Possibly Lil_B.
then they make another aby
Discord is causing all this.
artist: I'll Live-stream it later you'll see it then ^^
Uh, that aircraft carrier, I think it was a bit oversized.
Black President killed by the John F. Kennedy? talk about symbolism
or not
Is it ironic the it's USS John F Kennedy that destroys the white house?
Sonny: are you going to be streaming here?
artist: It's gonna be very detailed

BYe, RustyMeat. :)

As far as symbolism goes, this film is about as deep as a plate :P
artist: Well, It's gonna be as detailed as my other work but even better since I'm more experienced now ^^
RustyMeat get your 7 asses outta here!
Sometimes a ship is just a ship.

/me gives PoniesMaid47 some dust
Sonny: link it to me in private chat then silly!
The wave could have crushed the White House alone and achieved equal effect. The writer chose for a carrier, a US Naval carrier specifically, to do it instead. Let's not pretend that's not intentional. :p

Wait! people died in this movie? :O
Titanic! Just with a plane instead
thanks SirGanjalf
CriticKitten its not Air Force one
The President was never on it
weeeeeeeee
JT: No, they're just sleeping.... underwater....
We can't start the engine until we close that gate. This might be a design flaw.
smrtgy1: With the fishies
DerpyMuffins: This movie violates all semblance of logic and you're going to poke at THAT little inconsistency? :P
smrtgy1, oh few I was worried about them
Well, this movie certainly gets me in the mood for having nightmares. :P
CriticKitten yes
Kencolt: Or it might be that starting the engine with the gate open is more dangerous
this movie is surprisingly boring
of course it has tob everest
Oh it has to be everest doesn't it
to be*
So why don't you have a goddamn override again?
29k ft?! It's almost 30k ft!
Fucking everest, ALWAYS in the way
EEVERSTI: jinx
what happened to the yetis
Oh i get it, everyone in the world is on the plane, and if they take off in time, they all survive.
If only people could live on mount everest... They would be safe.
everest is best iceberg
I'm on the top of the world!!!
alexxm|colt: They evolved into SeaYetis
shoo bee doo

/me damnit
SafariMonkey you have the awnser! they just need to signal S.O.S

Night Alchemist
Derpy_Hooves: Moar drama
Slen: Nonsense, Heavy Rain is a much better movie than this
Tab fail BroPony|MEDIC
Slen: and video game
Slen: and concept
lets all go on a suicide mission...
DerpyMuffins: :P
smrtgy1: talkin about the drowning scene.
Whats the tab fail count up to Derpy_Hooves?
BroPony|MEDIC: :I
Derpy_Hooves: Srry
Waait for iiit.
If I had a bit everytime someone tab failed me
Is pan's labyrint worth watching? Now you've all seen it?
I'd have a ticket for the Ark
*labyrinth
SafariMonkey: Yes, definitely
Really Noah?
SafariMonkey: Yes. It's worth checking out.
^
SafariMonkey: I found it kind of... odd.
Wait a minute. In this movie, does the world end by flooding? Because i thought the original theory is that the world blows up!
You're an attention hog arent you
Thanks Iwa Kothenion and Kencolt
/me bakes Derpy_Hooves and DerpyMuffins an apology muffin
I'll check it out
thats a mighty big boat
That giraffe must be WIERDED THE HECK OUT right now.
Can't believe I missed both movie nights
BroPony|MEDIC: You just baked DerpyMuffin's brother D:
SafariMonkey: youre not the only one :(
B:|TCH THIS NEEDS AN HAPPY ENDING
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
JUST LIKE HALO
Wait for iiiiit
SirGanjalf: Talk about an inception style movie o_o
Trixieburgfan1337: I feel for you. :(
flutterchu: The world ended and all the trolls died
Happy enough?
Wait for it....
And after that, everything that's left is destroyed by gamma-ray burst.
s0 wait, the world is ending and a meteor just HAPPENS to be hitting the earth also?
What meteor?
when it rains it bucking pours huh?
Trixieburgfan1337: No meteor.
Wait for iiit.......
Serenity do you realkly think that nobody would at least save one of the 4chan servers?
She is giving it all shes got captin
Trixieburgfan1337: What metor?
...wait for it...
SafariMonkey: thats what i want to know
Lil_B: The /b/tards probably made it
Here it comes: They all die. Watch.
ICEBERG AHEAD!
Knowing them
Titanic much?
Just one refernce after another
i hope they had ducttape, cuz their boat is hella leaking
Titanic up to 11
awwwwwww yeah
meh
:p
Titanic 2: Electric Boogaloo
THEY SPEAR ACROSS THE ICEBERG?
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
BUT WHAT ABOUT BOOMER????
EEVERSTI: BOOMER
EEVERSTI: WILL LIVE
Oh, i was wrong. I guess movies always do have happy endings after all.
Dark92Enigma, mount everest
man they didnt even make the first service before damaging the arc
BOOMER WILL LI-nope, he drowned, sorry.
PONY: My mistake :(
So the moral is it's better to risk dying than to leave without some people?
The gas money it takes to fuel one of these "Arks"
hmmm
SirGanjalf: Whose boomer?
daww he died
Shaddup Noah...
if anyone seriously makes a cruiseship and names is the Titanic 2 I'll just lay down...
Oh stop
We know he's alive
that acting :/
>_>
yup
THEY SPEARED THE EVEREST? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?*
So much ddrama
JT: You better start doing that now.
he's like van damme
NO
WE're :'( acting
CriticKitten: Ping!
JT: It's worse enough there's a Titanic 2 movie...
never dies
nope
Why does he never stay dead!
Iwa ur kidding right?
The main character never dies
Iwa: seriously?
He caused it..... but HE DID IT!
Time for a victory screech.
JT: I am not kidding
Michael: why?
Dark92Enigma but... but... THEY DID IT HE SURVIVED
I'd like you all to invite me to my party of fucks I give
Derpy_Hooves: Most of the time
:)
Tab fail again
Asian Man approves
The main char died in Hitman
just kidding :p
BroPony|MEDIC: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dIfAFI-1rlE/THOSMBsKqGI/AAAAAAAAGio/B8KuTryWnRk/s1600/0.jpg (it's a NC related meme)
JT: You do know some guy's trying to make a Titanic 2, right?
VICTORY SCREEEECH!
Michael: he doesn't know martial arts?
Dark92Enigma: on movies, as i heard, van damme never died on a movie
...
Well, so much for me having nightmares tonight. ;)
DerpyMuffins: Tell that to most of the characters in Pan's Labyrinth.
I've googled it...
SirGanjalf: I see
Lil_B, althought they caused it... and some probably died... THEY STILL DID IT
SafariMonkey: Yes, seriously...It's...yeah...
it got released in 2010...
Derpy_Hooves: nice name
AJIsAwesome: i thought someone already did that supid fanfic
Lil_B: ......yes....they did
cachi01: No, i mean the shpi.
JT '09
/me in the YEAR 0001!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*ship
I actually going to download it, I'm pretty curious about it...
They went BACK IN TIME
^
I think Derpy_Hooves is getting tired of tab fails:D
AJIsAwesome: oooh.....it would be funny if the same thing happens.....funny.......but horrible.....
So now, everyone is living inside a ship? Cool.
Michael: Oh, i get it
What's with all the Wisconsin references?
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/23/0AUrTOo-pUGVR-NS6LU1pQ2.jpg
Worst than that there's two Titanic animated movies that absolutely terrible.
Iwa: I just saw the IMDb -- if you can get 1 star on IMDb you're doing something very wrong
shipping on a ship? yes please
Sexy times!
*-_-
Ew
Titanic animated movies?
For children?
Before 12/21 comes, i'll start living inside a boat. What a great idea!
Cock block inb4
SafariMonkey: Or focussing on doing something wrong :)
The FX is nice in this film but I'd wouldn't give it an ammy
Month 1, Year 1, A.A. (After Anihilation)
AJIsAwesome: PARTEH TIME?
come herw
One is terrible, the other is a complete abomination.
Slen: After anal
Cock block
sexy times for all
Serenity no.
SHIPCEPTION
Video chat bitch
Iwa: Yeah I was going to say or very right if you want low ratings
what about 1 till 5?
OK brb
Hat. Of course.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: FiM Six-Pack of Books Spotted by Sibsy
Needs more paper
Dat hat
<3
haaaaaaaatttttt
so whos raising the russian kids now tehy're dads dead
nope.,.. nobody is sparkling
Dead bodies everywhere.
They built a gift shop instead of more rooms?
gotta. have. the. soundtrack.
Hmm
Oh, cool - my niece and nephew have some books similar to that (Thomas the Tank Engine and Disney Princess themed, but hey).
Good job merika
heli?
And stupidly enough, AFRICA survives this whole thing like nothing happened
how?
how is there a heli???
good job world
what's going on???
Derpymuffins, we need them monnies
They'll be like "dafuq happened wherever else"
it doesn't make sence!?
EEVERSTI really? I love Soundtracks too, but I don't think this Movie has great music :/
Sonny: The world flooded. Now everyone's living inside a ship.
Finland didn't even notice, we were probably too drunk.
Africa is ignored throughout the movie and now is just being mentioned?
I see what looks like helipads on the top of the arks
Sonny: it doesnt occur to you that these enormous ships might ahve helipads?
I bless the rains down in Aaaafricaaaaaa.
hi everypony:)
whole world destroyed...still thanking god...
go africa!
Dark_Horst: Lies!
14idgi D:
spud: HAI
hai spud
Lil_B i think this ending soundtrack is awesome
Dat pun
me neither haha
sooo... does that mean there are potentionally more Africans now than any other erm... nationality?
whos streaming?
BOOOOM
Lil_B: Pretty much
everyone died
If it never flooded, then I think you're going to have to explain why you deserve to live there. The Africans will want to know. >_>
da end btcheeaaasss
spud: Caramel.
Lil_B: Yes.
We'll find a new fertile land and we'll call it....This Land
So everybody becomes Africans now?
WTFBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
it does Lil_b it does
everyone must always die at the end
Africa doesn't even know something happebned
cachi01: perfect
CriticKitten: Second Apartheid? Oh god
Aaaaaand meteor.
lol
Why did they need money in the first place?
and then they all died... THE END
and then they had lots and lots of babies. The End.
just go boom already
Planet Africa FTW
Buffer
only africa will stand
10/ mutherflutting 10
EEVERSTI it's not bad, but ... I don't know, very dull just
massive orgy
WHAT THE FU- BOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
ALIEN ATTACK
I bet you Luna is laughing her flank off
i think the reasoning behind this is that africa was a main-componant of pangaea
2013/10

CriticKitten, i second that
10/12
3/10
those ships are already build by now
10/0
Gordon/10
6/10, best visuals I've ever seen, weak Story
I found it quite believable.
so what movie was that?
divide by zero
2/10
they should have streamed this the same week as 21/12
Sasha/10
the world ends
20/12
Too bad Madagascar didn't survive - it's a good shelter in case of pandemy.
if you can ignore the blazing rape of logic, its actually not such a bad movie
My take on this film: The effects as always, are great, and there is some story to keep it balanced (sorta), and the soundtrack is also envolving, but if you were looking forward to this for ,mythology or survivelance issues alone, this ISN'T YOUR MOVIE. We all know WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE THIS DECEMBER 21st! THIS IS F***ING HOLLYWOOD HAVING FUN WITH A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE, THAT'S ALL 5/10
Well...it was an okay movie. But i don't like movies about things that i don't think will happen.
8/10
:3 I went a bit heavy on the whiskey during this movie - I feel loopy 6_9
2012/10
Dat text wall
still better love story than twilight
I mean, this has happened before, it says so in the bible
Only think that's true about this film is yellowstone

Night, Michael
Goodnight Michael

Cya Michael
Lag.
Night Micheal
His next movie is going to be about Shakespeare or something.
Kandarihu: Going out with a bang is an understatement. His career exploded before our eyes. What a piece of insulting garbage.
No mention of what happen to the UK at all throughout the movie
Hey did everyone die?
goodnight Michael
Night, Michael. :)
*Michael
Cya Michael
Bye Michael :)

EEVERSTI, take it easy
Night EEVERSTI

Serenity yeah, most of thermic springs with Gysiers have the opportunity to blow up like this, there is also a big one in middle Europe, but less active
Eli:
Night, EEVERSTI. :)
god's rage/10
bye EEVERSTI
thx twilight_sprinkle ;)
Lil_B: That won't be for a few decades yet
np
cachi01 looks awesome but whats the thing in the middle?
But yellowstone is due for 21/12/12
Discord's Revenge/10
Wierdly enough
Lil_B: There's a supervolcano in middle europe? Dammit, i live there!
ukrainian, not russian!/10
SirGanjalf: There's been one for millions of years
JT: books apparently
SirGanjalf me too, I'm less than 500KM away from there
books? :S about what?XD
14so bored today......DX
JT: sibsy found them on a store
SYMBOLISM
oh
JT: so hasbro didnt even knew about this
Closest Volcano to me is Icelands
DO YOU SEE???
Dark92Enigma: I think you understated it.
^
the next big thing that's really gonna happen are big earthquakes in Japan, Island and India
thats a bit scary for hasbro XD
Lil_B: So where exactly is that volcano?
so basically fanfic sold in stores... great.
mfw when peopl seriously review a b movie disaster flick
i cant what for 12/21/2012 for this whole "end of the world" hype to be over
well they printed out past sins, Lunanonymous
I didn't notice any symbolisim in this movie, but whatever. :P
Symbolism/10
At least when Yellowstone blows I know I'll be killed immediately and not suffer in the aftermath
Squallken: Just get a few coats and some central heating money, because it's gonna be freezing
twilight_sprinkle, but it looked like the movie was trying to be taken serriously
twilight_sprinkle: YFW this was a major motion picture that cost hundreds of millions to make, and is only a B because it's such an abysmal piece of shit.
SirGanjalf Germany, erm, I think the mountain range called Eifel
d3rb: maybe, but it was obvious it was bad hours ago
Also, the ash cloud might affect the Internet
true
Which if it does, I'll blow the rest of the world up myself
CriticKitten: it was obviously bad hours ago,no need to keep repeating it
No, I think it can't be repeated enough.
It was bad at the title card :P
What was the A movie like? I missed it.
Well atm the netherlands already need dike's to keep the water out... aldo I don't want to drown...
long credits are long
CriticKitten: of course.
It's not just bad, it's downright insulting and callous. >_>
2012 doesnt predict the end of the world
we need the core for next week, that is a great b movie
Well as always, some said it was shit and some said it was awesome HurricaAkumin
Dark92Enigma: Thank god. <_<
d3rb: The Core and Armegeddan
about those supervulcanos: the earth crust is more or less divided into 13 bigger pieces. everywhere these pieces push into each other, there is hte possibility of earthquakes and vulcanos. it also forms mountains. so basically if you live on a mountain have fun
Lil_B: I see
Serenity, hell yes
0,14wait, 2012 was his last movie?
twilight_sprinkle: No, i mean the plot. I already checked the website for the name, but i wanna know the plot.
0,14NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
^
Eli: what if you live under ground lvl?
SaxyPretender: yeeeeeeees
Saxy, just do what normal people do.
SaxyPretender: Hahaa
On the 20th of Dec. I'm the one who will be wearing one of those cardbord "THE END IS NEAR!" Sign.
SaxyPretender: YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
Go watch SyFy's movies instead.
Jk.
JT: :| do you really think taht would matter in an earthquake?
will the world end before S3 is finished?
TBH - i don't think i could watch this movie if it wasn't the chat
They're ALL about the world ending, they're ALL campy as shit, and at least they can be laughed at.
December 20th i'll be robbing all the stores!
We should watch Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
Slen: I might wear a sign saying "I'm looking forward to the 22nd"
d3rb: Nothing will happen
Eli, Idk XD
Slen: We will, next week
0,14but I liked Godzilla!
0,14And Independence Day!
Yay.
JT: if anything, you would be more fucked
/me eats SaxyPretender
i give 2012 a 8/10 becasse it wasnt boring the first time i watched it, although it annoys me how they didnt bother to do research on the plane even, the writers had a boner ofor everything russian apparently
:(
BroPony|MEDIC, well as long as it holds off till s3 is done im fine
SaxyPretender: Godzilla should TOTALLY be streamed here
I'm sure one of them will be A
I give it 5.4/10
Needs more Russian/10
original Godzilla that is?
0,14It should
Serenity oh god -.- SO MUCH FISH

Yay ponies! Now i'm sure that i won't be having any nightmares.
ICE CREAM HOUSEEE
JT: You live in Zeeland or something then? :)
It's a bad film, visuals don't excuse it. I don't wanna give it a number, but were it being graded, it gets an F and needs to retake movie-making class. :p
teleporting would be so awesome :D
Wahts the stream resolution? just outta curiosity

cachi01: That kinda explains it
1+ dark92engime
*cue Terminator 2 theme*
twilight is almost the opposite of me. even though i love to learn something new, she is reading too much
I have it. I believe Twi does too.

Epic Pony War
/me judgement daaaayy has ariiiiived
No fate but what you make T_T
I think this may be a paradox...
i would soooo bitchslap her for interrupting me all the time
Chao: Valid assumption, but the asperger syndrome is too broad a spectrum to be certain off :S
Chao: twilight is more ocd. checking and making list is ocd stuff.
Dark92Enigma: OOC? you mean OCD?
twoiloight pls. i huv a bery inpoltan mesug fram de fiuchure
da da daaammmm
Eli: but, but shes twilight, you cant bitchslap her! ;_;
I know Asperger's is a broad spectrum.
Don't try to diagnose cartoon ponies.
hello!
twilight_sprinkle: on second thought.......i think i mixed the capitols
cahi01: twoiloight pls
They need to play this episode twice for ultimate timeloop
Pinkie, you so mean
And I know she's definitely got OCD, but she shows many traits of Asperger's too.
Hi, ChaosIsAwonderfulThi.
fluttershy wooo!
She acted OCD, so nothing wrong until now
LAWL
twilight_sprinkle: i couldn't hit a girl for my life, but still. she's annoying
:D
rofl

Dat Rarijack.
D'aww
twilight_sprinkle: but it's the end of the EP what disappoints me
This is basically Twilight's reaction to the world ending on 12/21/12 theory. No really, think about it! We just watched a movie about a disaster!
Dark92Enigma: yay continuity
aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH anypony else wanna panic with me? no? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
lol
that's not a dam ! Thats a ship !
actually such a crack would have killed the damm
Dark92Enigma: why?

Nice oni_link...but won't the text be a bit small?
Pinie Pie has mastered the art of silence - bouncing around without a sound

aaaand she created an alternate universe
AGAIN
Colonel voice "You cant go changing the past like that! Youll create a TIME PARADOX!" *MGS Game Over music* :D
And Twilight could have used that spell for something more important
I wonder why Pinkie doesn't have time stopping spells stashed all over Ponyville.
see if I was her, I woulda gone back in time and given myself winning lotto tickets for the next 10 years.
Dat scrunch
she sounds too desperate for the situation. only downpoint in this episode

once jailbroken it brings them to the level of android :P
^
boxxybabee ftw!!
a jailbreak is necessary for live wallpapers on iOS
iphones are usually faster than android
IM BLIND!!
also the iphone screen is perfect
08,01twilight_sprinkle: define faster
Why cant I see anything?!
like literally
For a smart phone, Iphones arent very smart
WHY CANT I SEE ANYTHING?!

Hello there my fine sir MadSurge.

GigabitHarmonie: Have you played wave 666 yet?
Allegr0 is missing out
This is awesome
Hi GigabitHarmonie. Interestingly, you and allegr0 when you announced the Pixel Perfect Pony show's name were the first thing I ever saw on stream. So you have a special place in my heart. :)
^
/me 08,01steals GigabitHarmonie
Give him back!
14Okay so guys, I have a question.
Darnit I've been missing thw show! D:

Whoa! Now that's pretty neat~
How is it? Like, do you need tickets for it like in Mann Up?
/me hits Ponies47 with a spoon "Bad Ponies47, missing the Pixel Pefect Pony Show is bad." :|
AdamTheDuck: You were playing TF2 with me! :[
/me Smacks AdamTheDuck across the face with a frying pan
14Would vampires be prone to AIDS? o_O
Ponies47, and I left the stream on and killed zombie robots to classical music!

DerpyMuffins: the word riptide what does it mean?
GigabitHarmonie: Just wanted you to know that.

Hi, Mutterguy. :)

Good to know SafariMonkey! :)

oni_link: well retina display is literally perfect ppi-wise, because its the most ppi the human eye can see
:)
Hello Mutterguy
oni_link: hence the retina name
Derpy_Hooves: thx :)
08,01twilight_sprinkle: actually, it's not

Ponies47: did you see my new avatar on Steam? :3
Hahahahahaha, I do know my composers.
oni_link: Ha! Awesome ;3;
Too bad Allegr0 is missing out
DerpyMuffins: Ah. I'm used to Pidgin, so I didn't know about multiple presses. :P
This does sound like its being played back faster than usual
It sounds about 20% faster
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351376425683.jpg

And what was prevous piece? Before Requiem?

Brenna_Hooves: You're new to me I think. Hi.

^
^^
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351353636974.png
DerpyMuffins: Ah, but there's no D in her name. So that makes it easier for you. :3

08,01Brenna_Hooves: i have
Hello everyone.

Hi, Meanwhile. :)
hi Meanwhile :)
Hello Meanwhile
hi Meanwhile
Hai Meanwhile
why isnt the stream stoping
I see stream is oddly classy.
Hi Meanwhile
and suddenly ahwthibtee
brb
back
Brenna_Hooves: and what were you doing for those 11 seconds
Meanwhile! \:3/
aww, only one day left for L4D2, its super cheap. I wanna get it but not sure if I should. I always buy games compulsively when theyre on sale
I know Hetalia
flutterchu: I was answering my door for it to only be my sister who got locked out of the house
I already bought one oni_link
PASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I like the anime, just not the fandom.
No.
Just, no
oh....
:I
Chat sure is riveting this hour.
Spell-of-Gaming: I've heard of the show, but not of the fandom. Care to explain why you do not like the fandom?
DerpyMuffins: Ahhh, Im gonna give in and get it later today >.< since its like 5 USD
oni_link: Enough friends to do co-op with, like shooters, and is it cheaper than an average dinner at a restaurant? If yes: Buy :)
Truly I haven't been quite this entertained since that one time I tripped in the kitchen and smacked my face on a hanging pot.
Zombies
Spell-of-Gaming: does hetallia really have that horrible of a fandom?
0,14yes
and tons of them
0,14yes it does
How so?
Plus you can 10 people fighting them
Iwa: Ill get it later today XD Im giving in
Dont ask
Instead of 5
I have no idea what it's like, so I wouldn't know.
*6
I think I know AJIsAwesome. LOTS OF DIRTY THINGS
DerpyMuffins: Why not?
as much as i love classical, this seems a bit too whimsical for my taste
oni_link: Good for you :3
Hai Lyra`
But Im not in that part of the fandom
SaxyPretender|GG: which is worse, naruto or hetallia in terms of fandom then?
oh, hai DerpyMuffins
Brenna_Hooves pls more hentai = cooler fandom
GigabitHarmonie: "No results found for "preludium una fuga"" I'll try more general search. (similar terms)
That sound so awesome
:(
oni_link: You might also give Rock of Ages a play, since it's free this weekend (assuming you use steam for that sale)
/me glomps GigabitHarmonie
Ehh...
:'(
And since my sister is as school till 4...I can play
I GOT 99 SOULS BUT A WITCH AINT ONE OF THEM
Why so much glonping
(get it?)
glomping
Brenna_Hooves: hehe, soul eater
Prelude and Fugue SafariMonkey!
ah thanks for that Iwa, Ill give it a go after I install L4D2
Bronysith yea
Brenna_Hooves: soul eater?
Brenna_Hooves: Nice reference. :D
cachi01 YES

http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=Screenshot2012-10-27at23418PM_zpse724b0ec.png
unsurprising
Meanwhile: I can understand that.
Never got around to watching Soul Eater
DerpyMuffins: It's an interesting show. Try giving it a watch sometimes.
GigabitHarmonie: I found it just before you sent that under prelude and fugue n.2. Thnks. :D
*sometime
it has a cat with boobs
:I
the manga for soul eater is supposed to be much better
JUST SPEAKING THE TRUTH!
flutterchu: interesting..
Brenna_Hooves: thats every anime ever
0,14also, I'm so rusty at Guilty Gear ;___;
Brenna_Hooves: You mean a cat that can turn into a WITCH with boobs. :D
yes
oh yea I forgot
cachi01: Balloon: yeah i know
NO SHE IS NOT A WITCH... SHE IS A CAT WITH BOOBS
I mean seeing a cat with breasts would be..... interesting. :S
Ok Cats with boobs just ruined Soul Eater for me
the weierd part is that it's flagged as spam
hahaha
Is chat awful tonight or is it just me
NOPE.AVI
Just you Meanwhile
MEANWHILE
oh and yes it is Meanwhile
technically cats do have breasts
DerpyMuffins: Nah, the cat can turn into a witch.
I REMEMBER YOU
That's nice. I don't remember you.
twilight_sprinkle: I know, talking about human breasts.
AJIsAwesome: >.<
twilight_sprinkle cats have teats not breast
I WAS THAT ALL CAPS_PONY
Conflicting opinions. Greeeaaaat. So chat may or may not be awful.
DerpyMuffins: ill believe you without asking the differences
i mean *CAPS_PONY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBAMoD9Rih4&feature=g-vrec
I LEIK CAPS
Implying that only one person has ever joined this room and spoken in all caps.
YOU MEAN ROYAL CANTERLOCK VOICE
No video links during stream, please. :)
0,14no non-image links, flutterchu
No vid links flutterchu
but the stream.........
There is a stream, yes.
flutterchu: shush
Refresh if you have to
i suppose it was alright
a bit too festive of a waltz for my taste

Ruby: oh okay then

DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUN
Oooh!
Chopins Nocturne Op 9 no 2
is my favorite
Always the fifth...always the fifth...<.<
DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUN
I't rather like to hear the moonlight sonata
^
*I'd
I have no idea what it's called. I've always referred to it as "That one that goes Dun dun dun duuuuuuun"
^^^^
moonlight sonata is way too overplayed
^^
LISTNING TO GANGNAM STYLE FULL BLAST! ITS EPIC
twilight_sprinkle: So is Fur Elise.
AJIsAwesome: ye
Brenna_Hooves: best song of 2011 of course
Meanwhile: That's actually the exact way I describe every classical piece except this one :P
implying gangnam style is epic.
AJIsAwesome: stop giving me pings
Iwa: Well aren't you ironic.
Bronysith yea it is
Brenna_Hooves: How dare you listen to that instead of Beethoven?
gangnam style is as epic as flushing toilet
Meanwhile: Oooh yes...I am :)
Bronysith: yeah...................NO
AYYYYYYY SEXY LADEHHHHHH
im actually not a fan of moonlight sonata
0,14clearly you all are fools for not having Guilty Gear music as DA BESSSSSSSS
OP OP OP OPPA GANGNAM STYLE
twilight_sprinkle: >implying flushing a toilet isnt epic
Eli: How am I giving you pings?
Two steps from hell!
twilight_sprinkle: i agree. give it a month or two and no one will remember it
AYYYYYYYYYYYYY SEXEH LADEHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i know its one of his more famous pieces, but nocturne just has a certain elegant grace that touches my taste just in the right way
Eli: i hope so
Eli: it is going to last forever
AJIsAwesome: fur ELIse?
AJIsAwesome: Fur *eli*se
You put Beethoven to shame Brenna_Hooves
*does gangnam style dance*
Oh. :D
DerpyMuffins YES I DO
OP OP OP OPPA GANGNAM STYLE
AYYYYYYYY SEXY LADEH
Brenna_Hooves: now you're just spamming
AJIsAwesome: gimme a sec. need to go back in time and smash bethovens head in his piano for that
okay i will stop
Im starting to really hate that song now
Its overrated
it is too awesome though
hahahahaaaaaaaa
You and the rest of the world.
d
^
Seriously, it was funny the first like, 5 times but then everyone everywhere started doing it and it just became "Please move on."
I WANNA SEE OCTAVIA DOING THE GANGNAM STYLE DANCE
the stream is that were listening to a DVD called "Octavia's Favorite track's" (including night of the bumblebee for a liminted time)
i think gangnam style has a few more months to another year before it gets old
and then everyone hates it
Brenna_Hooves: I don't think she'd agree...
flutterchu its Flight of the Bumblebee
diddutz she doesnt have to *creepy face*
guys what was the command to kill the nick ghost?
cachi01: alt+f4
Derpy_Hooves: Ruby: oh okay then

I LOVE ROAD TO EL DARADO
(spelt that wrong)
Eli: most frustrationing are players who try to fight with a rocket/sticky Jumper imo ...
that didnt even sound classical
it sounds more bluesy
nvm
lol
:'(
<SafariMonkey> so...who's your favorite character, mine's kinda obvious
Impatient as always Lyra`
Brenna_Hooves: u a bro to PewDiePie?
hey, i love blues
flutterfan1990: It's Rarity.

and soul
cause I heard Ruben and he yells that every so often
and oooooold rock

cachi01, replace 'fly' with 'awasp'
wasp*
Sorry I missed the past 2 messages to me due to freeze. Can somepony fill me in?
Please?
this hardly sounds classical
Its in the eye of the beholder Lyra`
its very swingish
how come the mylittlefacewhen site no work for me? :(
i guess it was ahead of its time
It's was composed in the 1920's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_in_Blue
[19:42:27] <flutterfan1990> I<SafariMonkey> I must admit I love her flair for fashion designing, even if my attemps have been....unsuccessful,lol
Im gonna play AC Revelations while the pre-show is on :P This is nice to listen to, I gotta make an effort to catch the show more often
"In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major classical work, Rhapsody in Blue, for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé and premiered by Paul Whiteman's concert band in New York. It proved to be his most popular work."
It's probably one of those borderline things
that would explain it
we all left did we? haha
now it sounds like the OST from a cartoon
INTRO OF DARKNESS THEN REDNESS THEN WHITENESS
:3
classical 's cool, but i prefer most modern music genres
Can anypony tell Im bored?
though i really like classical instruments in my music
Your bored
steel and normal. wut about you http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/562009_10151113402331840_1452372121_n.jpg

Eli: did you like pans labyrinth?
DerpyMuffins: damn your names
DerpyMuffins: 4 more and you get a free sandwich! :3
Haha
10 min to what?
Eli: phew. for a second i thought i actually missed something
The PPP show

twilight_sprinkle: yeah. i kinda like mindfucks like that
I really feel sorry for Derpy_Hooves right now
/me enjoys mindfucks
Eli: k, couldve easily been less nasty though imo
RDash5000: watch end of evangelion
ah yes
the geodude line is prettty awesome so long as you avoid Fighting, Ground, Steel, water, grass and ice pokemon...
when i think mindfucks, evangelions always comes to mind
Bronysith: noted
lol ikr twilight_sprinkle
*evangelion
twilight_sprinkle: to my other favourite movies i count "he loves me, he loves me not (french)" "perfect stranger" and "Lucky #Slevin" all kinda fucked up
Waaaa ? got another genuine distinguished rouge and foppish physician for some reason ...
yeah
fantasia was cool
You know what? Screw Minecraft. It's caused me nothing but trouble.
I'm depressed now.
Eli: dunno if you like anime, but if you do, evangelion is one hell of a mindfuck
^
It's mainly an action/psycological anime.
I'm sure someone can take them off your hands.
twilight_sprinkle: is there a manga of it?
Pretty sure there is.
This sounds like something you'd hear from a cartoon back in the old days
Eli: probably, theres almost always a manga
Oh this :D
<3
i have just recently gotten into the world of anime. im so lost...
then i'm gonna read it
/me applauds
Wait I just noticed stream pic, Octavia with wings? o.O
We are getting so classical in here :)
this one makes my heart go pitter patter
oh I love this beautiful peace!
so fancy
and my mind flail in innocence
SafariMonkey: hahaha someone was slower than me
fun fact, I also played this song for my first jury! Along with Chopin Waltz in A minor! :)
Why so many french conductors GigabitHarmonie?
/me wishes he could play piano...
GigabitHarmonie: good thing it wasnt requiem eh :P
How many people here have weird attention spans?
Lyra` a lot of things make your heart go pitter patter
Derpy_Hooves: so many good things come form there. just not the language
Eli: I was on a client, I didn't actually see stream most of the time
Spell-of-Gaming: I do!
Grand duchess tiara seems familiar, someone will rename that "Big Crown Thingy"
127
Spell-of-Gaming: *raises hand*
Keeps on going
*12Z :P
has anyone heard the song United States of Erasia by Muse?
DerpyMuffins: really, change your name
Spell-of-Gaming: me Im playing Assassins Creed while listening to this and chatting here
Nope
DerpyMuffins: i keep tabfailing you
GigabitHarmonie: I love it how you and Allegr0 have been doing this classic music streams recently
its so delicate, and that rolling rise of notes at this point with just a hesitant touch to it, like a nervous lover for the first time, escalating to a bolder tones like that of the touch of one youve known for ages, its a wonderful piece, filled with the gentle touch of one you want to hold close, and fills a person with a certain longing to be a better person.
i freakin' love music like this
Hah. Gaaaaaay.
You should be apologizing to Derpy_Hooves for tab failing Eli
DerpyMuffins: because france has a loooooot of composers
DerpyMuffins: anyways, thre's a lot of good music coming from france. even now
and of course i want Crone's dome
too true Lyra
Lyra`: Your name befits you well. :)
Chopin was known for his graceful touches and timbre style.
thanks~
There has been so many Lya ships
yeah, sorry Derpy_Hooves for pinging you twice now. and now again
DerpyMuffins: *Lyra :)
Eli: so you ping him a third time :D
:D
Sorry
Lyra
oh, youre fine, my friend
twilight_sprinkle: yep. i apologized for that too
Eli: infinite ping apology loop :D
So what's the piece again? You should put it on your stream pic GigabitHarmonie!
3 more pings and I'm up to 130
So, since Left 4 Dead 2 is on free weekend mode, might there be a chance it might be featured on the PPP tonight?
