0,5Not even I lurk in here during the week

03hm,
I stay out of mainchat
*manechat
03http://i.imgur.com/jicJI.png
03it should look something like that
0,5yfw *main was right
03except not Realtek
Not to me
^
0,5x3
I occasionally lurk in #lobby
But it's usually just me and Slurry
3hm?
Why?
Wait, every intro?!
G1 is not that bad actually
mfw I heard that as Pony Randall
3Oh, yeah
G3 sucks though
03so that's probably Intel
:<
3#lobby was the old #bronystateregulars
03well, it's not Realtek.
03LOL
nono
well
Night Dash!
it should be realtek
LOLwut
0,5When I made this channel, I didnt even know #lobby existed =___=

samen hand in hand
2005ish or 2004 card
is it me or did it suddenly get quieter
Dah jeez! That's an aweful noise!
03yeah, those are awesome
03Creative soundcards are the way to go.
03but 99% of the time, Realtek is fine
I think I shared a photo of me like once
03just when it comes to MIDI, it kinda sucks
Yeah xD
03so uh
03you know any good piano VSTis?
03http://www.yohng.com/software/piano.html <- I'm trying that one out
the movie with the bart simpson pony
I'm sure few people here have seen my visage
very few
his wife rhea pearlman
0,14you ARE a thumb
<%drfsupercenter> yeah, trying any random MIDI, I get no sound output x.x < you need a VSTi
0,5:D
for it to make sound
03I know
03didn't I just say that?
0,5:3
03I asked in #reaper and they told me how to do it
This song isn't actually half bad....
Well this explains Winter Wrap UP.
I'm sure there are worse things to be...
Yes
i have a few, but if i import it as one track (not separate), the VSTis that i have break on it
I said it wasn't ha;f bad
I KNEW IT
>time&effort
/me is not best anything....
03OK wow
http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg138/scaled.php?server=138&filename=fppinoutco0.jpg&res=landing < this card
03this has really odd sounding bass
manliness *gets sent away*
03it's also too d*** loud
03it's playing every track at like 100%
Saxy, Soon I hope to be a thumb with a handlebar mustache
turn the master gain down
Luna: I cant thank you enough for sending me the dropbox link to the g3.5 theme
03yeah, just did
03not sure why bass sticks out more when you overdrive
/me puts it on loop
07,01your welcome :)
/me hugs Luna
The of the voices on the first few are terrible
*the effects on the voices
mfw I don't think The Pretender is the best FF song
rainbow dash dresses in style?
I prefer Everlong :P
03oh cool
03Reaper can play it fine without breaking
03prolly because of the VSTi
(if you have separated tracks)
03yes
03it auto-separates them
unless you click no
It's fucking brilliant
03even at like -26dB
We should do a marathon of G3.5
Dat bass is thumping....
03I think the individual tracks are overloading
I like learn to fly, that one is pretty damn legit
03hm, it also automatically does the tempo, as it should
Learn To Fly is great
^
03does GarageBand 4 autotempo based on the MIDI or you still have to do it manually?
as is pretty much all of Wasting Light
I have it on my ipod
it should read in the MIDI tempo
hello?
hi
Hello, is there anybody in there?
Can anybody hear me?
2012's G4 extended opening is missing.
Is there anyone at home?
03so just 3 sucks at it?
3 has no suport for variable tempo
O__o
Soz.
03yeah but you said you had to manually specify the tempo?
yep
one tempo for ALL of the song
03then it doesn't read it
03:P
03I can go get my hackintosh out
03well
03when I'm done checkdisking it
03(the laptop)
03ugh
Actually no, only Saxy's jacket is manly enough to do that
03why does this sound WAY TOO LOUD
03it's not an issue of actual volume
03it's not going about 0dB
03I tried not splitting the tracks up, same thing
I like them bones...that's a good song
Them Bones is pretty legit
ill download all the VSTis
might come in handy
(off yohng
03ah hm
the DX7 epno > pno
03I guess that's why
03o.o

03so you don't hear overdriven bass?
I hug you :(
I dont think I've gotten a legit hug in a few months...
/me hugs LTB back
3I'm here silly :<
3no, actually
PD
Aww...
i have crappy desktop speakers
good luck overdriving bass on that
3I just wanted you to read the channel name
inser an EQ if you want
03eh
03I could just try GarageBand 4
03does that have its own VSTs?
yfw this my theme song ;____;
Garageband and Logic don't support VSTs
03yeah but
03it has to have them built in then?
they have some built in effects
03well
03sounds different than any playback I've heard
03therefore I'm assuming it's something else
03a built in soundfont?
tumbleweed.gif
its the default built in piano i think
or one from boldt or the one in the orchestral pack
/me whistles a tune

03k, well I gotta play with the tempos some more, that end part is like 60bpm or such

use the automation at the bottom

04?
I was too busy staring at you
to look at them
04How touching
it's not that I refuse to look at people
04But damn you made that awkward
It's that I'm usually more interested in looking at OTHER people
that's my job you idiot

And I'm supposed to be the sadist in our relationship

You do that
you just know you want more of my sadism though >|

Yeah but I'm watching MiB the series, I can trust myself to do things like "check the time"

That's a stupid idea.

How about we tell them they missed the ep?
yeah, just missed the ep is amusing enoguh
Or we can be honest
That's just mean.
adding too much too it makes it unbelievable
Watch this
i do
Or we tell them that Luna got a song

<Scoota-Chicken> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
I like him more than you now.
Don't lie, you can't resist my jailbait-ness.
If you want.
And Trixie's a scuzzball.
also, in Mexico he's legal.
This isn't Mexico
and Germany
Fack everything.
And Japan, and the Vatican
and Amsterdam
And Denmark.
the Vatican has an unbelievably low age of consent
That isn't even surprising.
Briefly bring the stream back up, it's the "RD is an extra douchey douche" one.
RD is best pony
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
RD is worst mane 6.
[18:38]	Scoota-Chicken	Rainbow Dash is overrated pony.
imposter has a point
She's not being terrible, just a braggart.
She is hot shit.
I'd do her.
I mean, um er
I dislike RD some of the time for the same reason I hate Trixie, arrogance.
Um...
fun
lolwut
yeah
my issue with this ep is that the REST of the Mane 6 come off as bigger assholes in this.
I can't connect to the servers, but I'm online just fine
[13:41:58] <Scoota-Chicken> Uhm, sure. I didn't eman to hurt someone's feelings.. :U Just came to mind.
I wanna go say something nice to him
no
no friggin shipping
do I have to get the audio clip again?
Besides, Mare-Do-Well is best hero.
also the fact that they brag and boast about their OWN accomplishments, just to make Dash feel bad.

can you set off C4 just by dropping it with the detonators in it?
no
c4 is incredibly stable
yeah, that's why they like it
unless the detonator is triggered
you can use it as cooking fuel
I've heard
the only thing that sets of c4 is another explosion
hence why its always a secondary explosion
yeah, but mane is still a little.......random atm
I got distracted and missed like half the movie. That'd annoy me if I hadn't seen it yesterday.
In my defense, tea was involved.
hi DRF

Wow that typo was embarassing.
"Not on a computer"
I'd prefer watching it on a computer
there is a vanguard on this team
You can skip commercials
Sit closer
:D
the score looks like i am the vanguard
14I don't watch tv since...4 years now?
14it's total garbage here :(

Ello
Not bad I 'spose, nothing to do here.jpeg

Blades, blades everywhere.
Wouldn't know
I shoot people, I don't do statistics.
13also I need food
13too lazy to get food
If you have skill, you don't need stats.
03that's why :P
7It's not as if I need those. :U
03well I'm just saying
;-;
But fullscreen sucks
You can't see the time!
/me hides
03In fact, I just record TV straight to my computer and play it back
maid, or you can do both
03same quality.
03XD
Why would I want to do that? Stats are boring.
03I have two monitors, remember?
Yeah
132 screens 1 drf
/me runs
03hm darn, I need to get my hair cut, but this place closes in an hour
03and I don't even know if they do walk-ins
03I should prolly call them
03I mean it doesn't have to be *today*
ofc
Watch Korra with us :D
/me hide
Or
:p
13Why is Korra suddenly popular
Because Avatar fans and I dunno
Vanguard, kill thief extraordinare.
its rather annoying, its nice trippling the score of everyone else
Maybe because it might be the only decent Nick show?
:P
03:P
0390s Nickelodeon or GTFO.
deal more damage get more points
/me runs
Yeah
Nick != Nickelodeon
03I'll just see what's on
03*:
03*:P
06this
and their crazy AoE damage capacity
14I don't watch it at all, since a few years now
14too much trash :/
fine
7Don't watch too much--that I agree with.
I forgot all about it :3
14same xD
lol
03eh
03I made an appointment for Monday

13I had a subway for the first time in over a year today
:D
welcome back to the good side
13can't believe it's been that long since I last went to Subway D:
how does it feel?
13Still as delicious as I remember it <3
Never went to subway
;-;
13I wanted to buy a footlong but I couldn't afford the extra £2
03I usually always get footlongs on flatbread
Vanguards as such douch-
Wait a minute...
charge does NOT make you invulnerable
Actually I'm fairly sure it does.
it doesnt
if you go down while charging you completely break
Didn't really like the cast all that much in the movie… I'm still mulling it over.
It's awesome.
You play the easy way for fast points.
That's fair enough
vanguards are good against trash, but pretty poor against anything bigger
But don't try and say you aren't.
14one of my goals was eating something in the subway
which he'll be using tomorrow
14I did it, I regret it, but worth it
14x3
one centered around chandelure
Vanguards can knock back Atlases.
yyyyye-nope.
which is probably why I use them
03(that MIDI)
03so as I suspected, it uses its own rendering engine
oh
i think hitmontop is in it as well
And yet you still lose to groups of cannibals
7Mmm'kay.
basically
chandelure
and banshees with insta kills
03now, it gave me a few choices about which instrument set to use
and primes and hutners with stunlock
03was yours just at the default?
and pyros with their flamethrowers
They ganged up on me and I had no powers, I got gang raped
ninetale's only real job is to get in there and remove rain once their rain inducer is gone
7Yes?
You must suck hard if you lose to pyros.
and the other instakill enemies
I'm really glad I saw Cabin in the Woods though.
Charging pyros is a terrible idea
7Just sun-inducer, eh? XD
7Ah, well.
other than on bronze
I wouldn't know, they usually die before they reach me.
I usually play a very close range oriented Vanguard though
dohoho.
you can play a close range vangaurd without dieing alot....
Yes, but you must remember that I'm a massive noob.
^
You mean the one that's exactly like the other ones?
No, the one where Marauder Shields kills me and protects me from Star Child
Why'm I still wearing this?
Fun fact, that look of terror is real
yeah
Yeah, which is pointless
its supposed to "explain" the endings
given that everyone's gripe with the endings was... well that they're shit.
and reduced it into a red/green/blue chocie
also star child out of nowhere
And that would have been great
Ikr.
you know, give me some value to saving both of them
03o.o
or a wave of rachnii to clear up some of the mobs on earth
the asarii flagship take one for ours would of been nice, repaying the favour
but it should of just removed the entire area and bombed it from any distance
The last level as a whole kind of sucked, it wasn't nearly as epic as it should have been.
The whole Geth Quarian thing made me immensely depressed.
why?
/me randomly laughs thinking of Cabin in the Woods.
Because I was aiming for diplomacy, unaware that I'd invalidated it in ME2.
BNC server b0rked
:D
03LOL
:P
03I need to yell at Hetzner's support
Email them again
03yeah
That was fucking brutal.
that sucks man, it really does
lol
10drf
"artistic integrety"
10give me a hint on Draw Something
10because the cheat doesn't have any choices o.o
OOOOh yeeees! Look at all the symbolliiiiissssmmmm
You know it's false.
03I don't even remember my word LOL
03oh
hey, at least you didn't sit through Wrex's betrayal
03yeah
03the word is eyepatch
03derp
bc I saw that on YT, and it is crushing
10bah
Yeah, I saw that too
Wrex's betrayal?
That's not a renegade choice
dear LORD I could never bring myself to do it
That's a dickhead/psychopath choice
That's one douchey choice
another paragon of NOT saving someone
Mordin went out like a boss.
Seeing Shepard gun down Mordin in one of the outcomes was really heartbreaking
Right, that's his face.
I haven't played ME2 for a while.
i had to kill her myself cause i didnt think the school was actually times
I LOVED KIRRAHE.
Kirrahe died for you?
I had him holding the line in ME3.
D:
I was disappointed to hear that Kal'Reegar died in an email
Before the network, there were SOLDIERS!
i would of been happier
That bastard.
oh man, thane was tough
oh
I was actually glad it was Thane, he was going to die anyway
i didnt even like thane
Thane was too cool to let die in ME2
bastard sent me an email, oh damn was I like "You bastard"
His speech was incredible.
me too
good speech
Kirrahe was cool
^
lol
Inb4 sods law strikes you down should you.
sod's law?
Fair enough
Anyway
youd also have to kill mordin to do that too
still
yeah, you get a slightly smaller one though
Besides, the Crucible had Rachni. You can't really top Rachni.
I REALLY wish we could have seen Rachni fighting the Reapers on Earth, and the Geth wrecking shop.
well, not sluts, but they get around
I want to see more Asari history.
asarians

Meanwhile*
man, typing fail
Yeah see I didn't buy that.
They wanted more slaves
Seriously I can't even properly remember ME1.
as in Verner?
yes!
he has a GREAT scene in ME3
absolutely GREAT!
03I can get either Gingerbread or ICS for my tablet
In my defense, I got it like a week before ME2 was coming out.
His dissertation?
yeah, and his "Did I help?"
Actually wait.
If I think about it.
it was a great scene that was subverted and made me feel good.
But before I go....
and instead having a shep shrine
/me steals Meanwhile's legs
Oi
Heheh
Gotta go!
oh yeah
and LEAVE Meanwhile's LEGS!
/me feels bad and gives Meanwhiled's legs back
/me squees.
Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
lol
/me looks at one of his legs.
You sure?
Absolutely.
XD
If I get a cane, I can act like House.
:)
/me holds the leg
apparently they are a geth technology
Try not to break it :P
I'm not gonna make any promises
though to accomodate this they had to remove the internal cooling mechanisms
Cya y'all letter tonight if you're still on
Do people REALLY think about why they use thermal clips in ME2 onwards?
yes
i still prefer the old system
Well, most of it anyway
I wanted to play the story, I wanted to play Shepard. I didn't want to play librarian.
Re release all 3 ME games when the next gen of consoles come around, all of them with ME3's updated gameplay as well as somewhat remade levels.
That would be awesome.
OFC!
very little changed between 2 and 3
*that
I point them and the thing I'm poiting at dies. That's good enough for me.
but nooo consoles are too limted and we cant have the PCs looking ncier now can we
I liked ME1 grenades
I found the grenades kinda unwieldy.
That would have been really cool
There were grenades in ME1?
exactly
I don't think I used a single one in my entire playthrough...
alright, here we go
Goon.
LOTTO TIEM
*fingers
DOSH
right time for lotto

03and well
03I tried ICS and bricked it >_>
mmm, cider
Darn, I think I was 141

Why would you do that.

03well
03it's children's Advil

03but that basically ruins the effect
4x the recommended dosage for you, or for children lol
drfffffffffff
03SheenaFox, for children
03but like
03it's based on weight
it is
03the highest weight they have (one dose cup) is like a little under half of mine
03so I just filled the thing twice
03and then did that again >_>
10Why
10can't you swallow pills
03I just can't
03yeah
10Well, I used to be the same, but because I was SCARED to swallow them
10don't ask why

03basically where hair grows on the back of my hands
10Only certain people can pull of mustaches/beards

*
that's the same with mine
03the hinge

okay but yeah
any idea why a laptop won't live boot?
03bad RAM possibly
03I'd say the CPU but if you get a BIOS at all, the CPU works
Well

even hirons doesn't work

10No.
Even before the image, you should have believed me
03preferrably not something dirty :P
03meh, I'll just put drfsupercenter.info in there for now cuz I'm uncreative
Not when you say that they'll do anything to 'defend' a browser
When I also told you that IE was acting up
10Shouldn't that be a compliment?
But you said that you need proof
drffffffffffffff
03yeah?
and now everyone is going on about OCs
03Ascendant
10juhnquit
03I am having
yo
03terrible luck
10lolol
@_@
issues?
03yeah
03something about the RAID controller :/
12lol Angel
/me hugs Angel
what's the problem?
03Windows won't find any hard drives
13or take it somewhere else cuz we don't wanna see that crap
13>:/
03I've only got an hour left
b0rk
03and I paid 25
03>_>
Well
Now I have to draw my OC
You know, we don't talk enough about OCs in here.
hmm
I dc'd...what now?
Should have slipstreamed the drivers
03I didn't realize it wasn't already there
:P
OCs
>_>
Research!!
03I still can't fricking find which controller is even in it
03looking at my hetzner control panel
03no idea
Should have emailed them about it
o_O
/me nomz on the trout
lol memtest
03and it's got two 500GB Samsung hard drives, they were set to RAID1
:P
03I deleted the array and remade it just for good measure
03whatever was built in
I prefer salmon for future reference.
03to the recovery console
that usually sucks
03exactly
03but sigh
03why the frick
03they have an external RAID controller and no drives plugged into the onboard SATA ports
03I'm sure the motherboard itself supports RAID >_>
03actually it does
,),
03so why did they do that
03other than to piss me off
/me runs
Hardware raid ftw
go yell at them
03apparently 3ware is a retarded barnd
03Xanbreon are you saying BIOS RAID isn't hardware?
Why did the Northwest Coast Indians go fishing?
Of cause not
03I was under the assumption that it's built into the hardware
Its software O_o
on the cpu
No raid logic
Do I wanna know?
Just for the Halibut!
03well I know my board has like 3 separate SATA controllers
03LOL
that's kinda sad
3 separate ones?
03Yes
03well it's got 12 ports overall
036 of them are SATA2, that's all one controller
03then it has 6 SATA3, 2 and 4
03since apparently at the time, no SATA3 controllers could do 6 drives
03I don't really care, since I don't use RAID internally, only on my storage unit
....
That was terrible and you should feel bad
:-(
03I only know how to slipstream 2000/XP
03not Vista/7
/me is hugged
:-)
this is why
Do share.
rather than the other way 'round
Dam
Yup, that's the same category as my joke.
:D
And with that I'm off
Heheh

/me shrugs
now go get me some extra IPs >|
03it's 1/month
03per IP
03if you can pay for those then sure LOL
03I get free IPV6 though
1 euro
or w/e currency THEY use
I think it's euros
and VMing would completely eradicate the point of being a dedicated server
w/e
03yeah
/me runs
yeah I know :p
I'm kidding XD
how's the setup going?
03I'm emailing support

Haha
03well
03I heard it on the radio
wut
03but it was a catchy beat
03in fact, I recorded it off the radio as they didn't release it on iTunes for like, 4 months
03and I was impatient
03I even emailed the dude and got a reply
03(Brilliance is a local DJ/rapper in Detroit)
03but then I heard the slowed-down version from iTunes and was like woah
03yeah
03installing updates atym
03*atm
03and I'll do VNC
03can I please do RealVNC Enterprise? :()

TightVNC should
do check though
03cuz I need to crack TeamViewer using VNC
03which is like a $700 license
03>_>
03so right now it's on the trial period and then it'll boot me off

Not using it is just fracking retarded

Yes, grats, thats freq scaling
dunno
Sure, cpu cooler > air cooler > everything cooler > parts last longer

anything fun going on here? or is it just a doornail?

Also to turn it off, you would have todo it in the BIOS, which would mean paying them todo, unless you still have the KVM

you won't say that when you taste victory
anyone for L4D2 ?
03*if* I do
and win a regional which includes a trophy and a free trip to nationals
03there can only be one winner XD
03what are the odds of that happening
plus i needed to catch cresselia
which isn't easy
03I don't really get the point of EV training and all that
i need to buy pearl
03I have one I never use
hmm
03I'm not giving it away but you could borrow it or something :P
03you can if you have a flashcard
that way i could catch cresselia
tune it to a team's needs XD
03well
03regardless how many times you catch it
oh
03yeay
03*h
XD
03but then it would be hacked?
not really
03yes it would be
03I thought you were entering a tournament :P
how do i know that wasn't the actual real cresselia i just caught? :P
03PIDs.
needs a good cleaning
03seriously, if yu do anything with the Pokémon in an editor besides just cloning it, it'll show as hacked
03it's pretty crazy :P
03*you
well
yeah, mines also not real :(
if it spawns as cresselia
wouldn't that just make it legit?
03no
03well
03yes, but if you screw with the PIDs...
well
03since like I said
03the PID for the legendaries is already set
this isn't really doing anything with the poke file
03well it's questionable

yeah
Still fun
just changing the routes to make anything that spawns a cresselia instead

03yeah
03but oddly enough
03the camera worked under GB but not in ICS
03it says "error: cannot connect to camera"

03and cyanogenmod was like "eh, yeah, we know, just get ICS"
Kernel > userland APIs etc
03I kinda don't like trebuched
03*t
03can I use ADWLauncher on ICS?
cause
03well
03hence why updates of most of my apps were like "now works with ICS"
Depends on the app
03so it's not like XP to Win7?
well i am just about finished downloading saints row
first one?
the third
03ooh, it has a mode to optimize for a stylus
03that would make Draw Something a lot easier
/me hides
its fun
Burt Reynolds even shows up
Depends
euch 2 hours still to download
and 1 am
03hm
03Xanbreon you use CM9 ICS?
Yes
No, theres device specific settings
Not all the settings are implemented yet
03well
03I'm trying to mess with the on screen buttons
03since, they put a home button on screen despite the tablet having a real home button
03and tehre's no menu button except in certain apps L>_>
03-L
No global menu button
03in CM7, under tablet tweaks, there was a way to
03wtf?
03in ICS at all?
ICS doesnt have one
03That's retarded
Its changed
03I coulda sworn it works o.o
Of cause it works
But you dont need an onscreen menu button
As the UI has changed
03but if ICS doesn't have a menu button
03then what's that button doing :P
opens the menu
03:P
Urk
03also stupid trebuchet
03I hate this thing already
03rebooting then installing ADW
trebuchet is great :D
03IO hate it
03-o
03laggy as f*** when switching homescreens
03also the auto-brightness sucks
03:/
03that's prolly a hardware issue
03though it did work in CM7
Meh
03wtf
03it's having the same f'ing issue as before
03where if I turn bluetooth on
03it breaks wifi
03>_>
haha
aww :<
03maybe that's not a CM7/9 problem then
03or rather
did it happen in webos?
As
03a problem with the hardware and how Android reacts to it
03of course not
> Same antenna wifi
oh
03it works fine in WebOS
03bluetooth one
03actually
03you know wha tI think it is?
03the f'ing market.
03in both GB and ICS
03Wifi no longer works.
03Not sure WHY
03but yeah
Shouldnt be related
/me hides
03yeah see
03"no network connection"
03let me try something
03I'll restore the initial backup before I setup ICS and try NOT turning the bluetooth on
Of cause
03ah hm
03I got IIS to work at least </not related>
03also ICS, IIS, stupid acronyms that are similar
drf
heeeeeeelp
my wireless router isn't turning on ;_;
03yes?
03o_O
03did you try a hard dreset?
no lol
03try that
no power going to it
for some reason
03*adapter
I think it shorted out sometime during the night
03yeah, nothign I can do from here about hardware problems :P
yeah well it's been sitting there for whoknowshowlong
and my modem wasn't working either
I had to restart it
03hm, weird
03so if I turn the wi-fi off once it borks (e.g. updating the market) then back on, forget the router and then reconnect, it seems to work

I wish it would rain and get rid of a lot of it
Plus I just like the rain :)
3But of course :P
Rain makes me wet.
Mmm cashew <3
Rain is always good. ITs supposed to rain here tomorrow ^_^

/me hugs Meawhile
3hahah xD
03basically wifi has to be manually reset every reboot >_>
*Meanwhile
3Rain is a friend of mine!
3You know Rain, right?
3xD
I know Rain, yes.
3silly
Okies
nothing
there's no lights coming on at all
Tried diff power socket?
Oh gosh....
03"is it plugged in?"
/me hides
NevermindJohnU
tried 2 diff power sockets already
that are both confirmed working

Do you have a alt power supply you can use?
huh?
:3
You know
That was a weird autocorrect....
the power brick?
*Nevermind
well not 50
NevermindJohnU.
but it's a mess
I know everything is working
Yeah....

You are all about the spelling tonight.
3There we go :3
/me steals Meanwhile's legs "Be quiet"
interesting
I'm not actually sure
You're aware that my mouth (Or fingers) aren't on my legs right
I thought about it before
apparently in pokesav
you can unset the cresselia event
there is no such thing as a WRT54L
and it's probably about time it died anyway
there is a WRT54GL though
03Umbreon yeah
03but again
03it'll be the same PIDs
that is a cool one
to make it think that it's done
its highly open to alternate firmwares
then uncheck it again
03no idea
but the stupid thing keeps shorting out when I get a massive amount of traffic
massive as in
maybe he'll give me his hack checker as well
400 packets in a second
:D
Do you have a comparable one?
03#pokemon-originals at irc.hoshinet.org
03:P
03anyway
lol
oh?
Yesh.
2.5gbps UDP DDoS
:P
400 packets per second
how the heck are you pulling that off!?
10Ping
/me uses her LEGS and dodges
/me lands on his face.
fast
all i need to do is hack up some level 100s and hope they obey me XD
03yes but they check the *Entire save* for hacks
03so unless you're planning to trade them elsewhere
03don't do that
XD
Most considerate.
03oh
:)
/me steals LunaTheBeloved's leg.
I guess for 400 packets per second you need to use a commercial router
/me falls over
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/10378?search=mecha
/me hobbles after Neanwhile
*Meanwhile
/me surfs away on LTB's leg.
[10:52:57] <%Ascendant> oh?
[10:53:04] <Xanbreon> 2.5gbps UDP DDoS
[10:53:08] <Xanbreon> :P
[10:53:12] <nickstr> 400 packets per second
[10:53:18] <nickstr> how the heck are you pulling that off!?
yea, you need to spend something like $1,000 on a router alone
/me attaches Meanwhile's legs to her stumps and runs after you
my router shorted out before it could be completed
well
restarted
an interprise level router
enterprise
3mmm, I'll leave the RP alone for now...
yeah
the router is not "shorting out"
you are overloading the crap out of its CPU
probably
Okay
/me attaches LunaTheBeloved's leg and makes a hop for it.
I mean the <censored> power cable and the plug
Do you have an alt plug
did you read the part about 400 packets per second causing it to screw up?
Deal.
/me reattaches his legs.
/me reattached her legs
well
haven't done it for a while
and certainly not recently
oh
How long have we been stealing each other's legs?
well
Urrr...Pfft.
I can't remember.
I kinda killed both connections
i'm going to get sick XD
mine and the server I was running it on
but said server is a home server
with a netgear router
A long time.
yikes
Yeah...
Since last year at least
the clock speed on those is not too high plus not much RAM
I no longer hunger
03so you finished the hunger games?
/me runs
Yeah
They were tasty
I can believe that.
do eit
good idea
Not sure...might have been during a really boring movie and you just decided to do something crazy....
but look at its specs
I dunno...
CPU clock speed and RAM
Might have just been a spur of the moment thing.
sort of like you were buying a computer
Heheh
lol I'm going to have fun setting it up
cus' it's not like I've ever done it before
Itll always be our thing, legs
You derp
This is my second router anyway
the last one... died
Dem legs.
but 2-3 years is kinda long for a router to last
Not to bad
Heheh
And the leg stealing craze begins
Well, given that we only do it in this room, and to get in here you need to have a certain level of...something, I can't see that happening too easily :3
03whereas the $200 Linksys didn't
the antennas are passive
Yeah... :)
not active
^_^
they can't have power
03well
03the one I got has the largest legal amount
031W I thinkl
03-l
yea
03compared to the 500mW and such thta other routers had
03in fact
03that $200 Linksys had *internal* antennas
03it was also the highest rated router on Newegg
03>_>
but you need antennas that have a lower gain and thus a lower eirp
in order to stay within the part 15 specs for WIFI
I'm not bothered enough to work
make it work*
omg
this dumb rival
always has been the most annoying one of the bunch
o_O
wtf

Like a boss.

I don't think they ever would set boundaries....just a thought

Boundaries?
For how long you've been at BS to be in this room
03Ascendant
03that's a good thing
yo
03n
Not officially.
no it's not ):
I have to reconfigure my IPv6
which I can't be bothered to do
03they were too lazy to re-ban me
1212now you're un-banned from everywhere
But generally it's considered to be a few months or something.
You are a derp
1212:D
Cause it'll only grow larger as the weeks go by...
implying I was banned from somewhere
and drf for that matter
/me hides
I wouldn't use my own IP ):
Heheh....a regulars room for the regular regulars...
Yeah, pretty much
#bronystateregularregulars tbh
It'll be done one day...
awww
I liked my previous IP
baddie
03because the ISP bases it on MAC address or something
03so it's not surprising
03>Says we're low on IPv4 addresses
03>ISPs have dozens to spare
it's heh
IPv6 really is not on my mind at all
Yeh, but we dont want to end up NATing our NAT's
lmao
Thus IPv6 asap pls

but sure
03well
I don't really mind
03>VMWare Tools
anything works
03but
heh well
03that's if you need a GUI
03if you're only using terminal
03then yeah
I don't need a GUI
03exactly XD
I'm going to uninstall that crap
as soon as I get the login set up
sudo apt-get purge gnome
03hence when you were all
LOLGnome
03I was like
03SOmeone didn't install the tools
gnome is nice ):
at least gnome 2 is
03Gnome2 is nice
But I thought
gnome 3
033 is stupid
you said gnome
/me cringes

Why even install the GUI to start with?
I ewewww
nah
cus' liveboot does it

hah
03that's a reference to a movie
03w/e
Because GUI is fun ;<
03is install ESXi
03then just put both OSes
03as a VM
yeah
03I just have no experience installing ESXi on metal
and then I wouldn't have to rage at you
03I mean, if you think it's worth paying another 20
every time you restart the server
metal?
ESXi on metal?
03as in, hardware
oh
03yeah
03as in
03we used one at work
03because I wouldn't oppose to just wiping out my current setup and doing that
Just dont reboot it then
derp
03then I could give you like a gig of RAM or something maybe
03why would you need that much just for a terminal interface though?

03porn on a terminal?
03if I accidentally break things :D
good jorb

03and well, eh
well drf
03I suppose once everything is set up
I need at least 512mb :{D
preferably 1GB, but tis' up to you
03then I won't need to reboot very often
where you search
"very often"
03but, when you mess with the server roles
being once a month

03it makes you reboot :P

03they'll install it for me?
03do they even support vmware?
03ah
03XD
03well
well
ask them about it
03not all hardware has a built in chassis speaker

You are just going to have to pay for the iKVM
well, the actual headphones
03hm
03I mean, I can pay for the LARA console (iKVM thing), but I need to know how to install ESXi and all that
go slap hetzner
I haven't installed ESXi before
03I've got a computer next to me that I don't particularly need
03I could try it on there
03and well
03would you just need one IP?

idk drf
Oh noes :p
I can pay for extra IPs
03hm
have fun

Generally any 64bit cpu with hardware VT should do
03though eh
03it says 2GB minimum of RAM... I hope the f'ing software itself doesn't eat that much
03so it should be fine?
03my only concern is that stupid RAID controller
03it's a 3Ware one, which isn't listed at all

damn
i wanted to ask if he knew about a program.
/me sighs
whats wrong drf? :(
aww :(
is it that too much work is being given out or too much to take in at once or something?
oh.
XD
:/
and I have a programming assignment that I have no idea how to do
13oh I forgot to change my nick earlier
13ah well, brb |D

I think I understand this now
might have to go to the pawn shop and buy a DS
heh
well
you can take apart the DSi and manually trigger the L/R
they're just toggle switche
you think it might be a mechanical issue?
it usually is
it's pretty hard to break the toggle buttons LOL
byebye
i dont have the tools to open it
a screwdriver?
also hm
