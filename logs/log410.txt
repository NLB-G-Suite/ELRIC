Hot.
Blastoff!
SaxyPretender: I said Neshanigans ;___;
03it *may* be dependent on the sound card and not the software, but there's also the possibility of using a different rendering engine
that would make a GREAT GIF!
pinkie rocket launch detected
03such as SynthFont and all that

SOMEONE MAKE IT A GIF!

LordCelestia: oh fuck that one XD
7I think it's something on your computer. O_o

Luna: THANK YOU DEAR!
CCCP: leave your Xenophobia out of our ponies.

Night everypony who is leaving!
LordCelestia: me and him are both in maryland, its more or less a border state
0,5Scoots i dont think you have anything to use against me :3
ScootaChicken: it's actually eastern european, scots/irish that sort of thing
7Checking...
0,5But so help me if you do I will rip out your typing muscles
LordCelestia: I love you Rainbow Dash.

0,5pff
0,5I luth you thoo rainbfthow dasth
Tovler: okay u were right *huggles* :)

LordCelestia: I know what you did last night with DashWithRainbows.

Wut now?
03it'll be under Sound/whatever controllers
0,5O_O ewgh
man i love this song
oh god damn not the fuckin internet medley
youtube tiem?!!? awesome
You think I would degrade myself?
Seriously, DashWithRainbows and LordCelestia drawing art together is not a pretty sight
0,5You kidding me?
YFW I haven't drawn all week ScootaChicken...
0,5Our art would kick ASS
0,5Mainly his
0,5but mine would be AMPLIFIED by his
LordCelestia you could draw the plot.
LordCelestia: By your powers combined, you are...
Dunno.
I don't draw plot.
hm. Are people making money off of memes?
LordCelestia is amazing at plot
0,5CAPTAIN BACON
0,5*fanfare*
LordCelestia commandeers plot on a regular basis.
Like a captain.
And talk goes to plot.....
0,5You mean the SS Plot?
Trolololol.
Ah Regulars room......nothin like it...
LordCelestia: No, I meant the Plotanic
LunaTheBeloved: IKR?
0,5Ah
7Got there.
why is this room not active all week??
emangamer: because reasons
7Audio Codecs?
I try to get it active....
0,5Because no one is in here all week
LunaTheBeloved: Don't you love it?
I'm in here a fair bit
I make a motion that we all hang out in here all week...
No one ever talks though...
0,5Not even I lurk in here during the week
I agree with emangamer
I talk...nopony ever responds....
03hm,
/me responds to LunaTheBeloved
LunaTheBeloved: I would respond :3
0,5Now now, dont direct all your attention here, rather than mane chat
Usually Dken2021 does but that's usually it
I stay out of mainchat
*manechat
03http://i.imgur.com/jicJI.png
03it should look something like that
0,5yfw *main was right
03except not Realtek
LordCelestia: but the mane chat is full of idiots...
Not to me
^
0,5technically, mane chat makes no sense
0,5x3
I occasionally lurk in #lobby
But it's usually just me and Slurry
3hm?
oh and SuperBrony64
I haven't chatted on main chat since me and SB64 played Brawl on stream.....
/me is confused
emangamer: the silly filly group?
/me hugs SlurryMoon
Why?
Mane chat is so full despite there being no new episode.
Wait, every intro?!
ScootaChicken: *raises an eyebrow* wah?
SlurryMoon: There's this channel called #lobby that I think Ghosties created? And whenever I'm there you usually are.
G1 is not that bad actually
mfw I heard that as Pony Randall
3Oh, yeah
G3 sucks though
Right i'm off. ScootaChicken try to become legal faster, otakon grow back a beard and LordCelestia...I don't know.
CCCP I'm not saying that, I was mearly implying the inevitable. ..
03so that's probably Intel
oh god intel
:<
3#lobby was the old #bronystateregulars
03well, it's not Realtek.
DashWithRainbows: Quiet you.
03LOL
/me hugs DashWithRainbows
nono
well
Night Dash!
it should be realtek
DashWithRainbows: I'm legal in south carolina... gotta love the 16 year old age limit
LOLwut
night DashWithRainbows
0,5When I made this channel, I didnt even know #lobby existed =___=
03REaltek is pretty nice, but every brand of sound card does their own MIDI rendering or what-have-tou
03*you
0,5Night DWR!
I have conexct/something
03ah, I think that's a Windows thing
night toast
0,14later DashWithRainbows!
03it'll just pretend your card is made by Microsoft unless you tell it otherwise x.x
/me hugs DashWithRainbows
emangamer britains legal age is 16...only two more years for Neil.
Night Ashley :3
My PC has a nice old Soundblaster
Take care DashWithRainbows.
gaar me meet me may
/me remembers #lobby
samen hand in hand
2005ish or 2004 card
is it me or did it suddenly get quieter
DashWithRainbows: You have a calendar and everything, don't you.
hi GabeMoist
Ohai Communist
Dah jeez! That's an aweful noise!
GabeMoist: what if You were Gabe Newell?
ScootaChicken is best jailbait (and the secksiest)
03yeah, those are awesome
Do people here know what I look like?
'n' because "and" is too long and hard to spell.
03Creative soundcards are the way to go.
ScootaChicken: yes
It's the Potato Head family.
03but 99% of the time, Realtek is fine
I think I shared a photo of me like once
03just when it comes to MIDI, it kinda sucks
CCCP, Hats. Hats everywhere
ScootaChicken: i know what you look like
Yeah xD
GabeMoist: XD
03so uh
ScootaChicken: dont forget the video where you played drums on your guitar... that makes sense right?
03you know any good piano VSTis?
03http://www.yohng.com/software/piano.html <- I'm trying that one out
ScootaChicken: not really
emangamer: yeah, but my face is mostly obscured entirely in that one
the movie with the bart simpson pony
03Reaper doesn't decode MIDIs on its own, you need the soundfont similar to your program
here's a hint, ScootaChicken is SOMEWHERE in this picture: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/e83f9f36-e221-4d71-8240-e43bd328c72b.png
I'm sure few people here have seen my visage
very few
By hint, emangamer means bottom picture, far left
his wife rhea pearlman
so ScootaChicken is an embodyment of manliness...somehow...
emangamer: MandoPony's on that list, it's hardly accurate
0,14well, GabeMoist
ScootaChicken: is the guy in the blazer holding the guitar in the middle...
0,14you ARE a thumb
emangamer: lolwut
0,5I know which one is scootachicken!
0,5:D
LordCelestia: I do too...
for it to make sound
emangamer: let me address the problems with that statement
03I know
03didn't I just say that?
0,5Well obviously you do
0,5:3
03I asked in #reaper and they told me how to do it
ScootaChicken: sorry, you're not awesome enought to be him
This song isn't actually half bad....
Firstly emangamer, it's not a blazer. Secondly, I'm not Jimmy from AcousticBrony
Well this explains Winter Wrap UP.
I'm sure there are worse things to be...
LunaTheBeloved: have you heard the deutch g3.5 theme?
Yes
0,14but you're the best thumb ever, GabeMoist
second best MLP theme ever
i have a few, but if i import it as one track (not separate), the VSTis that i have break on it
ScootaChicken is Dusty!
I said it wasn't ha;f bad
I KNEW IT
GabeMoist: Nope, I'm MandoPony
i could insert 27 unseparated VSTis but
>time&effort
/me is not best anything....
03OK wow
http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg138/scaled.php?server=138&filename=fppinoutco0.jpg&res=landing < this card
03this has really odd sounding bass
manliness *gets sent away*
03it's also too d*** loud
03it's playing every track at like 100%
Saxy, Soon I hope to be a thumb with a handlebar mustache
turn the master gain down
Luna: I cant thank you enough for sending me the dropbox link to the g3.5 theme
03yeah, just did
03sounds a bit better now.
03not sure why bass sticks out more when you overdrive
G1 = okay, G2 = meh, G3= Bad, G3.5= Bad, G3.6= Hell G4= Heaven
/me puts it on loop
07,01your welcome :)
SaxyPretender is best Foo Fighters song
/me hugs Luna
0,14I look forward to it, GabeMoist
Check the main chat folks.
0,14also, indeed, ScootaChicken
The of the voices on the first few are terrible
ScootaChicken: foo fighters ftw
*the effects on the voices
mfw I don't think The Pretender is the best FF song
rainbow dash dresses in style?
I prefer Everlong :P
03oh cool
03Reaper can play it fine without breaking
03prolly because of the VSTi
(if you have separated tracks)
03yes
ScootaChicken: however, the pretender is still a good song
03it auto-separates them
When will we be airing this?
emangamer: 'good'?
unless you click no
It's fucking brilliant
03it still sounds too loud
03even at like -26dB
We should do a marathon of G3.5
Dat bass is thumping....
ScootaChicken: compared to everlong it's good
03I think the individual tracks are overloading
Everlong is still better though.
I like learn to fly, that one is pretty damn legit
Everlong is one of the best Alternative Rock songs, ever.
03hm, it also automatically does the tempo, as it should
Learn To Fly is great
^
03does GarageBand 4 autotempo based on the MIDI or you still have to do it manually?
I like the scootaloo learn to fly cover
as is pretty much all of Wasting Light
I have it on my ipod
it should read in the MIDI tempo
mfw this chat has somehow dissolved to me and ScootaChicken
Hey Johnny Park is a really good if underrated album song
hello?
is anypony else here?
hi
Hello, is there anybody in there?
well ScootaChicken looks like we have to repop-DAMMIT CCCP
Can anybody hear me?
2012's G4 extended opening is missing.
Is there anyone at home?
emangamer: :D
03so just 3 sucks at it?
/me repopulates with ScootaChicken just because
3 has no suport for variable tempo
emangamer: I'm too masculine.
O__o
Soz.
03yeah but you said you had to manually specify the tempo?
yep
Also, if any of you want to know what I look like, ask Flaria, she has a picture of me saved on her hard drive for some reason
one tempo for ALL of the song
03then it doesn't read it
03:P
03but 4 will do that?
ScootaChicken: we are, combined, so masculine that one of eventually goes past 999 and eventually flips to feminine
that's what i said
03I can go get my hackintosh out
03well
03when I'm done checkdisking it
What is happenning in here....why are we repopulating...
and that's what i said
03(the laptop)
emangamer: only Saxy is manly enough to do that.
I mean, have you seen me with my swag? no one can match that
03ugh
Actually no, only Saxy's jacket is manly enough to do that
03why does this sound WAY TOO LOUD
03it's not an issue of actual volume
03it's not going about 0dB
03it just sounds overloaded
0,14also, my favorite FF songs are: The Pretender, Learn to Fly, All My Life, Stacked Actors and Skin and Bones
03I tried not splitting the tracks up, same thing
ScootaChicken: obviously you havent looked at my swag picture long enough
I like them bones...that's a good song
Them Bones is pretty legit
ill download all the VSTis
might come in handy
(off yohng
03ah hm
Saxy's jacket is my true love...
holy shiat
03yeah if I don't split the tracks up, it does indeed break
03in Reaper
the DX7 epno > pno
03I guess that's why
ScootaChicken x Funkballs is OTP
Actually, this guy is my true love: i.minus.com/jb0bQZmsXUjFtB.JPG
03o.o
(in mb s)
ScootaChicken: you know you are in love with Funkballs
I honestally have no idea who Funkballs is, but I like the idea of fucking with ScootaChicken with that name
dafuq is Funkballs?
^
exactly!
3haha, yes
but it's still a fun name to mess with ScootaChicken with
ScootaChicken: you know you wanna make sweet love to Funkballs
3I remember the days SaxyPretender went as just ThePretender
I do too
I don't know what Funkballs is :s
I don't remember that ;___;
SlurryMoon: Hey, I remember those days too.
ScootaChicken: it's a user in this chat....
I'M SUCH A NEWBIE
0,14XD
My god emangamer, you're right
I remember killing ourselves about 210 times, me and Saxy, during Babes in Toyland....
Funkballs:
12.-.

03I still don't get it.
but then SaxyPretender became just so damn saxy...

He lives up in northern Georgia...
/me huggles emangamer
/me is still dead
SlurryMoon: You've seen Altair lately?

otherwise it wouldn't be a secret :3
sillyfilly
inser an EQ if you want
SlurryMoon: you have billions of channels though >.>
03eh
03I could just try GarageBand 4
03does that have its own VSTs?
yfw this my theme song ;____;
/me hugs himself
Garageband and Logic don't support VSTs
03yeah but
they support AU , and VST/is with an adaptor
03it has to have them built in then?
they have some built in effects
03well
03the piano in your flac
03sounds different than any playback I've heard
03therefore I'm assuming it's something else
03a built in soundfont?
tumbleweed.gif
its the default built in piano i think
or one from boldt or the one in the orchestral pack
/me whistles a tune
Alright guys, it's 5 in the morning, I'm gonna go to work

ScootaChicken: doesnt mininum wage suck?
emangamer: It's not even a minimum wage job, I'm 14
It's just busking
So the 'wages' are really variable
I get payed under the table because my boss is too lazy to do the math for taxes and cut me a check
so I dont pay taxes...
POLICE!
but I did make 15 bucks in tips tonight
Freeze sucka!

I truthfully didn't think that was gonna work :$
this is a pretty poor PMV...
I love the muzik of it
How so emangamer?
the muzik is nice
Great muzik
but the scenes have NOTHING to do with the music...
they just threw clips together and called it a PVM
Ah
PMV*
Its an alright PMV, not the best, but not the worst
Love this song.
Makes me wanna play Sonic....
the best PMV EVER is cosmic love
^
oh my god cosmic love...
LunaTheBeloved: agreed.
/me shivers....
tahnkyou for helping us break otakon by providing us with singing material
emangamer, it was my favorite, it just got way too much overplay
the otakon is broken!!!
LunaTheBeloved: but that's because it's so good...
the music is amazing, the editing is amazing, everything about it is amazing
it just got old...
I can see how you would think that
My crippling depression has reemerged. Time for me to sleep before I make an ass of myself.
but I still think that it's good
/me hugs Tovler
I love the second half of this song in particular.
Tovler: I get that way when I'm tired too
I actually really like the ELO Mr.BlueSky OMV
*PMV
what is about this that is reminsicant of sonic? the guitar?
Tovler, I get that way from time to time.
LunaTheBeloved: link?
emangamer, this song was made for Sonic Adventure 2.
oh

:<
pony_949528: thats becuase all the regulars in the regular room moved back to the main room by now

anywaydrf
i was gonna say, the Yallano Accentor is apparently the best-sounding Piano VSTi
SUKASHI!
its legality is questionable because apparently the author pirated commercial samples to make it
*YANNLEO aCCENTOR
you got the harpoon
that thing hits like a truck
its the only one with much of a use
the SMG is maybe as good as the pulse rifle, and the striker glitches up and shoot blanks half the time
i use a jandful of VSTs regularly, and i know what most of them do
*handful
nice :P
wow, main chat is still going 300 mph
do you have that yallano thing?
me?
jun
i tend to find fri-sun main rooms are too busy for any serious conversation anyway
they're mostly "what are we watching" and "why are we watchign this?"
http://rapidshare.com/files/52866793/YANNLEO_ACCENTOR_X-1GP1.rar
i haven't tried it though
because it's slightly sizebloat
yup
they always demand sooo much more ponies
its surprising how much hate this fandom has for anything thats not ponies
>lazy
naw.
and main chat exploded XD
of course it did
what went on stream?
by the looks of things that creepy vid with the giant twilight sparkle outfit#
liveaction g4 XD
caled it
although now sumica seems to be planning to show g3.5 or some other gen than 4 tomorrow incase anyone shows up for ponies
My god I cant sleep

03how do I just open a MIDI
12you're using an Apple product.
do that
03I have to use something in order to hate it
03also uh
03it asks for tempo
03will it automatically hcnage?
03*change
12What just happened.
use 210
drag n drop midi onto the project after you finish creating it
12I have no FLACs
12only crappy MP3s
you only just noticed that i play flacs?
03sucks for you
`\(°.o)/´
anyway, you can rip your skrillex wubstep CD in flac
03uh
03it gets the tempo all wrong
03it's like really slow
you using G3 or G4?
034

does FLAC?
12huh?
Jaketehsnake you there ?
I am. am I needed in the game>
yep
which i just lost :(
it sucks then ~
03k, well I gotta play with the tempos some more, that end part is like 60bpm or such
kk
03so apparently it *doesn't* read the tempo from the MIDI
use the automation at the bottom
03I even set it to 210 when hitting new project
03and it reset to whatever

03what did you press to get rid of the dock?

so drf
03what's that on regular keyboards?
today
apple option d?
Drake and I were sitting at a table
03yeah
03I have no apple or option
i'm using a mac keyboard on my PC
03LOL
/me hides
in the food area
03eh I fixed it anyway
03and OK
I went back to KFC because the idiots there gave me a non-zinger fillet instead of a zinger one
so
these two chicks who were sitting at a table next to us
ZINGABURGER ZINGAZINGABURGER!
decided to hit on Drake while I was gone
apparently
he was asked whether I was his girlfriend or not
( ¬‿¬)
it was kinda creepy
04XD
04It was
04and you refused to look at them
Drake do you have any //comments?
Drake
04?
I was too busy staring at you
to look at them
04How touching
it's not that I refuse to look at people
04But damn you made that awkward
It's that I'm usually more interested in looking at OTHER people
that's my job you idiot
your job is to bee an as*hole
lol I suddenly remembered my bee signature
"Stop beeing stupid"
actually
Drake
as you so eloquently stated, you're supposed to be the masochist
And I'm supposed to be the sadist in our relationship
I can comply with that if you wish
;)
04No
04:I
you shouldn't have said that then
04I have enough fun being the masochist to Skylands
You do that
you just know you want more of my sadism though >|
And I'm not really that sadistic anyway
ask drf
I'm not really a sadist
That's Larxene or Hensh
or Xemnas even
...
those 2/3 in the same sentence?
no thanks actually
04Yeah, you're actually not that sadistic.
You're just an <censored>.

03OK LOL what did I miss
03what did Drake actually answer to those people
I don't even remember
ask him
04I'm just like
04"Ok cool now let's skedaddle"
yeah
04I'm not used to women hitting on me ;_;
we kinda left pretty quickly
03I know right
we were like
03if anybody tried to hit on me
03I'd be like
"Why the hell were they hitting on YOU?"
03naked on the bed in 10 seconds
/me runs
lmao
04XD
the girl who tried to hit on Drake
04was a skank
was a sl*t anyway
03that sounds hot
03did you take any pictures?
/me runs
nah, not descriptive enough
04XD
lmao
lol
as I told Drake
on the wall of one of my school's changerooms
it's like
"If sl*ts could fly, NSG would be an airport"
NSG is my school
03LOL what
03ooh
04We had some deep, introspective conversations afterwards.
03a spam email entitled "cute & horny"
03that sounds legit
04Mostly involving questions like "Why the hell would anyone hit on US?"
03and you had a serious discussion about how ugly you both are?
/me hides
04Pretty much
/me hides
lmao
Anyway
and then some oblivion
or I might go turn on the PS2
and play some KH2 or Jedi Starfighter
or ROTS
03I read that as RIOTS
04k
04cya NS
might go with starfighter as I've been playing a crapload of hack n slash games
04Starfighter <3
yah
I still want Assassin's Creed on Steam though
either that or pirate it
03how much is it?
dunno
something like $20, it's pretty expensive
also
03that's cheap for a game
is it?
Well
I got oblivion GOTY for $30
but yeah, what is your paypal account? I'll send you something for funding the hetzner server

03I doubt logic would run on a VM, eh?
I finished that one yesterday
it was quite easy
04I loved that mission

04Ion Cannon <3
I hate Sabaoth fighters though
yeah the Ion Cannon was <3

Meanwhile: me.
Score.
I don't have any IRL friends who are also bronies
Because while it's physically possible for me to get a train back to the county, it means being in a city in the wee hours of the morning with no way back to my house.
But a sofa would be more comfy.
I'm not sure how viable that would be
Mostly due to my parents
As we have established,.
Well you know, if all else fails, maybe someone else at the venue will have floor space.

Don't you fuck this up for me! I need my cupcake money!
I think the new Derpy voice would have to be used since the episode would already be sent to the Hub after the change in The Last Roundup

Derpy's new voice is pretty cute

it is
I swear, mane chat is like if 4chan teamed up with the KKK.

So much hate.
so many exits
ScootaChicken: same here man, same here.
Want the rage reaction to be posted.
and the fact that it IS censorship.
RAWRity: it IS
ScootaChicken the voice i can deal with, hell it was a legetimate mistake
Guys, why dont we go episode protocol?
brb, getting coffee
but the name....
I don't mind the voice, I mean, her previous voice WAS better, but the changing of the eyes and exclusion of the name bugs me
mute main chat and open mane 6

ouch, fair enough, ill head to the shops for now then, up for some later?
Guys, if they played Pinkie Quest right before ep next week and had mane chat open... we might throttle the network
Oh god
The unrelenting toot spam
The mane chat will be closed though
I'm still going to be in chat but could someone say when the movie starts please?
I'll ping you
Meanwhile: movie's starting.
Meanwhile: it starts at 2 like always
just be back by then
7pm, Meanwhile
Is when it starts
Meanwhile: *7pm you silly Brit
Yeah but I'm watching MiB the series, I can trust myself to do things like "check the time"
can't*
alright, Here's our story for anybody who comes in after now and asks about a new episode: We tell them we were watching it live, and we got to a scene where Derpy was talking again, and was giving a Muffin to Dinky, when suddenl the feed from The Hub cutout because of "technical difficulties" but we suspect it was Hasbro trying to cover their asses.
That's a stupid idea.
^
Meanwhile: stupid idea for stupid people
How about we tell them they missed the ep?
How about we tell them there was no new ep today.
yeah, just missed the ep is amusing enoguh
Or we can be honest
Meanwhile: THATS a stupid idea
I'm with RAWRity, trolling unobservant people sounds amusing
That's just mean.
adding too much too it makes it unbelievable
Meanwhile: it's also harmless and hilarious.
Meanwhile thats why its trolling
Watch this
Trolling is against the rules.
So who remembers the Vocaroo spam last night?
i do
Alright, how about this: We tell them Vinyl Scratch spoke, and was actually a stallion.
Trolling is STILL against the rules.
Or we tell them that Luna got a song
Meanwhile: Since when have you been opposed to trolling.
lol
RAWRity: Yes.
You got ignored
ScootaChicken I am many things, but I am not a troll.
Do not troll
Intentionally irritating other users for the sole purpose of eliciting an angry response is not permitted.
damn you copy paste!
Meanwhile: that's not what emangamer says...
alright, that's what we're telling anypony who comes in asking if they missed the new episode. Luna got a song, and Vinyl spoke.
emangamer is a creepy fuckwit.
I couldn't care less what he says.
so isnt all our shipping trolling?
Now that's just mean.
I'm pretty sure generating this is trolling http://vocaroo.com/i/s0uAtkd3sC8P
Mean, but true.
RAWRity: Trixie came back and fell in love with a bg named
"Thanks for making feel like a retard for not knowing there was a new episode, RAWRity."
Meanwhile:
UnFoundBug: My goal with this is not to ellicit an ANGRY response. It's to amuse myself.
true, but that amusement is based on the negative emotions of another
be it anger or sadness
My hero, UnFoundBug
I think it's called Schadenfreude
UnFoundBug: no, it's based on the positive reactions of my fellow conspirators.
ScootaChicken that is correct, there is no english word, but there is a german on

Frankly, I've never actually seen your jailbait-ness.
Hmmm.... Meanwhile x Trixie x ScootaChicken threesome?
If you want.
RAWRity: He isn't legal.
Meanwhile: and that's what makes it so naughty
And Trixie's a scuzzball.
I'm writing a RAWRity x Meanwhile fic at the moment though.
DAfuq
also, in Mexico he's legal.
This isn't Mexico
and Germany
Meanwhile: it could be.
Fack everything.
And Japan, and the Vatican
and Amsterdam
And Denmark.
the Vatican has an unbelievably low age of consent
But I can't remember what it is
That isn't even surprising.
That's so unsurprising.
Dohoho pedo priest jokes.
what Meanwhile said
Briefly bring the stream back up, it's the "RD is an extra douchey douche" one.
Noooo.
Pinkie's right. Twilight is a silly filly.
RD is best pony
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
RD is worst mane 6.
[18:38]	Scoota-Chicken	Rainbow Dash is overrated pony.
I disagree with people who say Rainbow Dash is being so terrible in this episode.
imposter has a point
She's not being terrible, just a braggart.
She's saving people's lives. So what if she acts like she's hot shit?
She is hot shit.
I'd do her.
I mean, um er
I dislike RD some of the time for the same reason I hate Trixie, arrogance.
I'd rather have a jerky super hero save my life, than have all these super humble people stare as I fall to my death.
ScootaChicken: you want me to request your imposter to nick change?
Meanwhile: I find it funny that you hate arrogance.
RAWRity: Yeah yeah har de har har
So much animosity
Screw that. If I want to pick a pizza with only chili and dough, let me do it, damn iy.
offensive display of superiority or self-importance; overbearing pride. I wouldn't say that describes me.
Um...
kenne, RX-78-3-SweetieBot, UnFoundBug well the servers are down
fun
lolwut
yeah
my issue with this ep is that the REST of the Mane 6 come off as bigger assholes in this.
I can't connect to the servers, but I'm online just fine
so it's NOT my net
I asked him ScootaChicken. he feels pretty bad
Yeah yeah RAWRity "Why don't they just talk to her" Probably because she wouldn't listen anyway, plus that was probably more fun.
[13:41:58] <Scoota-Chicken> Uhm, sure. I didn't eman to hurt someone's feelings.. :U Just came to mind.
I wanna go say something nice to him
Meanwhile: good friends right there, assuming the worst of you and not trying to talk to you like human bei- er, pony being
And possibly ship him with otakon.
no
no friggin shipping
ScootaChicken x Scoota-Chicken = OTP
do I have to get the audio clip again?
gosh darnit RAWRity
RAWRity: Would you REALLY think Rainbow Dash, while pumped up on being the big hero, would at all care what anyone says?
otakon: no need, I have it saved
ScootaChicken: ofc you do
Meanwhile: I would at least give her the benefit of the doubt and TRY
I'd try the regular approach before becoming Darkwing Duck
RAWRity: Clearly they're better friends because they already know how she'd react.
Besides, Mare-Do-Well is best hero.
kenne, UnFoundBug, RX-78-3-SweetieBot well from the looks of things all of EA's servers are stressed atm, thus why I can't connect atm
ScootaChicken: he didnt /nick he refreshed the chat so i dont know. I think it may or may not be PinkieShy but just a guess. I would ask around the mane chat
also the fact that they brag and boast about their OWN accomplishments, just to make Dash feel bad.
too bad for being a multi BILLION dollar company that overchargers for stuff they don't update their SERVERS
otakon: they're busy geting the ME3 DLC ready
RAWRity: well, you THINK they would TELL US they are shutting them down or something
a HiE clopfic no less
in here?
Dash has absolutely NO internal dialogue.
she's a ALICORN
ScootaChicken: whats their name?
RARWRity: twiandme
...and how do you know the title of a clopfic.
RAWRity: reasons.
nvm, I just reconnected, but I've been getting randomly dc'd from the Servers all morning
dat neck cracking
hello? Is this thing on?
/me taps his computer screen
No.
ofc not.....
"Jennifer"
otakon x Jenni-
Wait no
lol
I wouldn't do that to her
XD
ScootaChicken: don't you remember Ash's pet name for you?
otakon x otakon17
.......
otakon: he has lots of pet names for me
Hype: I'm otakon17
brb, need coffee
Y'know, I saw a certain 'otakon17' in #brony earlier
otakon, what were you doing in that terrible place
Nothing wrong with loving yourself, otakon
You're far too young and innocent for it
ScootaChicken: yeah, i'm just hooked in there I never really talk in there
ScootaChicken: I'm TWICE YOUR AGE!
ScootaChicken: and how do YOU know I'm in there?
otakon: Almost twice.
ScootaChicken: you're 14 correct?
otakon: I saw 'otakon17 has joined #brony'
otakon: yesh
oh THAT'S that beeping
don't ping otakon17
I can hear it on my iPod
brb need COFFEE
Alright, EMN starts at 8:00 GMT, correct?
otakon17 otakon
otakon17 otakon .
:P
Afternoon Regulars room
Hai ^_^
afternoon our beloved luna
ScootaChicken: actually, it starts next
hiya LunaTheBeloved
damn, I think I'll play some Skyrim later
mmm parent funded pizza is best pizza
Tori Spelling?
Who?
I remember the name, but I don't know from where
I think she's playing Candance
it's WREK!
is the lottery today?
UnFoundBug: agreed on that
Tori Spelling has done Scary Movie 2 and Saved by the Bell, amongst other things.
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
Habbadewhatnow

Stop that.
Movie night.
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
otakon: no, she's hosting the Finale.
To the moooooooon
Meanwhile?
dat kick
Thankyou Hype.
Meanwhile
Ohai Meanwhile
Stop pinging me!
Allo LTB.
RAWRity: but why her?
dat kick
Fffff
Stop pinging Meanwhile!
Okay Meanwhile
Allo LunaTheBeloved.
otakon: Maybe she wanted to do it? maybe she owed a favor to somebody at Hasbro? maybe she's secretly a Pegasister.
Yeah, I'll stop pinging Meanwhile
How you Meanwhile?
yippie kay yay, motherfucker?
Alright, I'm gonna settle down with a book while this plays, I shall return for the lottery
Yippie Kay Hay Motherbucker
Not bad, nothing of particular note's happened today. How 'bout you?
Doing just fine thanks, pretty tired...
lol, ScootaChicken
I missed the beginning last night
Alright, I'm gonna head off for a bit, hopefully be back in about 30 minutes or so
Bye all ^_^
/me hugs ScootaChicken
Bye then :)
bye ScootaChicken take it easy!
bye ScootaChicken, hope you don't miss the explosions!
RAWRity: not the explosions!
Michael Bay explosions!
BOOM
no, these aren't Michael Bay explosions.
I know....
These explosions are from before Michael Bay even dreamed of ruining cinema
LunaTheBeloved: nothing in this movie is made of Baynium, so no worries about that.
well said RAWRity
let us discuss our dislike of Bay shall we?
Heheh
like how he's going to mutilate the TMNT
but his new TV show might be good
My real problem with Bay is taht he's been so succesful, other movies are now copying him.
Micheal Bay Blows S*** Up?
RAWRity: dear God, help us all.
nope, a reboot of RobotWars / Battlebots
UnFoundBug: actually, that might not be too bad
i know right
UnFoundBug: Id be okay with that.
I liked Robot Wars as a kid.
and with the technology that's around to day...it could be pretty kick ass
I was like oh god no one should let him on TV, then i was like i liked robot wars, he does impressive looking things
I liked Robotwars/Battlebots it was neat
RAWRity you ever seen it live
OH did you see that one bot?
Razer?
it was just made, what was it called again....
Chaos 2
HypnoDisk?
no, it has 5 legs
can morph into a ball
eww walker bots
Well guys...I'm gonna go watch some Community.....Ping if SlurryMoon gets here please
ooh that omniball thing?
LunaTheBeloved: okay dear, take care.
otakon: the Super Cycle from Young Justice?
UnFoundBug: YES! I think that thing has combat potential
as a targert
just armor it
and add a gun
razer would eat that thing for breakfast
it's NOT ARMORED, without armor "Razer" would be a glorified RC car.
Razer is the single most powerful robot ever made, and has only been beaten due to mechanical failue, and a cheat
razer takes on the house robot and wins ffs
UnFoundBug: what was teh cheat?
Tornado
added a 1-foot box around the rim
so big it could no longer fit in the pit

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

god, did they HAVE to kill him?
Yes.
ofc you would say that RX-78-3-SweetieBot
And now they have to kill you. With moldy cereal.
NOT THE MOLDY CEREAL!
So EA accidentally the servers eh?
http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
yeah, from the looks of things the Servers are getting overloaded
take that test, then compare the results to this: http://sage.bloowuff.com/mlp/personality_chart.jpg
oh hello regulars
I'm apparently Cheerilee
also, the fac that the ponies can IDENTIFY with actual personality types is a good indication on how well they're fleshed out as characters if you ask me.
hiya Bjornfot
sup pingas
why am I a pinga?
enope
ooh I am Celestia
I got celestia, although the N is very weak, so one question answered differently would give me big mac instead
Lol
I got Luna :3
14Saturday evening
14and I'm in my pajama
14:D
lol
I would be a great ruler. First things first, everyone gets robot bodies. Think GITS for the most part.
I assume that over 50% is one thign and under 50% is another?
no RX-78-3-SweetieBot I don't want a robot body
I like being flesh and blood thank you
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 5Shelgon.
and is anyone else getting lag?
Thats fine, people can opt out of it if they want.
unlike THE ENDING OF MASS EFFECT 3!
But you have to want out. If you cant decide wether you want the robot body or not, you get it anyway.
argh, curse you lag, curse you to the hanging upside down hell!
and then it LAGGED AGAIN!
Next step is removing alot of safety regulations so idiots will start getting themselves killed more often.
but they'll have ROBOT BODIES
And you think they still wont find ways to kill themselves?
won't it take a bit more to kill them then it would an average human?
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 3Mantyke.
People can be really REALLY stupid. and the crazy amount of safety regulations we have are the only reason they have not removed themselves fromt eh genepool
10Viri, Saturday afternoon and I'm in my pajamas :P
good point
14:D
ever hear of the Darwin Awards?
Although you ahve a point. I think Ill save the robot bodies for after the idiots kill themselves
10I changed into them as soon as I got home
yes
10It's so colddd
14you had a very intense week too? xD
14same
good stuff
14I had 6 tests in 3 days
argh, curse you lag
but the darwin awards are only for absolutely exceptional idiocy
14I spent all the week studying. So sorry if I wasn't in chan ^^;
/me had 4 tests today
6Korrrraaaaaaaaa
oo
Korraa when?!
:O
6now lol.
:O
6today is the premier
14o.o
6well, now for western coast
wow.
I thought it was like
in May
xD
yeah
About time it aired ;-;
but anyway, robot bodies? really? that would take some getting used to.
14Ray :3
02:3
6noooooooo commercials
That realy depends on how human they are.
Going out now
Cyall
with a very human-like one, the only main differences would be no more needing to eat or remove waste, although power will need to be recharged still, and could be set up to basically be part of a sleep cycle, to help keep things familiar
6wait
6wait
6wait
6nick when the hell did you get here
6you've been gone for like ages
6...
6fml i've only been trying to get ahold of him for 3 weeks.
Although having less humanoid things would be fine for those that want them.
hey otakon / RX-78-3-SweetieBot you guys up for some ME3?
I did that humanmetrics test, got Trixie. :3
I wonder how many people would want to be a robot horse/pony....
UnFoundBug: not atm I think, maybe in a bit
14don't worry
fair enoguh
14I'm still here! :D
/me runs
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: well, if I could grab things with my hooves I wouldn't mind. I would miss bacon though.....
I wouldnt be surprised if it becomes possible to make synthetic taste buds.
so you could eat and taste things, you just dont have to
You guys usually play ME3?
yeah, but then it boils down to artificially recreating the 5 senses inorgainically
yeah Bjornfot on 360
I stopped playing multiplayer when I finished the game lawl
we usually play a couple of Silvers every other day or so
Bjornfot: it's fun unlocking new stuff, plus we laugh our asses off.
otakon we really should start moving to gold, after we get kenne to behaev
I wonder what having reverse joint legs as a robot would be like....
UnFoundBug: that might take weeks
thing is we know you, me and RX-78-3-SweetieBot can all run gold
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: off balance, since your brain isn't used to balancing like that
I'm gonna continue ditching ME3 until they release the free extra ending and multiplayer dlc
UnFoundBug: yeah, but it's damn hard!
Bjornfot: the multplayer DLC is out already
oh, really?
Bjornfot: you'll be waiting until SUmmer for teh Ending, and the MP DLC JUST came out, new characters/maps and weapons.
yes
still, ending
and it's FREE
BOTH are free
you just have to unlock the characters/weapons through buying reinforcement packs
dat FAMAS
they have what? HPK45?
Does it sound like I'm ordering a fuckin' pizza?
lol I love that line
That's me announcing my return, by the way.
dont remember, havent brushed up on my french guns in a while
Fun fact, I bought a pizza
Fun fact: You are blind roughly 40 minutes each day.
Also, otakon would be a robotic oompah loompah, and his work name would be Mr. Chewy McFlubster
brb
no it wouldn't
It's so nice outside...
Everyone should totally start calling oatkon Chewy Mcflubster
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
You mean, Shippy McShipMe
Chewship Mcshipster
Sir Shipsalot
Ships McLargeBeard
Poor otakon...
McShiptacular
I'm being shipped again aren't I?
MC ShipTacula*
actualy you arent
Hey LunaTheBeloved ^_^
Yes
nope
we are just deciding your new name
dat crotch shot
ouch, worst way to die
okay, brb gotta wake someone up
Oompahkon of the Northern Shipping Lanes
And now for an absolutely epic scene
John McClane you boss.
I want to be an oompa loompa
who the crap is tori spelling?
lol, i'm brony and i know it
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: stop taht
oooo, comedy central has Hot Fuzz on right now
also, THIS for all of those who play ME3 MP
I WILL STOP NUTHINK
http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#53RAPIR@5@
oh wow

nice huh?
finally
it's a Class Creator
it's still rough, but it works pretty good.

oh fu
i gave my teacher the wrong text D:

14hi AE :D
13ohai :3
14how are you?
lol, bronze to warm up.. everyone here is lvl 20
13I be good thanks :3 You?
so? a warm up is good
lets you get into the "zone"
14same. I'm back online after some days I've been away
14school was getting pretty intense xP and I was risking to fail the year
Ladies
I was playing a H/Sentinel lvl 20 and went down TWICE because I was rusty in how they play
yes
hmmmm
6OH MY GOD I'M SO BORED.
UM
UM
WANNA PLAY TF2?
6surrrre
and skype? :D
I cant decide how I would want to build geth engie.
UnFoundBug: you click the little circles to affect the rank of the weapon on your loadout
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: I'm gonna go full on defensive turret with Chain Overloads all the way
the only thing that'll give him grief will be armor
by defensive you mean the sheild restoring all the way?
yeah
just pop it next to me and take a nice defensive position
I might go for a full offensive one then to keep from role overlap
AE TUNE IN
it would be a good idea,
but ofc, we have to GET them frist
first
otakon: get what first?
the Geth Engineer class
man full offensive justicar is badass
13LINK
03ugggh so groggy
14hi drf
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
lateish
LOL, this guy REALLY doesnt like being beaten by a "support class"
who? what are you doing?
bronze warmup
UnFoundBug: I would say, it's possible
this guys a whiny bitch cause hes losing
ooh apparently im also a haz
hax*
use Biotic Sphere as a "trap"
lol, just reaving everything
how can you LOSE at a co-op game?
that's a LOT of detonators
wait, how does that even work?
can you set off C4 just by dropping it with the detonators in it?
no
c4 is incredibly stable
yeah, that's why they like it
unless the detonator is triggered
could it be a shock detonator?
you can use it as cooking fuel
I've heard
the only thing that sets of c4 is another explosion
hence why its always a secondary explosion
ah
man, this movie is classic
This chat is really empty
yeah, but mane is still a little.......random atm
I got distracted and missed like half the movie. That'd annoy me if I hadn't seen it yesterday.
o Meanwhile, u so crazy
In my defense, tea was involved.
hi DRF
Did your tablet die
?
:D
03nope
03I let the battery die
03then plugged it in
03and it booted into WebOS
03and then asked me to update WebOS so apparently it *did* get corrupted a bit XD
14wait a minute
14drf has a tablet?
14o.O
/me looks at a meteor in the sky
oo

What a reatrd.
03yes I do
03it's an HP TouchZPad
03-Z
03paid $150 for a 32GB
03beat that Apple
Beat that Kindle fire & Nook
:D
Dat spelling
oh lol
03XD
dat irony
03at least Kindle Fire runs Android natively
03but yeah, I'm still stuck with a useless moboot loader
/me mops ScootaChicken
03hm, I think I can just remove that entirely and start over
oh
/me is a lady
I saw somebody with a Kindle fire with ICS/Cygen9
And it was pretty fast/worked welL :V
It's a trap.
03how much are those again?
200
03ah
(350 here, cry.)
03want me to relay you one? :P
I mean, it is way better than the Nook tablet (in terms of modding)
But until it: 1. Has ICS HW Accel support and 2. A way to use a USB stick for extra storage
I'll wait
14hey, at least you can buy the Kindle Fire
I will be getting one in July/Summer anyways
14it's not even relased here
I know :<
Viri
PIRATE IT!
14xDD
it's definitely a trap.
/me dusts ScootaChicken.
14oh, and a pirate hat :DD
03wait, what OS does Nook run?
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3os0e5/#by=ad

man justicar is the new vanguard looking at these scores
the legend of Keen?
:P
Adept has always been OP, but Justicar takes it to a whole new level.
7The show looks quite impressive not on a computer. o3o
Get the hell of me Maidwhile.
7Except more animation. :U
*off
Wow that typo was embarassing.
/me dusts Leg_of_LTB.
"Not on a computer"
I'd prefer watching it on a computer
there is a vanguard on this team
Oh sorry busy ATM Maidwhile
You can skip commercials
Sit closer
:D
the score looks like i am the vanguard
Oh ok, didn't mean to drag you away LunaTheBeloved.
7Well, true.
14I don't watch tv since...4 years now?
14it's total garbage here :(
7But it looks a lot better on a TV. X3
7So there's that.
03that's because your rips suck
/me runs
03if you get proper HD rips, then computer watching FTW
Yeah
Plus, Super HD PC Screens

It's alright
INB4 Using your iPad 3 as a real entertainment centre
:D
Hi HD
HD x2 screens?
/me hugs Maidwhile
03yeah
03two 1080p's
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved back.
03I use one for my Xbox regularly
See, the real way to watch HD video on a PC
Is to like, get a monitor that is 1920x1200
（╯°□°）╯ ɐıƃn⅂ʃɐʇǝWɹǝdʎH

Allo Jake.
Ello
How are you doing Meanwhile? And you UnFoundBug?
im doing fine, just annoyed at n00bs on me3
Not bad I 'spose, nothing to do here.jpeg
bad boy bad boy what you going to do?
7Anywhoo, DRF: remember what i mentioned about berating others?
Ode To Joy ensues
03yeah, what about it?
Maid I know that feel. Maybe we could get a game going afterthis
dat armor
dat money
Batarian sentinel is best armour.
Blades, blades everywhere.
Maidwhile: eh, not really. They have lower DR and health/shields than Krogans
Wouldn't know
Maidwhile: but they DO have one of the best crowd control skills in the game
I shoot people, I don't do statistics.
13also I need food
13too lazy to get food
Maidwhile: it's as much stats as it is skill
7I don't get the sort of 'rips' you do. YouTube quality.
If you have skill, you don't need stats.
03that's why :P
7It's not as if I need those. :U
I could pour over the ins and outs of shields, manueverability, reload time to shooting ratio and so forth, or I could just grab a gun and kick ass.
03well I'm just saying
;-;
7Unlike your fancy stuff.
But fullscreen sucks
03watching them on a PC is fine if you have legitimate rips
And so far, so good.
You can't see the time!
/me hides
03In fact, I just record TV straight to my computer and play it back
maid, or you can do both
o-O
03same quality.
03XD
and kick some serious ass
03and LOL HML
Why would I want to do that? Stats are boring.
03I have two monitors, remember?
I do the second. Kicking ass is more fun
Yeah
I already melee primes to death, why would I want to dull it down.
132 screens 1 drf
/me runs
03hm darn, I need to get my hair cut, but this place closes in an hour
03and I don't even know if they do walk-ins
03I should prolly call them
03I mean it doesn't have to be *today*
03but I'm bored
how is it dulling it down? numbers give whole new ways to kill
like bubbles + reave = many explosions
ofc
or a min/maxed vanguard is so good it literally breaks the game
Watch Korra with us :D
/me hide
UnFoundBug: when PLAYED right and it doesn't glitch
Or
they STILL haven't fixed that glitch
Record it when it comes on in your timezone
:p
13Why is Korra suddenly popular
Because Avatar fans and I dunno
Vanguard, kill thief extraordinare.
its rather annoying, its nice trippling the score of everyone else
Maybe because it might be the only decent Nick show?
:P
Maidwhile you get as many points as you deserve from assists
03you mean the only decent NEW Nick show?
03:P
0390s Nickelodeon or GTFO.
deal more damage get more points
14my aknowledge of things is so limited that sometimes I think that you are all hipsters because you always talk about stuff that I don't know
/me runs
The only thing game breaking about Vanguards is the ability to travel.
13I just don't watch TV these days :D
Yeah
Nick != Nickelodeon
03I hardly do either, it's usually when I'm at home and bored
otakon you ready to play ME3 yet?
03I'll just see what's on
and thier infinite stun lock on all but the supers?
03usually end up watching Pawn Stars or Family Guy :
03*:
06<Angel_Umbreon> I just don't watch TV these days :D
03*:P
06this
and their crazy AoE damage capacity
14I don't watch it at all, since a few years now
I don't really Vanguard, so I don't know about that.
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: can it wait after the lottery?
14too much trash :/
fine
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: I'm sorry, I like watching the lottery is all and I don't want to miss it
7Don't watch too much--that I agree with.
13THE INTERNET IS MY TV ;3
I forgot all about it :3
I play the role of "He who is useful and yet not overbearing" as opposed to "He who must charge ALL the enemies"
14same xD
lol
03eh
03I made an appointment for Monday
CHARGE EVERYTHING FOREVER
I play the role of "There is a guy behind you, I'll pick you up"
what does vullaby evolve into again?
super trivia :D
7Mandibuzz.
Seriously. I've no respect for the Vanguard class. It's like huntrads in wow. Press one button, score everything.
13Mand- yeah
okay thanks
06+1bacon
7Okay. O.o
Huntards* pardon my letter slip.
every class is like that
you get at most 3 abilities
Maidwhile: still takes skill to play it well in Gold
Every class doesn't gave charge
and alot of them have one of those as basically useless
have*
:D
welcome back to the good side
how does it feel?
Maidwhile: every class has one skill you WILL spam, Vanguards happen to have a good spam class that launches them like a cannonball
13Still as delicious as I remember it <3
;-;
13I wanted to buy a footlong but I couldn't afford the extra £2
14same HML
03LOL what
mmk, I'm back from Cabin in the Woods.
03I usually always get footlongs on flatbread
hell even infiltrators end up spamming their alt skill (not cloak) simply to reload faster when your really gunning it
Maidwhile: IKR
Vanguards as such douch-
Wait a minute...
Tovler: how was it?
You can try and spin it so that playing Vanguard SOMEHOW takes skill to press charge and unload at close range with a shotgun, but you can't. Charge makes you invulnerable, can take you straight to the weakest enemy on the field, and move you around the area and plaid speed.
charge does NOT make you invulnerable
Actually I'm fairly sure it does.
the single most game breaking game comes from that fact
it doesnt
if you go down while charging you completely break
Maidwhile: It doesn't, it brings your shields up to full but that's all
Maidwhile: if it did you wouldn't die mid charge
Didn't really like the cast all that much in the movie… I'm still mulling it over.
ScootaChicken: and it doesnt even bring your shields up until you get to your destination
Damn, my lack of experience with the class has invalidated my entire point. Oh wait, no it hasn't.
Maidwhile: also, it doesn't work 100 percent of the time, I've charged Guardians and they have had NO reaction to it and melee me OUT of the charge animation
But yeah, my main vanguard tactic is to Leeroy Jenkins in, melee shotgun and Nova people and get killed and hope people revive me.
Fact is, it's the easiest class in the game and there's nothing you can do about it.
It's awesome.
dont forget you have a delay as you exit the warp where the heavier enemies can easily stun lock you
You play the easy way for fast points.
o-o
That's fair enough
vanguards are good against trash, but pretty poor against anything bigger
bye Karl
But don't try and say you aren't.
which he'll be using tomorrow
Also, what the name of the trope where inspirational hope music starts playing and then SUPRISE! death. As seen in Deep Blue Sea.
14I did it, I regret it, but worth it
14x3
Tovler: not sure
one centered around chandelure
Vanguards can knock back Atlases.
yeah, considering everything large other than geth can pull you out of charge into insta death makes vanguard ssuicide against them
Tovler: do all of the main characters die?
Bjornfot thats been nerfed massivly
chandelure, garchomp, ferrothorn, gyarados, ninetales, and something else
yyyyye-nope.
Yeah, Vanguards are an unbelievably douchey class
which is probably why I use them
03(that MIDI)
03so as I suspected, it uses its own rendering engine
oh
i think hitmontop is in it as well
And yet you still lose to groups of cannibals
7Mmm'kay.
basically
chandelure
and banshees with insta kills
and 5 guys to destroy chandelure's threats
03now, it gave me a few choices about which instrument set to use
and primes and hutners with stunlock
03was yours just at the default?
and pyros with their flamethrowers
They ganged up on me and I had no powers, I got gang raped
ninetale's only real job is to get in there and remove rain once their rain inducer is gone
7Yes?
You must suck hard if you lose to pyros.
Oh god I hate pyros
and the other instakill enemies
I'm really glad I saw Cabin in the Woods though.
Charging pyros is a terrible idea
7Just sun-inducer, eh? XD
7Ah, well.
pyros can down you in a second of fire.
other than on bronze
I wouldn't know, they usually die before they reach me.
Or they reach me and find out what armoured knuckles taste of.
I usually play a very close range oriented Vanguard though
So I tend to get killed a lot.
dohoho.
There's no awesome charismatic protagonist but it's definitely up there with the Evil Dead series especially towards the end.
you can play a close range vangaurd without dieing alot....
Yes, but you must remember that I'm a massive noob.
^
Ah
Seriously, ME3 was the first game I played in like half a year
ScootaChicken lost to Marauder Shields.
So you are the kenne of the PC group?
Maidwhile: three times, actually.
I got the best ending though.
You mean the one that's exactly like the other ones?
No, the one where Marauder Shields kills me and protects me from Star Child
Sounds legit,.
Why'm I still wearing this?
nice ScootaChicken
Better.
I cant wait to see what convoluted BS Bioware comes up with to try and explain the endings in the ending dlc
Fun fact, that look of terror is real
inb4 they accept fan theory and its indoctrination
They let Alan Rickman go a second earlier than they should have
I like the indoctrination theory, it makes better sense.
UnFoundBug: I doubt it BioWare will do it.
This ending DLC will not end well.
almost certainly
As it stands though, they said they aren't changing the ending but are going to release epilogue type stuff didn't they?
yeah
Yeah, which is pointless
Pointles my ass
its supposed to "explain" the endings
given that everyone's gripe with the endings was... well that they're shit.
ScootaChicken and they took a massive dump on the 100+ hours i sunk into that characther
I don't care about magic space lasers, I just want to know what happened in the future from a nearer point than grandpa and his stupid grandson.
and reduced it into a red/green/blue chocie
UnFoundBug: that's a problem everyone has
Basically the main problems are: Choices didn't matter, throws away established lore, Plot holes galore, EMS means jack shit
yeah, all those choices you made? didnt matter. Why were the reapers there? So nobody makes reapers, and to make more reapers.
also star child out of nowhere
To be honest I was expecting the ending would be like the Suicide Mission in ME2, just with fleets assigned to different duties instead of characters
And that would have been great
an actuall god damn fight with all the people i recruited would of been awesome
i had SO much recruited
Ikr.
would of been nice to actually see a geth+quarian fleet take down a reaper
yeah, maybe have those final battles on earth change and have different forces for you depending on what you were able to gather and recruit
you know, give me some value to saving both of them
I'm very disappointed in myself during my run of ME2 though, now that I know what screwed over my Geth Quarian alliance.
03o.o
or a wave of rachnii to clear up some of the mobs on earth
Also, outside of the ending. That fight where you use a laser designator on a reaper. IT HAS A FUCKING LASER AND IT CANT HIT A PERSON RUNNING BAKC AND FORWARD ON A TINY LEDGE
EMS meant jack shit in the end, you got practically no visual representation of it and it basically meant nothing to the ending
RX-78-3-SweetieBot its a ship-ship weapon, not a antipersonel weapon
but it should of just removed the entire area and bombed it from any distance
The last level as a whole kind of sucked, it wasn't nearly as epic as it should have been.
YOU WERE ON A TINY ASS LEDGE
The whole Geth Quarian thing made me immensely depressed.
why?
Meanwhile did you not have a save with legion and tali alive?
/me randomly laughs thinking of Cabin in the Woods.
Because I was aiming for diplomacy, unaware that I'd invalidated it in ME2.
BNC server b0rked
:D
Not mine, so I get to laugh
I like the Mass Effect 3 ending because hating it is so mainstream.
03LOL
Meanwhile: it's possible, but you have to save Koris
otakon you have to save him eitehr way
Kammerjunk does your hipsterness know no bounds?
otakon: Apparently giving Raan the data in ME2 makes it impossible.
:P
Silly question.
03I need to yell at Hetzner's support
Meanwhile: oh, that. Yeah, you have to save Tali from Exile and NOT give Raan the data
03they haven't written back in like two days now
you need 3 votes of support to stop the quarians attacking the geth, yours, koris and tali
Email them again
and the geth will only succeed if legion is alive
Before I really knew what I'd pressed, the Quarians got blown to smithereens and Tali jumped off a cliff.
03yeah
ScootaChicken: given man, I was REALLY looking forward to Krogan riding Rachni into battle
I liked Tali. A lot.
Meanwhile: ouch
otakon: IKR
That was fucking brutal.
Tali is awesome.
that sucks man, it really does
Meanwhile i know, she was my love interest in the run where she commited
Meanwhile, more than Trixie?
i was like, wtf, the paragon choice doesnt even save her
I honest to god spent ten minutes trying to rationalise that it was a war and people die.
it just makes you NEARLY save her
I still need to see the scene where Tali kills herself.
BUT IT WAS FUCKING TALI GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.
But guys, the endings are good because THEY ARE SO ARTSYYY
lol
/me slaps ScootaChicken
/me puts on aviators and sniffs
10drf
"artistic integrety"
10give me a hint on Draw Something
10because the cheat doesn't have any choices o.o
Krakass: That's a silly thing to ask.
OOOOh yeeees! Look at all the symbolliiiiissssmmmm
Seriously. Not a lot makes me give a fuck about anything. But I LIKED Tali.
My god it's so beauuutiiffful

/me wallops ScootaChicken with a cinderblock.
03the word is eyepatch
03derp
bc I saw that on YT, and it is crushing
10bah
Yeah, I saw that too
Wrex's betrayal?
Meanwhile: Tali committed suicide in my (non imported) save file, and it was really painful
That's not a renegade choice
dear LORD I could never bring myself to do it
oh god, killing Wrex
That's a dickhead/psychopath choice
That's one douchey choice
Meanwhile: well, Shepard betrayal ON Wrex
I could never do anything against Wrex, Mordin, or Legion
man mordins death was painful as well
I lost Mordin on my first runtrhough ME2 for reasons unknown.
Renegade Shep gets MORE evil(how?) in this game.
another paragon of NOT saving someone
Mordin went out like a boss.
Seeing Shepard gun down Mordin in one of the outcomes was really heartbreaking
Woah woah what?
The only one who died on my run was Jack, and I hate Jack anyway.
Who?
Meanwhile: he has a low survive score, he's the most likely to die if you leave him to hold the line. THat's why it's good to bring him with you on the final boss or send him with the crew back tot he ship
Even though you can save Mordin, I think it's better to let him sacrifice himself, given that the scene is both awesome and hearbreaking
Kammerjunk jack becomes a phantom if you dont rescue her
Kammerjunk: Jacob
My only real loss was a Salarian Spectre
Right, that's his face.
I haven't played ME2 for a while.
i had to kill her myself cause i didnt think the school was actually times
Kirrahe's death made me weep.
I LOVED KIRRAHE.
Kirrahe died for you?
HE HELD THE GODDAMN LINE ;___;
I had him holding the line in ME3.
ScootaChicken: But did he hold it as well as Marauder Shields?
Kammerjunk: He held it better.
D:
otakon: I forget that's even an option.
WE WILL HOLD THE LINE!
I was disappointed to hear that Kal'Reegar died in an email
Before the network, there were SOLDIERS!
WHY WOULD ANYONE HAND OVER LEGION
I loved Kirrahe, seeing Shepard gut Kai Leng and go 'this one's for Kirrahe you son of a bitch' was one of the best parts of the game.
to be honest, if they didnt have the ending and just went, btw guys the entire of me3 is the ending
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: bc you want credits
i would of been happier
ScootaChicken: you must not have had Thane at that point.
Even though Kai Leng was an irritating Sue
the had so much closure on so much
ScootaChicken: Are you talking about Thane?
o.o Cabin in the Woods will have an extremely limited run.
ScootaChicken: I think killing Kai Leng in general was the best part of the game.
ScootaChicken: it's a little more meaningful if it's Thane
Kai Leng never met Kirrahe from my perspective, Thane got shanked.
I HATE Kai Leng with the force of a thousand stars.
That bastard.
Kai Leng was a douche
oh man, thane was tough
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: Kirrahe takes Thane's place if he died in ME2
oh
I was actually glad it was Thane, he was going to die anyway
A terminally ill Drell kick Lengs ass.
i didnt even like thane
Thane was too cool to let die in ME2
bastard sent me an email, oh damn was I like "You bastard"
otakon: Meh, I really liked Kirrahe, even though he was only a minor character in ME1
His speech was incredible.
me too
good speech
Kirrahe was cool
he never died for me though so
^
I should do that speech in the next MP game we do on the final wave
lol
Inb4 sods law strikes you down should you.
otakon: Did you read that massive alternate endings script I sent you?
sod's law?
ScootaChicken: oh crap! I lost the link!
One of my favourite things about it is that you can make an absolutely incredible speech to the Galaxy
otakon: if something bad CAN happen, it probably WILL.
otakon: Lemme go get it for you
Meanwhile: that's Murphy's Law here in the states.
thanks ScootaChicken

Fair enough
Anyway
What's the context of this whole betrayal of Wrex thing?
otakon: http://social.bioware.com/forums/forum/Mass-Effect-3/Mass-Effect-3-Story-and-Campaign-Discussion-Spoilers-Allowed/Alternate-fan-made-endings-for-Mass-Effect-3-10966771-1.html all of the endings are brilliant, and the existing ones are expanded on very well.
Meanwhile: the Salarian's offer you full aid NOT to cure the genophage. If Wrex is alive, he finds out and goes after Shepard
otakon: I know they do that, but I didn't know that happened if you agreed.
youd also have to kill mordin to do that too
Meanwhile: yeah, so you could potentially have to kill Mordin AND Wrex in that playthough
I mean, what kind of twonk picks some random Salarian spazzmo over Urdnot Wrex?
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: you can persuade Mordin to help, and it's the only one in which he stays alive.
He's Wrex ffs. I'd romance him if I could.
still
But that's a pretty crappy outcome overall, it's a lot better to let him sacrifice himself and go out like a baws
Meanwhile: they offer to work on the Crucible, as Garrus says, it's "ruthless calculus"
I said no and still got the Salarian fleet.
yeah, you get a slightly smaller one though
Besides, the Crucible had Rachni. You can't really top Rachni.
Meanwhile: well, you can if you have Kirrhe alive and find the ships
Ill take not betraying Wrex and letting Mordin go out like a hero
I REALLY wish we could have seen Rachni fighting the Reapers on Earth, and the Geth wrecking shop.
EspyLacopa|2: Brainwashing. Obviously.
EspyLacopa|2: I'd say humans due to mammaries and body size/shape
well, not sluts, but they get around
lol

otakon: That headcanon or not?
otakon thats referred to in the DLC
mean*
Meanwhile*
man, typing fail
Yeah see I didn't buy that.
Meanwhile: no, it's actual canon. ME proves that Prothean's meddled with humanity in it's developing stages
Meanwhile: the prothean artefacts you can find in ME1
They wanted more slaves
otakon: Ignored all of ME1's side quests.
Meanwhile: you shouldn't have, there is a GREAT scene with Conrad if you did ALL of the sidequests from ME1
Seriously I can't even properly remember ME1.
Conrad?
Meanwhile: Conrad VErner, Shepard's No.1 fan!
as in Verner?
yes!
Oh that guy.
he has a GREAT scene in ME3
jeez, meanwhile probably missed out on half the game
03so HML
absolutely GREAT!
RX-78-3-SweetieBot way more than half
03I can get either Gingerbread or ICS for my tablet
otakon, what scene?
In my defense, I got it like a week before ME2 was coming out.
and it staggers me that they put in THAT brilliant scene but the ending is crap
His dissertation?
yeah, and his "Did I help?"
Actually wait.
If I think about it.
But before I go....
otakon what bout his not actually having a wife
I had a renegade Engineer that I did a lot of the side stuff on, but it was mostly shit I didn't care about.
I remember really liking the scene with conrad but I cannot remember what happened in it >_>
and instead having a shep shrine
UnFoundBug: he was divorced
03I'm gonna try Gingerbread first just so I don't brick it again
/me steals Meanwhile's legs

Heheh
Gotta go!

forever!
/me feels bad and gives Meanwhiled's legs back

Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
hes just gonna be on bronystate all day
lol
/me looks at one of his legs.
You know what, you can have this one.
You sure?
Absolutely.
XD
If I get a cane, I can act like House.
this chat became very wierd as i started reading the thermal clip canon
:)
Dr. Meanwhile, ND
/me hands LunaTheBeloved_ his leg.
/me holds the leg
Thermal clips annoy me so much.
I will treasure it always
Why can't the guns fire at a slower rate without one?
apparently they are a geth technology
Try not to break it :P
/me hugs Meanwhile
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved_ back.
I'm not gonna make any promises
Wow, LunaTheBeloved_ really is beloved.
Krakass becaue mass effect shielding is designed to combat high damage rounds at a low RoF
Krakass, you got that right
ScootaChicken: Probably not. But why would I want to when I have this voice.
thermal clips are there to allow guns to fire large amounts of rounds to overwhelm shields
though to accomodate this they had to remove the internal cooling mechanisms
Cya y'all letter tonight if you're still on
Do people REALLY think about why they use thermal clips in ME2 onwards?
yes
i still prefer the old system
Maybe, maybe not. Will see how much tea I can down LunaTheBeloved_.
It's a codex entry
The old system was much better.
Figures. I ignored the codex.
Y'know what BioWare should do?
Well, most of it anyway
man Meanwhile you really didnt actually play the game did you
UnFoundBug, I was thinking the same thing.
I like the old codex and journal better bc it WORKED
I wanted to play the story, I wanted to play Shepard. I didn't want to play librarian.
Re release all 3 ME games when the next gen of consoles come around, all of them with ME3's updated gameplay as well as somewhat remade levels.
That would be awesome.
ScootaChicken: and working journals, it would be good
Oh, and it would give ME3 better endings.
OFC!
I got soo pissed at the journal. It would open to the electrical schematics no matter what.
I read some of the codex bits that interested me, like Brutes, Banshees, harvesters, phantoms, Admiral Hacket and so forth
ScootaChicken so basically just update me1
otakon: The journals were great in ME2, I don't see why they would go back on taht in ME3
very little changed between 2 and 3
*that
But honest to god I do not give a fuck about the inner workings of the guns
could of done SO much more
Halfway through the game, that's a lot of scrolling
I point them and the thing I'm poiting at dies. That's good enough for me.
UnFoundBug: and give ME2 rolling and shiz
but nooo consoles are too limted and we cant have the PCs looking ncier now can we
but you know what would have been an awesome thing?
I liked ME1 grenades
looks exactly the bucking same on the pc
I found the grenades kinda unwieldy.
For light melee attacks you slash your omniblade, for heavy melee you do the same stabby thing as is in the game
As opposed to just swinging your weapon
That would have been really cool
ME1 grenades were a cool looking thing, but mostlly useless
There were grenades in ME1?
exactly
Light melee is meant to be fast, you expose your defense by drawing the omni blade, which is why it hits like a cannon.
I don't think I used a single one in my entire playthrough...
Krakass: bug, plus it NEVER updates quests
ScootaChicken: you killed all the Feros colonists?
alright, here we go
Meanwhile: oh yeah, that part
ScootaChicken: yeah, they were VERY important in the Feros mission
Goon.

haven't you noticed how people who we never see keep winning
I thought he said RAWRity for a second there
UnFoundBug: oh, you are right, my math fail
the Ryan Reynolds in a box movie?
Also there are sometimes disqualifications for ineligible picks, etc.
like WinRarity and Octavias_Pride
Buried? I have NEVER heard of that before, sounds like a troll movie
Ryan Reynolds. Was he Green Lantern?
I think I need more email address so I can get more newsletters.
Buried's alright.
Oh that film
is it the one with Ryan Reynolds?
Meanwhile: yes, unfortunately
ScootaChicken: yes
Ah, I like him.
otakon: you silly filly.
Though tbh, I never actually saw GL. It was just what came to mind,.
Not me either.
SO... people are using fake emails to get more votes?
Lasharus!

I never win ;__;
We should re-implement that system when you has to be in the chat at the moment of the drawing to win.

awww yeah
I liked the Green Lantern movie....
Nice, History of the World.
YEEEEEEAAAAAAH
not me, but same pic as me
I'm still waiting for Part 2 of that movie.
I have no idea what that pic is but it's Mel Brooks. So it must be good.
Pic?
film*
It already came out, EspyLacopa it was called Space Balls
RAWRity: the question is, if we pick JB as A, will they allow it?
No.
it's Mel Brooks, it's FUNNY
Because it's IMBD score is really low
Nor will they as B.
Because frankly, fuck you.
ScootaChicken: probably on money alone
yes
JB?
phew. I was afraid the fact that I didn't pick Bieber would be revealed.
Krakass: Justin Bieber's Never Say Never
Oh got
d
Jaketehsnake won. Wait
Didn't he win last week?
that he did
grats Jaketehsnake on winning ep
Yeah, he picked the ep we just watched didn't he?
Jaketehsnake has won loads....
mods, he won last week
I've never won anything ;_______;
IM SORRY!
I DIDN't MEAN TO!
AUGH
Jake is best hax.
Can someone PM a mod and tell them Jake won last week?
I did
Poor Gilda, she doesn't get enough airtime
Yay, Cider.
Dat cider.
Is there a 1 month limit for winning episodes?
RIGGED.
RIIIIIGED/
10Mmmcookies
Ikr.
Tovler: for everything.
has there been a week where a mod hasnt won one of them?
hii
GB is pretty horrid on tablets, HC or ICS all the way
Probably.
If you win for a category, it's a month before you can win it again.
03there's no HC
03and well
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: occasionally
03I tried ICS and bricked it >_>
mmm, cider
RX-78-3-SweetieBot: several
Darn, I think I was 141
Shizuka! YOU WON!
cause it doesnt seem like it...
Remember when Luna won twice in one lottery?
03because the bootloader was for GB
Jaketehsnake: yo9u won too!
that was amusing
otakon: he won, but it didn't count
so many skips
ScootaChicken: yes, and she got us good with the LONGEST BOLLYWOOD MOVIE that kicked ass in the last 30 minutes
Dat 8
I won twice! Huzzah
03so Xanbreon, Hetzner wrote back like "please do it as a support ticket" >_>
oh hey, Dragonshy. Haven't seen that 4 times on here...
Ugh
Dragonshy, I've seen that way too often
You wherent going though the ticket system?
Thing is, it's obviously not rigged, but people are paranoid.
too much*
03I emailed them directly
03well
03there was a form on their page
03for support
03before I bought the server
This is why I don't want to win. People get pissed at me becuase they have seen that ep too many times
afternoon everyone
man i did win but still have to think of a new b movie chocie
oh cool, we get to see the flim flam brothers
UnFoundBug: go with "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
Dat kick
no
do iiiiiiit
Poor Wrek got kicked.
you'll love it!
brb biobreak needed badly
Nudist Colony of the Dead, it's a horror/comedy spoof that's also a MUSICAL! :d
time to get toast
sounds like funny
With a name like that I'd have thought porn.
I think i might go for scary movie
eenope.
/me still laughs thinking of Cabin in the Woods.
HAHA NINJA'D YOU MEANWHILE
ScootaChicken: not on my screen.
Tovler: is it that funny?
or monty python and now for something completely different
which should i stick with?
Tovler: I thought it had some ......well situations that were on the dark side there.
UnFoundBug: Nudist Colony of the Dead
Did anyone else think of the brawl in Beauty and the Beast during that one scene?
okay, brb
or Birdemic
didn't see it yet, read the synopsis
birdemic would be good too
RAWRity: Birdemic is fantastic
oh yea, did they show the edited version of last roundup?
Dken2021: eeyup
I can't watch Birdemic without Rifftrax.
much rage was had in the chat
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/TNJ3m.jpg
I'm guessing it was the bizarro version of the first time we heard her talk?
Dken2021: pretty much
Dken2021: eeyup. Wish somebody had been recording it.
I want to see the upload reaction to Debra, the clumsy but loveable pegasus.
ooh! ooh! Great idea for a movie night: Breaking Dawn Part 1 for A, Vampires Suck for B
daw I didnt wint he lottery again :/
don't worry, I didn't win either
Question guys!
The Gondor reference
yes?
answer guy
Can someone explain it?
Vampires Suck made more money than Scott Pilgrim, so no.
explain what?
Where was Gondor when we explained it?
On the moon
Hype: there's a line in Return of the King that goes "Where was gondor when ...." and the chat turned it into a meme
RAWRity: One thing at a time, JB first, we'll deal with others later

ScootaChicken: oh I know, just bringing up some ideas.
Thanks Rawrity
Tovler: I just did.
LoveFace
/me now knows the origin of gondor
Loveface?
Does anyone remember Hard Rock Zombies?
yes
that was brilliant
ooh! ooh! The Hunger Games for A, Battle Royale for B
dear god, how could I forget that crap
ScootaChicken: vaguely
RAWRity: zombie werewolf grandma
that is all
wut
you heard me
Where was Gondor when the intermission lasted long enough for me to go grab some chocolate and a cup of tea?
lol
RAWRity thats not nice, then everyone who thought hunger games was a good idea will have their entire ideals destroyed by the epicness of the original
we can see white kids kill eachother with shaky cam, then Japanese kids kill eachother with every weapon imaginable.
Kick Ass for A. Super for B.

I just finished reading the alternate ME3 endings
still better than the originals
Knowing how they could have ended the trilogy makes the actual ending sooooo much worse.
Krakass: They are great though, aren't they?
Indeed they are.
Even the crappy ones were good for what they were.
The crappy ones were good because they explained pretty much everything
They were good, the just weren't endings I'd want.
Yeah, I would hate the Corruption ending, but in terms of the dramatic impact it had it was pretty good

Is it dead in here?
Pretty much RX-78-3-SweetieBot
im still alive
well thats no fun
I am alive
I r ded
RX-78-3-SweetieBot, Well, I am just looking for a group to go game with. Sad, nopony wants to
what game?
Aaaahhhh Zombies !! * run to the hills*
I don't know, Maybe Left 4 Dead. Maybe TF2. Whatever
What is the game about zombies that is really good?
Gumri: theres a couple of those
i'll play l4d2 if you want
Left 4 Dead is great. Killing floor has different mechanics, but is till godd
It uses the same engine as L4D but it is not made by valve
but i'm going to take a shower first so brb
Shower well, T
Also, Dead Island from what I've heard.
Zombie panic i think it's called
It is also free
Krakass, I have never played Dead Island. Can't review
Zombie Panic needs DLC set at a disco.
Zombie Panic at the Disco FTW
That would be so punny
Wow, SB sobered up quick

OH U
http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/oh-you-dog.jpg
In the UK you can have drinks at 14 as long as an adult buys them for you.
True story
In the US we can have drinks at 14 if an adult buys them for us and doesn't get arrested before giving them away.
:D
The statue got me high.
02*WB03(Lyon03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
Gumri in the UK, your allowed alcohol at any age
you just can't BUY it for till an age, or buy it FOR someone else
so if its bought for yourself and given to them, its technically fine
I think we need to lower the drinking age in the US to 18 but that will never happen as long as highway funds are tied to drinking age.
holy cow, wrek has ALOT of tabs open

they never did
That sucks
How long has it been?
a month
Show up and just start working.
lol they can arrest you for that you know
trespassing
I did that with a college class once
Just kept showing up till the professor finally relented.
well, college and a place of business are a little different
I'm going to start filling out applications for places I already did tomorrow, since the damn things run out over 60 days
my face hurts.
:(
why the hurt face RX?
to much insanity rage laughing
too*
XD
Add the O to the list
add all the keys

Exactly

main chat has turned into a portal RP
I don't suppose Feather has been active on here
it scares me

/me comforts RX-78-3-SweetieBot
nope
Wat.
o.0
/me sighs
10April 10 last seen
Im confused...
I seriously
about?
What's up
Whats up?
don't want to do this, but :|
why I heard a ping
Though
?
I'm currently too lazy to do anything
Because you were comforted.
it's 10:30am and I just woke up
so
10Demod
oh
"Bronystate comforts RX-78-3-SweetieBot"
ah
the chat froze for a bit and clear previous messages
I'm gonna go game until 2am
oh
then go to bed
and then do that for the next few days
thats a derp and a half
until I'm too busy to do anything
:{D
It is so annoying when the chat freezes
I like using xchat.
I wish flash wasnt so unstable
Haven't had it derp on me yet.
hey hey I am using Xchat :D
i use either xChat or IceChat
You use the on page chat?
i prefer Ice, but it crashes when the rooms get too busy
RX-78-3-SweetieBot, try the ajax version
It doesn't use flash so it should be more stable.
I usually use the page chat since I dont feel like bothering with external IRC programs most of the time
Xchat just came with this Linux so i just thought i would use it
Most stablest
welcome back
point proven :D
woah, this looks different
welcome back RX-78-SweetieBot
oh, is there a way to make it not show join and quit messages?
I wish there was
what client you using?
the ajax one
Menu top left
Then options
Scroll down Hid JOINS/PARTS/QUITS
hide*
ahh Krakass beat me too it
Gumri you can hid it in xchat as well
How??
ah, much better
Right click the name of the room
Settings: Hide Join/Part messages
aha yep ok thanks
/me sighs
03is Advil supposed to make you tired?
03also for some reason my headache isn't going away, I've prolly taken about 4x the recommended dosage now x.x
o-o
Why would you do that.
LOL
03well
03it's children's Advil
03I can't take pills.
03or, well, I can if I chew them
03but that basically ruins the effect
03so I try to get liquid medicine if possible
4x the recommended dosage for you, or for children lol
drfffffffffff
whoever suggested switching to this thing thank you, its so much better than the default thing
03but like
03it's based on weight
it is
03the highest weight they have (one dose cup) is like a little under half of mine
brb rebooting into windows, I'll still be on IRC on my craptop
03so I just filled the thing twice
03and then did that again >_>
10Why
10can't you swallow pills
03I just can't
03I tried once with some M&Ms and almost choked on them
RX-78-SweetieBot, why dont you get an external client?
10Small throat? inb4 that's what she said
03gag reflexes, prolly, I tend to choke on almost anything
03yeah
10Well, I used to be the same, but because I was SCARED to swallow them
10don't ask why
03The dentist was like "Your parents probably won't tell you this, but you have a really small mouth"
that is what RX-78-SweetieBot just did :D
03yay being a freak of nature :D
/me hides
10:P
no, hes just using another online chat
03they basically can't "fix" my jaw
03originally I was going to need jaw surgery
cause I dont feel like dealing with it. I only use one right now if Im playing a game on PC
What happened to it O.o
oooooooh?
I'm back
03then after the braces, they were like "eh, it wouldn't help"

Okaygood.
03I actually want to take a "staged" picture of me, it'll be quite funny
it's been just over six months since I lost my last one through no fault of my own
03but I'm not doing it until I get a chance to shave XD
10I'm so glad I am not male

10It's grosssss
03it's actually a genetic thing, applies to both genders
03at least
SB also likes a) not sleeping b) being naked
03what they call "hairy digits"
03I hate having it, but nothing I can do
heh i know a guy who spells thought like that just to piss people off
03basically where hair grows on the back of my hands
10Only certain people can pull of mustaches/beards
10off
03I used to think the moustache looked good but then I realized it looked silly
03alright, time to take a really ugly photo LOL
10I like how you point out my UK spellings
Gumri, the majority of mane chat?
03inb4 "you mean like any of them?"
10then you spell it like moustaches
03moustache is the proper spelling o.o
i liek to UK spelling
<MaxTheBrony> What do you meant by theme? I just drawed somthing from Hellsing does that count?
10baww
10Another one of those words I always thought was right

10I have a new bedspread now
Demoncat
03They downloaded the ISO, and said the LARA console will be available whenever
03I said any time works
10Demoncat?
03cuz I only get it for 2 hours
03that far right thing above your bed, LOL
Ah
10oh, my pet cat
Well
I'm on my craptop atm
since I'm gaming on my other laptop
so
03LOL having more than one laptop
03I've got several desktops, jus tone laptop
03which is broken ATM :/
I actually have 3
but one is broken
03well
and I have 2 desktops, and one sitting in the garage
3 desktops
03my laptop "works", but the hard drive broke
2 in my room and one in the garage
03and HItachi does slow RMAs
yeah same with mine
for some reason
03and the hinge is falling apart again
I can't even liveboot
it's that dead
03well I can do that
03I'm dbanning right now
and then chat died
Ah
03literally ONLY the hard drive is broken
03but like
regulars room always dies eventually
it des that
well
DOES
*
that's the same with mine
03the hinge
03is starting to go
but it shouldn't affect live booting
03AGAIN
03I already paid them to fix it twivce
same
03*twice
03I'm pouring more money in repairs
03than if I just bought a new one
03>_>
03so I need to call them and start yelling
O was already on the list.
03and be like FIX IT FOR FREE YOU INCOMPETENT PEOPLE
heh
okay but yeah
any idea why a laptop won't live boot?
03bad RAM possibly
I finally managed to get it past the hard disk error
03I'd say the CPU but if you get a BIOS at all, the CPU works
yeah, that's what I was thinking
Well
normally, the laptop derps on "Non-system disk or disk error"
And memchecks come up fine
03hm
so I'm utterly confused
03what did you try livebooting from, CD or flash drive?
So is key to destroy from all keyboards gonna by my thing now?
Both
keys*
03interesting
even hirons doesn't work
03hirons?
03also how did you memcheck if you can't liveboot o.o
BIOS
03the BIOS has that built in?
yeah
03nice
03mine doesn't XD
XD
03but mine was also barebones
it's weird though
I should theoretically be able to live boot
03what all did you try livebooting from

03I got the LARA console
and you'll like the sprites
04I have art that needs finishing today
03time to setup Windows then
derp
have fun drf
don't forget to install VNC :{D
/me goes back to being bored
03of course
03I'll do teamviewer first though
tightvnc
not realvnc
>|
03eh
realvnc is a laggy piece of crap
03RealVNC Enterprise works better
just run it on a diff port or something
03IMHO
run your realvnc on the standard VNC
and I'll run mine on my random port
03that's stupid
03I don't want two
you use teamviewer though :|
03but I want VNC for emergencies
03:P
03especially since this won't be a VM so I have no VM console to force reboot if needed
yeah then tightvnc is fine o_O since you're not using it a lot
but it's up to you
I can use whatever
since SSH works for linux
using VNC for linux is stupid
03LOL MSI
03hm
03Array mirror is RAID1, right?
Soooo many stupid people on mane chat.
ikr
04NS
04did you finish Jedi Starfighter?
03wow, this is going really slowly
03for loading files
03must be one really crappy flash drive they put the ISO on
doesnt it just make you want to drain the blood from their skulls? ^_^
will you get off of that
Ive only mentioned it twice....
Evening regulars
and now someone just showed up in mane chat asking for a linkt o todays episode
FUUUUUUUU
Quick question...if you don't mind....what won lotto?
History of the World Pt 1 was B
Can't remember anything else
Buried was A
Okay....never heard of it....
Cool, thanks
Two movies I don't know....
And then my browser commited seppeku
History is older but funny.
Is it a "so bad it's funny" or just funny?
03...it isn't detecting the hard drive
Plan old funny
Plain*
Yay!
/me watches the tumbleweed roll through chat

Chatception?
I'm silly?
So I have a coupon for a free domino's artisan pizza. Spinach & Feta or Chicken Carbonara?
Also, no "Yuck that's cardboard" comments.
One day I will go back in time to remove the movie inception from existance so we dont get any ___ception jokes. Instead we will get more xibit jokes
and yes you are LunaTheBeloved
xibitception?
Spinach and Feta
I heard you like xibit, so I put xibit in xibit so you could something while you something.

Both movie set for Autumn 2012. For more information please see official website
Remember though....it's bacon....from Domino's....
Hmm, what will Lord Bacon decide?
10MBAM is blocking it
10and MBAM is blocking a ton of other things
10like
10whenever I get on TST
03you can whitelkist stuff
10It block access to something or another
03*whitelist
03wb
10drf, how do
So much maiding
10Ignore List > add > ?
03it should show a little popup when it blocks something
10It brings me to files
03right click and say add to ignore
03or just right click and uncheck "website blocking "
10Not helping
10I right clicked the pop-up, it disappeared
03well it's not going to take effect right away
03I know
03right click the tray icon
Well I've always been one to follow a crowd.
Hmm, I don't think that sounds right
Heheh....Maidass
10k
10inb4 won't be in effect until after I reboot
03nah
03but it takes like 2-3 minutes
oh god more maids
10actually
10both MBAM and Chrome
We will rule the world!!
AHAHAHA!
10http://i.imgur.com/h552h.png
10inb4 get Firefox
10instant no :P
03yeah I dunno
03it seems to do that for LL too, where it just blocks random websites
03it works fine here though
03o_O
10oh
no
i don't MBAM \o/
10AdBlock addon was blocking it
silly mbam
:p
10LOLWAT
03This is why Ad Muncher FTW
10because a Puella Magi wiki is totally a full advertising website
04o-o
it isn't adblocker's
.v.
it is mbam.
03they're called false positives
simple as that
03and now
03-w
03it's the two of them together
03Ad Muncher is fine on its own but it seems to conflict with MBAM's blocking
03as they both try to block the same stuff
03which causes the world to explode
10no
10I turned off AdBlocker and it suddenly worked
10so
all teh maids!
10BOTH things were an issue
03read what I said
03"the two of them together"
10HML just can't admit that Chrome isn't always the best
10drf
10that's what I told him elsewhere
We will rid the world of all it's filth and scum!
04XD
03see
03LL uses IE, you use Chrome, both have adblocker + MBAM issues
03I use Firefox + Ad Muncher, no issues whatsoever
/me hides
i use chrome and don't have MBAM issues
03it's not JUST MBAM
03it's MBAM + an ad blocker
03I'm telling you
I have to be honest, my apartment is filthy. :-(
03when two things both try to block content
03it causes the world to explode
10I love how violent he gets
I can no longer live the lie.
I'm not a maid.
10I told him that he'd defend Chrome like a fanboy
03XD
10"F*cking B"
10etc.
03I don't really care one way or the other, it's not like I go around telling people to use Firefox
10"shut up and accept that I am right"
03I just like it myself :P
12o.o
ORLY NAO
10yarly
03hey, it Just Works®
03No browser is perfect but I don't run into those weird issues everybody else seems to have LOL
debateable
03also LL
/me hides
It was worth a shot
03I got Android to work on my tablet
03if you wanna try it on yours
03but it has this weird bug where, if you let the market update, it breaks wi-fi >_>
Sky is a freaking moron
She refuses to accept
12wat
that it is Mbam's fault
10HML is a freaking moron
:|
Yeah, that revolution didn't last too long.
I gave you proof
03OK seriously
03it's not *just* MBAM
03it's MBAM + an ad blocker
03How many times do I have to say this
DRF
03if you disable the ad blocker
I used IE
03it will work
:|
it is still broken
03well
so
Mbam
03If the site itself is being blocked by MBAM
03then that's one thing
!attack Xanbreon
03if it's like what happens with LL
12?
03where random cheezburger sites get blocked
03it's the two of them together
12oh
!Espeon
/me now belongs to Xanbreon for 10 minutes
pff
!Umbreon
03you disable Ad Muncher, it magically works

03well for some reason
03"No hard drives detected"
03>_>
Err
03it's an issue with the RAID controller
Support ticket!
12there was a fire alarm about an hour and a half ago
12i heard at work
03http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2010/10/installing-windows-server-2008-r2-server-with-3ware-9650se-raidcontroller/ <- I'm seeing this
support Xanbreon
03but I don't know exactly which one it is
12when I left work an hour ago
03it just says 3Ware
12I smelled smoke
12now I can smell it at home
12-.-
03I love how they make IE Look terrible
03in all honesty, IE 8 and 9 are pretty good
/me is debating whether or not to have a fifth cup of coffee
10butthurt
WHAT
03me? Not really
03as I don't actually use it
How is that a debate? Go for it. With 3 cubes of sugar.
D:
IE8 was pretty crap
10DRF no
I'm getting off of IRC
10HML is
03it just seems like people are saying IE sucks because it used to like 10 years ago
03ah
10He ragequitted MSN
if Skylands won't listen to me
Okay :)
Because
I gave proof
Both browsers
i use Chrome & Opera on PC
no adblocker
03Xanbreon, I dunno, IE8 works well for me in XP and 7
She refuses to listen
So I've had enough
10>getting mad over something silly
Sky should just sleep
10>my opinion doesn't matter anyway
Yes, because you're not listening and saying I am a liar
03I won't deny that :P
10I listened
04...
04:I
10I didn't call you a liar
12o.o
HE LIKES TO DERP AND HE CANNOT LIE!
03hm
03how do I figure out exactly which RAID controller is in my server?
12wow
03I gotta figure out if it inherently doesn't work with Windows Server without external drivers
10juhn, wat
Dunno
10Anyways
12Danny
03?
10I said just question the screenshot
10Sheesh
12I am getting the strangest feeling of deja vu, can't imagine why :P
hmm
03XD
10-said
Same difference, saying I am wrong when I *was* obviously right
precisely!
03hm
03what RDNS should I give my server
@LL
10No.
Even before the image, you should have believed me
03preferrably not something dirty :P
10I'm not allowed to question someone?
Not when you say that they'll do anything to 'defend' a browser
When I also told you that IE was acting up
10Shouldn't that be a compliment?
But you said that you need proof
so
drffffffffffffff
03yeah?
and now everyone is going on about OCs
10juhnquit
03I am having
yo
03terrible luck
10lolol
@_@
issues?
i'm on linux right now :D
03yeah
03something about the RAID controller :/
12lol Angel
/me hugs Angel
what's the problem?
03Windows won't find any hard drives
13or take it somewhere else cuz we don't wanna see that crap
03so I'm not really sure what I can do
13>:/
03I've only got an hour left
b0rk
03and I paid 25
03>_>
03but maybe if I tell them what happened they'll give me more time for free
Well
03I slightly LOL'd, they took the Windows Server ISO I gave them and stuck it on a flash drive
Now I have to draw my OC
03a really slow flash drive at that
You know, we don't talk enough about OCs in here.
hmm
I dc'd...what now?
Should have slipstreamed the drivers
03I didn't realize it wasn't already there
:P
OCs
>_>
Research!!
03I figured newer Windows should Just Work® with like 99% of RAID controllers
03I still can't fricking find which controller is even in it
03looking at my hetzner control panel
/me slaps Krakass around a bit with a large trout
03no idea
Should have emailed them about it
o_O
/me nomz on the trout
o-o
03it does have 4GB of RAM though, according to the BIOS, so memtest was derping
lol memtest
03and it's got two 500GB Samsung hard drives, they were set to RAID1
:P
what WERE you using for memtest anyway?
03I deleted the array and remade it just for good measure
03whatever was built in
I prefer salmon for future reference.
03to the recovery console
that usually sucks
03exactly
03but sigh
03why the frick
see: HP
03they have an external RAID controller and no drives plugged into the onboard SATA ports
03I'm sure the motherboard itself supports RAID >_>
03actually it does
,),
Trout is good,salmon is better, but fresh flounder is best
03so why did they do that
03other than to piss me off
/me runs
Hardware raid ftw
go yell at them
03apparently 3ware is a retarded barnd
03Xanbreon are you saying BIOS RAID isn't hardware?
Why did the Northwest Coast Indians go fishing?
Of cause not
03I was under the assumption that it's built into the hardware
Its software O_o
on the cpu
No raid logic
Do I wanna know?
Just for the Halibut!
03well I know my board has like 3 separate SATA controllers
03LOL
that's kinda sad
3 separate ones?
03Yes
That is my favorite cheesy joke.
03well it's got 12 ports overall
YOUR MOTHER IS SAD
036 of them are SATA2, that's all one controller
03then it has 6 SATA3, 2 and 4
03since apparently at the time, no SATA3 controllers could do 6 drives
03I don't really care, since I don't use RAID internally, only on my storage unit
....
That was terrible and you should feel bad
:-(
03also Xanbreon, how do you slipstream Windows Server anyway?
03I only know how to slipstream 2000/XP
03not Vista/7
Same stuff
/me hugs Krakass
/me is hugged
:-)
this is why
it's easier to VM windows
I have some cheesy jokes as well
on linux
Do share.
rather than the other way 'round
What did the fish say when he hit the wall?
What?
Dam
Yup, that's the same category as my joke.
:D
And with that I'm off
Well on that note, I'm going to go get my pizza and pick up something to drink for the Bronystate drinking game.
bye LunaTheBeloved
Heheh
Which one is that/
Bye LunaTheBeloved
Well I used to drink when Deathstar would dance.
Bye Krakass, Sweetie
*SweetieBot
Now I just drink when someone complains about the stream.
Because I drank way too much.
Krakass, how does your liver take it?
03well once you get WIndows working, it just works :P
Not very well. I have to drink to shut it up.
True dat
so does linux
03I just think, overall Windows needs more resources so it's silly to virtualize that
yeah, but you're also better off running what you're going to be running - apache, websites, etc. - on linux
because running that stuff on windows fails
03I'm fine with IIS :P
>IIS
only thing it's good for is ASP
03it works fine for HTML for me
03and FTP
derp
well
/me shrugs
now go get me some extra IPs >|
03it's 1/month
03per IP
03if you can pay for those then sure LOL
03I get free IPV6 though
1 euro
or w/e currency THEY use
03that's what I said
I think it's euros
and I can't host servers on windows ):
and VMing would completely eradicate the point of being a dedicated server
w/e
03yeah
03hey, I'm the one paying, so I'm choosing the OS
/me runs
yeah I know :p
I'm kidding XD
how's the setup going?
03I'm emailing support
03as still can't find drives
well sure
hopefully they can fix it
I'm going to go play some more games
lol

hunger games was an alright movie
storyline was good and the presentation of some parts was decent, and according to Drake it's pretty faithful to the original books and everything
but
03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/video-game-memes-call-of-honor-future-battlestrike.jpg
look, its bacon and applejack!
a lot of the parts could have been done a lot better
03I never read the books, but the movie was good
03and I'm a boy, not a fangirl, so that says something :P
06>semen remaining. all of my what
04Espeon what
13whoa what

I haven't read the books either
but
the movie could have been done a lot better in some parts

and left wanting

03I heard it on the radio

03I even emailed the dude and got a reply

but some people do and that's OK, because that's their thing
03some people are also idilts :D
03*idiots
sure, *I* think it sucks now, but that opinion is not absolute

Budget cuts
That sucks
I was the last one hired, first one to go
UnFoundBug: because most people cant grasp basic strategy
07,01what was the reason?
The economy is just taking a toll on the restaurant, they had just hired some new employees, they were doing fine, then people stopped eating out as much, began losing money, had to let some people go, I was one of them sadly
07,01yea.. the economy is bad atm.. well I hope you find a new job soon dear!
So do I
Thankfully I saved a lot of money before this happened
07,01that's a good thing
07,01a safety buffer
Yeah...
The problem is gonna be finding work
So few places are hiring
good luck on getting a new job LunaTheBeloved

14now that I found my old laptop I should be able to play it though

> Installed some registration program in System32/Windows folder
I loled
03this is why
03you get Uninstall Tool
03it includes the "Install and Trace" feature
03so it'll tell you everything that was done during installation
03:P
haha
03what's fun though is trying to uninstall Uninstall Tool using Uninstall Tool
03sadly, it doesn't work as expected :P
03but for most programs, when you remove them, it runs the regular uninstaller and then scans your computer for leftover traces, it's surprising how many programs leave stuff behind

man, i swear half the chat recently is either a) why there no stream or b) put something else on stream
it should die down back to the regulars tomorrow
weekend seems to retain alot of people from the friday night and saturday morning movies
Yeah
Also my pick for B movie this week and all weeks until it gets shown is now G-Savior
G-Saviour?
G-Savior
Alot of people are going to hate.
gundam film...
Especially any weaboo gundam fans
Never heard of it....
But it must be watched
Its a live-action gundam film. Sunrise commisioned a studio in canada to make it, but then gave them less than half the funding they said they were going to, and now sunrise does their best to disown it
However, it wasnt terribly bad, and it does a good job of feeling gundam-ish while not playing through the same tropes and cliches nearly every series of gundam shoves in
also the mobile suit designs or so very sexy
are so*
Ever watched Macross?
yes
its not really one of my favorite series, but its still good.

6most people in gensokyo have no idea what stuff like that is, it's secluded from our world. Only 3 people know about the stuff from our world, yukari who can come here at will, rinnosuke who's ability allows him to know what an object does (just not how it works), and nitori, who can immediately figure out how they work
magical girls figuring out things magically FTW!
/me hides
rinnosuke is a guy, therefore he is a shopleeper.
amirite?
*keep
6well, dunno about "therefore is a shopkeeper", guys arent forced to be shopkeepers

i recall you said "the only dudes are shopkeepers"

04bluh
so, did anything good happen while I was gone?
i mean Drake D:
i went 2-2 at the vgc regionals, i'm a failure to kyu D:
04XD
all that training
although i did record one of the matches
04You're better than me, be happy.
it was a pro with like 3 years of experience
and i beat him because he stalled himself out XD
if only you had black and white D:
black or white
ummm
Ohmyleg ;-;
we had our days of having several people here
lol
12ah
but its pretty much gone down to this again :P
Drake i'm not better than you :P
i forgot to factor in a counter for rain dance teams
12+G can be used when you don't want to kick someone who won't stop swearing
04Umbreon, trust me, I'm sure you're better than me.
i lost to a guy who didn't even understand how to play
he was just following his kid's orders before the tournament and mashing A
12I don't mind a little swearing, but +G can be useful
what does it do then?
1212it removes the swear word
04Not everything in Pokemon is about skill Umbreon
ah
04There's quite a bit of luck.
with what? this? @#$^ ?
12I'll show you how it works, but remember, it might fail :x
well...
http://www.masswerk.at/googleBBS/
the thing is that i didn't have much practice with my team
12[censored]
1212derp
in fact i didn't get any practice with my team before the tournament
you don't have a copy of black or white do you Drake?
1212there aren't any words loaded on the server for +G XD
12I'll have to add some
04I play White version, yes.
04But I don't train for competitive play at all. The only time I'll ever use competitive movesets/strategies is on PO
darnit!
well Drake
i can send you my replay then XD
04Well, I don't think I can connect to my internet
04I never have before
/me tries
awww
don't cryD:
04Oh my god this is hilarious
04I put my DSi on my tablet while it's still turned on and the mouse is going CRAZY across my screen XD
o-o
03o.o
04ok, so that's cool, I'm connected on my DSi
sending it online right now
it was only 12 turns
i probably was going to lose but he stalled himself to defeat XD
battle video
12ah
81-97442-06424
12that's why +G isn't working
12and I don't own this server, so I guess I won't be able to change that
04Umbreon I have no idea what I'm doing here :'D
go to the 2nd floor of the pokemon center
talk to the lady on the far right, next to the globe
select battle videos
view or upload
04ok
view battle videos
searcy by no.
then enter the nubmer i just listed
number
04Lucky you had that Focus Sash
yes
he honestly didn't see it coming either
not many people sash their tanky gyarados lol
04Yeah
oh amazon, you wont let me order the CD, but i can download the new album from you for less?
i outdid him that first round lol
why would i wait
04You used Overheat at a bad time
coming from the person who said i was better than them :P
/me shrugs
04Just pointing stuff out
i really didn't care
because my team surrounds around setting the stage for lucario
04ah
i wanted that hitmontop dead so i wouldn't have anything to worry about
04You taught it Vacuum Wave?
yes
it's a special move set
04And then you paralyzed your Lucario XD
yep
04Frankly you're lucky time ran out
yes
like i said
04You would've been at a serious disadvantage had it continued
he stalled himself out of the match
i didn't know discharge strikes everyone
or it can paralyze
04Discharge has always been able to paralyze.
04And I hate how in 4th gen they changed several moves to strike your other POkemon as well.
04Surf used to be awesome :<
to be honest
i didn't really want to do good good
because they were doing random black boxes of people's games
04Meaning?
basically
04ARE YOURS HACKED?
maybe.
04You don't know?
;P
i couldn't throw that team together in 2 days
04XD
not to mention i had to "make" my friend a team as well
XD
04"everyone! Act terrible so you're not caught!"
i wish i could ask him

03http://valid.canardpc.com/show_oc.php?id=2333300
03that's my dedi
Not bad
03not sure why it says 1000MHz though
cpu scaling
03oh god, so Windows does that too?
Of cause O_o
03can I disable it?
Its not OS based
Why?!
03I'm not the one paying for electricity :P
03so why not just overhaul it
Its stupid
Ohai
CPU hotter > air hotter > everything else hotter > parts dont last so long
CPU state switching is basically instant
At least these days
Allo.
Not using it is just fracking retarded
Xanbreon colder
What?
and more clueless
Xan, my laptop is on 917MHZ
Yes, grats, thats freq scaling
Umbreon, what the frack are you on about?
dunno
Sure, cpu cooler > air cooler > everything cooler > parts last longer
w/e both fracking ways around work
hai ~
anything fun going on here? or is it just a doornail?
o hai doornail
/me blows tumbleweeds around.
All the world needs more tumbleweeds.
Also to turn it off, you would have todo it in the BIOS, which would mean paying them todo, unless you still have the KVM
03nope
03but I didn't see anything for that in the BIOS
It would be called cool and quiet
But anyway
Dont turn it off
Cos thats fracking stupid
why is everyone sharing pictures in the mane chat?
tumbleweeds are highly nutritious

idk
03right, time to install ICS on my tablet

sometimes the right thing isn't fun
Umbreon
I watched it
:DDDD
135
ahh :D
Nova is Pogoguy? :P
yes XD
03what sort of long series are you guys watching LOL
Some crazy serieds
you don't want to know
i played in the VGC
went 2-2 drop :<
out of 7 rounds
and 300 something players
1212ah :<
my friend said it was 300 something
i could have sworn it was 100 something though
1212wow
/me sighs
Drake said i made a lot of misplays :P
but says i'm better than him
04Only because you're willing to train and actually play competitively
:P
03LOL playing competitively
03I think it takes all the fun out of the games if you do that
you won't say that when you taste victory
anyone for L4D2 ?
03*if* I do
and win a regional which includes a trophy and a free trip to nationals
03there can only be one winner XD
03and given that I have almost less than zero self esteem
03what are the odds of that happening
i didn't have time to legit train the pokemon
plus i needed to catch cresselia
03my "training" consists of just playing the game
which isn't easy
03I don't really get the point of EV training and all that
i need to buy pearl
03I have one I never use
hmm
03I'm not giving it away but you could borrow it or something :P
i wish i could save state diamond or pearl right now
03you can if you have a flashcard
that way i could catch cresselia
tune it to a team's needs XD
then save state back to before i caught cresselia so i can get another one in the future
03well
03the roaming Pokémon (e.g. Cresselia) are actually pre-set when you start the game
03so their nature/EVs/IVs will always be the same
03regardless how many times you catch it
oh
03yeay
03*h
03you would literally have to start a new game to get a different one
i wonder if i could enter a cheat then
to make every wild pokemon appear as a level 50 cresselia
XD
03but then it would be hacked?
not really
03yes it would be
03I thought you were entering a tournament :P
RX-78-3-SweetieBot my guns bigger than yours :P
how do i know that wasn't the actual real cresselia i just caught? :P
03PIDs.
My big gun is currently in pieces
needs a good cleaning
03seriously, if yu do anything with the Pokémon in an editor besides just cloning it, it'll show as hacked
03it's pretty crazy :P
and that pistol was still in .44, so its not small
03*you
well
yeah, mines also not real :(
if it spawns as cresselia
wouldn't that just make it legit?
03no
03well
03yes, but if you screw with the PIDs...
well
03and if you use a generator, to make random PIDs, it would be obvious
03since like I said
03when you start your game
03the PID for the legendaries is already set
this isn't really doing anything with the poke file
03well it's questionable
airsoft?
03I can ask bluesun
yeah
ah
Still fun
just changing the routes to make anything that spawns a cresselia instead
03he actually has the official hack-checker
03don't ask how XD
oh yeah, i can shoot that at other people
XD
03bluesun is a genius
well, sometimes
03he basically hacked the Dream World apart, figured out how to automate it all without using a browser
its rather hot atm, so most sites wont let me ue it
use*
I have heavily modified nerf guns for shooting other people
oh
"heavily modified"
read as?
and one of them I cant use from closer than about 10m or it can peirce skin...
ouch
those things are foam ffs
yeah
Nerf keeps making new ones harder to modify well though
proabbly on purpose you know
nearly every new one uses the shitty reverse plunger inside a restriced case, so you mostly have to use the spring it comes with
oh, I know they are doing it on purpose
03hm, I think I have all the needed files
o-o
03I'm putting Android ICS on my HP TouchPad
03last time I tried, it broke
ahh
03since I used the wrong files
03LOL
and not just for safety, the engineers that work on it have come to a forum and talked about how they enjoy seeing how people modify the designs they make
03I was able to get Gingerbread, though
03so now I *think* I have the correct ones
they do it just to watch us XD
well thats one way of interacting with a community
keeps you interested
03not that WebOS is all that bad, there's just not very many apps for it due to it being "dead"
surprised they havent thought of making MLP: FIM nerf guns considering its all hasbro for both products
MLP nerf guns?
that inject brony shots
all haters will join the herd!
I say within a year or so hasbro will start making the crossovers between the various new incarnations of their franchises
And it will be glorious
03and now my tablet is in Linux mode XD
03hm, well, it's at least in the recovery, that's a good sign
03LOL @ ICS
03It has a "call Mother" option, even though A. it's a tablet and has no phone and B. I ahve no contact named Mother
03..and then it just rebooted itself when I took a screenshot?
http://derpy.me/Q14lf
latios backwards :D
heh why dont people get the easiest way to avoid the shipping, is to ship
03OK seriously, why does Android think that Eastern time is GMT-4?
03it's GMT-5
03>_>
I dont get why they care, the shipping people on the chat is just silly fun anyway
it can get a little out of hand, ie otakon
summertime
thats partly because he reacts so much to it. If he didnt, people wouldnt care
03you mean daylight savings?
03because it's still GMT-5, just with DST in effect (or not in effect, not sure)
1212drf :D
/me 6 6puts Umbreon in a cage and avoids ownership. 
D:
12whee
12backwards where
03LOL fail
03so ICS seems to work fairly well
03but they were lazy
03and just left stuff out
1212Soital!
/me pokes
03"Temporary placeholder until functionality merged"
Aka the rom is still under development
03yeah
03but oddly enough
03the camera worked under GB but not in ICS
03it says "error: cannot connect to camera"
03:/
03I'd stick to GB but the wifi driver broke
03and cyanogenmod was like "eh, yeah, we know, just get ICS"
Kernel > userland APIs etc
03I kinda don't like trebuched
03*t
03can I use ADWLauncher on ICS?
cause
03well
03I know ICS was compatibility hell and required everything to rewrite itself
nom
03hence why updates of most of my apps were like "now works with ICS"
Lot of that was redoing UI stuff
Depends on the app
What it needs todo etc
it is gettign VERY difficult to avoid spoilers on this new ep
03so it's not like XP to Win7?
Clearly you need to sever ties to the internet until the day it airs
well i am just about finished downloading saints row
first one?
might just make a chick, turn the "sex appeal" charachter stat to max and make her jump up and down for a bit
the third
03ooh, it has a mode to optimize for a stylus
ah
03that would make Draw Something a lot easier
/me hides
its fun
Burt Reynolds even shows up

euch 2 hours still to download
and 1 am
im in uni at 9
/me pokes late
03hm
03Xanbreon you use CM9 ICS?
Yes
03did they get rid of the CyanogenMod settings where you can tweak stuff?
And other stuff
Not all the settings are implemented yet
03well
03I'm trying to mess with the on screen buttons
03since, they put a home button on screen despite the tablet having a real home button
03and tehre's no menu button except in certain apps L>_>
03-L
No global menu button
03in CM7, under tablet tweaks, there was a way to
03wtf?
03in ICS at all?
ICS doesnt have one
03That's retarded
Its changed
03then what about phones like mine with a hardware menu button?
03I coulda sworn it works o.o
Of cause it works
But you dont need an onscreen menu button
As the UI has changed
03but if ICS doesn't have a menu button
03then what's that button doing :P
opens the menu
03:P
03so why can't I put an onscreen menu button that does what my phone's menu button would?
Urk
03also stupid trebuchet
03I hate this thing already
03rebooting then installing ADW
03I liked CM7 better but >Bugs
trebuchet is great :D
03IO hate it
03-o
03laggy as f*** when switching homescreens
03also the auto-brightness sucks
03:/
03that's prolly a hardware issue
03though it did work in CM7
Meh
03wtf
03it's having the same f'ing issue as before
03where if I turn bluetooth on
03it breaks wifi
03>_>
haha
aww :<
03maybe that's not a CM7/9 problem then
03or rather
did it happen in webos?
As
03a problem with the hardware and how Android reacts to it
Gotta love driver issues
03of course not
> Same antenna wifi
oh
03it works fine in WebOS
03I even have the official HP keyboard
depends on the chip though
03bluetooth one
Blame HP for not giving src
03actually
03you know wha tI think it is?
03the f'ing market.
03in both GB and ICS
03as soon as I click Market and it updates to Google Play
03Wifi no longer works.
03Not sure WHY
03but yeah
Shouldnt be related
03it's also HP
/me hides
03yeah see
03"no network connection"
03let me try something
03I'll restore the initial backup before I setup ICS and try NOT turning the bluetooth on
03so are you sure the market doesn't replace any kernel-related stuff when replacing itself with Google PLay app?
Of cause
O-o
03ah hm
03I got IIS to work at least </not related>
03also ICS, IIS, stupid acronyms that are similar
drf
heeeeeeelp
my wireless router isn't turning on ;_;
03yes?
03o_O
03did you try a hard dreset?
no lol
03try that
no power going to it
for some reason
03wait what
03maybe the power adater is broken
03*adapter
I think it shorted out sometime during the night
03yeah, nothign I can do from here about hardware problems :P
yeah well it's been sitting there for whoknowshowlong
and my modem wasn't working either
I had to restart it
03hm, weird
03so if I turn the wi-fi off once it borks (e.g. updating the market) then back on, forget the router and then reconnect, it seems to work
03o_O
!kyu
/me 07does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.

3You know Rain, right?
3xD
I know Rain, yes.
3silly
^^
Okies
so Xanbreon
So what happens when you pull the power and put it back?
O-o
nothing
there's no lights coming on at all
Tried diff power socket?
Oh gosh....
03"is it plugged in?"
/me hides
gd night my fellow bronies
NevermindJohnU
Night UnFoundBug.
3night UnFoundBug!
tried 2 diff power sockets already
that are both confirmed working
night UnFoundBug
3x3
Do you have a alt power supply you can use?
Night UnFoundBug
huh?
:3
You know
That was a weird autocorrect....
the power brick?
*Nevermind
I have about 50 cords flying around the place
well not 50
NevermindJohnU.
but it's a mess
I know everything is working
Yeah....
What router is it?
When I go to sleep I will dwell on who John U is.
3xD
some d-link one
make, model, A/S/L?
WRTsomethingSYS
I guess I shouldn't tell you then
hang on
03LOL SDL

I think the box went poof
If you do, I'll sleep much easier.
I like to know the age of the routers I am humping or something
He's one of my brothethers
*Brithers
**Brothers
You are all about the spelling tonight.
3There we go :3
/me steals Meanwhile's legs "Be quiet"
yeah, that's my question too
interesting
I'm not actually sure
You're aware that my mouth (Or fingers) aren't on my legs right
I thought about it before
apparently in pokesav
you can unset the cresselia event
there is no such thing as a WRT54L
and it's probably about time it died anyway
so you can make the game think the cresselia event never happened
there is a WRT54GL though
03Umbreon yeah
03but again
Ah yeah, it's a WRT54GL
03it'll be the same PIDs
that is a cool one
well what if you set it to checked
to make it think that it's done
its highly open to alternate firmwares
then uncheck it again
03no idea
Tomato and DD-WRT work
03just talk to bluesun sometime XD
but the stupid thing keeps shorting out when I get a massive amount of traffic
massive as in
maybe i will
maybe he'll give me his hack checker as well
400 packets in a second
:D
Do you have a comparable one?
03#pokemon-originals at irc.hoshinet.org
03:P
03anyway
don't think so
lol
oh?
Yesh.
2.5gbps UDP DDoS
:P
400 packets per second
/me hand leaps after LunaTheBeloved.
how the heck are you pulling that off!?
10Ping
/me uses her LEGS and dodges
/me lands on his face.
no big deal
;n;
i can plow through diamond quite fate
fast
all i need to do is hack up some level 100s and hope they obey me XD
/me picks up Meanwhile and dusts him off
03yes but they check the *Entire save* for hacks
03not just your entries
03so unless you're planning to trade them elsewhere
03don't do that
that's why i always trade pokemon to my other versions afterwards
XD
Most considerate.
03oh
:)
/me steals LunaTheBeloved's leg.
I guess for 400 packets per second you need to use a commercial router
/me falls over
that has a powerful enough CPU to handle the traffic
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/10378?search=mecha
/me hobbles after Neanwhile
*Meanwhile
drf what i used to do was hack parents
then EV train the pokemon inside those games
then trade them to a game that was never touched by hacks
/me surfs away on LTB's leg.
[10:53:04] <Xanbreon> 2.5gbps UDP DDoS
[10:53:08] <Xanbreon> :P
o_O Xanbreon
you probably think that's a whole ton of effort for nothing, but that nintendo tournament was actually quite fun
Who have you pissed off this time NS?
but getting caught with hacked pokemon would put an end to it right off the bat
yea, you need to spend something like $1,000 on a router alone
/me attaches Meanwhile's legs to her stumps and runs after you
my router shorted out before it could be completed
well
restarted
an interprise level router
true
enterprise
like what you would see in large companies
So have you tried a diff power plug you derp
3mmm, I'll leave the RP alone for now...
yeah
I've plugged it into a diff port Xanbreon
the router is not "shorting out"
you are overloading the crap out of its CPU
What
probably
/me nuzzles SlurryMoon
Okay
/me attaches LunaTheBeloved's leg and makes a hop for it.
/me tackles Meanwhile
/me nuzzles LunaTheBeloved back
/me bites the dust.
I mean the <censored> power cable and the plug
Do you have an alt plug
nope
/me takes her legs back and gives Meanwhile his back
Truce
did you read the part about 400 packets per second causing it to screw up?
Deal.
/me reattaches his legs.
/me reattached her legs
/me hugs Meanwhile
well
What the hell are you on about?
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved.
haven't done it for a while
Im talking about something else
and certainly not recently
oh
what kind of router were you pushing that level of traffic through
How long have we been stealing each other's legs?
well
Urrr...Pfft.
I can't remember.
I kinda killed both connections
i'm going to get sick XD
mine and the server I was running it on
but said server is a home server
with a netgear router
so many fun memories inside my diamond version and i'm going to erase it
normally that derped first
A long time.
yikes
Yeah...
Xanbreon, btw, do you know what IP got hit?
Since last year at least
the clock speed on those is not too high plus not much RAM
I wonder how it started. (I really should know)
I no longer hunger
03so you finished the hunger games?
/me runs
I think you started it...
Yeah
They were tasty
I can believe that.
I'm going to probably buy a new router today
do eit
good idea
Not sure...might have been during a really boring movie and you just decided to do something crazy....
but look at its specs
I dunno...
CPU clock speed and RAM
Might have just been a spur of the moment thing.
sort of like you were buying a computer
I'm totally ok with the whole situation. ^^
ah
Heheh
lol I'm going to have fun setting it up
cus' it's not like I've ever done it before
Itll always be our thing, legs
You derp
This is my second router anyway
the last one... died
Dem legs.
but 2-3 years is kinda long for a router to last
so I suppose that's okay
Not to bad
in other news, brb, gonna switch the ethernet cable over to my better laptop
Heheh
It'll be ours...before some kid copies what we do in another room...
And the leg stealing craze begins
Well, given that we only do it in this room, and to get in here you need to have a certain level of...something, I can't see that happening too easily :3
03and it works a ton better
03whereas the $200 Linksys didn't
the antennas are passive
Yeah... :)
not active
^_^
they can't have power
03well
03the one I got has the largest legal amount
031W I thinkl
03-l
yea
03compared to the 500mW and such thta other routers had
03in fact
03that $200 Linksys had *internal* antennas
03it was also the highest rated router on Newegg
03but nope, didn't last a day in my house
03>_>
but you need antennas that have a lower gain and thus a lower eirp
yeah, no, linux is hating trying to connect
in order to stay within the part 15 specs for WIFI
I'm not bothered enough to work
make it work*
omg
this dumb rival
always has been the most annoying one of the bunch
so .96
o_O
wtf
Dc'd
probably dalnet
Who have you pissed off now?
Like a boss.
wouldn't be me
lol
my IP changed again
):
I don't think they ever would set boundaries....just a thought
:P
Boundaries?
For how long you've been at BS to be in this room
03that's a good thing
yo
03>easier ban evasio
03n
Not officially.
no it's not ):
I have to reconfigure my IPv6
03I switched schools, then went to this one place I was banned from like trololol
which I can't be bothered to do
03they were too lazy to re-ban me
1212well, look at thr bright side
1212now you're un-banned from everywhere
But generally it's considered to be a few months or something.
You are a derp
1212:D
Cause it'll only grow larger as the weeks go by...
implying I was banned from somewhere
and drf for that matter
03the way you act? I'm surprised you aren't banned almost everywhere :D
/me hides
if I wanted to ban evade
I wouldn't use my own IP ):
Heheh....a regulars room for the regular regulars...
True, but this chat room has never grown particularly large. Probably because nowadays it's only really advertised privately.
Yeah, pretty much
#bronystateregularregulars tbh
It'll be done one day...
awww
I liked my previous IP
baddie
03my IP changes every time I get a new router
03because the ISP bases it on MAC address or something
03so it's not surprising
03>Says we're low on IPv4 addresses
03>ISPs have dozens to spare
it's heh
IPv6 really is not on my mind at all
Yeh, but we dont want to end up NATing our NAT's
lmao
Thus IPv6 asap pls
IPv6 is kinda meh
Wut

also
have you checked your dedi?
03well
virtualbox wants to disconnect the network temporarily
so I kinda left it
03I closed that
03because
03eh
cus' I didn't want it to kill anything
03you sure VMWare wouldn't work better?
VMWare is kinda crap
but sure
I'll be happy to use vmware
03well
I still like virtualbox better
I don't really mind
03>VMWare Tools
anything works
03is honestly what makes it work
03but
heh well
03that's if you need a GUI
03if you're only using terminal
03then yeah
I don't need a GUI
the only thing better in VMware is the tools :s
03exactly XD
I'm going to uninstall that crap
as soon as I get the login set up
sudo apt-get purge gnome
03I just know when I'd install Linux distros in VMWare, they'd lag like f*** until I installed VMWare TOols
03hence when you were all
03"ew Linux in VM"
LOLGnome
03I was like
03SOmeone didn't install the tools
HML, don't diss gnome
gnome is nice ):
at least gnome 2 is
03Gnome2 is nice
But I thought
gnome 3
033 is stupid
you said gnome
/me cringes
3
Why even install the GUI to start with?
I ewewww
nah
lmao Xanbreon
O-o
cus' liveboot does it
03you mean that gnome in your pants?
/me runs
hah
03that's a reference to a movie
03w/e
Because GUI is fun ;<
What distro?
Aka use a better one
03I'm curious if I could somehow like, make the VM autostart when WIndows starts and so I don't have to worry about if I reboot, killing the thing for good LOL
03you know what I should have done?
03is install ESXi
03then just put both OSes
03as a VM
yeah
03I just have no experience installing ESXi on metal
and then I wouldn't have to rage at you
03I mean, if you think it's worth paying another 20
every time you restart the server
metal?
ESXi on metal?
what?
03as in, hardware
oh
03yeah
03as in
03"I'm running Windows Server on metal" opposed to in a VM
03I wonder how easy it is to set up an ESXi server though
03we used one at work
03because I wouldn't oppose to just wiping out my current setup and doing that
Just dont reboot it then
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I'll play
derp
03then I could give you like a gig of RAM or something maybe
03why would you need that much just for a terminal interface though?
03Xanbreon, it's Windows, I reboot a lot :P
pornography
O-o
03porn on a terminal?
Jaketehsnake just let me restart my laptop then ~
What the hell do you reboot for?
Sounds good
03if I accidentally break things :D
/me uses google voice
good jorb
I DEMAND PORN
03LOL
03and well, eh
Google voice?
well drf
03I suppose once everything is set up
I need at least 512mb :{D
preferably 1GB, but tis' up to you
03then I won't need to reboot very often
where you search
"very often"
with your voice
03but, when you mess with the server roles
being once a month
03as in, IIS
03it makes you reboot :P
ignore it ):
Lawl
/me hides
>windows
lmao
hahahaha drf
03"oh no, data's leaking, better fix that"
/me runs
BAddies
03well eh
03I would honestly prefer ESXi if you're serious about running Linux full-time
03that way the only way it would screw something up is if I did a hard reboot
03which... is kinda stupid anyway
hahahaha drf
03as ESXi takes like 10 minutes to starty
03-y

lmao drf

You are an twit
03dude, I'm clumsy
should get hetzner to do it
03just don't let me manage a data center
and then they'll be like
03wait
/me facedesks
03they'll install it for me?
"WHAT THE F IS HAPPENING WITH YOUR SERVER"
03do they even support vmware?
03ah
03XD
03well
well
ask them about it
03not all hardware has a built in chassis speaker
03XD
they'll probably surcharge
03but that one sure as frick did
lmao
03it was a dell poweredge something
03anyway brb
the beatsaudio speakers on my laptop
are <3
fiiiine
are overrateed
Heh, its $75/30min or something if you want them to install stuff
You are just going to have to pay for the iKVM
HML they are good though
well, the actual headphones
:V
03hm
03I mean, I can pay for the LARA console (iKVM thing), but I need to know how to install ESXi and all that
go slap hetzner
I haven't installed ESXi before
03I've got a computer next to me that I don't particularly need
03I could try it on there
03the HP one
03and well
03would you just need one IP?
http://derpy.me/nIfex
yay im under a tornado watch.
and im currently in a heavy storm
idk drf
Oh noes :p
I can pay for extra IPs
RX-78-3-SweetieBot, xD
03hm
03should I try installing ESXi on my HP computer and figure out how it works? XD
If that person gets six or seven invites back....
have fun
you can try installing ESXi on my dead computer, but I have a feeling that won't work
:{D
03well lemme make a ghost image first
Make a video of you failing
anyway
I'm off to game for a while
so bbl
1212see ya
then I'm going shopping
and then hopefully have a new router
1212I'm going shopping too XD
and then I need to figure out how to set it up
'nyway bbl
1212in that case, good luck

03hm
03n Known 64-bit processors:
03n All AMD Opterons support 64 bit.
03n All Intel Xeon 3000/3200, 3100/3300, 5100/5300, 5200/5400, 7100/7300, and 7200/7400 support 64 bit.
03n All Intel Nehalem (no Xeon brand number assigned yet) support 64 bit.
03that doesn't list any other AMD o.o
Generally any 64bit cpu with hardware VT should do
03though eh
03it says 2GB minimum of RAM... I hope the f'ing software itself doesn't eat that much
Nope
03so it should be fine?
03my only concern is that stupid RAID controller
03it's a 3Ware one, which isn't listed at all
Oh, or maybe it does need that much
03:/
hi people
I'm home
03FINALLY

03so Xanbreon should I bother with VMing or not?
ask the audience please
XD
Meh
Just VM linux
03and try to not reboot Windows? :/
DRF, you can have my mother's vista PC

03k, got the "personal site" back
03not that it's anything to be proud of
03*com
03IIS is easy once you get the initial config done
LOL i listened to voice.mp3 XD
yay keen collection
x.x
12.om? I had no idea drf had his own top-level domain
/me hides
03if I did it would be .drf
1212XD
.derp
1212that would be mine
12or
12.o3o
No, fracktard
12and it could be more popular than .com
12:D
What an idiot
:P
12or I could buy .com and covert it to .o3o :'D
/me runs
03how about no
Nope
1212it would be cool to have your own top-level domain
You could
12LOL how?
For like a few hundred k and if you had the infrastructure to run a tld
12oh
oh wow
srsly?
You guys missed the whole "buy your own tld" <censored>?
03>people saying that dubstep isn't repetitive
03wtf are they smokine

DENIALISTS

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNWfqVWC2KI LOL
so drf
it'd be nice if you didn't restart anything
They use WEP :D
lmao HML
do it
just be careful not to get caught
if they do packet monitoring
I doubt it
Because
I'll be using a USB stic
stick
and a VM
That might protect me somewhat
lol still
wouldn't the local IP be the same?
er
nevermind
I'm being an idiot
:<
I wonder what I can do to the network using Aircrack :s
hack into their router
change passwords
install trojan
???
PROFIT
I wonder if I can get the admin password :c
bruteforce it using ophcrack or something
That'll work on a network domain?
well you need to set a bruteforcer on the username admin and whatever domain it is
start running with 8-character passes or something
because that's probably their minimum
i see
unless your school is genuinely retarded
Well yeah
at the very least, it'd be 6, but I doubt it
8 char letter and number
my school's network pass was some random 28-char or something
Wrell
Wel
*Well
8133!nsrradio@det#nsw$edu%au^
I have the Wifi password
that was the pass
I'm like "lol you"
Just not the silly windows admin pass
hit f1
???
PROFIT
What does F1 do? :P
in safemode
admin thingy
to reset admin pass
probably disabled and everything
but it's still slightly lulzy
but hurr
infect the router with a trojan!
I swear one of my friend's user accounts is an admin
there are some router trojans/viruses out there, but I've never really looked at them
lmao
and I was like, "How."
LOL
INB4 mass keylogging
just keylog everything on the network :{D
also altiris
:3
ohai
What does Backtrack linux do?
you don't want to know
Okay :<
you don't care about linux anyway
lol backtrack
get konboot or something
and hax the fuq out of the computers
infect everything with winlogonn.exe or something
or the naked wife virus even
or that recycler usb virus
that was such a lulzy virus
my school had it for 1-2 years
before the admins finally managed to block it
it was, if nothing else, annoying
:<
Xanbreon
What
Yes?
to get around the incasesensitivity
of $readini
use $repcs to replace A with A' and stuff
;D
Oh yes?
Oooh
because
as you know
readini is retarded
Yeh, <censored> stupid thing
and windows is too
>no case sensitivity
WHAT U DOIN
But thats a cleaver work around
well
I've been considering it for quite some time
but I didn't know about the $repcs
Whats that do?
until a friend told me yesterday
replace case sensitive
like $replace
except case sensitive
I love how some commands have a case sensitive version
yet readini doesn't
I cant even find any documentation on that cmd
the <censored>
o_O
Bawww, can't find my wifi usb stick
er sorry
poor you
I mean $replacecs Xanbreon
and lol Xanbreon
You mean, using A' to mean A and A or a to mean a
Yes?
yeah
Gotcha
heh
As long as your input doesnt allow 's
:P
you should see my workaround for the !pokemon script
yeah
you know how mIRC's $rand function can't do a specific range of numbers?
like 1-2,4-5
and skip 3?
Wouldnt be surprised
my ears are killing me atm.
._.
well it can't
Thats just <censored> retarded
yeah well
It is
thanks to that Nyan Cat 404
heh
THAT BASS
and the !setgen script
ON LAVANDER TOWN
allows you to change gens, right, Xanbreon?
Oh yes
so you can turn stuff like gen5/gen4, etc. off
so I had to find a way
I have never really buggered about with that script
XD
I dunno if I gave it to you
Probs something horrid todo with loops
well
there's not that many loops
Loop while loop while loop while loops
haha
I'm fond of loops
you can't blame me because mIRC sucks at doing things
so loops are necessary
and the pokemon script only has 1 loop
I blame you for everything ;)
n16= var %gennumber 1
n17= while (%gennumber <= 5) {
n18= if ($readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen $+ %gennumber) == on) {
n19= set %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] $+ %gennumber
n20= inc %gennumber
n21= }
n22= else { inc %gennumber }
n23= }
I could actually just get rid of the else {
and move the inc %gennumber to outside the if
that's the only loop in the !pokemon script
Heh, general blerg at mIRC script
:/
heh
but
the actual printout line is a mess
msg $chan $nick $+ , you are a  $+ $read(c0l0r5.txt,$rand(1,$lines(c0l0r5.txt))) $+ $read(pokemon $+ $mid(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ],$rand(1,$len(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ])),1) $+ .txt) $+ .
lol colour codes got derped
msg $chan $nick $+ , you are a  $+ $read(c0l0r5.txt,$rand(1,$lines(c0l0r5.txt))) $+ $read(pokemon $+ $mid(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ],$rand(1,$len(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ])),1) $+ .txt) $+ .
hm
but yeah
it's a large mess
that's just the one line to print out the pokemon
Funfunfun
and the !setgen script doesn't have any loops
it's only if-elseif-else
so overall it's a fairly loopless script
Just spending a lot of time working about mIRC's b0rkness
12Not really XD
12derp
12brb, restarting computer
Off to catch some sleep
Toodles
nai :P
So like
I think my GPU failed for a moment
:|
Or flash crashed my GPU, something bad
and the daribot continues to chug away
Holy

Hi llllllllll
Also I tried lucid dreaming
I chickened out of sleep paralysis
;(
03LOL what?
My heart was racing too fast
03how does one "try" that
03I thought it just happens
03on its own
Anyone got a suggestion to make me not get afraid of sleep paralasys?
drf
enjoying the weather?
03um
03what
Drf you try it by just letting your body enter sleep mode
hear about that storm last night?
03I haven't gone outside in a few days, what is this weather you speak of
pretty much ripped through texas to the midwest
>drf
>outside

ANYWAY guys
03well I'm not dead if that's what you're asking
http://www.weather.gov/sat_loop.php?image=ir&hours=24
XD
Anyone know if it's possible to willingly exit sleep paralysis?
not sure
That's prolly what's haunting me so much
The fear of permanent damage
hmm
03well
03if you die in the Matrix, you die for real
i'm not sure if it's really damaging
Exactly :p
No I mean
i know what you mean
i've heard of it before
The inability to actually get out of my dream state
I'm sick and I slept the whole day
03Inception?
I have nothing to do but sleep right now
I just wanna lucid dream for once but mt body won't let me LO

07</sexism>
07don't worry, I question my existence too
what existence
07I wouldn't know, I'm not sure I have one
what existence is there but the desire for existence
</philisophical>
07what philosophy is there but the philosophies of lazy nerds
07:'D
12I hate babies too
what is philosophy but lazy nerds trying to explain things that cannot be explained

07yep.

What are nerds rejected by philosophy if they are rejected by everything else to begin with?

04If nerds are rejected by everything, are they rejected by themselves?
07what are philosophers if not people who work at Burger King even after recieving a doctorate?

12no
12O.o
12that is truly a depressing life
04If rim is the opposite of middle, and sky the opposite of earth, is Skyrim the opposite of Middle Earth?
What are philosophers if they reject not only themselves, but their own concept of existence outside geting a degree at Burger King and questioning their own existence like the losers they are?
12My head *shot*
What is Drake's love of Skyrim if Skyrim does not love him back?
12nope, I can handle that
wait
12Skyrim is too mainstream *hides*
"getting a degree at burger king"

12you're going to make that punctuation mainstream

6-6
04Only won via stalling
hey

he stalled himself
07I lost to really bad luck
04That makes it worse!
how
07double critical hit + double flinch in one match
07I missed everything in a 2nd
i didn't really care
since my team was hacked anyway
XD
07and I was matched up against a friend who I knew had a perfect counter
07lol
beats getting black boxed disqualified
5O.o
5I never have anyone to pit my Pokemon against. :c
that's why you go online

04Dark Void, Spacial Rend, Ice Beam and Nightmare.
i did put up a replay of the person who stalled me out
04>event Darkrai F**k yeah
i think drake has the number for the replay
5...hacked]
04Meh, I'll get it later Umbreon
5I have an event Zoroark
07I have "________" hacked is never something to brag about lol
04[08:32] <%Umbreon> 81-97442-06424

pff that was fast
I have a legit shiny charizard and umbreon, self bred

lol
04Aurora
<@Kyu> I have "________" hacked is never something to brag about lol
^ derp
04I want that Charizard
5me too
i learned something hacking the guys up saturday
5?
04But there's nothing I'm willing to trade
that you don't need to go onto the dream world or the GTS to get dream world abilities legitly
04...
04Nowai
5whoa
5how
thats assumng /I'd/ be willing to trade
which I wouldn't
04exactly
you just need a female with a dream world ability
5fair enough
Vega stays right here with me lmao
and a male that isn't a ditto to "bread" with it
04Aurora, James Vega?
04Can I call him Slab Bulkhead?
6what? no
6who is that
5XD
04Fridge Largemeat?
5LOL
04Hold up
04I need to get the list
oh yeah Aurora
Drake and I went to see the hunger games together
6I hate the whole "you can only nickname your own pokemon"
04^
i'm going to sleep goodnight
6cuz i didn't nickname her vega on the other game
6so her name is still charizard
6OTL
04Especially because if you migrate a Pokemon from D/P/P without a nickname, it has ALL CAPS
6yeah
07the migrating system in BW is awful :'D
07I did it for the first time on saturday lol
6eh?
6hell no, the BW migrating system is awesome
5I've done it at least six times
07it's fun
5because my nan has a DSi, lol
07but I hate the effort :'D
5me too

OH KYU
since apparently you are here or were here
and I'm lazy
07YES SIR
I need to talk to you
07mmk
I just noticed something
I'm in the grass
I'm in the grass man
http://youtu.be/a_aaggALrzA
Drake
04?
I shouldn't be eating lollies
04Crap
though lollies should be fine
04We don't need sugar-high NS
chocolate is bad
inb4 NS goes in the grass
/me hides
huh?
04"So you're NOT secretly plotting my downfall so you can have Marten all to yourself?"
04"Oh, I'm plotting your downfall alright. Just not 'cause of Marty."
04"Then why?"
check the video for the reference NS
who is Marty/marten?
04"Just plain old ornery-ness, I think. Plotting downfalls makes me feel...tingly."
04"We have GOT to get you laid."
I'm on my craptop
which blocks sites
oh. i forgot
she has 2GB of internets a month, btw
04@jun: A frustrated 20-something
04Didn't NS get an upgrade for that?
oh?
I have 120GB or 60GB on/off peak
I think
not sure what the 120GB entails exactly
0460GB is still better than me
true dat
OP probably means during 12-6AM
check with your ISP
i also have 60+?? per month
04NS
04Finish Jedi Starfighter?
but that gets used up p. quickly with my sister streaming videos
04Man, I wanna play Jedi Starfighter again
Yes I did
I've been replaying parts using the Sabaoth Fighter
04Is it fun to play as it?
Yep
its lasers are fantastic
Also Jinkins' aircraft, the Freefall, is awesome
I also love Nym's yellow missile beam things
Which Jinkins also has
04Cluster Missiles?
yep
I love those, Drake
They bypass shields
04Yeah XD
The mines on the other hand
were pretty useless
04I remember trying to take down the Saboath Destroyer with them on that tug level
04Yeah
oh lmao
I've noticed how most of the stuff on the left arrow thingy
04Take down the Destroyer. Crap, THERE'S ANOTHER
are useless
shockwave, mines, etc.
lmao
04What, like Force Shockwave?
04That was terrible
04The last mission was awesome, right?
it was alright
I preferred the 14th mission/heart of the storm
where you had the Ion Cannon and also had to defeat Bella
I did that with a Sabaoth Fighter
so fun
04XD
04The one where Nym uses the Ion Cannon against the Destroyer with the Hex Missiles will always be my favourite
Basically when I used Nym's craft the first time
heh
Anyway
I'm off to play some starfighter
and then KH
I cbf to deal with my computers today
04XD kay
04Cya NS
oh yeah Drake
04?
the PS2 has to be one of my favourite gaming systems
the only thing I have to say about it
is slow loading times
due to it being a disk system
04XD
PS2 has all the star wars games <3
LOL
anyway
off
google offers to translate an italian restraunt page into english
(it was in english already)
oh god I have a pile of lolly wrapper on my desk

that'd be what you call a ghost
12Ohai Drake
04What're you up to?
12Creating a new team on PO
04What does it involve?
04Like
04what Pokemon are you aiming for?
a big shroomish and barboach
04XD
12So far I've chose Azelf, Gliscor and Kingdra
04Ohgeez Axelf
04Azelf*

1212XD
04m*

04XD
Anyway
bored, I'm going to go do some scripting

hmm
03ugggggggggh I feel so sick
03I woke up at like 4am and threw up a few times :/
o.o
03missed my 8am class, too
Eat something bad?
03apparently my alarm was playing for an entire 30 minuters
03-r
03and I didn't hear it
03o.o
03which is odd as it's pretty f'ing loud
0931 Eat something bad?
03I'm not sure
03actually maybe
03does cream cheese go bad if it's at room temp for too long?
Probably?
03then probably
03it's weird though
03at my work, they'd have cream cheese just sitting out
Depends
03never refridgerated
03this kind I had in the fridge
03and the fridge was so cold it *froze* it
03so I let it thaw
03perhaps for too long
it could go for an hour or two
03as it was all...weird when I went to eat it
03oh it wasn't more than an hour or two
03probably around an hour
/me shrugs
It tasted odd?
03no, it tasted fine
Please don't describe it in any detail 'cause I think I'll be sick if you do.
03but the texture of it was a bit weird
03OK
03I think it's just a classic case of "I ate too much"
03but for some reason my stomach is weird and I don't get a stomachache until like 12 hours later
03>_>
Join the club.
Takes time to digest food
That's why you do not feel the effect til later
03well you can usually feel *full* right away
03for me it just skips that stage entirely LOL
03well, sometimes
Like the morning after so it looks like I've had alcohol :'D
03yeah that's what usually happens to me
03I'll wake up in the morning with a stomachache
03never at night
03only in this case I couldn't even make it through the night x.x
ohey DRF
Wake up sick as hell, but I can't vomit to make the pain stop
03My Radeon HD card sold
03to some dude in Brazil
03$175
Worst. Feeling. Ever.
03yeah I know what you mean
03it's not like I *want* to throw up
03and usually I don't, it's only if it's bad enough
03that my body just goes "OK this is enough"
03http://sb016.100tbh.com/Proxy/ <- oh hey
03my seedbox finally processed the order, gave me a free proxy xD
wow

blocked for proxy
yet
03ah
Sure you don't
the other link works
:D
03that's funny, too
03since that whole site is devoted to piracy
03they basically just split up the server and let you torrent with it
03hence the term seedbox
I think I re
03...OK that wind is REALLY LOUD
Remember you talking about that*
03my windowshades are rattling like crazy cuz I keep the window open
03as it gets hotter outside though I might close it

03I love how the word iPod is never misspelled with autocorrect :P

03came across this page for the Australian Department of Defence
03I was like
Brit spelling best spelling >;3
03why the frick did they misspell it
03LOL Xanbreon that seedbox site finally set up my account
03and wer elike "oh sorry, we've added any days on"
Good jorb
03because they sent me an email a few days ago saying it was ready
03and failed to provide me the actual URL
03>_>
Who did you go with?
03100tbh
Aahh
03that µTorrent webGUI is fancy
No clue if they suck or not btw
03XD
03I'll find out
Did you bother reading reviews?
03so I was like sure, why not
03it's cheap enough where I can just pay for 1 month and see if it works
Its leasesweb isnt it?
Meh
03yes
03I hate leaseweb to
03*too
03but we/
To much seedbox is why they suck

03I prolly can make do with that
03but would prefer to not be running torrents off it
03alright let's see if what.cd allows this site
Nice
Those backpacks with initials
"MEH"
03XD
03yeah I had DRF on mine and got so many people making fun of me for it >_>
They shouldnt care about the site
Just about the client
03My initials are awesome but if people say it as "durf" I rage
OI-o
durrrfffff
03that's wha tI mean
:D
03the ratio tracker sites I use
03whitelist a very few
Drf why
03even µTorrents have specific ones
03because everybody was like "LOL HI DURF" every time I walked by them
oh
03>_>
Hahah

no idea about wifi/3G :p
prolly 3G since it's silver
oh wait
HML, this isn't an iPad but some lookalike ICS tablet :P
he has it in a case so I wasn't sure
i'll have to figure out if there is a way to fix my L+R buttons
Oh good
Anyway, I saw some girl's laptop BSOD randomly
I said that I haven't had a BSOD on here yet
:D
(Technically, it is true, software BSOD wise)
Now bbs, rebooting n' disk check while going home ;D
I have no idea what I'm doing :|
this class
so confusing
x.x
gah
i need to get a DS that actually has working shoulder buttons
Yo Jun you there?
I think he went AFK
damn
i wanted to ask if he knew about a program.
/me sighs
whats wrong drf? :(
this class is just completely overwhelming
aww :(
is it that too much work is being given out or too much to take in at once or something?
it's super confusing math. LOL
oh.
XD
:/
and I have a programming assignment that I have no idea how to do
13oh I forgot to change my nick earlier
13ah well, brb |D
heh
I am sorry drf but that kinda sound ironic to me
dude, I'm not as smart as I act
I know how to use computers. that's not the same as programming
I think I understand this now
might have to go to the pawn shop and buy a DS
just so i have a DS i can plug an AR into and use the L+R controls
heh
well
you can take apart the DSi and manually trigger the L/R
they're just toggle switche
s
you think it might be a mechanical issue?
it usually is
it's pretty hard to break the toggle buttons LOL
byebye
i dont have the tools to open it
a screwdriver?
also hm
do you have the AR with USB connectivity?
o-o
6There is a database of potatoes. Ovo
when you get back
i don't have a screwdriver small enough
6</randomfact>
and yes, usb
database of pokemon :D

03back
04Just tired
03yes
10What was it?
1212Pokemon
/me dies
04XD
03basically
03XD
03and well
03not just anime
044 Kids was good at dubbing the Pokemon Anime
03live action movies too
03just not a fan
04But now I'm used to Ash's other voice.
1212same
03I just don't watch the new anime
03>BW
03someone hand me a 10 foot pole
03and then remind me not to touch it with that
1212I liked the change, although some of the Pokemon are stupid
03try all?
10I was curious cuz I am strongly against the Puella Magi dub. It's coming from someone who has seen the original a bazillion times and gaah
10They butchered all the voices
1212but hey, what gen doesn't have stupid Pokemon? :'D
03also they made the CHARACTERS stupid
03Ash "How do I catch a Pokémon again?"
03Yeah OK no, changing the channel
04You throw a Pokeball.
04No, Ash, you forgot to turn your hat around.
03and Skylands, I hate Japanese VAs most of hte time
03they hurt my ears
03stupid high-pitched females LOL]
10Well
10English VAs are surprisingly too girly/high for my likes
03well seeing is believing :P
03or rather, hearing'
1212with me it depends on the anime
1212like, they did a awesome job on the english dubs for Code Geass
03that's funny you say that
03I actually just bought the dub DVDs of that show
03and I plan to watch it when my laptop is fixed
03yes I can watch stuff on my desktop but >distractions
1212nice
10Second DVD came out
03of what
10The dub
03of PMMM?
10Yeah
03that's still not the whole show :P
10drf, just sayin'
03that was for Code Geass
03LOL
03why would I pay for PMMM when it costs an arm and a leg?
1212LOL people who want there to be a season 3 of code geass. >won’t be happening
1212It would ruin the story
03there's a season 2?
03what I have is the first half of season 1 I believe
1212yep
10Huh
10Wait
Anyone doing anythign intereesting here?
10What did you BUY
10Specify
1212a season of Code Geass
