How many are in yours?
It's for everyone. Luna's setting up the movies.
AT THE MAGNETO
lol

the streamer is playing the music in the background
lol
Oh yes. Would you look at that. This works.
Me too... I need the rest of the time before season 2 for sleep. :P

VULCANOO!!!
2,14 lol dunno. Dari did all of the structuring for that :P
omg
AAWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAH
we should watch the pony anthology, clean version
omg...
is there possibly an issue with adblock programs and choosing rooms?
Uhoh
Heh.
But what's the diference? Does it has something to do with the IRC channel?
(and probably for other reasons that I'm not network-savvy enough to know)
nooo spoilers!

07Thanks for all the requests everypony
...
this is just embarassing
Poor Applejack.
Epic guitar solo!
/me is embarassed slightly by his IRC client fucking up
somewhere towards the end of this song, there's a point where Scoot's VA cracks up, but it's covered by the music
hmm
07I'm preparing to switch to the mane-show soon
YES!!
Oh hus.
Nice sun.
Comedy at it's finist
CMC's FTW
Looks menacing.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
No such thing as too much pony

i just spoiled part of episode 2 for myself.
!
=(
There is no line of that sort
i would be emberaced if i did that..
Okay, I tried to access the room through BronyState.net but absolutely none of the rooms are letting me in
DONT TOP BELIVEING!
yes it does
:(
Has it been crossed when you can recite 6 of Season 1 songs by heart and name 74 of the characters of the show?
spicey is good
oops
more smoke!
yep. no such line.
aw
07Ehmm it was a request :)
most of the time
............
wrong song :P
Stupid ad in the way
"more steam"
i swear for a song meant to be bad it's pretty good
Darn!
wow
XD
k
wackyteen aw man, that sucks. I've been trying my hardest to stay unspoiled, outside of the non-discord screen shots.
i got kicked because i said this song isn't good?
How do I get to this room via MIRC?
I hope the stream tomorrow won't be this low of a quality?
Damn autojoins.
07I know.. i'm not even using mibbit!
take the house down
yes you did
05nope, it was the way you said it, and that you repeated yourself
^
well i was avoiding spoilers
However...
Also, you check EqD about two dozen times a day
Hey, could you make the song worse?
It's not meant to be good, Chang
but i somehow have had it happened regardless
^ i just hope they come through with the mobile stream
The S2 stream is very good quality.
Dat running
Oops
i said this song is bad
that's the point
Even though the voices aren't that good.
omgomgomgomg is this the intermission
They're OK.
sti wrong song

I'm totally doing air guitar right now.
That's all? Still not crossed.
07not during weekdays
<_<
Yes it is
I recall seing one a few weeks ago
Daniel Ingram has a "good version" somewhere
it it doesn't make my cry it's not too spicey :P
I wanna hear it
Ow
