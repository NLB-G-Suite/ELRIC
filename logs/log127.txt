10 million FLuttershys. You get a pony! And you get a pony! Everybody gets a pony!
I would love this song (fireflies) if the singers voice wasn't so autotuned.

I know
garuntee at 9am its going to be so hecktic in here
i would want Fluttershy to snuggle me to sleep :o

Àllo, everypony. I`d say I'm excited for season 2 ep1 but I've already seen the entirety of season 2. And 3. Well, seasons 2-46 to be honest. Not really, though, but that's how many seasons are made. By then, ponies overwhelm humans in population, so the life of the show becomes real and a new series is started with the real life renditions of the ponies.

Have a look for a tab at the top of the chat.
0Heyy

Flutteryay i know. It's not very respectful
#bronystate should be open and it has 300+ people.
#the_moon
Denied_Existance has been here for a while
This chat will fill up eventually
lulululululululululu
07Fall try clearing your cache
I can't help but feel that someone has too much time on their hands, but this is still awesome
And yeah, I have studies too, so I'm not always so active...

RAWRity: , i dont either
Wooo! S2 is less than 24 hours away!! MY BODY IS READY!
0It's like calling him-/herself Hi
don't overdo it bronyguy
3Hi RAWRity
Reminds me of the pre-wwII computers which took up an entire aircraft hanger
I wonder, if they used some 3rd party program to build these things in Minecraft? They surely didn't run around and put the blocks piece by piece.
4Sent a PM to interior_gummy
this is still less hardcore than the guy who made a whole computer in minecraft
Sir_Hoofalot, any relation to sir-tommy-hooves?
RAWRity - Have you played the full version? The free version is not much to talk about
I'd say my body is ready too, but it's only 13 minutes after midnight and I'm already feeling sleepy
0Winter Wrap-Up!
there's only 6 people here
07this is amazing
0'Cause tomorrow Spring is Here!
this is kind of putting me to sleep
i bought the full version during the alpha
Okay, I think this cinched it. I'm going to get Minecraft my next Paycheck.
0This is awesome
Twilight is obviously best mane pony
I wish I had enough patience to do this in MC
o ok thx :D
:)
this is one of the best I've seen
0WHoever made this needs a minecraft song creator cutie mark
SOLO
I played the trial version, but I didn't like it
3These minecrafters have WAY too much time on their hands...
0just imagine how long it took to build this
asking my skype RPG group their IRC names as we set up via here a good few months back so are all regs
we can do it,Apokalipse!
Though considering how annoying Endermen are I wouldn't bother even if I could >.>
I CANT FUCIKNG SEE IT
my fav minecraft song is "cutie mark crusading"
aaaaaand then suddenly a creeper
My next paycheck already has SWTOR written on it. lol
3Not that I think that is a bad thing.
05mind yer language
It says the connection has timed out
i kind of wonder why i have patience to play minecraft...
The structure of this says it was built using a minecraft song creator.
huh
they go down pretty easely
3KanyeEast lol
a guy made a computor on minecraft?
the_mole a friend of mien let me play the full version (i think) on their computer. I just didn't get the big deal. They'd played it up as the biggest greatest game ever...I didn't see it
i only ever mine things, i never build things
Latest minecraft patch has a creativity mode in which you can make anything instantly
Yeah! *brohoofs best fort*
Not that it makes it much easier.

3I just realized that those lyrics are all a logical paradox
dreeeeeeEEeeeEEEeEeeEEeEeeeEeEeeEeEEeeeEEesssssss
it would be madness
I've been using IRC for ages but yeah it made me think of Ghosties too
0hmm
MORE MORE
This chat is slower that what I would expect from 320 ponies...
yeah, I'm pretty sure those dresses are pro bono
Well you don't want to make it too much cooler, then it starts losing it's other aspects.
YES
0Lol? Elektro?
0Now play Winter Wrap up!!!!
DoctorWhooves How many people can fit in the tardis?
denied_existence how?
nothing's happening when i click on the rooms
group and ungroup
I thought Ghosties when I saw it too :3

There should totally be something like bots on IRC, in my honor of course.
/me 11will brb for a moment. Setting up. :D
frezezy pony?
lol, No one uses this chat
If you refresh the theatre page you will see our new room setup.
=D
you get IRC bots
>mfw there is
I know :P
Yes, it would. Although I do have 1 sock puppet nickname that's just for the sake of 1 joke.
hey every pony!
It allows you to join one of our main6 rooms and joins you to this room.
post link...
3Do not adjust the dial, we are now in control of your television screen.
hello?
/me is an IRC bot or might as well be
RBD!
And that it was viewed as a strength by Twilight in her letter to Princess Celestia.
I'm thinking of writing one, TBH, since I saw that you can write XChat scripts in Python
And He's not even connected at the moment.
3We control the horizontal, we control the vertical.
This room will eventually be throttled, restricting how often you can post messages, because if we get more than 1000+ people in here this will be out of control.
2,14 we are assuming control....
GOD. ART OF THE DRESS?
AGAIN
wtf
Double song?
4Yes, hello
Dash is best pony.
wow this chat is popular....
So no one will ever know when I'm idle...
Fluttershy room ftw
i can just see all the spam
4Welcome to the Rainbow_Dash room
So the main 6 rooms will be unrestricted, but you can only be in one of the 6 rooms at a time.
3Dont correct me Va! I can fail if I want to!
lol
booyah
Riiiight, tabs...
woo
One of the few times Pinkie is incorrect about something
Rarity's still a great character on the show, just not my favorite after that
That's pretty much it.

Yay! There's more people in this room!
Had to do something.
Thanks for listening to me everyone.

And now I can't get in to the stream. :(
RARITY ROOM IS BEST ROOM.

>mfw I cant choose any room

Um. I click but nothing happens
Yes they are. I'm in one right now.

Applejack Room is tempting.

It needs to be about 20% cooler.
4But you can't be in multiple main rooms

Tomorrow are you prepared?
3ValtheJean Stop trying to change the foundation!

When I pick a room nothing happens.
Is everyone else seeing the end of a youtube video?
Hi!

yeah
video player

hm....that would be pretty cool if they do
that was the worst performance i'd ever heard
:P
I agree with Spike
yes
ja
I am
>not using Irssi
i love this one so much
0!yay

It wouldn't surprise me if they did.

Na. They'll prolly just throw in Bon Bon sitting like Lyra lol.
yay
So Many Wonders. Ugh.
yea!
any way I'm joining TS perma now

Knights of canterlot version was better :p
magneto is a rarity fan
somewhy was expecting YapLap singing of this song
that would be amazing
i love it when she says: cute little bunnys. Its so cute :o
wait, then what do you mean by you can't be in multiple rooms?
Yes, I love everythiiiiiiiiiing!
0anyone know where I can find the version of this with a tough sounding guy singing
this is why Fluttershy needs more songs in S2
brb, i gotta go downstairs for a while
Can't wait till the episode!
still can't get into the rooms when I restarted the browser.
will be up when movie airs i hope
VLC = video player. Huh?

Thank you, WhatPayne.
This is why I hate Fluts.
Ahh
So nice and quiet
<3
0So...many...rooms...clogging my IRC
Pinkie Pieeeee
magneto is a fan of everything

Confound this new video-screen, it has no refresh-button.
0Wait, one channel?
07well just 1 or 2 more
wow... FLuttershy sounds a lot like Pinkie when singing
It's nice in here.
0I die laughing everytime I hear it, but I've never found it
Dunno then
0Yay ill totally come to your party Pinkie!!!!
Not this again...
2,14 :P
But http://bronystate.net/theatre/ does not really work.
07I was setting up for the movies
vlc plays everything
ha ha. ikr/
Try a different browser maybe? seemed to work for someone.
She'd only learned about them, not that she didn't know they existed.
I just love how pinkie says "party" in this song xD
I love Pinkie Pie's invitation song :D
It won't be the same without you So we hope that you say yes
so cuuuute1
2,14 it's refined and dignified, like our fashionista pony :P
/me has to switch between this and #BronyState :\
I will use all the rooms available, and some that aren't
one channel for the mane six
Singing Telegram is a nice song
and I mean EVERYTHING
d
I got the telegram Pinkie.
The website works on Chrome, but not Firefox apparently
would be on brnystate chat but so many people
I got that same issue. I suspect that they're working on fixing it, or confused because they CAN use it. :P
:)
same voice actor... i know... but wow, having a shy and pinkie song back to back really points it out
0Pinkie Pie is best pony
bronystate*
0WITH MAGNETOOOOOOOO
Oh. you guys made those already... I see.
Ah. In that case, I'll find my last one to prepare everyone for the B movie.
There are 24 people in this room, and I'm the only one talking...
and it just spam so many messages
how long left till episodes start?
There'll be at least 1,000 people in here in 8 hours or so.
Well of course darling! Would we have it any other way?
:(
Those with problems to join: write http://bronystate.net/theatre/<pony>
Yeah. I like that one.
heh
Huh? the screen frozen or something?
0oh jeez
I'm having trouble with ads...
So, why did we split the chat?
STREAMING GUY, WE WANT VIDEO!
'bout two movies until season 1
Did anyone here manage to get the rooms work?
i dunno
07ads?
No.
the FF version of co.cc is what I'm using and it works
2,14 that's why we have these rooms :P
Pony Pokey!
0episodes don't start until after both movies
I did.
Nope.
2,14 flood control ;)
07get a ad killer :)
Pinkie makes good songs but Fluttershy makes cute songs..
Oh.
I'm in Rarity room.
Eenope.
yep
It seems like the new layout is against firefox.
am i to early for the pre show marathon?
Me too
Where did it redirect you?
Eh, I'm just here for the movies.
They keep playing and popping up over the stream and I can't close them.
Curse thee irony!
anyway lunafanatic what did you mean with "the one with soldier?"
sorry chat lag
countown
2,14 Rarity Room is best Room <.< >.>
http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/ works, although the random (and, thankfully, rare) streambreaks are irksome.
9wait for the rooms to fill
its pre-show atm
i guess it does...never noticed that. oh, on the first episode, did anyone notice the nightmare moon in the hourglass?
Yes
I'm in Fluttershy room.

Yeah...
I tested it on FireFox

I'm just here for the jokes.
D
And I had no problem

COME OUT!!!
I'm in the Rainbow Dash Room
Flameshy: Use "/join CHANNELNAME"

To keep too many people from talking at once?
Come out!

kayne

yep
COME OUT!!!!and YOU WILL LOVE ME!!!!!!!!!!

Its just audio.
normal movie days*
But yeah, I'm in #Twilight_Sparkle
At the magneto!
how did Pinkie Pie know how to sing those lyrics
oh fluttershy ^^
AT THE GALA
As a general rule, I tend to like Ponies best when they're in Psycho-mode.
manually the http://bronystate.net/theatre/<pony name> works
How many are in yours?
It's for everyone. Luna's setting up the movies.
0AT THE GALA WITH MAGNETO!
AT THE MAGNETO
lol
is it just me, or does Fluttershy sound a bit like rarity when she says "Come Out" there?
the streamer is playing the music in the background
yay
My favorite song! Nope...
lol
AT THE GALA... WOOOH!
Oh yes. Would you look at that. This works.
Me too... I need the rest of the time before season 2 for sleep. :P
OK I'm entering this in IRC. Because Twilight is best pony
:D
AH AH AH AHHHHH
yay
LOOP VERSION
Opening
:D
i can sing this looping without stop.
Basically, we had more viewers on the 3hr pre-show, so I can't imagine how will it be on the premiere
Has anyone read Cupcakes?
my little magneto
aww
It's sad, I only know one other brony in real life
11Alright, so how many of you are intending to stay up ALL NIGHT for the event?
At me?
I did
2,14 I can see that a little RAWRity :P
Thank you GoldenSandslash, joined through the channel link. Whatever works. :P
Pff

Though my friends will be wiered out
You are so right. She is best pony

Awesome writing

Silverscreen: Well, me, obviously :P
0what event?
Sibsy said Twilight is the best pony. Then she really is! nuff said
Get what to work?

9I'm not
It was split because of the chaos that would result in #BronyState from all of the people.
0don't you know you are my best minnniiooooooooonnnns
Juicy!
Is there going to be Silverscreen Trivia?
9and I'll be the one streaming

The sound is Ok, but the video couold have been better.
9I'm just that skilled
I'm here for the all-nighter.
Juicy in deed.
I can't choose best pony...
~yay~
Then again, I woke up around noon.
thought it might be your work
Yes, at you, magneto
sup
And Magnets make it all complete!
Frankly the main reason I chose this channel. :P
could be
I prepared in advance >3>
lol
:/
FOREVER!!!!
i dont know any bronies in real life, all my friends think im a nutter
inb4juicy
I really should code this auto join with a shorter delay on kick
as that was stupid
this chat is in a rather inconvenient position.
I know one in real life.
11How are you preparing to do so?
Yup
Most via Internet though
What is this (the best) channel for?
VULCANOO!!!
2,14 lol dunno. Dari did all of the structuring for that :P
Will this stream be in HD?
omg
AAWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAH
we should watch the pony anthology, clean version
hey guys i tried the new website, but the theatre buttons don't work
My cousins are into MLP now.
something about the red soldier being sent to equstrian
so can I aska questiong to everyone here? What is the magneto joke? IDGI
omg...
i got to irl brony friends
is there possibly an issue with adblock programs and choosing rooms?
Half of my friends are bronies, half of them think i'm insane
Uhoh
Heh.
I have a group of brony friends.
But what's the diference? Does it has something to do with the IRC channel?
(and probably for other reasons that I'm not network-savvy enough to know)
nooo spoilers!
SPOILER ALERT!
true
9well
Spike loves Rarity!
two*
Same
oh no...
Yeppers.
sooooooooooo much lag
Being awesome

hahahahaha
What.
What?!
WHAT
oh
nope
RARITY LOVES SPIKE???

NO WAI
I'm dumbfounded.

Fallen: Are you having problems joining?

Aaaaaaah...
SPIKE HAS A cRUSH ON RARITY OMG WTF BBQ

And really
0lies
9you'll see something new on the mane chat later
I love Twilight. If you told me a year ago that I would say that I'd look at you like u told me I eat poopie
Splitting it up into six channels at least makes sure that people can follow the conversation. Somewhat.
07Warm welcome you all :)
11So how are you all preparing for it?
that is not unrealistic
lol
so we could talk a bit. if thats okay with you...
9hold on to your horses
I'm sorry, twilight, I missed that...what?
mine has the mane6 launched to TF2
the show is ruined!
i could get the channels to appear, but i can't get anything to happen when i click a channel picture
2,14 as I understand it, it was an advertisement during the bronychat stream
the theatre choice buttons on the new site didn't work
Sup

Bacon strips

'Tater chips
Silverscreen: dual screen :D
2,14 outside of that, I have no idea
I'm willing to bet that there are some insane people who'll have all 6 channels open, of course.
>mfw not much more people present in chat
Do you think there will be need of more rooms when S2 is starting?
Chillin.
Dividing the chat by six was very wise
I'd only eat these if they got me to Equestria.
07Less spam amd less speedy chat
Chips. Nice and salty
11Nice.

Twilight is rather good at winking.

0I love the music when Pinkie goes all psycho
Starting with the same "My Little Pony Melody" but then change into something new.
The BGM on this show is just fantastic.

^There will be a extended one.
episode 2 lol
/me 13is so tired

11Caff-Pow! It is 1 part Red Bull, 1 part NOS Energy, and then filled to the brim with a selected flavor of punch drink. :D

07Hello WhatPayne
Pixles.. Dosen't it for me
It is epic.
Well, there's be a lot of heated trolling. But mostly just arguing over which is best.
Honesty!
I'm using Google chrome
Aw man, I really like the "End of Harmony" comic on EqD
how are you today man?
and find the http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/Rainbow-light.swf
Where was Gondor when i couldn't see the stream.
/me 13hugs people back <3
Kindness!
2,14 are your roomies here with us Octy? :P
Time for low quality...
the server at www.vemi.com has timed out
kind of sad that nearly all fanfiction involving Nightmare moon as a seperate entity despict her as an evil tyrant
RAWRity nuu if he likes flutter shy then #Fluttershy is better
hm...i had no problem at all, thats wierd.
I'm gonna have to man it up and go to see it
Cool.
11SirReginald: That's what the drink's based off off.
I can hear them in my head,because I can remmeber what they say
Laughter!

Laughter!

Hi Luna!

Hey guys.
/me hugs everyone
I hate the cold.

Superbrony: A very awkward theatre setup.
The stream needs more leverage!
Loalty!
And Loyalty, naturally.
yeah, but uh, im on the luna republic...tee hee
05nyx, please make sure you are at bronystate.net
Loyalty!

While we're at it.
Hello
Winter needs more fire.
hello everypony
... and a bigger boat
I'm sorry to hear that, DoctorValor.
might just be my firfox being derped
Close, but not quite BronyGuy :P
My opinion: Twilight > Rainbow > Rarity > Fluttershy > Pinkie > Applejack
nyx are you on bronystate.net?
9steram is working fine. Try the popout http://www.owncast.tv/embed.php?u=Wild%20Dance%20of%20Machine%20God&vw=700&vh=585
16-30+ males on one side, the other side little girls with their parents.
11What's that?
i'd say she was under some kind of magic not from equestria
inb4 Rainbow blast
though all the bronies showing up would scare away the families
/me hugs Windblow
Well time for the first energy drink
Natleyn, sorry I missed your question initially. I'm using Firefox
07Hello everyone
/me hugs Windblow

Magic!
Fluttershy is better than rbd
Magic!

At least today I know I won't run out
Ahh.
DAT DEUS EX MACHINA
RAWRity Yeah but your forgetting That Fluttershy is. And the most cutest =3.
and i'm using firefox
The whole thing: http://www.livestream.com/thebronyshow/video?clipId=pla_77bf60f1-0fd3-40e7-a19c-97b9777b335e
You guys ready for an awesome night?
I fail at spelling, sorry
What would I even by a spy for?
Has the movie started!?
I couldnt click the pony rooms when I used adblock, I had to open the link in a seperate window
http://www.livestream.com/thebronyshow/video?clipId=pla_77bf60f1-0fd3-40e7-a19c-97b9777b335e
That link probably won't work just by itself DCD
works fine for me
I would never have guessed. What with your name being themed to the sun and all. xD
drakmoth you say that, but then Art of The Dress happened.
Oops, sorry
uhhhhh
Epicness
You need to click the popout button.
a Deus EX? I never asked for this...

9hmm true
9anyways click the button
TASTE THE RAINBOW
lol
Np, i have a hard time spelling sometimes too
Quite all right BronyGuy. I'm a linguist so I tend to get grammar-nazi at times.
And they never wear that jewlery again...
WhatPayne: I know Chrome checks the page source for updates every once in a while, but since Firefox has the Reload Frame option, it checks it less often
escuse me?
nehh we all have diffrent opinions RAWRity so there is no best pony
taste the rainbow
TASTE IT
11I can't see
taste the raibow mutha fucka
MLP being awesome. I never asked for this
taste the rainbow mo-fo
Yeah, got plenty of Coke Zero and if that fails I have coffee.
Ofcourse!!
0All the ponies are awesome in their own way, I love them all <3
No offense is intended, I assure you. I'm just OCD. :P
:D
yay
Why so many Sirs?
Tastes like skittles.
That MIGHT be why choosing a room was so hard.
Though theres no point in argue that Fluttershy is the cutest.
3<3 my new TAGHeuer watch.
Windblow, no colors :l
Pony Pokey
The funneh starts 50 mins in I think
no pony is best pony? BLASPHEMY

Same here
You're Pitiful ftw.
Hm... So how I can fix that one?
mfw there's apparently a pony dance that includes shaking hands
cupcakes
I really dislike anything sugarfree. I hate the taste of sweetener
Lyra is best pony
thats her back right.
o.O
The_Watcher is EVERYWHERE
I really hope they have a Celestia based episode in Season 2
or colgate
I'm a GRAMMER-nazi, I just fail at spelling, especially when typing fast.
Can I ask a question?
did rainbow dash's eyes just derp?
07sure
Damn straight
The Bitchprince
oh noez
the prince is rude
I'm a huge grammar nazi
I did with the sweetener they used before, aspartame or whatever it's called
COME OUT!!!
lol
someone fix the channels for me /cry
Gummy is best pony.
Wow. You didn't once realise your name contains 'luna'? =P
COME OUT
the prince is gay
Wow, 12:40am... where's that?
I need to find something to keep me awake
I would have called her "Aquafresh" actually
I'm still deciding whether or not I'm going to go te sleep :D
Absolutely vile stuff
same here, actually
INTO THE GALA
B movie out?
I hate people who abuse the word "however." That word should be used rarely, if ever.
Sweden.
Much better than dinky page
METAL THINGS
You realise I will have to end you for that BronyGuy?
Her yeaaah there is so cute
YES
Annoying ads are annoying. And in the way. :[

i cant load stresm, is that just me?
Winter wrap-up, FTW!
07from now on bronystate.net is our mane-site

Yeah, trying to decide if i should stay awake or sleep at some point, 14 hours...so long heh
It's not.
Brony state
Really? How so?
Um. Doesn't this system disperse people somewhat?
Yes
Question?
Because Aquafrsh has 3,3 in one protection for your family
Lagmobile how do they work though
No killing allowed till season 2
whoops nvm
lol that sounds like a very bad idea, GabeMoist
"He usually skipped the editorials, as he was only prepared to read the word 'however' so many times in a 150-word article."
:P
At the Gala, welcoming ponies to their doom.
here play this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqlpHa0pk8E&feature=mh_lolz&list=WL030B65418A119681

WINTERR WRAPP UPP
Winter Wrap-Up! (sry can't resist)
Winter warp up!Winter warp up!
Twilight's singing voice is awesome!
RAWRity: ...selfcest? still gay
11*bobs head to song*
NONSENSE
I don't mind chewing gum with aspartame though strangely
07We still have a general room for everypony
lol it looked like spike was humping twilight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8BYBaDz0Ic
pure caffiene
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Waitm so when is the movie?
Yeah, haha
wrong channel for that
Spike is actually the best pony.
:D
And then /pony/'s Applejack Guy was here! And boy is it dead in this room.
OM nom nom
so if we can agree on anything, I think it's that Rarity and Fluttershy need a duet in S2
0717 mins
it's narcissism
I'm afraid I'll go to sleep and come back to a stream with zero slots left...
^
11VicViper: NO vid links in this channel
k
Twilight's Song-voice is actually another woman.
Pratchett remains a fantastic author. :P
Yeah. That's good I guess...
Tottally
BRONY STATE Y U NO Show Different Videos
bjornfot It's not gay, it's masturbation!
We need a spike room
If you want to request a video, post in #vinyl_scratch

RAWRity is correct

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o69uXgYQ8iA
Carrot Top?
awesome
I can recommend him. I'll warn you though, he's a bit of a marmite-author. Some people will adore him, others will think "eh, can't get into it"
What time is the live streaming of the new episode?
Luchadeer: Ouch. That's not nice.
k.
Let's hope Derpy Hooves will have some lines in this season.
Deadlypony uses IE?
However

Oh Gawd
Pooo-oonies

OMG I have a remix of this on my iPod too

Isn't there a really good remix of this?
i hate this crap so much
0This is so awesome <3
Twilight
god i hope they release the good version of this song
I like the Alex S. remix
that's why it's a live stream
07Thanks for all the requests everypony
...
So crappy.
HEY SUPERBRONY
Brb Bronies, gonna play some Magicka.
Sorry, I'm listening to his fucking broadcast and he just insinuated that Bronies "probe their anal passages" with My Little Pony dolls
this is just embarassing
Poor Applejack.
Epic guitar solo!
/me is embarassed slightly by his IRC client fucking up
So I'm still trying to figure out where the line is of "too much pony"
somewhere towards the end of this song, there's a point where Scoot's VA cracks up, but it's covered by the music
hmm
07I'm preparing to switch to the mane-show soon
YES!!
Oh hus.
Nice sun.
Comedy at it's finist
I'm so dumb
This a PMV of a Justin Bieber song?
CMC's FTW
Well all the rooms will probably be full tomorrow, we have 350 people and BMN hasn't even started yet.
Looks menacing.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Luna, what was that Electro Flutter video? o-o
I swear, most of the music from FIM sounds better in 8-bit
No such thing as too much pony
That line does not exist, dave
That makes no sense... I love pony logic"
also totally have a IRC for beginners tab up
/me it's what you get for coding one out of boredem
i just spoiled part of episode 2 for myself.
!
=(
07I won't play any new requests at this point
Finally, I got off of internet Explorer: STUPID!
3Owned by Wrek
I love Indian food, I always get the spiciest thing on the menu.
There is no line of that sort
i would be emberaced if i did that..
Okay, I tried to access the room through BronyState.net but absolutely none of the rooms are letting me in
0It would be awesome with Sweetie Belle singing this song
This system is untested though, so I'm just working out the problems. <_<
I CAN SEE THE VIDEO :D! YAAAYY!!!
DONT TOP BELIVEING!
What the heck
yes it does
:(
Has it been crossed when you can recite 6 of Season 1 songs by heart and name 74 of the characters of the show?
oops
more smoke!
yep. no such line.
YEA! rock on!
aw
07Ehmm it was a request :)
most of the time
............
wrong song :P
They always warn me "no, you don't know what you're doing, whitey"
I don't really enjoy spicy...
Stupid ad in the way
"more steam"
lulz
yes, protect us from the barbarians at the gate prince
Wasn't there a vid of a bunch of bronies singing this?
Try to use a different browser if your not getting into the rooms :D
i swear for a song meant to be bad it's pretty good
in one shot the hanging things had one eye, the next they had 2
DeadlyPony, what did you do to fix it?
Darn!
wow
XD
k
So is it weird that I'm more stoked for tomorrow than I was for my birthday yesterday?
wackyteen aw man, that sucks. I've been trying my hardest to stay unspoiled, outside of the non-discord screen shots.
It's so hard to find x.x
nope DaveKenroy
i got kicked because i said this song isn't good?
cmc y do you rouck so hard
Nope, still not crossed.
How do I get to this room via MIRC?
I love the Alex S. remix of this.
I hope the stream tomorrow won't be this low of a quality?
Damn autojoins.
Use a different browser other than Internet explorer
07I know.. i'm not even using mibbit!
take the house down
@AllisZero, nope
Am I the only one that can't open stream w/out having my internet derp like a mother fucker?
yes you did
So is this room system used from now on, even when there's no hundreds of ppl on line say in weekdays. Or will you revert back to #bronystate?
Or is it just because it's youtube 'n all?
05nope, it was the way you said it, and that you repeated yourself
^
well i was avoiding spoilers
However...
I'm using Firefox. >_>
What the heck?
I still smell upcoming trolling though... I will be watching closely!
Also, you check EqD about two dozen times a day
It's just because it's youtube.
For example: this, Winter wrap-up, art of the dress, and the main theme
SCRAMOOSH SCARAMOOSH WILL YOU DO THE FANDANGO
For those who cannot see the video, they haven't shown the movie yet
Hey, could you make the song worse?
It's not meant to be good, Chang
MrChang this song is good actually.
but i somehow have had it happened regardless
I'm using Firefox and I still can't get in, I'll try Chrome
^ i just hope they come through with the mobile stream
The S2 stream is very good quality.
Ohai, Caboozles.
Dat running
Oops
i said this song is bad
that's the point
there is a vid of bronies singing this?
all sound better in 8-bit
i use firefox
That just means your a better fan then most of us. or, at least, better then me
Even though the voices aren't that good.
07The theme rooms will be used for events
Chrome is beast
omgomgomgomg is this the intermission
They're OK.
sti wrong song
it's meant to be bad
im on chrome and it wont load
Scootaloo, oh Scootaloo!
I'm totally doing air guitar right now.
right there, before she says "find out who we are"
That's all? Still not crossed.
07not during weekdays
I didn't know chickens could sing...
Its so bad its good.
<_<
firefox = best browser
Yes it is
say what?
I recall seing one a few weeks ago
Daniel Ingram has a "good version" somewhere
3Also, trolling tonight (A.K.A. not G4 movie) is curtesy of Bjornfot, who by chance is also the man in charge of the MLP dating sim. Please rage at him and PM him with questions/rage about the sim. Thanks!
I wanna hear it
Ow
i have Google Chrome..
its a challenge
eeeeyup
is it possible that you can make a Luna room? :)
i'm on chrome and I have no idea which room i'm in I said join Fluttershy so I assume I'm there
Is it a chrome issue? Do i have to use something else to see the magic?
i thought everypony does that :D
i need to see that vid!
This can't be the intermission, because the first movie didn't even start. lol
DONT MAKE ME GO TO SLEEP
Stream is lagging for me
PLEASE
firepony ftw
Hush now
But yeah, how long till movies?

3Magneto Nope, I mean the DATING SIM itself.

Why would i hurt my fist?

Well, my name is unique enough that nobody would be compelled to take it unless they want to immitate me
Tears coming out of your eyes?
*imitate
Sweetie bell scares the scootaloo right out of me
Hello there

Hi brah

Denies_Existence He already said, that shipping is involved in his game.
OH YEAH

Guys, any ideas why songs are being streamed? Kind of strange since it's a video stream.
I forget
MLP Them ovie
i never even heard of bronystate until i saw the announcement for the stream
Lag, wasn't that still on youtube?
The movie
mrponiator it's the MLP movie from 86
12am GMT for first movie. 10 minutes in other words.
G1
But Twilight is my favorite because I see qualities in her (and APplejack) that I wish I had.
Ah, right
ending music to the series
Right-o
Reminds me of Re: Your Brains
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjtzib0G9Rs&feature=player_embedded
no idea
The B movie is from Generation One
Never watched it
ya
I want to try a dating simulator of MLP :P Where is it at?
6Please :3
Technically, these are videos. From youtube.
*Applejack
Oh my god. This is the best thing ever.
in a music mood the streamer is
NYD
Denied_Existence: Just link them to http://gentlecolts.org already!
sme fans reupped it
Its not out yet
You mean work ethic and study ethic?
Is it the one with the rainbow of darkness or whatever?
lol
I'm in Twilight chat because I identify the most with her
a gift from heaven that was
07Will you become a regular now?
=\
I assume it's the long/good cut of Bladerunner?
YOU WA SHOCK
In development, SuperBrony64
oh oh and all of season 1 back to back?
Wat? Oh god what is this.
probably
evening stream
this is amazing
I relate to twilight the best, Always studying with no social life.
I blame the requests being made in Vinyl_Scratch channel.
Twilight and Applejack are my favorites cause they are the two I relate to best.
Right now it's video, right? Friendship is Power Metal CMC theme instrumental
in a yoda mood Dumori is
I'm in Twi chat cause i like her
hello
Heya
it's god's favorite song
Oh okay.
Am I the only one who sorta liked CMC's song?
Besides the awesome qualities of Twilight, she's also the cutest pony
‎/)^3^(\
Technically isn't Luna room which ever Luna is in?
Same here, BronyGuy
Yay Luna is in the best channel
hello doctor

Ooh, Portal 1 is free on steam today.

DaveKenroy Agreed!
Clever Dari...
Dem bangs

I just wish we had the good version
Suppose we could set up a Finnish brony channel for this, mareathon and the s2 premiere, WhatPayne?
what?
WAH

teamroom?
doctorvalor you knew it would happen eventually
SuperBrony64: wait for the premiere :D
.....lets see.... how about.... My Little Death Metal?
seriously?
lol I just wasn't sure if it was on pause or not
isn't quite prefect
That's the mod room!?
07yea for the bronystate team :)
Yeppers.
Zephirdd: *shivers*
yes, it's free until 9/20
Wasn't it an intermission ever 9 episodes?
i swear i heard somewhere a similiar tune like Cutie mark crusaders theme did..
Any reason I can't see the stream? Anything going on in there atm?
Wait, so there actually is room called Luna=
Metalocalypse Pony
?
dastrdlyW: Yup.
and I think you've had enough of my imperfect coding
07we need a home !
07:D
X3
Good news. Found my Heroes 3 disc today. Nostalgia rejoice
dastardlyW is correct.
bronystate.net doesn't work
6MFW I just see that you are done with requests >~< Sorry Luna D:
but I can hear that it's the CMC theme.... just doesn't sound very power metal...
Sooooo....is anyone planning to stay up for the whole marathon?
someone didn't get the memo :)
She's adorable on her own ^^
bastards at studio b and their song hoarding :)
Princess Selatcia, anyone?

I guess that's a no-go for us non teammates?
I am
any advice for geting my conection to stream to work?
o mai gosh o mai gosh o mai GOSH
ME!
Is this one of these games, where you can, once finished, actually find a Harem-route?
I am
It just occured to me how special today is...
Yes
Eeeeeenope
Why did he try to do that?
I'm guessing it's protected though. Highly.
nah
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
even if I have to take my notebook to my room
mib_okewmq: You at http://www.bronystate.net?
07correct ;)
:(
I just found that out 10 minutes ago. I already have the PS3 Orange Box, but it's nice to have it on PC too.
I am, but I don't count since I'm in Australia
A Harem-what?
^lol
So it's during the day for me
any idea who's streaming?
07but i'll be here for you all
The clock here is 00:52 am. I think not =.=

/me pats VioletVanilla's shoulder
that wouldn't even be night
Luna

THUNDERPONY BY METALOCOLYPSE
I know DCD will be streaming the marathon
Get ALL the girls
I would love to hear a new take on "Call Upon the Seaponies" in S2.

Yay!

I think Luna is streaming, saw the background earlier

Ugh, why the hell do I have to have classes tomorrow?

He's done that in about 3 channels.
I have work all day tomorrow... I can only hope some Brony puts the new eps on youtube.
7pm, long night :)
Was that Bloody Tears i just heard?
Heh, I never used the words "adorable", "cute", or "pretty" as much as I have since I started watching My Little Pony back in December
He's being a dumbass.

14 Hours, 6 minutes, and 45 seconds to go till Season 2!
Hey, when is Blade Runner starting again (Wis Time?)

Twilight needs a single imo
D:
Yard by yard, fussing on the details!

I know nothing of blade runner
Why do I always sing along to this song.
Then you don't need that much brainbleach as we do. LOL

[b]Brohoof[/b]
My boss caught me watching FiM at work, his response: "I'm ok with this."
Wait, was that a crayon?
any reason my stream stops every once in a while?

07383 bronies

House, sorry. I say Winter Wrap Up
Hi Every pony
x)

Did any of you know that some stores actually sell brony shirts?
I'm amazed I can keep up with chat so far
*brohoof*
i have seen people getting real mad over the test chambers
3Magneto Oh, if you knew some of the rooms I frequent you wouldn't think that...
lol
lol
Rainbow's dress looks sweet
Ditto Rawrity
awesome boss
manliest dresses EVAR
So if you could meet Twilight, what would be the first thing you'd say or do?
I like your boss MrMaxaminus.
I'd thought it would be at lightning speed with so many people
Slowter: Take your time to do something right, because you will spend more time on it, oncce it is broken.
I watched Blade Runner 10 years ago... don't remember much, except that I liked it, tbh
Now what do we do in here with requests gone?
So which room has the most ponies in it?
why ?
the only momet the word die was ever uttered on mlp
/me is glad we have theme rooms
Lol perfect boss
Dash's dress is amazing
I'd look at her eyes
Rainbows dressss...
and say
[b]*Brohoof*[/b]
I'm in the lobby and here so I guess it's fine to be in more than one
anyone else getting a 'connection was reset' page for the stream?

Thanks Magneto
I wish I could pick A movie once. It would be very obscure :D

"Teach me magic? Please?"

No problem, Slowter
rainborcrash then get kicked from ALL the rooms!
DO IT BITCh

because alot of them are tough
I might pick Leon for my A
Dat hair
I'd want to know her favorite book

Choose one and stick I guess?
More obscure than my choice, Apokalipse?
if I get picked
hey guys what is with all the channels

Oh god no.
I wil hug everypony! But mostly Twilight.
hey guys why is there a channel with all the characrters
Here comes 20% cooler. xD
the twilight room has teleport spamming
I'll have to think on it; but it most certainly won't be applejack
Gawd, I think if I actually saw Twi in real life I'd start crying.
JESUS RARITY!
mine isn't in english
activison sucks
I believe there was a big troll called "The Observer" in the HP livejournal fandom years back. Turned out it was a sock puppet of one of the big name fans.
i'm pretty sure my connection is gonna crash down a few times before season 2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_knNvzudycI 41-minute video by me
yes!
No Activision/IW pony games...
how do you watch the movie for movie night?
there are only 11 in applejack, she is the least popular i think :(
Luna is happy yes? XP
Wow, more than normal eh Wrek?
same as dashorcrash
MRD, No
I'll be back in a couple minutes bronies!
twilight is best
oh, 40 people did the right choice :D
05MetalRainbowDash no youtube links in this chat
so france exists in equestria? or what

Tonight’s movies are Blade Runner, and thanks your local troll Bjornfot, our second B movie is relevant to the special event, as it’s the horrorfest known as MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE! Based on Generation 1! *gasp*
IT's awseome!

Wish I could stick around for this, but I can't. I'll be back later, best chat room
It has Harrison ford
hahahahaah
lets play the guss the cut game....
This movie is excellent if you're into cerebral cyberpunk movies
I just haven't seen Blade Runner period DaveKenroy :P
FO2>FO:NV>FO:BoS>FO>FO3

g
g
g
g
3*DOUBLEGASP*
Opinions, of course.
most of the time
07indeed I am
They say that this is what inspired Deus Ex
So I kinda get annoyed when I'm running around the starting village and the carnivorous plants start combat with me
It's a very philisophical movie
Never seen it so i will give it a chance. YOu can't really say something is bad unless you've tried it
11Following our mane event, we’re going ALL NIGHT LONG with an ENTIRE MARATHON of MLP Season 1 as a forerunner to….THE SEASON 2 PREMIERE!!!!!!
07sorry i'm having my hands full atm :)
Curse you hunger! Why u no tell me earlier!
:o Ima wait until MLP the movie god lol
this movie is produced by john fill, the moose director
I think two cuts have the same intro
2,14 inb4 gas-...oh wait
Apparently. *shudder*
the what now?
Man, I can't believe I haven't seen this movie yet.
doctor have you heard of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.?
I'll watch it for the luls and the irony. And for sheer sake of comparison.
0no problem
Warning: this movie is kind of boring, mostly due to it being film noir. Just stick with it and you will see the beauty of the film. Now sit back and enjoy the show!
Dumori: this is the final cut
2,14 :P
6SEASON 2!!! <333
and by the way (guessing by the rooms we can choose) can we all agree that pinkie pie is best pony?
mods are talking in main room
Aren't there only two intros?
My body is ready though
cursing is allowed, but we only get 2 fucks before we have to upgrade to R
Yeah.
awwww
That alone is worth it then. I very much enjoyed Deus Ex. :P
Never heard of Blade Runner.. -Watches-
the longest one
Main chat is ~5 messages to ~20 messages a second, depending on if people feel like talking
i love it

Blade runner? Film noir? boring
Pinkie Pie IS best pony.
the ones i hate are the 3 legged beasts
2,14 oh you violet :P
It's hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing
now we only get 1 since RAWR just used one
Did I see background?
Aw, fuck.
did i miss anything
Am I on the right planet?
Pinkie pie is indeed best pony. Unless, of course, Twilight is best pony. Which sometimes happens.
6Shoo be doo shoop shoo be doo~
3Umad ValtheJean?
It's based on the novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
lol
I'd love to try it, but I gotta buy GoW3 and Killing Floor
The first one was pretty good. :P
05and behave in chat, ol wrek is watching

my body is ready for g1
But they were always busy

I totally thought it was that dark, gritty reboot that nobody likes to talk about
05its post 2012, whaddaya expect?
tried watching Blade Runner, got bored after like 3 minutes. Let's see if I matured
gotta love those old-school soundtracks
But it doesn't look like it

Dumori: indeed.

PST?
it's not my first time watching it, but i didn't get it the first time. maybe this time.

dude, this looks like a scene from Star Wars
This was the thing that the Snatchers ripped half from
Bit strange but if you click on a link to Bronystate.net, then go to the theatre, it might work?
And this is all thanks to the obama administration
6 am pst

You mean BETTER, Bjornfot?
Watch it in LQ
Man we kick science's ass in 8 years.
i thint i saw gunther hermann!
2019 and they still use fans. :[
...i believe the real threat is bunnies. not robots.
This is my first time seeing it
Bayformers money gave us MLP:FIM and you will show it some respect *cans.wav*
ooo pretty lights
I didn't ask for this
:)
no wait... I want the robots
Bjornfot what did he do agin?
It's 2012. Why aren't we on other planets?
well, I gues it's for the best, I've got a few hundred more words to do for NaPoWriMo. be back once I'm at 26,667 guys!
Still though, I know what my B movie is since the Wicker Man reserved for... something.
This movie is where Precussion Of Evil comes from.
stream fine
HQ is for pussies
"it was the aliens"
We're like "fuck let's get inventing"
2,14 I sent an invite to dsnesmith
guys, think of it, this movie is multiple decades old.
Sorry for asking another stupid question but when is the season 2 premier stream? >.< sorry...
xD yep.
its 2011 and why no real life fluttershy yet?
"They stole the pie"
2,14 but he seems to be afk
Hello! And..good night whoever's going to bed.
Bjornfot IS Tacowiz.
Harrison [For]dTheWin
I'm kinda scared to watch the MLP movie, I never was a fan of the pre-4 Gen ponies
I really needed to see it aynway
.
0you just KNOW the movie is good when the explosions are all the same sound ;)
man, this looks like such a SNATCHER ripoff so far...
Cool, I can't wait till 2019 xD
It's the ONLY WAY to watch the movie.
:P
@denied_existence he's one of the greatest trolls in bmn
invite to Elky?
I click play, and then it just loads and loads forever
Nor was I
2,14 S2 is 9AM EST
how do we enter the lottery?
dont worry
2,14 hmmmm
I'm going to watch it anyways.
I got Xbox, but not Gold
in 13 hours
useless fans are useless
the B movie is supposed to be like that
@denied_existence he suggested the absolute worst B movie we've ever watched
They have flying cars and computers still look like Apple //'s
PrincessCelestia, the portal hasn't been completed yet
I DID NOT MURDER HIM!
fucking veemi, WORK!
aponymous: SSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHH, it's a secret!
i bet we'll laugh our asses of :D
Elky: lawl
lol, wut are tortoise!!
also, G1 is watchable
I find it deplorable that there are only 14 people in this room
@denied_existence traumatized one of the other mods too
^this
trust me I am a doctor
MY STREAM IS BROKEN, WHAT DO I DO
smile for the camera
its not G3/3.5/3.5
Elky: I know right? Get some originality!
2,14 working on it
3.6*
:P
3Which movie?
I refreshed a couple times and got it to work now though
:(
Tacowiz picked the WORST movie in BMN history
not even B-movie
G1 is okay....sometimes
I suppose spoilers are not allowed?
anyone else having problems viewing
Spider's Web didn't qualify as a movie
Elky: I remember when we watched NewDCD game through Snatchers
05what movie?
or is it just too busy
Soon........
cool. sorry xDD quess i didnt understand when ya'll said before
IQ tests have changed alot.
... i love how my computer has no sound. -.-
Pretty sure Snatcher came after this
What did Tacowiz do again?
Spider's Web
alright thanks Val
So many bronies
in the future eye scanners will use bagpipe technology
I made the popcorn just in time, this is going to be a very memorable 14 or so hours :D
at least G1
Watch the movie in Low Quality (ONLY WAY TO WATCH)
@denied_existence i think it was something like A Pig's Tale? not sure.
so apparently I have to watch at 7PM
there are other rooms
is this the original version of the film or the directors cut?
up in here
crash lol
Spiders Web made me cry
So I haven't done this IRC thing in a long time. Are xchat and mirc still the best clients?
Is this the movie with the Sea ponies?
0nope
I'm a doctor, not a mechanic
ive had gold since i was but a colt, 8ish i think i have had xbox live for 8 years so says my profile
Cybernetics will eat your soul
The pilot is good
what happened to tacowiz btw? haven't seen him in ages
so there's probably more xD
though I woudln't read that link if you don't want spoilers
derma: t'was fun
Snatcher copied off Blade Runner, but more as a tribute
nah i was 10
G4 pilot ==== G1 pilot
@denied_existence aforementioned traumatized mod forbid us from saying the name on threat of joke kick
he's hiding in shame
what is this
lol
2,14 glad to hear it RAWRity
Spider's web was short
0Soul will eat your Cybernetics
A mob of bronies must have tolerated him to death
Is this the one with narration or no?
yep, way more xD
Oh he picked Spiders Web
MrPoniator_: yes.
I think spider web should be t for terribad.
Tacowiz was banished to the moon
Around the same age I had that
what movie is this
3Which mod eh?
i think what silks saying is, there's ony 14 people in "Rarity" which is rather deplorable
07Please not no
This conversation might get tricky. Poor investigator.
it was the aliens, they stole the pie
2,14 yeah, there's about 400 people total connected
Ah yes, the Turtle
...aaaaaaaaaaand you failed
TUUUUUUUUUUUUUURTLE
07yep
I liked Spider's Web...
Turtles, Mankind's most dealiest enemy in the future
Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a doctor!
I'm with PrincessCelestia
07i'm on Mirc

current counter says 429
i like tortuses
RainbowBlitz: Blade Runner
Tyrell corp. makes me think of the Tyrell racing team
Spider's Web was short but it concentrated a lot of pain into those 30-40 minutes.
Is this real life
Fuck kind of test is this?
especially the ninja variety
HEARTBEAT SFX
This is best room
FLASH OHOHO!
DAMN TURTLE IS COMMUNIST
I LEIK TURTLES
@denied_existence i think it was newdcd or hipster_brony

In case you guys are wondering, replicants don't have emotions.
Jedi mind tricks.
MY STREAM WONT WORK, WHAT DO I DO????? SOMEONE HELP!!
HOLY FUCK
I heard no questions...

Trying to screw his MIND
luna are we watching the theatrical release or the directors' cut?
2,14 I agree :P
Why does that man hate me
This room has the best singing voice
?
Halo 1 was amazing
i had a choice to raid firelands in wow with guild or watch mlp, guess what i picked?
THAT TURTLE JUST BLEW HIS MIND
The turtle, he doesnt help it!
Bronies, Bronies everywhere
cigars in the future everything is fine for me
lol
the music still gives me chills
Now that I think of it, which cut of the movie is this?
Indeed.
because tortoises are apparently delicious
kick the turtle
07thanks :)
Well that was weird.
an emotional response... we should watch Equilibrium sometime
u on http://www.bronystate.net
I LIKE TURTLES
I believe this is the test of THE GAME
lol he's smoking
oh here we go
So much smoking
:O
NO, TOSS THE TURTLE
o_o
Wait, what is a turtle doing in a desert?
lol
Suddenly bronies, thousands of them.
SCREW THIS TEST
Why would he put me on my back?
DAMN
She seems nice
Coca Cola time!
Oh hey Elky

Ouch.

Zoh my goodness
Thats one damn good gun
This room is also the most mature room
Pew pew guns
wat?!
His momma gave him that gun.
you are dead. dead. dead
Gun from nowhere
damn, thats some gun
Well, that was unusual.
The game already ended
Suddenly, explosions
So amazing, that when I went to my friends house to a borrow a game from him, I almost cried when I saw him chuck the game CD away.
k thanks bye
wut?
that's one strong pistol
He did kill him
Japan in the future?
Ohh what you say
tortoises live in the desert
though what I want more than anything in S2 is for there to be a Rarity/Fluttershy duet song.
there are desert turtles
Whoops?
I'd call that an emotional response.
oh god I just lost the game -_-
evening all
oooh, guns
OK, I don't think that was the right answer to the question

Wait who guessed there will be 500 people in chat for the premiere?
i like turtles
Han Solo! SHOOT FIRST!
Jetpacks actually kinda suck
Halo 2 was not bad, it was pretty good
People keep flamethrowers on their roofs
HHHHHNNNNNGGG
It'll be even more needed during ponies.
ohai Han Solo!
can the answer be the story?
05for some reason, i get the feelign of syndicate mixed with deus ex here
perhaps when (if) Sweetie gets her Cutie mark?
i like how the comments load like ten at a time
2019*
everfreenights, try a different browser to see if it works on that?
Hans Solo seems to be stuck on this planet
You're nearly a thousand years late Xzite.
I think this is the theatrical release
HARRISON FORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BRING ME SOLO AND THE WOOKIEE
OPPORTUNITY AND ADVENTUUHHHHHHHHR

Halo 3 was disappointing however.
mib_6vl8h8 not enougth magic

Reach is beautiful
2,14 I doubt the CMC ever will
Damn, too slow.
lol
Han Solo seems to have lost his badass license in this movie
lol
woooo
Chewbacca and Short round are the same person.
^^ okies, thanks, I've never understood timezones that much... and about the singing voices, yessweetie belle should sing more!
No off-world colonies because no profitability in it.
Wait. That's chinese writing but that guys spoke Japanese...fail
I'm worried even six rooms might nt be enough for the premiere
Yeah, shooting the questionnaire tends to be read as "failure"...
you have a bottle?
i liked the music
Everfree Nights? Like, The Raccoons?D:
I think deux ex is inspired by this movie.
SirReginald, it's the same actor
Ford Prefect
okey the joke's on me
when did it start?
WHERS CHEWBACCA
Harrison Ford is a very sexy man, if I do say so myself
HE DOES NT LIKE YOU
2,14 but so long as Sweetie keeps singing, I'll be happy :P
hb odst?
wow, you guys are amazing.
I miss Neocron :/
ThinkGeek sells those umbrellas I think
It seems that the stream isn't working for me
mib_x98oi6 just go now you won't miss much I promise. If you do, I'll tell you

oh yeah
Mousier, look at my moostache.
yeah
everytime i see Harrison Ford talk to someone who doesnt understand him I think of Chewie everytime
0pro typo
best go now while the plot is still shallow
Graaawwwhhhh
Nonetheless still fun to play as an ODST other than a spartan or elite
Looks like we could hit 500 during the movies.
Yeah, stream's dead
suddenly everyone english
............does anyone think luna is best alicorn?
Ok so i see yoda...george weasley, bin laden, yodas back, hey osama! O_O

0only noodles
burade runner

ITS WORKING NOW, YAY
Spazturtle: Yup.
French people have special combs for their mustasches
2,14 the problem is that if they lose their cutie marks, they lose the appeal
So it seems I can't watch the HQ stream lol
Han shot first
first time here; this is awesome.
I think it'll probably hit over 1000
Faust is best alicorn
11Ford looks so young in this movie

A computer in the cars, it must be THE FUTURE!

magic car
*brohoof* Ow.
yeah
Sweet stache bro
>mfw i'm in 4 chat rooms
the future is scary
Yesh/
then the lobby will be seriously needed...
CMC won't until either end of S2 or sometime in S3, is my guess.
0HOVER CARS
Faust is best fause
Huh, future cars have old VHS graphics.
what's with the music?
indeed he does, Silverscreen. But do you think we should talk about the product placement curse thingy?
It's 2011. Why no flying cars?!?
haha
BTW: No CG here
ahes ago
fast*
and word of mouth
Floating cars, always needed in the future
FLYING CARS. WE NEED THEM BY 2015
Damnit, I SAID there was too much of that. My wrist hurts now.
wow so few in the rarity room 0.0
450 good thing i got here fast
this film came out 1982
Snatcher totally got ideas form this movie.
smoking commercial on billboard
THE YEAR 2000
didn't I hear this music in Master of Orion II?
someone tell me why we dont have those umbrellas right now??
faust* oh god why typos..
it's THE FUTURE
and the only live stream of s2 I think
So flying cars come with smoke machines now?
okies then
Silverscreen: This was before his "I WANT MY FAMILY BACK" phase.
Nittany_Tiger: There are
8 Years to go Tiger
nom nom nom
It's 2011, why no gieshas in my windows?
aww
Why do computers in the future have such bad resolution?
I better have a hover car by 2019!
0i wonder if they have the internet
@nittany_tiger we have those already
this world runs off of windows 3
There's a flatscreen in one of the scenes
Its 2011 and japan hasnt taken over the world?
people dun liek rawity. D:
Just not mass produced
MEANWHILE ON CORESCAUNT
We had 200 during pre-show
@nittany_tiger they're called PLANES
ill have to send you my acc name after this
the future needs more ponies.
awesome floaty cars! CRT monitors......
11Dermathil: Maybe. Maybe Not.
Not much choice, is there
All the others are CRTs for whatever reason
Nittany_Tiger: Flying Cars are for 2019, not now
i think basil is streaming, too
we can'T drive in 2 dimensions, how are we going to manage 3
Wait...no...maybe not.
Actually, there's like four livestreams
Aye then
I think we do have led umbrellas now.
Guess all thea "Green" stuff was a waste huh?
I can't remember having that many then
11*trollface*
The site isn't letting me in the Rainbow Dash Room
yeah
what is the plot so far?
An honest-to-god flatscreen? :P
trollestia/mollestia or offscreen luna
no triva?
i wont lie, i expected much higher quality
Wait what year is this supposed to be?
I just think there's a lot of possible material for them finding their Marks. For instance, if one gets theirs before the others, and there's jealousy issues. or they get it, and have to work to stay friends in between pursuing their passions.
0magic
In the 80s future?
hope the Mods don't mind I did some advertising 4 the show. for you guys
nah: You know what I mean. :p
WHTEVER YOU DO HAN! DONT PUT POINTS INTO SWIMMING!
I love how this chat makes livestreams the only place where you can talk during a movie and everyone can still enjoy it :D
They sure had to push their imaginations in those days
oh u Silverscreen
Flying cars: bringing drunk driving to a whole new level.
I prefer the snatcher aesthetic...
NO, It'S FOR 2015
0Get off my plane!
hoping to come back later for g1 movie. had to see what this was.
It wouldn't let me in any room. >_>

Corescant
Getting flashbacks to Dues Ex revolutions
OH THE HORROR
and the facebook bronies group
It's hidden in the background, though
It's always night-time in this film
no internet as i can see
How long is the movie?
Rarity makes people feel inadequate
I still remember that discussion we had way back then, Silverscreen. When was that? June? Oh right, the day after Kick Ass.
very round and furry
WHY U NO WATCH BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II
@S_E_F have you seen Canada? That's what awaits USA
also no ponies in future
Theres no sunlight in the future.
Lol yeah
apparently I have to watch at 10 AM

Or how about someone just telling them about their obvious talents?
0this future sucks
Does anybody Died in this movie?
bronystate chat is like /b/ lol sooo fast
I've not had a good look seeign as I was gonna be at this one
Don't pick swimming because t's fairly useless!
Entire world evolved. Except police stations.

The CMC saga would end in an instant.

Would that make it space Noir?
Skinjob
11Yeah, I know, Dermathil.

Skinjob sounds like a really, REALLY creepy indian burn.
It was old at the time the MOVIE was made.

Never mind in 2019.
Never went to /b/, never will either.

By the way, I walked into the office yesterday to find this: http://www.kidoutenshi.net/Images/pics/IMG_20110915_092332.jpg
ur mom happened :P
and it's clear that the writers for he show are intelligent and careful with the characters, so there's a good chance they could handle it very well.
how?
The thing in the recording happened.
True, but the idea of one getting her mark would be interesting
Chatbox next to the screen would be nice.
That's why AJ channel is so awesome. Nice and quiet
you can't change your name
0:P
yes
0Either way they die at the end
yea that didnt work
saw the constant pony thread which sparked my initial intrest
Well, I dunno whether to go do stuff and stuff waiting for the ponies, or what... lol
sooo many mibbits!
I have a deep loathing for that place...
would it be advertising if i were to post a link to where one would be able to buy one of those LED umbrellas?
Fly cars underground?
magic of course
Nice
you are stuck with it
forever
That is a very good question Deadly
Feels proud to be an open brony
oh conveniant
I accidentaly a turtle.
O RLY?
Very true. It's always interesting to see how the future was seen, and how it compares to how we see it now.
2,14 we'll just have to see when the time comes :P
is the /nick not working?
how nice
And/or perhaps getting a younger pony involved in the CMC...
oh yeah, there are origami and eye motifs if you guys wanna keep an EYE out for them
high five!

So is this acting as some sort of a refuge from the lagg?
The replicunts
Sweet
Especially in older games.
And you gotta set your name when you join the chat, that's all I know
anon: stay out for about two minutes
sweet
YEAH!
