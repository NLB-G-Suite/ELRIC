i see ya
Discord = The Joker
Not really.
Discord = Almost the Joker, but not quite
Is anyone else having chat problems? Or is it just my internets?
Joker is my favorite character of anything ever
Discord is a close second though
Discord IS a pony
part-pony
A Draconiquos or whatever it is called
but he IS a pony
"head of a pony, body of a dragon" or something like that
I have lag too
Does that make Gilda an Eagle?
on chat
I want to RPEEEEEEE
Draconequis, I think it is
oh
Fluttershy` Yes, I just assumed it was me. I don't receive any messages, then like 10 at once...:P
well, she's a Griphin :s
or w/e its spelt
Half eagle half lion, same thing as Discord
So, by your logic, Gilda=eagle
/me climbs up the wall, sits on the celing
no, she is lion
:D
is it me or is it lagging?
08,1it's lagging...
MrChang Not you
its lagging
Hey, everypony with wings! Lets have a party up here on the ceiling. :3
Nah.
Twilight will just die of old age.
/me has no wings, is an unicorn
:(
Before Spike's too big.
Fluttershy`: join me?
Prince-buzzkill
>Celestia was previous element of harmony
why's it lagging?
Seriously Dari, you're being a real downer today
>Twilight and co. might live as long
what kinda shenans is this?
/me parties on ceiling
>Celestia is a God
>Twilight isn't
a god*
>Spitfire is best pony
6sobsob
>Rainbowdash isn't
/me parties with Xerion
God is a term much too lowly to describe Dash.
unlesss Twilight & co. turn into Alicorns by some crazy spell
they will live as long as anyponyelse
Everypony join me!
Also, Celestia is a Demigod, as Gods don't have a real form or whatsoever
Flaria: I dunno.
Edward_Newgate Woah, woah, woah. Spitfire is pretty awesome, but this is Rainbow Dash that we're talking about here!
and she isn't all-powerful, she is just imortal
Spitfire is the leader of the wonderbolts. Dash can't even get in. Do the math
Zephirdd: I corrected 'God' to 'a god' for that reason.
>mfw RD is on the bottom of my fav-main-pony-list
Zephirdd; Ever heard of Greek mythology?
What did I start, oh celestia
They weren't all powerful and had forms
... I need more winged ponies for mah ceiling party.
Dash is too good for the Wonderbolts.
^
Zephirdd :O That is like speaking the language of Mordor in the Sire
Shire*
what do the wonderbolts even do
just fly around
boring
Yes, flaria?
rbd fights dragons and star trek characters
oh well, true that Edward_Newgate, but we barely have many forms of gods :s
I need more for my party
Come here Fluttershy`
Yall gotta watch this RBD video

I may try chatzilla

mibbit is horrible

I searched embedded IRC clients and got nothing yet
08,1LordCelestia do you use Firefox?
LordCelestia, i *could* let you ssh into my server and use irssi
but that's kinda silly and you might as well just use mibbit

LordCelestia, that's really not so bad then.
Dermathil: I certainly hope not.
would be pretty funny though
Diftraku, something obviously went boogers
Diftraku, you should know better! don't do anything 255 related! D:

always 254 or less!
Now pinkie could use finalized vers of Evil enchantre-- Evil Enchanter
evil number is evil
Well, I uploaded 258 images, they were already on server side so it was just Shimmie adding them to the DB

Yeah, but PS3 is better with raw computing power.
yep
blech, irssi over ssh is a tad awkward :3
I liked the Xbox.. I just didn't like paying for online :/
that's why the department of defense bought a bunch and made a supercomputer out of them
I saw that
TrollightSparkle, yah i can't play online anyways
but dvd is easier to pirate for
confusing people
thats why i just bought a ps3 and stuck with it
Mhm, I used to pirate ALOT a couple of years back.
emulators? all this stupid crap to slow down my computer? no thanks. been there, done that.

On the way back up, she paid special attention to ctrlx’s wings - working around her joints in strong, tight circles before rolling his wing bones between his hooves from joint to tip and back down again.

I'm so borreeddd I think I'll go try TF2.. and hopefully people won't bitch about "F2P" and stuffs..
I don't know why I am so tense right now. I hate when I feel tense.
Hoping you feel better.. worried about something?
I don't know, but I have found out that my grandmother's condition has been deteriorating. She fell last week and broke her wrist. She's been in the hospital ever since.
She's very old and frail.
Really sorry to hear about that. I know it might not really console you to say that, but I don't know what else to say, to be honest.
I understand.
Honestly, it doesn't sound like she has much time left, so I don't expect much fun in the near future.
Oh
Nittany_Tiger, i work in a nursing home and the only real straightforward advice i can offer is that you just have to be accepting of it. yes you want to keep her alive and well but sometimes things happen especially with older folks. losing someone special is hard and as always with time it will get better. just hold on to the memories and know that she lives on through you and maybe that she's in a better place now. peace is better than living uncomforta
bly. and besides, i bet she's lived a fulfilling life already :) just take the stress in strides. it'll be ok
She's had an up and down life.
I wish I could take her out to eat one more time.
if at all possible, do so. i bet she'd love that
Back when I lived at home, I used to do that every so often.
If it's possible.
or even take something in to her
According to mom, she can barely eat and dress herself.
I'll be going home in a week or less to visit her.
i wish you and her the best of luck. to ease the tension a bit just try and keep your mind preoccupied every so often. it gives yourself a break from hte stress
I don't handle stress well. There are reasons why. Put on top of that my thesis work. No chance for a break. Thank you though.
anytime, brony. just don't explode and explode again. :P best of luck mate
I'll be fine as long as I get to see her at least one more time.
ive watched the first episode of season 2 about 30 times now O_O
well a friend of mine may now be a brony. yay
:D awesome
:D
I wish i had brony friends :(
you... dont? :(
no
not that i know of..
any friends knwo you're into the show?
*know
i have a friend that watched the entire show and likes it but doesn't consider himself a brony.
the rest of my friends tollerate me being a brony
My internet browser just commited suicide
im still getting a few raised eyebrows from jackie, as ill call him.
Huh.. I have an ex-coworker that is a brony, a friend that is in denial that he likes ponies, and a close friend who's a "half-brony".

In the interview with Jayson

waaat
yeah
if they do put them in there.. they better do a really good job

the sa ponies

.___.
yeah, but I ain't worried.
They'd make the smooze awesome if they had to put it in.
and shoobie doo all over that episode

JT: Hmm... let me think... There... Well, it’s hard to say, I don’t know what people are gonna think, but yeah, there’s some great endings I think, there some... we try to make them unexpected where we can... So, there’s stuff in the works, let’s just say, that could potentially make a splash.
that's why I am 50% sure the Seaponies will show up in S2.
oh gawd
shooo be dooo

There's a projector in the living room
You thinking what I am thinking?
Move PC to living room, hook up to the projector and WATCH ALL THE PONIES!
inb4 wallflower jokes
hook it up to the ceiling and project it on the floor.. and duct tape yourself to the ceiling so you can watch it.. and when whoever else gets home you can explain!
:P
depending on how high-tech the projector is you could aim it at your mind and it would project the image directly into your brain
err aim it at your head
you could go to sleep with it projecting images into your mind and you would have some interesting dreams
on ep 26 "the best night ever" does anyone else find it funny how those ponies outside of the gala were all singing along and stuff with the them but when they got inside of the gala the ponies there were just interested in doing whatever fancy things they were interested in doing?
if pinkie wanted to party she should have went back outside with those ponies (that probably couldn't get into the gala and just loitered around)

so, I just finished reading On a Cross and Arrow
cute, funny, liked it
it was a good fic
I just realized the neighbours are out of town...
so?
lol
oh lol
now I feel kinda empty
and I need a new fic to read
t_t

Portal and Ponies
counfound them
OH BOY
and the author
I know, I spent an evenning just reading that fic

:P
haha
Zephirdd: you fancy fallout?
I never played it
and no, I won't read FO:E
:(
>_>
well
I read TNTNE without ever realizing it was a grimdark fic until reading the tags afterwards
wat is TNTNE?
The Night That Never Ends
oh.
well
I would say past sins but that one seems to bring up too much hate....oh wait.
counfound those ponies
they drive me to read portal fics
Sumica: I loved Past Sins
I loved Past Sins
I re-read it when the author announced the rewrite
Val likes Caramel because terrible fanon.
lol
Tad late Dari
Never read Past Sins, what is it?
lol
Caramel/mac?
2,14 oh surprise, Dari brings up an old topic as an attempt to troll. I'm so completely surprised
Trollestia: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/story-past-sins.html
Val loves Caramac.
Thank you.
Who doesn't love Caramac?
diftraku answered it
:3
:P
I hate caramac
Mac belongs to fluttershy
everypony knows that
:<
Ew, Nyx. No thanks.
^lol!
/me refers to that ungodly Excel file
Past Sins is what created Nyx
past sins is quite good
Twilight would *deserve* to be hung for that.
the ending gets real predictable and is drawn out a little too much
but it's quite an emotional ride
overall worth reading, i've barely read any fics aside from that though
meh, idk what people complain about that story. It was quite good imo
it was better than i'd expect a fic to be
yes, my thoughts exactly
So to change the topic I started reading article 2 last night. Intersting start but seems slow to update.
Article two?
I don't dislike either Caramac or Fluttermac
I think both are good ships
I do prefer Fluttermac, though.
FreezeFrame: Same here
/me prefers Fluttermac due to My Dream Mare being almost headcanon.
06,15Twilestishy Diane Cake is best ship.
RobotPinkie: lol
It's one of those *gasp* humans in equiestria fics Trollestia
Actually, I ship like... 4 different ponies with Mac
*le gasp
hello everyone
(not at once)
FreezeFrame: What's stopping you? :3
Well, there is one three-member relationship in that set
Trixiemac Sparkle
MacHarem, the way of the stallion
Hehe
Damn
This hurt
A LOT
Holy crap my ribs
stop doing it then?
Great, now I want to see a fimfic that parodies harem animes with Mac as the central character.
rofl
Lul
FreezeFrame: MacHarem as in MacDonalds
Big Mac even has the personality of a typical harem MC
oh jeae lovehina comes to mind.
Only problem with Mac-shipping is the number of people who insist on AppleMac
Jetpack
no wing
wings
FreezeFrame: Yeah... that's...
Disturnimg
:| AppleMac? Wow, that's pushing it
*Disturbing
/me combusts the fuel tank.
AppleMac? seriously? that's just... disgusting
Mmhmm
wth
/me uses his paraglider
They're related for crying out loud!
Hello bronystate
Hello.
evenin' Apokalipse
OHai Apokalipse
wait where was all this omg rage when you all were talking about CaraMac?
Why is everyone surprised at the lenghts this fandom goes to with their fics? AppleMac is hardly surprising
Double Standarts
they're normal
Sumica: Caramel isn't explicitly a family member
Some people make him an Apple, some people make him not an Apple
2,14 he was refering to me Freezeframe
look at other fandoms, it could be identical twins and some people would ship them
IMO best shipping is Elusive/Rarity, most hilarious shit I've ever seen
Animu Twincest is win
But start throwing innocent equines in the equation and suddenly I'm against it
Luna is a Joker, you can write her to fit into EVERY STORY
I was turned off of fanfics for a while after I accidentally read an Ayaka/Sammy shipfic....
Wait, Caramel is an Apple?
apparrently
I don't think I've ever read fanfiction, ever.
Zephirdd: I've seen him called one in a few fics (where he's shipped outside the family)
He's usually just a hired hand in Caramac fics
IIRC Caramel was a paradoxal male/female pony
wasnt it?
Caramel Apple seems pretty obvious.
Caramel Apple was a different pony, though.
The Light in the Darkness and Growing Pains are 2 of my personal favourites. Full End"horse"ment
/me slaps himself for terrible pun
Also, I MADE CUPCAKES!!!
sry, I'm feeling random right now
who remembers glompday?
glompday?
I"ve not been there.
yesterday
lol
LittleLuna "glomped" everypony except LordCelestia and me
it was crazy
Screw Attack has a magazine?
what are your favourite FF's?
question goes to Everypony
x-2 =p
There we go
Piece of junk
Six is best FF
It's the only correct answer to that question, too.
I thought the only correct answer is not to play.
everyone has their own opinion
You lie, LittleLuna didn't touch me.
And I am just beeing an ASS it seems, so I went with x-2
sry, you barely said anything during the glompage, I forgot you were there
/me rubs his neck nervously
Oh well.
Q: who should return for another episode, Trixie or Gilda?
if you HAD TO choose one of them
Trixie, definately
Gilda
MLP needs more non-ponies
Gilda for a RBD centric episode with a duet song
MLP needs Flutterponies
as seen on The Movie
Those things with the laterns on their heads?
their queen had this weird flower/showgirl thing on her head

Id love to disect a heart...
The Škoda Octavia VRS is the worlds fastest 2.0 litre supercharged production car... kind of pony related

6Yayz! He's online again :D
Blood is tasty, i always lick my wounds

I remember because I was literally on the floor the whole movie
6Idk why people find it so disgusting to do that..
Idk, its like...putting it back :D
Not really but you get the idea
6xD
I remember a fist full of dollars because it had flute
ah right That is why I did't recall what was before that. Forgot I worked the two weeks follwing Battlfeald earth.

/me drain is not responding, please close windows
Face it Discord is second best mlp fim char

{1,0You0,4Tube}: "everyday im discordin&#39;" - "i LOVED this part of SE2EP1!!! why!? THIS PLAYED IN MY HEAD XD possibley one of many highlights i enjoyed MLP FiM Is (C) To Hasbro and Lauren Faust a flash a..."

It had nothing to do with your curse`d information.
/me 2gets out a phone

/me pouncehuggles Curly

2nope
6Just been curious in some way?
thnaks
maybe just write a script to reset every night at 12am
Wasn;t Luna supposed to help?
I guess, if theyve done it and liked it, even if they wouldnt ever again for pride reasons id call them bi. Curious is a tricky word
Defeat Discord I mean.
AHA
/me 2puts up a wall keeping Suinide
I have a new lead

Lol
/me 6feels the tiny newborn fuzz on her head
At the top, I see "Show Time!" So, why is the video offline?
Whos head?
6Mine :P
Because nobody updated the countdown
Because no one has bothered to update it recently. :/
has the show time clock thing ever worked?
Your not a newborn...or did you shave your head?
yes
yes
Because Dari is a bigger troll than Discord
yes
must have somthing blocking it on my end.
/me is the winner
@Edward: lol
6Lol no :P For some reason I had that hairloss thing you get when you suffer from stress or whatever..I still don't see how..
Oh, freaky...
6Luckily it doesn't really show
@Edwardmeter JohnAtMC
6 JohnAtMC is 7% Edward. (204)
lol
Does it only work on some browsers?
6Still,the little fuzz feels adorable xD

It is complete.
9so your replies might take a while
Edward_Newgate, thats inapproptriate
Not really
>: (
13Thats... painfully borderline lol
What is? :0
Any work I could do would just be online, which is free.
Besides, it's best pony
Disappearing pictures D:<
feelsbadbrony
/me can't see images
13But it is suggesting y'know lol
2,14 yes, please no shipping here
13Edward knows lol
Under my rule there will only be lesbianism between characters that Ive actually heard of. And I dont know who the brown one is.
13Hes testin the waters :P
Can't trust you because of your irrational hatred of shipping
OH GOD
2,14 I just figured I'd make sure :P
PRINCESSMOLESTIA
13YES?
/me hides from his prior... 'lover'
13lol
/me whimpers in fear
Oh wait a minute... I thought she was licking her breast, but i took another look and saw what was really happenind. *phew* haha
13As for no lesbianism... LordCelestia gtfo >:|
Yeah, there's no explicit anything
..
Ohai PrincessMolestia
I was joking silly
Silvermane You're cheating on RBD? :O
lordcelestia, pm that?
:P
Lesbianism is smiled upon in my kingdom
RDash, course not
I outtroll Discord and Molestia outrapists Silvermane. It's glorious.
lol
XD
13Lmao
Lolol
Handling? oh god lol
trololololol
2,14 YOU LITTLE BITCHES ARE ABOUT TO GET TRIDENTS
DISCIE PIE IS MY OTP
I don't like the sound of.. "shipping and handling"
13Dat "handling"
Hey! It's not 10pm yet!
You missed quite a party Val
/me pokes PrincessMolestia
PrincessMolestia... 'acquired' me once. and it was... painful. (but fun)
9and you little Val are about to get FIN FUNNELS up your ass
Yes revolver?
oh wait
/me 9unleashes dem FIN FANNERS
wrong "estia" haha
/me has no idea what you're talking about
A lot of Caramel in the pic you missed.
9also Val
9I had some of the best mecha weapon concepts ever
/me hugs PrincessMolestia "Please don't eat me"
/me 13pokes Revolver back... but he probably doesnt want to know with what
2,14 oh?
Trolololololololololo
/me 13pokes Silvermane too
9but I'm wondering whether I should integrate them into the same robot
ooo, soft
Hey all this kicking sounds like abuse of power to me, I interject
NewDCD: You probably don't want my life story in the app, just what I can do etc.?
/me punches PrincessMolestia
/me is here to protect you all. Have no fear.
9(the Valjean)
inb4 kick
2,14 oh my god, if it's a trident I will smother you with love
inb4 temp ban
9or actually make the Valjean and an unrelated mech, the Arkblade
/me fires the friendship cannon at Revolver.
TAKE THAT YOU BLOODY PRINCESS!
13Aww Revolver, you know what enjoyed yourself too <3
9dunno what to do with the Arkblade though
I'll draw a french-looking mech for you, DCD
/me has the raw power. Trollestia has the pure lulz. And Molestia, well... idk, i guess she just scares everypony.
/me licks PrincessMolestia on the cheek. "I need a shower, so laters. If you see NMM, give her... well, you know... for me, okay?"
9the Valjean has a pilot, but the Arkblade would probably end up being my personal self-insert bullshit mech
no, no I didn't PrincessMolestia
2,14 lol
9OKAY now listen to my WEPON
SHOO BE DOO
hey NewDCD do you take requests?
SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
SEA PONIES NOOOO
Flaria, awesome name = troll?

CALL UPON THE SEA PONIES, WHEN YOU'RE IN DISTRESS
What? Naww.
13Mhmm Revolver <3

You needed a "D".
/me , Trollestia , and Molestia can all work together to keep order in the universe. Each balances another.
The last pony to be shipped with Caramel was Twilight. I saw the story!
@pony pony most likely to be shipped with Caramel
Pony most likely to be shipped with Caramel is Lyra the Sea Pony

Guys, don't talk about Caramel ships
Fluttershy is it the D&P thing? invite me
talk about Pinkie Pie X Discord
And then I silenced the chat
:]
@meter my hatred for RainbowDash
my hatred for RainbowDash is 100%
13Itd be funny if a group of explorers went on an expedition to some pyramids and on the walls they deciphered that Rainbow Dash is to be shipped with everyone ever o.O
/me boards the HMS Appledash.
bah. i'm gonna go brogram something
That would be so awesome /^3^\

/me couldnt click the pic fast enough :P
13My first thought would be.... "how did the Egyptians know about RD?"
9yeah I guess those are enough samples
So Edward. If you got the chance to off Rainbow-Dash, you'd take it?
...I think I would
/me waves at NewDCD

But mainly to piss off most of the bronies
:O
I'm setting up body gaurds

Hiya Dermathil
2,14 DCD, if I had to pick one move from Z2 to show someone how awesome it is, what move/which mech, should I pick?
9hey Derma
Hy Dermathil
/me very much dislike RD if you can't tell
/me sends a special forces detail to duard Rainbow-Dash.
guard
9Val: Amuro's Fin Funnel Dynamic Kill
Valthejean: pretty sure he's gonna suggest a combo move
Z2?
9also Val
NewDCD: that be Nu Gundam?
9here's a little spoiler for that fic of mine you'll never read
9Derma: yeah
9but here's the spoiler
9"Cease your foolishness at once, Prince Marius Blueblood!"
Wait what?
2,14 Prince Marius...should I know who that is? (I get the blueblood part)
Herospirit.. What did you do?!
Valthejean, sounds like a firstname. Prolly a firstname in a fic for blueblood.
2,14 well, it's not really a spoiler if it's just "oh btw blueblood is in it"
2,14 I figured it was Blueblood is some bad guy I should know
*yawn*
brb, food
So guys..
9actually it's the opposite, Val
9also remember a certain name from Les Miserables
2,14 eh...it's been forever since I read it....remind me?
9a certain rebel who used to be almost royalistic, yes?
2,14 ah
9and threw it away to be poor but happy
2,14 I see now
newdcd, pm
2,14 can't say I like comparing him to blueblood, but hey, it's your fic :P
/me sighs
Hm? Why Flaria?
g'night everypony, time for me to hit the hay
Bye Diftraku
Hey PrincessMolestia! What was #5 in the drawfriend?
9it's a different Blueblood in that fic, actually..in the sense that I wrote his first appearance BEFORE he appeared in the series
Let's see how many times irssi crashes
Anyhoof, g'night
2,14 ah
Here I am again
9so the Blueblood in my fic is Blueblood but isn't a douche like canon!Blueblood...and instead pretended to be a douche for...personal reasons
Food GET
Oh there it is
TrollightSparkle: I don't really know.

We aren't talking about clopfics...
Either way though.. yeah, it's a bit awkward to walk into right..? o_o
Clopfics are always implied
Always.
That was. An interesting picture.
Ooo! Story update!
/me deletes internet history
What picture?
daw
I wish I knew why I'm in such a crappy mood.
#5 in the draw friend.
oh yeah
It was "Too Saucy" linked in comments.
I think I know what chu talking about
Flaria, what's up?
It was a Nightmare Moon pic.
/me is off to find #5

She's getting legit with someone in there. :I
That would be me. :)
We were just having a nice chat over tea. It wasn't like that.
You know you've loaded the wrong music onto your mp3 player when you have a thousand songs and listen to less than 100 consistently.
/me sighs
^
But in my case, it's around 600 loaded, and 50-60 listened to..
Well obviously Trollight
I can't think of anything else you'd be doing
Tea is legit.
Better yet, coffee. Coffee is baws.
Speaking of which
?
Is "I Can't Decide" Pinkamena's official theme? Because it should be.
It's my Pinkamina's theme, definitely.
Listening to it at the moment.
It does sound like her theme.
I like how you take my linking coffee to that in stride.
:D
You do not so much as question my "speaking of which" :P
Oh? Why not though?
Trollight sparkle, wanna do some random RP?
Sho, how do we do it?
join #silvershipper
K, hold on
2,14 please keep advertisements for #silvershipper on PMs

Alright ill keep that in mind
hey herospirit
Check yer pm.

Anyway, bedtime. Bye
Bye Rainbow-Dash
Night Dashie
So.. yeah. Your face is pretty soft!
Night Rainbow-Dash.
Hi Nittany
/me is late again. le sigh
Thank goodness I have an USB keyboard.
/me hugs Nittany_Tiger
:>
Hi.
/me hugs back.
Night Dash!
Took my laptop to Best Buy. They said it might cost around $800 to totally repair it.
Wow. Did they say what exactly was wrong with it?
I told them what I did.
Hmm.. $800 is pretty much 1&1/2 new laptops..
They said that they couldn't touch the keyboard because of the milk. They said the milk was considered a "biological hazard."
Yeah.
I tried to buy one today, but the one I settled on was out of stock.
Milk a biological hazard? Sounds to me like a REALLY stupid excuse to take $800..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK4gm4wixH0&feature=related
I don't get it.
Anyway, I also have a broken case. The plastic is fragile from age now.
So if I sent it to the manufacturer, they would replace the keyboard and case. They might also replace the motherboard just in case it was damaged.
Which means they would replace over half of the laptop.
I found this really nice laptop over at Best Buy, but it was barely too expensive.
It sounds confusing.. I hope you get it straightened out.
Yeah.
I also need to figure out how to get this info off of this laptop.
I need to send off my 1TB external HD for repair. I think they can do it. It may be expensive, though.
/me hugs Nittany_Tiger
/me hugs back.
Thats a terrible position to be at :C
Yeah.
/me 3hugs Natleyn
They said that my laptop may be in a week at best.
But I'm going to be heading home to visit my grandmother by then.
/me hugs Denied_Existence
I'll probably just check out laptops at home.
HELLO THAR!
Hi.
Nittany_Tiger: what sort of laptop you considering? Since I need to buy one as well
/me hugs Diftraku|Sleeping
Not so asleep, eh.
nope xD
Hi Randall
just checking if irssi is still up on my mobile
I shee O_O
Oh.
Something less than $400. I could go higher, but the warranty plan would put me in a situation where I wouldn't have much money left. Lemme find the ones I was considering.
Time for me to hit the hay. Goodnight everypony
Night Rdash

FAREWELL
Goodnight RDash!

/me huddles down in a dark corner
:d
I'm looking at something along the lines of 17" screen, keyboard with numpad and it must be able to house 2 hdds
Heh.
http://tinyurl.com/3hznplg Here was the one I was going to buy.
i already got an hp pro-book on the consideration list :3
Second best part of my day: Getting to put Move ***** on my mp3 player for when I get stuck in traffic.
Nittany_Tiger: Damn, that's a nice laptop o_o
it is quite
the probook I was recommended is somewhere around 930 euros
I'll.. be back.
Okay.
/me stsrts humming the Terminator ending theme
I really hate buying a cheap laptop only to curse how slow it is
http://tinyurl.com/448umad This was the one I was eyeing, but couldn't afford.
I can't afford a $700 - $800 laptop.
I only have $850 in the bank right now.
I liked that second one because it had a Radeon card instead of the Intel POSs.
yeah
i'd go for the second tbh
;~;
it's 80 bucks pricier but it has a bit more kick
What about http://tinyurl.com/3qqq57u ?
/me is also looking for a new computer
hola
Natleyn, it looks pretty good, but will you be using it for everyday stuff or intensive like programs?
Intensive how? Like a marathon of Crysis or something?
i'm bit worried about just 3gb of ram
I don't have a lot of cpu-taxing stuff since it won't run anyway on this.
JUST 3gb?
I'm working with 1.4gb right now
oh well, s-pose it could work with your usage :3
Sorry, my mouse died momentarily -_-
xD
But I think 3GB will be plenty for you Natleyn
I'm not gonna run ri-
Errr.
Run.. what..?
I'm not going to run high-req gaming marathons.
I think the most taxing thing I own is probably Borderlands, and I've run it on worse than that one.
I can't play it on my current computer, though.
I got 8gb jusr because I run multiple programs at the same time, including VMs
FML, my mouse hates me ._.
:C
What kind of mouse is everypony using?
An old Logitech mouse that's the only thing I've got :/
steelseries cataclysm one
Damn fancy mice and keyboards.
g510 as my kb
Apple keyboard with keypad, here.
I'm running windows, but I like their keyboard.
It's funny.. cause here I am with the old stock Dell kb and a wired Logitech wheel mouse..

It'll be fixed soon. :o
But someone didn't know that Rarity was the Element of Generosity *Cough*

Oh hey ctrlx
feels better than leaving myspace
Myspace sucked IMO
/me hugs ctrlx
Natleyn, \:3/
myspace was alright in the beginning
but went all shitty then facebook came up since it wasn't shit
now that's going all shitty
Hey.
I'd leave facebook, but its how I keep in contact with people.
Hey Natleyn.
Hey hey Natleyn.

Natleyn, i'm just gonna use g+ from now on. people will switch over if they really want to. otherwise i have contact of everyone i need through other channels
>you're already dead

I only have the first one, and it's the psp version :[
Well, I used to, before my psp died. :C
Well, it's as good as dead.
What is G+ btw? Just another social network thing?
Google+.
It's already dead.
Google's facebook, except better, imo.
I have my professional account on there >_>
Oh ok
it's not dead
just new
even so, it still works 1000x better
ctrlx: How? I've heard so many people complain about facebook, but I never hear specifics
Natleyn, how what?
facebook is so buggy
Why facebook sucks/g+ is better
and they change so much stuff around all the time and shit
g+ is all like
smooth
I've never had any problems aside from the occasional upload messup.
and the app WORKS
^THIS.
facebook app never worked
Well,it'd be more important to me if I had a phone that used apps.
mobile site was extreamly limited as well
it's google so it makes sense that the android app works
but facebook has no excuse for updating an app that broke it
then taking a month to fix it

cutie mark crusaders junior detective league! http://www.wallpaperpimper.com/wallpaper/Kids/Case_Closed/Case-Closed-Private-Eye-1-1280x1024.jpg
would be nice to have a crossover of that
lol I remember when [as] had taht show. It was short lived.
ya me and my sister and brother used to watch that on AS
and apparently sometimes my even younger brother.. despite being relatively young myself
great show!
Crazy long show. 1k plus eps IIRC.
i think it got over 600 not all that long ago
but i plan on watching all the episodes for sure.. i marathon'd the whole dub of it (130 eps) over the course of a week or something probably
would have been faster but me and my brother decided to watch the last 50 or something together
well counting oav's and such and the 17movies.
guess not a thousand but still long as hell.
ya lol
*headdesk* another gundam.
Gundam AGE coming in october.
looks like they are going retro again.
i never got into gundam so i never had to get out :D
Not a big fan of it but rather liked double 0
we will end war by actavly attacking any one engaging in war
we could also end war by destroying all life
no kill like overkill
now all this talk of overkill I want to go watch gunbuster.
lol
bleh I realy need to sort my external drive one of these days.
lol me too kinda
find out if I am missing any eps and get them all in the same folders based on show.
get rid of LQ versions of shwos if I have HQ
and then in folders based on season
dont run in to that too much with anime.
ya
13-26 eps and taht is it.
usually so
some may have a second later on but they always change the name.
nanoha and FMP for example.
or the second comes so later down the road it's damn near a new show. the 15 year or so gap between gunbuster one and two.
full metal panic turned into full metal gear alchemist in the shell
lol
yeah the overdrive thing was a bit much
i actually have no idea about FMP
what changed?
ah well he got a case of the emos
he?
yeah soskay (sp) lasted most of TSR till Kana kicked some sence in to him t
Might try and show some eps asuming the powers taht be are cool with it and well I get some time off work.
8 days in a row ending in a plated dinner for 25000 is fffffffffun
plated dinners sound hard to eat
like a tank
yes you must attack the weakspot when it glows to get at your steak.
lol
We have buffet dinners and plated dinners.
buffet is easy as we just put all the food in warmer pans and it's help your self.
platted is as it sounds, presented on plats sit down dinner style.
25000 dinners is going to be insane.
wow
i wasn't sure what you meant by dinner for 25000
i was thinking $25000
like you're eating gold bars or something lol
lol
now think of having that much money in $1 bills
and then think of those bills being people who all want a plate of dinner
so that comes to roughly 150 tons of cow we have to cook plate, and serv
party is gonna be spread out over 3 floors in the banuet halls
lol DANG
sure we are charging them an arm and a leg for it all too.
probably around 30 bucks a plate
lord knows what the rentalcost is.
so that's like 750k.. gosh
for plates
if someone took all the earnings and left they would be rich
which gives me an idea.. where is this being held?
i'm going to defend the place and regain my honor!
lol
Vegas of corse
lol alright i guess i should have known
besides I am sure they already payed.
well that's vegas.. paying for stuff before getting it and hoping nothing goes wrong
not that i would really know:P
more or less.
Here have some old giant robot action.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHXS2_NV4-0&feature=related
starts out with passionately yelling women.. that's pretty oldschool
although that still happens all the tim
time*
as if their yelling makes the machines stronger
She was't all super powerd or heroic and sucked at everything so the yelling was a mantra or some such.
though i haven't seen it so for all i know it could
with all that we've imagined the reality of this night is sure to make this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LIPFgMcVA
Is anyone online this early?
I guess not. haha
i am
just weighing out my options.. wondering how i'm gonna waste the day away
hey is anyone online?
its like 6 in the morning here
nevermind
byea
i just said iwas
D:
well take care i guess
/me yawns
lonesome road was fun but now theres my day
gone
sweet sweet FA to do
i never see fan art shortened like that
my mind jumped to fur affinity.. lol
i don't even go to fur affinity
soo
when's the discord shipping fics gonna start pouring in
what's the ETA on that
i think that's already started
well dunno about fics
fyi FA tends to mean fuck all
yeah i've seen pictures with discord and pinkie, but just innocent one's since i stay away from the r34 stuff
yeah I'm quite sure I've seen DicordX fics
or pople saying they've started one
what a world
yeah
x3
I need to hit my FLGS
ya i avoid R34 too so idk about that stuff.. and i rather like to keep on not knowing
I think Black Curasade and Unhallowed Metropolis Revised are in.
r34 gideline there is
x3
really I've hardly ever been surpised at a missing r34 content
not sure exactly what you mean there
there tends to be pretty much any r34 you can think of in existance
I'm sure some artiest just dedicate them sleves to making rule 34 true...
oh ya i wouldn't doubt that at all.. i'm sure it's turned into some sort of game
what how long dose it take a .pdf to get on the net its been up for sale for a good 3 weeks
I don't want to shell out £15 on the pdf when I'm buying the book for £30 odd too
if i was an artist into that sort of thing i'm sure i would enjoy making stuff like that
but i'm not and that's sick
it just makes me sad
i guess it makes sense a lot of furries are into MLP
and in the internet, there are A LOT of furries
aye
wait theres an RPG called Leaverage
LAWL
lol idk why furries being into MLP makes you sad
no the existance of MLP r34 is what makes me sad
ah ya ok
r24 is for EVERY thing
34**
i stay away so it doesn't REALLY bother me but
really
just stay away
if it makes one sad
i've never been this closely connected to the fans of that stuff
i don't like anime
but it will exist for anything
i don't watch new animated movies
don't like anime? D:
if you like animation of any sort then you are almost certainly missing out
eh not really
i've seen plenty
i've enjoyed some
still not a fan
like.. bleach/naruto/one piece?
those are some of the most famous ones.. not the best though
like death note, berserk, cowboy bebop
and uh
hellsing
those are some that i enjoyed parts of
but overall i'd rather watch something else
and vast majority of what i see is total garbage that i think you have to just be really into the whole animation thing
in short i'm not a fan, liked some stuff, hated most, don't go out of my way to watch more
ok.. death note.. well if you still don't like anime after seeing things like death note/fruits basket/gurren lagann.. or something then i guess lol
well i don't like alot of the more famous anime.. that's why i avoid them and watch the ones that i think i will like and usually i can tell based on the cover art and the summary if i will like it or not
so i really don't have much experience with bad anime shows
that said i've never seen any you listed except death note but i know of them
Ainme is too varryied to really say it's all crap
imho any how
it would be live saying liveaction is crap
ya that's what i'm sayin
though I guess it has an added language/culture barrier
you gotta really be opposed to animation in general to dislike it
I wouldn;t know
spent a chunk of early childhood in Japan
cool
i've never been there but i wanna go
still can't read japanese any more
x3
I'm sure I must have been able to once
but I've totaly forgotten most of the lnaguage
I can get the jist of it some times
and I knwo the odd word
really no soild help
k.. lol dunno what else to say
lol
btw i actually might not have heard of berserk
Berserk be huge
IIRC
i am thinking.. super bloody anime
but I've not seen much
dude with super huge eyebrows
Rings bells
but google images isn't helping
is deff heavily violent
then i'm sure it's what i'm thinking of
Guts ring a beel
bell is the mains name
also cool 2012 brings a new anime
of films aiming to cover the full manga
This web radio sation feels like avery DJ on it's libary on shuffle...
I can't say it's bad
but it sure is swaping tone fast
is on AutoDJ atm
anyway mantis if you don't want to watch anime that's alright but i don't really see why you wouldn't like it as a whole since it has a huge variety.. i don't even watch anime for the fandoms.. i watch anime and hardly ever touch their fandoms
aye
the only Fandom to grab me was Hellsing
Manga and OVA
the orginal anime is ok but really off track form the manga
the most i see of fandoms is when i have to watch a show on youtube lol
ironic..
lol
I have just seen DDR controled Tetres
I can die complet now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAZdgTVhzsI
well not really I have some other things to tie up
and also MLP needs to stop airing
fandoms don't really interest me unless they have a reason to.. bronies for instance are just that awesome.. they interest me alot.. other fandoms are not so interesting since i'm not following anything with them i guess
Bronies I've not met one I hate
and i just don't see how they could be as awesome as bronies
and I've meant soem I should hate...
you shouldn't hate anyone
lol
I have self lothing still but FiM stole all my other hate
i don't really understand self-loathing
the most importent part is having reasons
well i think i have PLENTY
lol
06,15ohay ponies
Hey
i mean i have felt like i wanted to go die in a hole before.. i mean i think i have.. i'm pretty sure i've said so at least.. but that wasn't cause i hated myself.. that was actually just something i wanted to do
because i hated what i did
yeah
then all you need is to hate yourself for doing that
i don't think it's good to hate yourself.. you can hate what you did but there's no changing it now and hating yourself won't solve anything.. and if you're using it as an excuse to keep doing nothing then stop it
i mean if you're using it as an excuse to keep doing whatever you hate doing then i could see the interest in self-loathing
nah
/me opens his bottle of pepsi Max and tastes it for the very first time.
first time with pepis max
it's ok
k well i can totally see people doing that.. hating themselves because they feel better about what they're doing
the drink makes me go batt shit hyper though
or rather so they can feel better about it
/me grunts and WAVES, saying good morning.
hey
afternoon to you
hehehehe
i just wish people could admit their problems.. and if they still want to do whatever they're doing that's wrong go ahead but don't hide it or try to justify it.. just admit it
ah
06,15Oh goddammit.... now I'll be busy for the next couple of weeks... http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/baldurs-gate-pony-mod.html
i guess i'll quit rambling on now lol unless yall actually like to hear what i have to say.. relevant or not
yeah I saw that RobotPinkie
x3
06,15That's srsly awesome.
enjoy hearing but I need to head out and "waste" money
yup
lol alright
take care!
06,15later Dumori, I guess
nice talking with you
hey RobotPinkie
got some RPG books to buy and gush over
06,15'sup Dermathil
should keep me going to new pony day

haha ohhhh yes.. i know what you mean.. although i don't do that myself:P
testing pepsi max out at 8:30 in the morning...
06,15I have a ton of RPG books... more than is healthy...
06,15The best time to test out caffeinated beverages is in the morning, so...
just before class?
Oh, and I'd still do it at 11PM.
06,15Yeah, I think so...
06,15That's when I need caffeine the most, anyway
hehehehehe
/me still has to thank NewDCD for the linkies for the two TTGL movie downloads.
hey guys
speaking of which.. procrastination.. that's an annoying concept to me.. if you procrastinate and still worry about actually doing the work then you should actually do the work.. worrying about it does nothing.. so either decide early on to not do it and save the stress or do it and be done with it
MeteorVenture, that's not how it works.
First, you want to do it, but you can't be arsed since you're bored. So you say you'll do it on the next day. Then it goes on until the very last day.
well i mean if in the end you actually don't do it
that made completly no sense to me MeteorVenture
MeteorVenture, half the time people does it at the very end.
you put it off until you don't do it.. that sort of thing
Because they want to have the fun they could have after BEFORE doing it.
not like putting it off till you actually do it at the last minute
/me doesn't think I'll go hunting today.
ARARCHY IN THE MIDWEST
anarchy
meteorventure, doing it at the last minute is EXACTLY what procrastination is.
06,15I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was.
You push it back 'til the last minute.
POKEMON!!
i will not sing that theme again...
06,15To catch them is my real test, to train them is my caaaaause
GOTTA CATCH EM' ALL!
listen.. i've procrastinated before.. i worried about doing it all along.. and at the last moment i realized it was not worth it to actually do it.. i much rather not do it
06,15I will travel across the land, searching far and wide
do what exactly? some essay of some sort?
MeteorVenture: you listen. I'm probably the biggest procrastinating bastard in the entire chat. I should know, I've recieved dozens of detentions because of it.
i did that plenty of times till i realized it's INCREDIBLY stupid.. even if smart people can do it too lol
Due to incomplete works.
oh
06,15each pokemon to understand, the power that's insiiiiiide
06,15POKEMON!
trust me,
i have been detention tonnes of times for no homework/late coursework
¨¨
06,15Ouch, probably a good plan to not procrastinate then
and around 18/30 of my lessons are empty i do the homework then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux8mJUexBcM
well either way i mean if you don't think you'll do it in the end.. just skip it and save the mental trouble.. if you think you will then do it.. but whatever you do DON'T worry about it until it passes over as you smile uneasily at it so you can feel better about yourself later
MeteorVenture, I don't wanna do it NOW, that's the important thing. I wanna do it LATER.
lol i know
that's what the concept of procrastination revolves around.
i know how it works.. but you need to eventually actually do it for it to work
Kind-of putting it as priority 2 and always moving something else in the priority 1 slot.
I know
that's what the last minute is for
yep...
i'm saying if at the last minute you resolve not to do it.. you could probably tell from the beginning that you would do that.. at least i know i can
i know myself better than that.. i know whether i'm gonna do something or not
so if i know i'm not going to it's best to decide that at the start
MeteorVenture, most people can't actually tell from the beginning, and that's what the concept of procrastination is the result of.
Hey guys
k.. well it's most likely cause they don't try
hey LunaTheForgotten
>they don't try
what the hell are you saying right now?
you don't have the whole picture to say that.
it's not tough.. in the end it's alot better
MeteorVenture, maybe for you, but not for everybody else.
i'm saying most likely
don't use most likely, because you have no proof that it is actually the case. Use maybe instead.
and you can't tell me i don't know what i'm talking about cause you don't know what i'm talking about
You are talking about the fact that they don't try to figure out early on whether they will do work or not later on.
im finding this argument very interesting...
So yeah, I do know.
lol no you don't
Dash,So am I
Then mind clarifying your points, then? Explain?
mostly because it sort of describes what i used to be like
i was not talking about that.. i was talking about they don't try to learn themselves well enough
first of all you should know yourself.. your history
you should pay attention
if you do it every time you're going to do it again
MeteorVenture, that's called being torn apart between having FUN and doing the work.
06,15YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!
i don't know what you mean
thanks, RobotPinkie.
06,15You're welcome.
Hey RobotPinkie
how does reviewing your history stop the fun? it actually makes things funner when you realize you're not going to do it anyway and you just skip the whole thing and don't worry about it
MeteorVenture: that's meaning you are having a hard time choosing whether you want to have fun first and do it later and doing the work then.
06,15I think the entire argument is a bit silly, but go on.
06,15Hey LunaTheForgotten :)
RobotPinkie: just trying to clear some stuff up with Meteor.
both me and LunaTheForgotten find this argument interesting....
We do.
i should talk about controversial stuff i know 100% without a doubt more often
:P
MeteorVenture: then that's not procrastination. Not at all.
06,15Certainty is always more fun when you're wrong. :P
i'm joking around of course..
06,15trolololo
Like I said already, procrastination revolves around the uncertainty.
So if you know, then you are not procrastinating.
exactly though.. i'm saying that procrastination is not very smart
and that you should do something smart
MeteorVenture, you are basically insulting a big bunch of people by using these terms. Maybe they don't know, but you do in their backs right now.
What I'm trying to say is that Not everyone is as "perfect" as you.
i did clarify earlier that even smart people can do dumb things
Most people have a much harder time deciding between the sensations that fun gives and the boredom that work gives.
has the chats layout changed for anyone else or is it just me?...
nope, Dash.
It's the same for me.
i realize that.. also i was not meaning to say anyone was dumb.. just cause something someone does is dumb doesn't mean they are
Always been like that.
must be this school computer then
God, I love homeschool.
somewhat lucky LunaTheForgotten
:)
i was homeschooled.. glad i was too.. but eventually i realized i didn't like school altogether
jk that was apparent from the start:P
at some points i wish i was home schooled but then i wouldnt have as much of a social life...
but i still much prefer homeschooling
but in all fairness i would like to of been homeschooled
I wasn't homeschooled till the 7 grade though
So I got that social interaction
i dont really get the difference oif USA's schools 7th grade and Year 7 here in the UK
/me is happy he ended that infernal debate.
Idk, I'm in the USA
i was homeschooled all after kindergarten.. i basically quit before the 5th grade though.. the work piled up and such.. not that i couldn't do it though.. it was just exceptionally boring and unchallenging at that.. so i skipped right to the GED and passed that with flying colors
i think that the age of 7th grade is the minimal age of year 6
/me was in public school in elementary school
/me went to private institution for high school.
in all fairness i most likely would of been better if i was living in USA
I started 7th grade at 12 but turned 13 during the year.
My brothers went to private school for highschool.
/me misses the days back when there was only 12 people in chat until 3PM
its 2pm over here...
It's 9am here
probably around 9 for you
i went to church for my social interactivities
So do I
/me mumbles something about churches...
hated it...
lol, church
/me plays in church band.
/me lives in a place where the younger generations don't give squat to religion.
(half a century ago they controlled the school and the lives of everybody, basically)
(people eventually decided that it was time to change)
Shut it Dermathil.
i have mixed opinions of religion...
LunaTheForgotten, I am talking about what they did where I live.
Where do you live?
alabama
Province of Quebec, Canada.
Oh........Sorry.
i believe there is an after life (mostly because of karma) and that there is a creator and thats it really...
I live in Georgia though
to me it's not enough to think there's a creator.. i want to know him personally
MeteorVenture, True dat
*brohoof*
Personally, I don't believe in things that have no irrefutable proof of it. I pretty much observe and study. I prefer to believe in things that I can find proof that exists.
i hope that the "after life" is a choice e.g. live as a different person/animal from birth or go to your personal heaven
/me has stolen, kills most days, and has never regularly gone to church. Sue me.
/me accepts brohoof
06,15Confound these telephones, they drive me to answering them.
DashWithRainbows: you be buddhist?
no...
I don't want to be a animal!!
brb
i just like some of their ideas mixed in from other religions
i don't really think proof is something you can have.. i think there's plenty of foolish things to believe or not believe though
06,15Well, I hope that when you die, you can choose to live as a pony in Equestria.
Dash, the concept of buddhism is that you will be reborn until you achieve perfection, upon which you will ascend to the afterlife.
06,15I think this is fairly likely, tbh
i think enough evidence is good enough if it lines up right with everything else
RobotPinkie wins, topic closed.
thats what my personal heaven would be RobotPinkie, now like Trollestia said, topic closed
now what shall we discuss??
mods always win >.>
06,15Haha, no need to close the topic for that, religion is interesting.
and I'm back
06,15Just don't... y'know... troll about it...
/me doesn't know who's a mod and who isn't.
/me would love if RobotPinkie was right, but is pretty sure it actually is like a dreamless sleep where you see/feel/hear nothing, where you can't think or even react to anything.
Guys, I have to go to tennis
I'll seee you later
/me thinks the afterlife is an actual state of lack of live.
*life
alright take care luna:D
06,15Later, LunaTheForgotten
cya Forgotten one
Being dead is probably nothing. If it isn't, all the better.
bye LunaTheForgotten !
/me isn't about to worry about it in the meantime.
Trollestia knows my philosophy well.
06,15Pretty much. If you're just gone, there's no cause for worrying about it. If not, well hey, cool.
Better do what you want now instead of hoping that you can still do it in the afterlife.
one more thing
Are they streaming anything today
06,15Don't think so... might link to my synchtube later if nothing's going on...
i dont think so LunaTheForgotton
had to mention..
my home laptop's screen is absolutly fucked right now...
I don't kill randomly, I only take what I need. I thank my kills for the food, but that's mostly an old habit.
that's nice i suppose
when you kill someone/something, be polite...
reminds me of avatar lol
Yeah. They at least deserver that.
brb, need to sign a piece of paper to say im on this computer....
*deserve
06,15plz don't eat ponies :(
Horses are worth more alive than dead, of course.
As for a *pony* pony, I wouldn't touch them.
06,15Well ponies aren't exactly horses, yeah...
again.. just joking around
06,15I pretty much agree with that, though I try to avoid eating once living things that aren't fish.
06,15Mostly for health reasons, though...
even hamburger meat? whatever that stuff is made of?
oh ok
ok im back
06,15That's just cardboard and compost, perfectly fine to eat :P
still better sounding than candy
06,15Nah I do eat hamburgers on occasion, I just try to not overdo it.
i like stuff like hamburger helper
meh, i dont really enjoy hamburgers often...
hamburgers are alright.. but when i eat those it's chicken sandwiches
usually
06,15Chicken is delicious
what meats do you guys actually eat anyways??
i so agree with you RobotPinkie
Whatever I hunt.
KFC is awesome
I very rarely buy food.
Well, besides cola and such things.
06,15I eat sheep from the farm, on occasion.
for me in order from best to i like - Chicken, Turkey, Galmon, Beef
06,15Really delicious meat.
06,15What's it called again? Mutton?
i just thought about eating the pound puppies
i think so....
cause of mutton
Ew, cotton.
06,15Secret mutt fun
i see what you did there....
06,15...I sincerely apologize...
but srsly the spam when that Ad shows...
we need a pound puppies stream
06,15I dunno about that, I've never seen it.
i have only heard of it because of the advert
even then it sounds terrible...
but daniel ingram
06,15He makes music for it?
i believe so
just curious, who is Daniel Ingram?
and martha speaks (which i thought was really dang funny when me and my brother watched it while flipping around channels a LONG time ago)
06,15Oh, yeah, IMDB confirms it
the dude who makes the songs in MLP
06,15Yeah, what he said :P
the background music is someone else though.. i think will anderson
im trying to find a good download of the background music as well as the songs...
i've been following daniel's fb page
06,15Wow, he has almost 8000 fans on facebook now...
since before the huge boost in likes *hipster*
better make it one more closer to 8000 later then...
06,15Pffft
06,15and yeah, you should :P
06,15I just love the songs he's done for FiM
gotta love when he decides to ask for something with an exchange of unreleased music
obvious as they are really awesome RobotPinkie
06,15so many awesome remixes on YouTube, too.
its rare i find some PMV's i actualy like to listen to again
06,15Well, percentage wise it's not a lot that I've saved and listen to...
06,15It's mostly PinkiePieSwear and NotACleverPony, lawl
sitcoms are like "what is this place filled with so many one-liners?"
06,15I see what you did thar :P
like two and a half men...
i thought of it and had to say it:P
06,15That happens to me sometimes, too
yet i still liked to watch it but with Ashton as charlie i think it will go downhill.
06,15It was pretty clever
06,15Ashton needs to start bangin' seven gram rocks
did someone say ash? http://i1216.photobucket.com/albums/dd377/volt28/memes-dat-ash-ay-girl-can-i-get-yo-digletts-Copy.jpg
he needs Charlies brain but he would not be able to handle it
06,15Did someone say Ash? http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yy6Y12nWqjU/TPfX2oKdriI/AAAAAAAAAJM/FBI5Mw9prDo/s1600/ash_boomstick.jpg

ASH
Where's your chainsaw man?
06,15It's out of frame, but still attached
/me wishes he had his own boomstick...

cya Dermathil,
Morning everypony
that from todays nightly round up?
ohai AllisZero !
06,15mornin' AllisZero
eh that reference to rocky was a longshot (not to be confused with hookshot)
eh that reference to zelda was a hookshot
/me never played zelda...
(not to be confused with confusion)
/me played pokemon instead
i guess you didn't catch em all
caught every pokemon on every game...
dealwithit.jpg
while you were trying to catch em all with pokemon i caught all big poe's
dealwithit.jpg
1. what is a big poe?
2. also fit in halo series and command and conquer into childhood
it's from zelda
06,15Ocarina of Time
>mfw this conversation
when i joined AllisZero
MeteorVenture: and Dermatill were arguing about procrastination
then it somewhat went into our views on religion
Lol
then about Daniel ingram
cause he's a religion himself
also forgot about meat we eat...
:P
and now its about zelda/pokemon
06,15And now it's about what the conversation is about.
06,15How meta!
and in the future it's gonna be music

i love dubstep.. let me explain why
06,15I wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub dubstep
06,15lolololol
i wub wub wub wub woo woo woo
i herd u guys wub dubstep?
to bad im not going to post any :D
06,15Well, I like some dubtrot I've heard, anyway...
aww no lols about what i considered to be a great pun
lol
so i do it myself.. because if i don't who will?
06,15I thought I made that pun too, kinda :P
/narrative
dubtrot i will most likely listen to for some off reason
odd*
oh.. i totally missed the I
great pun robot
Why is Twilight always brown?
lol
06,15lol you too
06,15Twilight is brown?
lol thanks.. i try:P
I don't know; whenever Twi is drawn humanized, she has dark skin
Never got the reasoning behind that
@AllisZero Cant tell if making a joke or a statement
oh then yeah,
i never understood that either..
ok.. i think this is what happened
06,15Oh yeah... I really dunno
06,15I don't really see them as any specific skin color
a person who works on the show drew humanized ponies
twilight was black/brown/whatever
06,15Ahh okay, that would explain it
Yeah, probably
i dont really care for humanized ponies...
YOU BREAK MY HEART
i think there were a few people raging over that
06,15Me neither... I much prefer ponyized humans
I'm drawing some at home
which of course makes me lol to even think about
as long its not rule 34 AllisZero then i would like to see it
i think i have it saved somewhere in my HUGE FOLDER... anyway
or that's something else i'm thinking of
http://imgur.com/gallery/nr2PZ
It's not; I don't draw porn, though I'm told I'd be very good at it.
Trollestia: out of fucking nowhere.
It's my special gift, you know.
your cutie mark perhaps?
Nah, that's a rifle.
not to derail.. let's talk about humanized ponies over in THAT corner
/me doesn't know how a rifle would fit on a flank, but whatever.
thats a good comic
i know i lol'd
06,15ponified humans > humanized ponies
a small rifle perhaps Trollestia ?
06,15Fact.
Sure.

Essentially I sent all traffic to an interface that couldn't receive it :P

Eh, minor setback for some people
Also, the Su-37 doesn't get the credit it deserves.
But a huge benefit to everyone else
Still, I hate making mistakes

As realistic as Ace Combat usually is, I don't see how the plane opening up to reveal the laser is aerodynamically possible.
9Ace Combat works on Gundam physics
9try not to think about it so hard
Which Gundam physics? They vary.
/me beamspams Trollestia
Sound in space

That kind
So, realistic until the plot says otherwise?
no.. always realistic all the time

What makes a $10000 computer be slow as shit with no signs of distress anywhere?

jk but i really didn't quite notice
You forgot a background process somewhere.
Weren't they using handguns because lowly Ganmen couldn't use spiral power?
They could still have proper frame-mounted guns.

Goldeneye was probably my favourite N64 game, but i didn't exactly *game* then.
me and my siblings played that alot
Yeah.
goldeneye was so awesome
with auto-aim off and licensed to kill (1 shot kills)
/me loves how I'm probably older than you, but we both nostalgia over Goldeneye.
oo, how old are you Trollestia?
but not always.. sometimes just normal
lol ya i'm 19:P
Twenty-two now. Don't remind me.
lol
I'll be 22 in november D:
07,1age is just a number...
Also, that means I've been here for three years. Odd.
g'morning
Morning.
if age is just a number then why does everyone say i'm mature now that i'm 19? checkmate
I'm probably fairly immature.
Eh, I'm 25. You are all youngsters to me.
i've always been mature for my age from what i can tell.. but being mature doesn't always mean acting like it:P
25 of age, 75 in will to live
i thought you were zero
/me feels old, for various reasons.
Ahh yes. Disco Discord?
i remember feeling old even when i was only like.. 14 or 16 or something.. sometimes i would just think about how i wasted my life away.. then i would realize i'm still a kid
I remember having those thoughts when I was 10, Meteor
07,1and yes it's Discord
lol well i don't actually have a set timestamp on those thoughts.. lol
but 10 is pretty young for those types of thoughts probably
i don't seem to really have those thoughts anymore though
at least i haven't for a long time

@meteor: I have them nowadays more than ever
Even if by all standards my life has been pretty productive so far, I guess it goes without saying I'm one of those people who're never satisfied.

Just the channel, I think.
07,1there's none just different chatrooms
Or that
Perpetual loading.
My proxy doesn't like that streaming service apparently

Dash theatre is 20% faster
Dash is also the first, and therefore the easiest to click on

"The ultimate in equestrian robotics"
On one of the FO3 loading screens
With a robot horse
Derp?
That's a great slide :P
ok so who has this new Google+ thing?
9hmm
9I'm debating whether I should open a tumblr
He
9well I actually just got an idea
hey
9guys
9what would you think of "Ask BronyState"
Why not?
Why so?
seems semi pointless
Not underground enough for me
9I want to make a tumblr for drawings, but yeah
/me 9is actually a drawfag as well
for Brony State not sure why it's needed.
/me 9an art-blocked, very uninspired one, but one nonetheless
9well, for fun
/me is a wirtefag my drawings are best left alone
true
9and "Ask New DCD" sounds a bit too much of own ego strokan
also DCD you stole my thunder I had a rant to make ;)
Stupid Fanstys Flight
The new 40kRPG book is in every shop in the UK
but they can;t sell it to friday
and I just spent too much on my trip out to buy the book I won't pick it up for ages.
and yeah Ask DCD is a bit egocentric
9maybe I should make Ask Caramel...
9(and then Val nuked me from orbit)
x3
So newDCD how are you?
Do it DCD!
9OH SHIT BROS
9I HAD THE GREATEST IDEA FOR A DRAWING
9will probably make it next week though since I'm really fucked up time-wise
9http://veranimesonline.com/anime_imgs/mazinkaiser-skl.jpg
9That
9with Snips and Snails
and I shall read the Leaverage RPG book
x3
i did not buy it just cos of the name honest
I did how ever down load the .pdf due to it
Wow I hate these people so much.
"Oh what's that? The PC broke down? Should've gotten a Mac"
Yeah, please, be my guest and try to explain to the owner why spending 8 thousand dollars on a PC I bought for three makes more sense.
x3
hell a mac night not even do the same jobs
decently
Trash can?
Pony, please... it's been lost forevere
/me is thinking of that parody mac ad
oh I got stalked by a pony today
x3
lol
was in zee city going to the FLGS
and there was a pony
on the street
for some charity
and i started following me
was weird
wasn't candy coloued though
:(
is it saturday yet?
It is in my thoughts.
lol
well I need it to be firday
gotta blow my money on pointless stuff
my music libary some time disurbes even me
Dumori: how come?
Mindless Self Indulgence/ The Left Rights tracks
normaly only iffy if they are on right after something much more normal or a zone out for a bit
but zoneing back in to a song about anal toeing is quite jarring to say the least
Hmm. Is the cutie mark of the Anonpony the words "cutie mark not available?"
maybe
Wow, this is making me increasingly mad.
Trollestia, it's actuall a little red X
Fair enough.
So the face is covered with text like Anon's, right?

Especially if you have mods
I kept crashing when going out of rivet city
08,1lol I can't actually tell who's active or not on mIRC
Eh, I have been fooling with it for to long already. Im done for now
Me too, i just got the last acheivement for it sunday

Ill just play Dead Island XD

I did on PS3, havent gotten it for PC yet
06,15Right click their names, Fluttershy`? I dunno how mIRC works, really...
I didnt finish it
08,1hmmm

2Nice
still waiting for the helpdesk to open fw ports...
So I can use irssi as a proxy :3
It was a pain :p but im an achievement whore and wanted to be done and go to gears 3. Seriously 2.0 :P it sucked
2Same i like Achievements
Lonesome Road is out today. :)
Or yesterday, but whatever.
06,15Good lord, those images.... no matter how much I scrub, my brain will never be clean again...
you gotta be VERY good to draw that bad
06,15I mean most of the pose sketches are actually GOOD, I seriously don't understand how he can fuck up the last step so much.
06,15...and the faces, sweet mother of Celestia...
Problem is
Whats your gamerscore?
RobotPinkie: the eyes...
i will treasure those faces.. and show them to my sister who will instantly lose her drawing abilities
06,15Ahaha, oh lawd

lol
wait.. http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/131662377926.jpg
Pfft, mines 32,000 something
the bottom right image instantly made me think of "feels good man"
I'm bad but not that bad
lol
Those people HAVE to be trolling
There's no way anyone can be that much of a crook
06,15Top image is the colored version of that.... Quick, to the macro-mobile!
lol
2wow
2Hey GGgala_
Its wierd when i look at my games, like it shouldnt be that high
If i had all that i could id have like 60000
if that tutorial taught me anything it's "don't be afraid to make mistakes"
Riiiight
06,15Haha... I dunno, in some cases I think the mediocre drawing in books like that is a good thing, like "don't worry if it's not perfect"
The person who wrote the damn book is a mistake
06,15In this case, it's WAY beyond that.
08,1WAI DO I HAVE 'AT THE GALA' STUCK IN MAH HEAD?! D:
Fluttershy`: I know the thing to get it out there
that's the pony song that gets stuck in my head the most too :c
06,15I am here at the grand gala, for it is the best party
but THEN
WINTER WRAP UP
and repeat
06,15but the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie!
/me pokes RobotPinkie hard in the spleen
06,15owwww, my spleen :(
Fluttershy`: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeOYJO-jFGs

You should give me your gamertag, so if you get gears 3 i can kill you ruthlessly

06,15Haha, I've seen that one :P
I wish I could try that just for lultz
/me falls on the ground and dies
I'd need a place in the middle of nowhere for it though xD
i'm starting to feel kinda bad about laughing about all this

(Not that I would be biased as I play chaos space marines in Wh40k)

Et tu Brute is actually a name of a map in Halo 3 campaign
2,14 I did dermathil, hence the "Down with Caeser" line :P
Dirfraku: that's a reference to the line in the shakespeare play
/me brohoofs Valthejean.
/me brohoofs dermathil
Referenceception!
07,1lol
06,15You so awesome, Fluttershy` <3
06,15PLZ SAVE IT FOR ME
Say Fluttershy`, is it easier to draw with draw tablet than with regular pencil?
I still think he should be a shell fish of some kind
You sir, got great literary tastes. And that's one of those things that are awesome.
/me has read hamlet, Julius caesar and Romeo&Juliet
2,14 :P
2,14 yeah, in my brit lit class we had the choice between JC and Romeo and Juliet
noo, fluttershy.
2,14 and I read Romeo and Juliet WAY too many times (hate that play)
Nooo, the Caesar references :P
he looks like a snake
2,14 so I went with JC
we need chief thunderhooves with an afro
The refception was about the Julius Caesar ref
No Macbeth?
2,14 not for that particular assignment
have yet to read it, dari
2,14 Macbeth was the year before
probably
06,15Haha
Fluttershy, the ref was unrelated to you
2,14 YOU HAVEN'T READ MACBETH?
06,15YAY!
2,14 Bubble bubble toil and trouble?
Valthejean, haven't read it YET
It is in my to-read
/me takes back his brohoof
6yfw julius caeser is not pronounced julius sea-zer, but julius kai-zer.
RBD seapony?
:3
draw a 2 headed sea pony.. 1 head being pinkie and the other being surprise
>yfw that's how I pronounce it Violet
06,15Kaizer Söze
Stop singing :_;
MFW Val got the quote wrong.

A wild virtual machine appears!
Luna, Y U starting XP in vbox? :P
RobotPinkie has colored text? Are you a mod now?
2,14 Sea pegasi don't have wings! they have FINS!

<3
06,15lol hai mib_bkc2ds, who u? :P
06,15and yeah, I am.
2,14 lol, EVERYONE knows that violet :P
i love the expressions though
More singing!
Oh, I'm just some sock puppet account for someone who was too afraid to ask with my username for some reason that I don't remember now RobotPinkie
2,14 just like everyone knows if you play the Skyward Sword trailer backwards it's zelda's lullaby
then suddenly my face fell off
You're a mod now RP? Congratulations!
Discord as a Sea Something or Other
my desktop pony's app worked... i think i overdid it a bit
06,15Thanks RandomExtra <3

Is Flutterbro a mod now as well? I saw that he was an OP in #Fluttershy, so I can only guess.
That's some good singing
awsome singing
07,1No he's not
Oh.
>mfw I'm watching something on megavideo and suddenly a pop-up ad called Caesary
2,14 it's a sign dermathil, GET READING
06,15Well, he's not a mod on #bronystate, in any case :P
Dat hostname
Valthejean, I already read Julius Caesar
2,14 GET READING AGAIN
Ah. Well, congrats to all then.
It's because of the network merges.
Hey everypoony
pony*
/me continues to watch his "unicorn and the wasp" Ft. David tennant thing.
obabo~ oooooh.. didn't mean to make you presiserp of unitinu
Can you sing something for me, Fluttershy`?
Aw it didn't change my nick..
06,15I'm so banned by now...
ooh, someone's connected on his android phone
Fluttershy`: 10,11/)13^10,11313^10,11(\
Dermathil: I've been on my android few times here :P
It's algorithm.
Am I Evil, by Diamond Head, /Docta/
Got to love irssi for that reason
08,11bliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinding
Diftraku: I didn't notice it due to whoising you
YAY
Using AndroIRC at the moment.
Someone fixed it with the ham banner again!
2,14 mmmmm.....ham banner....
Dermathil: It doesn't show up on /who, I got irssi running 247
06,15permenant ham banner? Sounds delicious.
Delicious ham banner.
ham banner... *drools*
/me brohoofs Dermathil
Your IRC is lagging.
Satisfying ham banner
Banhammers are for chumps. Real men wear a good pair of boots
Ham banner? AH! Don't post any spoilers gaiz! You'll ban all of the ham from BronyState, and we don't want that to happen do we?
Oh the lag..
Such lag.
Dem streamception!
Indeed
Dat lag....
06,15Or maybe we'll turn all of the bans into ham?
We must go deeper...
/me bans Ham
Lagception?
o.o
Indeed
08,1darnit >>
08,1I hate lag D:
RobotPinkie: would that be set mode +h then?
Lol Fluttershy
06,15+ham, pretty sure...
08,1I don't even know how badly it's lagging! >_<
06,15Then only mods can talk.
08,1okay
08,1I will say something
08,1now
singer fluttershy's lament
06,15...about ham.
sing*
There's about a second or two between irc and video Fluttershy`
Yeas, sing Fluttershy's Lament...somehow.
*Yeah
06,15More than that...
^
Oh poo... Steam lost connection again...
06,156 seconds or so for me, but it's okay.
08,1hmmm
08,1guess it depends on connection speed
global warming is not an issue! we got air conditioners
06,15I mean it's lag on two places, first your stream has to reach Luna, then Luna has to reach us.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLvjfrxynA Good luck.
08,1ahh true
Actually
06,15or well "lag", Luna probably gets it as fast as possible :P
It's a good song, just impossible to sing.
First Fluttershy` streams to livestream, which is then passed to Luna and who then streams it to owncast and then to us :3
Oh hey. I was looking for that song
You're welcome, then.
08,1though Luna has super fast internet lol
06,15Yeah, I thought that part was kinda understood in the process.
Streamception
:P
Oh so there is aa stream?
06,15Yeah Flutterguy, bronystate.net
This is almost as cool as NewDCD's streamception
/me wishes he could stream. One day...
RobotPinkie can't get on my computer for a couple of hours, I'm just on mobile talking.. :/
/me has nothing of interest to stream.
06,15Aw, too bad Flutterguy :(

I have learned photosynthesis

06,15I kinda want to do some streaming of when I play games...
ah
Oh lawl
That comic xD
06,15Only problem is my computer kinda blows.
RobotPinkie you and me both
Someday RobotPinkie :)
I don't always play games on my computer. But when I do, it's usually TF2.
That's quite, um, interesting comic.
Love that one as well
­>mfw I discover there's a livestream stuff available called megalive
06,15Yeah, someday I'm gonna stream when I play Ninja Gaiden Sigma on Way of the Master Ninja difficulty :P
06,15That should be hilarious.
Sad day for Fluttershy.
Me sitting behind my sentry would be boring. PS3 games, less boring, but harder to stream.
06,15Probably never gonna happen, though, lawl
Ewwww, sims
Sims 3 is good.
Bleh sims
06,15Minecraft is fun to watch, if the right person is playing.
Sims is only good for locking your sim in a block surrounded with mirrors
And then speeding up time
terraria is behtur
MEINC--
Diftraku ...What?
06,15Yay Jolicraft!!!!!
WAT
Fallout: Most boring stream?
modded?
/me hugs Fluttershy`
LOLS
Organic_Algorithm: I had Sims 2 a while ago for a short time
Didn't really play it
Diftraku you know what was better? Playing Sim City games and constantly calling on natural disasters.
Flutterguy: I did that so often :P

I blame the gaming community I used to be a part of.
It was a lounge for lurkers.
puppy in a box
Ohey, who's streaming?
Luna
Oh nice.
Alrighty then
I suppose you should type in the other five channels. So type in /mode #Fluttershy +b $c:#applejack
You'll of course have to do that with the other 4 channels as well.
Ohey Prince Dari
Alright, good, it works.
Hey.
Ok.
Pontang.
Hm?
Try and join #Applejack.
Ok.
That works too.
Good.
hmm
Alright, so I joined #Applejack through mibbit. It won't let me connect to #Fluttershy.
So yes, it works as it should.

Hmm, all your mods go to another room, right?
Yeah.
Is it set on +p/s?
Nah, but it's set to restricted anyway.
Alright then.
Diftraku, where is that screenshot from?
It'll be easier to set exceptions then.
06,15Nice work, Diftraku
So as long as they're on the mod channel, they should be able to join all the rooms.
works the same as it does in imgur
Ahh.
?
hello ponies!
Like that?
need to look into optimizing it a bit
So remove the b for an e and the name of the mod channel.
Oh.
Yeah.
=p
If it's already done, then it should be no problem.
Ok.
All done.

Have you tested it out?

Yaay :D
Hmm.
the word yay has lost it's meening to me after that comic yesterday.
I've only used lightIRC once before to my memory.
Hrmm. Well, it's at 9:00 am like the last one, too. Right? EST of course.
But flash tends to be really unstable, especially when sockets are involved IMO.
9am and 930 am est
With 1000+ people I don't think it'd hold up.
Lol, Sumica the one up on EqD?
Also, thanks~
yeah
Kabaka seems to think it will.
Mibbit gets really slow, but it doesn't crash.
*Bites his apple*
Come on Luna!
Worth a try I suppose.
I can talk to him about it.
im over in england so the episode is at 2:00pm
same here Drummar
But its cool, i get a lay in :D
Flash tends to enjoy crashing over seemingly menial tasks though.
Brits :)
What do you guys thinks gonna happen
?
I dunno. Awesome ness?
all i know is that in exactly 2 hours 46 minutes will be my birthday :3
somthing to do with rainbows I am sure

Really love it they put the vid after pagebreak
I won't spoil it but there is something I wanna say.
I'll PM it to a mod and see if it's too spoilery
Somebody PM me a link to this. I wanna see it.
LordCelestia, just go to EqD
just go to Equestria Daily
ah, gotcha :p

BTW GUYS
Discord confirmed for Celestia-tier troll!
/me slaps Dermathil with a trout
*Trollestia-tier
Minecraft 1.9 pre-release is out!
/me punches Diftraku.
Leaked or for real?
Flutteryay: I thought that was a given.
true but this clip...
Nevermind
Celestia vs Discord trolling fight?
Diftraku: comes from the Hub youtube. Do with that what you will.
I mean the Minecraft pre-release...
I've already modded my 1.8....
:3
Diftraku: the 1.9 pre-release is the same thing as the 1.8 pre-release as in bug-fixing time
I know. I wanna try it out but I don't wanna lose my mods again
FlutterBro13: lavaslimes
and some of them aren't even 1.8.1 yet...
also, fireball throwers
...
:3
I will make another backup
Wait... it's alreayd 1.8.1?
isn't 1.9?
Diftraku: yes.
...
But pre-release 1.9 has been leaked by Jeb.
Minecraft really needs a better modding system
Diftraku, they are working on it.
But they got bigger things to take care of first.
Yeah
Like, release the game?
Isn't Minecraft still in Beta?
It is
^^
minecraft needs round surfaces =p
hey, so, uh, what are we watching tomorrow?
Sumica: rofl
Sumica: just look at some of the mountains. Also, I seen spheres in minecraft before.
Batman Begins and Babes in Toyland (not sure which version though)
my dad is blocking all *.minecraft.* websites ><
can't dl 1.9
lol why
http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmf6n0lex21qdc7t3o1_500.jpg
That's not acftually a sphere, Dermathil.
Still flat surfaces
I've been not doing homework too much
babes in toyland
never heard of it
looked it up on imdb
and now I am terrified
There's been four versions of it in movie form.
can't log in to Minecraft either ><
There's an original version, a second one made by Disney, a third that has Keanu Reeves in it, and then the fourth which is animated.
is stream doing anything, or is it really just sitting there
Sumica: closest you'll find, except in item gifs.
Besides it was a toung in cheak comment.
Dat toung
Dat cheak
XD
hey dari
Hey.
is stream active, or just sitting there right now
DAYUM, EqD received a review-copy of the iOS app directly from Hasbro HQ.

"
Damn
Bill Gates is the nicest guy ever.
/me hugs everyone
He really is a nice guy, too
He gives away about 80% of his income
06,15That's kind of old news, isn't it? I thought he pledged that years ago. :O
/me hugs RobotPinkie
06,15 and yeah, he pretty much is.
/me hugs Flaria
I missed you in the epic group hug :C
06,15I missed an epic group hug? :O
/me hugs channel.
Yeah, the date on it is 2008
I just hadn't seen it till now.
06,15Oh okay, cool. Yeah I love Bill Gates, he gets too much hate.
RobotPinkie: I hugged everyone I know on #bronystate
You must've been offline :c
06,15Probably, or I may have been idling...
Guys, i figured out a cool new way to make awesome pictures better than my orevious method
?
06,15but then I'd still be on the list
^
i can make art for any of yall if u want
I scrolled through the list.
06,15Lens flares, LordCelestia?
It was three lines long on Mibbit. :3
If only all CEOs weren't consumer-hating assholes.
no, actually, i just mastered Powerpoint in school and i fugred out that I can use its transparency options and such as an awesome picture editor
*Cough*Sony*Cough*
I'll be back.
*Cough*ActivisionEAUbisoft*Cough*
ACTIVISION
06,15I dunno what's so bad about Sony when compared to Nintendo or something.
EVIL DOER!
>Nintendo
>bad
Wut
*Cough*Treyarch*Cough**Hack**Choke**Pas-out*
Any one with more cash then me is evil cause they have mroe cash then me.
>Sony
>not bad
^This.
^is true
Err.
What Sumica said.
lol
06,15Removing the Player's Choice titles? Keeping the price on the Wii artificially high?
It's not about being rich. It's about being an outright asshole or abusing customer rights.
06,15Kazuo Hirai being arrogant doesn't make all of Sony bad...
whats up
>gives their customers rootkits
They gave their customers rootkits for God's sake.
Not much gets worse than that.
>Strips PS3 of a feature and gives no good reason why. Ignores blog and posts complaining about it.
06,15Sony Music Group of course being the ones who make the games and consoles...
Yeah, an advertised feature.
Some people bought the console for it.
06,15Yeah, removing Other OS was shitty
What they did was illegal. <_<
I didn't update my PS3. Didn't play it for 9 months. Then it was stolen :M
:<
:O
06,15People will have found another company to hate in a couple of years, no doubt.
If the company gives them a reason.
Just people gamers weren't 90% sheeple.
MFW after the first Sony rootkit scandal they dumb bastards actually put a rootkit on another of their products 2 years later
*wish
06,15Meh, Nintendo can do whatever the fuck they want without getting the same kind of hate.
What's this I hear about Windows 8 having special hardware that prevents other OSes from being installed on the machine?
Lawl
>Bill Gates no longer in charge
EspyLacopa: Windows 8 has zero hardware
Isn't that what Apple used to do?
>PCs become OS locked
So, Apple machines will be unlocked for OSes, and PCs are OS locked.
It may rely on hardware that serves a similar purpose, but there is no hardware in an OS
*snerk*
06,15Microsoft under Bill Gates did some really shitty things, too.
So did Apple in the early days
06,15I doubt it was his personal decision in those cases, though
"Neutrino experiment sees them apparently moving faster than light"
>faster than light
>wut
Tachyons!
dari: It's a poorly done layman's version of it
06,15>nowai
I heard about that.
Basically, the central point of the velocity was > c, but its error range was greater than how much faster it was
Therefore, it probably wasn't actually > c
Error range > c?
Let me find the thing again
So it could be going nowhere :p
Here we go, that took forever
I know what you mean.
Large error.
06,15Either it wasn't actually faster than the speed of light, or we'll have to rewrite the fundamentals of physics.
My stance on Sony VS. Nintendo: http://hejibits.com/comics/2011-08-01-apologies.png
06,15My bet is on the former.
Wouldn't be the first time we had to do so, RobotPinkie.
I heard String Theory predicts tachyons.
HALLO THAR
They were determined to be at a velocity of 1.000051 c, with an error range greater than .000051 c
06,15>implying hashed and salted passwords could in any way be useful to a hacker without knowing at least the salt
Basically, nohting to get up in arms about yet.
String theory is so ridiculous.
Wait. You can play virtual console games on the 3DS?
They have GB VC for now, and are adding NES and GBA
Wow, that's pretty solid.
That's pretty sweet.
Suddenly, Nintendo being so hard against emulators makes sense.
^
HOWZABOUT PLAYING WITH DOS Games lol
THTAS a blast to a past
THATS*
Whoa man, that may be too awesome.
06,15So many good DOS games that can't be played on modern computers. :(
DOS BOX
That's what DosBox is for.
hard to use but makes almost all of them work
06,15Um, no
Is it sad that my only memory of playing DOS was playing Wolfenstein 3D? :P
06,15If I had said "all", then sure :P
06,15I do love DOSBox, though
:P
This is why I still have XP :3
Gotta go eat dinner, bye all. Will be back in about an hour.
06,15but it's compatibility is still far from perfect, which is unfortunate
My main memory of DOS games were those old Roberta Williams adventure games. King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest. . .
So much questing.
I think my favorite game for DOS is very Obscure one called Zeppelins:Giants of the SKy? or something like that
06,15Ahhh, I love those games
06,15Though I'm pretty sure the first two series got XP conversions
I don't know. Going back now to play those. . .they're just highly frustrating.
lol
so true
That damn gnome in the first King's Quest, and trying to guess his name.
Or that stupid snake-girdle-horse puzzle in King's Quest 2.
06,15I wait just long enough to forget most of the puzzles :P
Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle. . .
Sam and Max.
LOL
LulzSec member got caught.
Dat Maniac Mansion
06,15The Dig, Full Throttle
^whut
Can has info, Dari?
Zak McKraken and the Alien Mindbenders.
I liked LulzSec, because they were funny, but I still find it funny that one of them got caught.
"To hide his identity when performing the attack, the FBI claims that Kretsinger used VPN service HideMyAss.com. In spite of this, activity was traced to an address in Arizona."
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
DAHAHASHSHDFAHSHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
O________________O
I remember a game called KGB, That was extremely difficult
obviously about the KGB
Given all the high profile stuff that lulzsec has been doing, I kinda figured that them being caught was a given eventually.
/me falls over, laughing madly
06,15That is srsly 1337 of him....
And that's why you make sure your VPN is based somewhere that doesn't give a shit.
Sad that they never hacked Activision.
06,15Haha, oh that I would have liked
Distribute Kotick's mailing address and stuff.
Hacking ActiBlizzard and trolling the sc2 servers writting 'LAN NOW' would be hilarious imo
looool
"Earlier this month, police in the UK arrested two men claimed to be LulzSec member "Kayla". LulzSec spokesman Topiary was arrested in July, and the previous month, Ryan Cleary, who operated a LulzSec IRC server, was arrested. The ringleader of the group, Sabu, has tweeted that there are now only two LulzSec members at large."
Ahahahahahaha
Fail.
Hah
I have a friend named Ryan Cleary, except he's far from good at computers
I miss gaming before I learned what Kotick said at that certain speech.
lol
Nittany_Tiger: What speech?
silly nittany
I'm almost disappoint that no more lulzsec hacks, but to be honest that they got caught is funnier than the hacks they were doing.
I mean
silly Flaria
06,15Wouldn't call it unexpected.
he is obviously much better than you think
he is just hiding himself
He's trollin' a lotta people, then.
Lawl
06,15What did he say, Nittany_Tiger?
06,15Kotick has said a lot of stupid things...
What the Ryan Cleary guy got arrested just for hosting the IRC?
That sucks. XD
http://open.salon.com/blog/mikewatts/2010/02/18/an_analysis_of_bobby_koticks_dice_speech
06,15Pretty sure he wasn't arrested just for that, lol
"Ryan Cleary, who operated a LulzSec IRC server"
It doesn't say he did anything else. O_o
06,15There's not really all that information, I'd assume he worked with them in some capacity.
Where is the exact thing at?
06,15Hard to know from just an article.
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/9.151292-Activision-s-Bobby-Kotick-hates-developers-innovation-cheap-games-you Here. This is where it all started.
BRB
06,15Yeah I remember that...
06,15Made me realize how much of a dick he is
06,15Good thing there's still competition and that not everyone is like that...
The major players are.
Flutteryay: You pinged me?
Either buy Activision's extremely-monotinized CoD, EA's Orwellian games or ones with online passes, or Ubisoft games with online passes or draconian DRM.
And then there's online passes, install limits, draconian DRM, and other crap abound.
Gaming sucks now.
/me sighs
Truth
Or bypass the nonsense and get pirated versions.
man gameing sounds depressing.
Eeyup.
06,15lol, I think games are getting better and better.
*pirate.swf*
good thing we got ponies
The games are, yes.
The ridiculous anti-pirate measures however are getting worse.
And the monotization.
And this "Used games are taking our money!" BS.
^
I miss the days when part of the instruction manual was to make a backup copy of your game discs and use the backups instead of the original discs to play the game.
06,15Only problem is with the Activision and EA, when you don't actually buy a whole game but some of it is activated DLC that you only get once
06,15but most of the games I buy for consoles are the same way they've been since the Master System days...
06,15PC gaming seems to get worse and worse, though...
Console gaming will see DRM. It does sometimes.
