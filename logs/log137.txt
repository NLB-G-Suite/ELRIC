/me refers to that ungodly Excel file
past sins is quite good
Twilight would *deserve* to be hung for that.
but it's quite an emotional ride
overall worth reading, i've barely read any fics aside from that though
yes, my thoughts exactly
I think both are good ships
Actually, I ship like... 4 different ponies with Mac
*le gasp
hello everyone
(not at once)
Well, there is one three-member relationship in that set
Hehe

They're related for crying out loud!
Hello.
wait where was all this omg rage when you all were talking about CaraMac?
Why is everyone surprised at the lenghts this fandom goes to with their fics? AppleMac is hardly surprising
they're normal
Some people make him an Apple, some people make him not an Apple
look at other fandoms, it could be identical twins and some people would ship them
IMO best shipping is Elusive/Rarity, most hilarious shit I've ever seen
Animu Twincest is win
But start throwing innocent equines in the equation and suddenly I'm against it
I was turned off of fanfics for a while after I accidentally read an Ayaka/Sammy shipfic....
apparrently
I don't think I've ever read fanfiction, ever.
He's usually just a hired hand in Caramac fics
wasnt it?

Math at the end of the day is awful :/
I'll take that as a no then.
6We had that today ._.
I pretty much have maths all day every day now.
6>.<
Of course
Maths, further maths, physics (so far just maths), and chemistry (so far very little other than maths).
I have anatomy and physiology
6Meh,that's good..
Hows about I give you a symbolic one on the interweb.
I get to disect a cat and a pig, and maybe a kidney
/me treasures symbolic Luna bar
Oh wow, I have missed alot of Zero Punctuation.
Hm.
That sucks
At my school we got to disect eyes, fish, and hearts.
That was pretty much it I think.
/me doesn't use periods when doing symbolic activities
Worm was stupid :P
6Eyes? DDD:
>stick fingers through heart valves in peace sign
The lens in the eye's pretty weird.
6Prefferably heart than eyes.. x.x

Always.
That was. An interesting picture.
Ooo! Story update!

I wish I knew why I'm in such a crappy mood.
#5 in the draw friend.

But in my case, it's around 600 loaded, and 50-60 listened to..
I can't think of anything else you'd be doing
Tea is legit.
Speaking of which
?
Is "I Can't Decide" Pinkamena's official theme? Because it should be.
It's my Pinkamina's theme, definitely.
Listening to it at the moment.
It does sound like her theme.
I like how you take my linking coffee to that in stride.

Oh? Why not though?
Sho, how do we do it?

Hi Nittany

Hi.
/me hugs back.
Night Dash!
Took my laptop to Best Buy. They said it might cost around $800 to totally repair it.
They said that they couldn't touch the keyboard because of the milk. They said the milk was considered a "biological hazard."
Yeah.
I tried to buy one today, but the one I settled on was out of stock.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK4gm4wixH0&feature=related
I don't get it.
Which means they would replace over half of the laptop.
I found this really nice laptop over at Best Buy, but it was barely too expensive.
Yeah.
I also need to figure out how to get this info off of this laptop.
I need to send off my 1TB external HD for repair. I think they can do it. It may be expensive, though.
/me hugs back.
Yeah.
They said that my laptop may be in a week at best.
But I'm going to be heading home to visit my grandmother by then.
/me hugs Denied_Existence
I'll probably just check out laptops at home.

Something less than $400. I could go higher, but the warranty plan would put me in a situation where I wouldn't have much money left. Lemme find the ones I was considering.

I really hate buying a cheap laptop only to curse how slow it is
http://tinyurl.com/448umad This was the one I was eyeing, but couldn't afford.
I can't afford a $700 - $800 laptop.
I only have $850 in the bank right now.
I liked that second one because it had a Radeon card instead of the Intel POSs.
yeah
i'd go for the second tbh
;~;
it's 80 bucks pricier but it has a bit more kick
Intensive how? Like a marathon of Crysis or something?
i'm bit worried about just 3gb of ram
JUST 3gb?
I'm working with 1.4gb right now

Errr.
I'm not going to run high-req gaming marathons.
I think the most taxing thing I own is probably Borderlands, and I've run it on worse than that one.
I can't play it on my current computer, though.

lol
lol me too kinda
find out if I am missing any eps and get them all in the same folders based on show.
get rid of LQ versions of shwos if I have HQ
and then in folders based on season
dont run in to that too much with anime.
ya
13-26 eps and taht is it.
some may have a second later on but they always change the name.
nanoha and FMP for example.
lol
yeah the overdrive thing was a bit much
i actually have no idea about FMP
he?
Might try and show some eps asuming the powers taht be are cool with it and well I get some time off work.
plated dinners sound hard to eat

i was thinking $25000
lol
now think of having that much money in $1 bills
lol DANG
sure we are charging them an arm and a leg for it all too.
probably around 30 bucks a plate
for plates
if someone took all the earnings and left they would be rich
which gives me an idea.. where is this being held?
i'm going to defend the place and regain my honor!
lol
Vegas of corse
lol alright i guess i should have known
besides I am sure they already payed.

Is anyone online this early?
I guess not. haha
i am
just weighing out my options.. wondering how i'm gonna waste the day away
hey is anyone online?
byea
i just said iwas
D:
well take care i guess
/me yawns
lonesome road was fun but now theres my day
gone
my mind jumped to fur affinity.. lol
i don't even go to fur affinity
soo
what's the ETA on that
well dunno about fics
fyi FA tends to mean fuck all
yeah I'm quite sure I've seen DicordX fics
yeah
x3
I need to hit my FLGS
r34 gideline there is
x3
really I've hardly ever been surpised at a missing r34 content
there tends to be pretty much any r34 you can think of in existance
I don't want to shell out £15 on the pdf when I'm buying the book for £30 odd too
but i'm not and that's sick
it just makes me sad
aye
wait theres an RPG called Leaverage
LAWL
r24 is for EVERY thing
34**
really
just stay away
if it makes one sad
i don't like anime
don't like anime? D:
eh not really
i've seen plenty
i've enjoyed some
like.. bleach/naruto/one piece?
those are some of the most famous ones.. not the best though
and uh
hellsing
those are some that i enjoyed parts of
but overall i'd rather watch something else
Ainme is too varryied to really say it's all crap
imho any how
it would be live saying liveaction is crap
though I guess it has an added language/culture barrier
I wouldn;t know
spent a chunk of early childhood in Japan
cool
i've never been there but i wanna go
still can't read japanese any more
x3
I'm sure I must have been able to once
I can get the jist of it some times
and I knwo the odd word
really no soild help
lol
Berserk be huge
IIRC
but I've not seen much
Rings bells
is deff heavily violent
bell is the mains name
of films aiming to cover the full manga
I can't say it's bad
is on AutoDJ atm
anyway mantis if you don't want to watch anime that's alright but i don't really see why you wouldn't like it as a whole since it has a huge variety.. i don't even watch anime for the fandoms.. i watch anime and hardly ever touch their fandoms
aye
the only Fandom to grab me was Hellsing
Manga and OVA
the orginal anime is ok but really off track form the manga
ironic..
lol
I have just seen DDR controled Tetres
I can die complet now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAZdgTVhzsI
well not really I have some other things to tie up
and I've meant soem I should hate...
you shouldn't hate anyone
lol
I have self lothing still but FiM stole all my other hate
i don't really understand self-loathing
the most importent part is having reasons
well i think i have PLENTY
lol
06,15ohay ponies
Hey
yeah
then all you need is to hate yourself for doing that
i mean if you're using it as an excuse to keep doing whatever you hate doing then i could see the interest in self-loathing
nah
it's ok
the drink makes me go batt shit hyper though
hey
afternoon to you
hehehehe
i just wish people could admit their problems.. and if they still want to do whatever they're doing that's wrong go ahead but don't hide it or try to justify it.. just admit it
06,15Oh goddammit.... now I'll be busy for the next couple of weeks... http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/baldurs-gate-pony-mod.html
x3
06,15That's srsly awesome.
enjoy hearing but I need to head out and "waste" money
yup
lol alright
take care!
nice talking with you
got some RPG books to buy and gush over
see you all alter
06,15I have a ton of RPG books... more than is healthy...
Oh, and I'd still do it at 11PM.
06,15That's when I need caffeine the most, anyway
hehehehehe
hey guys
MeteorVenture, that's not how it works.
well i mean if in the end you actually don't do it
that made completly no sense to me MeteorVenture
MeteorVenture, half the time people does it at the very end.
you put it off until you don't do it.. that sort of thing
Because they want to have the fun they could have after BEFORE doing it.
not like putting it off till you actually do it at the last minute
/me doesn't think I'll go hunting today.
ARARCHY IN THE MIDWEST
anarchy
06,15I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was.
You push it back 'til the last minute.
GOTTA CATCH EM' ALL!
listen.. i've procrastinated before.. i worried about doing it all along.. and at the last moment i realized it was not worth it to actually do it.. i much rather not do it
Due to incomplete works.
oh
06,15POKEMON!
trust me,
i have been detention tonnes of times for no homework/late coursework
¨¨
06,15Ouch, probably a good plan to not procrastinate then
but sixth form is easier as i have only 1 subject to do.
and around 18/30 of my lessons are empty i do the homework then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux8mJUexBcM
MeteorVenture, I don't wanna do it NOW, that's the important thing. I wanna do it LATER.
lol i know
i know how it works.. but you need to eventually actually do it for it to work
Kind-of putting it as priority 2 and always moving something else in the priority 1 slot.
I know
yep...
i'm saying if at the last minute you resolve not to do it.. you could probably tell from the beginning that you would do that.. at least i know i can
Hey guys
k.. well it's most likely cause they don't try
>they don't try
you don't have the whole picture to say that.
MeteorVenture, maybe for you, but not for everybody else.
i'm saying most likely
don't use most likely, because you have no proof that it is actually the case. Use maybe instead.
lol no you don't
Dash,So am I
i was not talking about that.. i was talking about they don't try to learn themselves well enough
you should pay attention
if you do it every time you're going to do it again
MeteorVenture, that's called being torn apart between having FUN and doing the work.
06,15YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!
06,15You're welcome.
MeteorVenture: that's meaning you are having a hard time choosing whether you want to have fun first and do it later and doing the work then.
06,15I think the entire argument is a bit silly, but go on.
We do.
:P
MeteorVenture: then that's not procrastination. Not at all.
06,15Certainty is always more fun when you're wrong. :P
i'm joking around of course..
06,15trolololo
Like I said already, procrastination revolves around the uncertainty.
has the chats layout changed for anyone else or is it just me?...
It's the same for me.
i realize that.. also i was not meaning to say anyone was dumb.. just cause something someone does is dumb doesn't mean they are
Always been like that.
must be this school computer then
:)
i was homeschooled.. glad i was too.. but eventually i realized i didn't like school altogether
jk that was apparent from the start:P
but i still much prefer homeschooling
but in all fairness i would like to of been homeschooled
I wasn't homeschooled till the 7 grade though
i dont really get the difference oif USA's schools 7th grade and Year 7 here in the UK
Idk, I'm in the USA
i think that the age of 7th grade is the minimal age of year 6
/me was in public school in elementary school
its 2pm over here...
It's 9am here
probably around 9 for you
i went to church for my social interactivities
/me mumbles something about churches...
/me only went to church for family weddings and christenings
hated it...
lol, church
/me plays in church band.
christenings? not really familiar with that term tbh
/me lives in a place where the younger generations don't give squat to religion.
(half a century ago they controlled the school and the lives of everybody, basically)
(people eventually decided that it was time to change)
i have mixed opinions of religion...
Where do you live?
alabama
Oh........Sorry.
I live in Georgia though
to me it's not enough to think there's a creator.. i want to know him personally
*brohoof*
Personally, I don't believe in things that have no irrefutable proof of it. I pretty much observe and study. I prefer to believe in things that I can find proof that exists.
06,15Confound these telephones, they drive me to answering them.
no...
I don't want to be a animal!!
brb
i just like some of their ideas mixed in from other religions
i don't really think proof is something you can have.. i think there's plenty of foolish things to believe or not believe though
06,15Well, I hope that when you die, you can choose to live as a pony in Equestria.
06,15I think this is fairly likely, tbh
i think enough evidence is good enough if it lines up right with everything else
mods always win >.>
06,15Haha, no need to close the topic for that, religion is interesting.
and I'm back
Guys, I have to go to tennis
I'll seee you later
/me thinks the afterlife is an actual state of lack of live.
*life
alright take care luna:D
/me isn't about to worry about it in the meantime.
06,15Pretty much. If you're just gone, there's no cause for worrying about it. If not, well hey, cool.
one more thing
Are they streaming anything today
had to mention..
my home laptop's screen is absolutly fucked right now...
that's nice i suppose
when you kill someone/something, be polite...
reminds me of avatar lol
Yeah. They at least deserver that.
*deserve
06,15plz don't eat ponies :(
As for a *pony* pony, I wouldn't touch them.
06,15Well ponies aren't exactly horses, yeah...
again.. just joking around
i think animals should be treated with respect.. no killing for sport.. but they're still animals and perfectly fine to eat
06,15I pretty much agree with that, though I try to avoid eating once living things that aren't fish.
06,15Mostly for health reasons, though...
oh ok
06,15That's just cardboard and compost, perfectly fine to eat :P
06,15Nah I do eat hamburgers on occasion, I just try to not overdo it.
meh, i dont really enjoy hamburgers often...
usually
06,15Chicken is delicious
Whatever I hunt.
KFC is awesome
I very rarely buy food.
Well, besides cola and such things.
06,15Really delicious meat.
06,15What's it called again? Mutton?
i just thought about eating the pound puppies
cause of mutton
06,15Secret mutt fun
06,15...I sincerely apologize...
but srsly the spam when that Ad shows...
we need a pound puppies stream
06,15I dunno about that, I've never seen it.
i have only heard of it because of the advert
but daniel ingram
06,15He makes music for it?
06,15Oh, yeah, IMDB confirms it
i've been following daniel's fb page
since before the huge boost in likes *hipster*
06,15Pffft
06,15and yeah, you should :P
its rare i find some PMV's i actualy like to listen to again
06,15Well, percentage wise it's not a lot that I've saved and listen to...
like two and a half men...
i thought of it and had to say it:P
06,15That happens to me sometimes, too
06,15It was pretty clever
did someone say ash? http://i1216.photobucket.com/albums/dd377/volt28/memes-dat-ash-ay-girl-can-i-get-yo-digletts-Copy.jpg

06,15Ocarina of Time
>mfw this conversation
MeteorVenture: and Dermatill were arguing about procrastination
then it somewhat went into our views on religion
Lol
then about Daniel ingram
also forgot about meat we eat...
:P
and now its about zelda/pokemon
06,15How meta!

Why is Twilight always brown?
lol
06,15lol you too
06,15Twilight is brown?
lol thanks.. i try:P
Never got the reasoning behind that
oh then yeah,
i never understood that either..
06,15Oh yeah... I really dunno
06,15I don't really see them as any specific skin color
twilight was black/brown/whatever
06,15Ahh okay, that would explain it
Yeah, probably
i dont really care for humanized ponies...
YOU BREAK MY HEART
06,15Me neither... I much prefer ponyized humans
I'm drawing some at home
which of course makes me lol to even think about
i think i have it saved somewhere in my HUGE FOLDER... anyway
or that's something else i'm thinking of

It's not; I don't draw porn, though I'm told I'd be very good at it.
It's my special gift, you know.
Nah, that's a rifle.
not to derail.. let's talk about humanized ponies over in THAT corner
/me doesn't know how a rifle would fit on a flank, but whatever.
thats a good comic

Also, the Su-37 doesn't get the credit it deserves.

You forgot a background process somewhere.
Weren't they using handguns because lowly Ganmen couldn't use spiral power?
They could still have proper frame-mounted guns.

lol
There's no way anyone can be that much of a crook
lol
2wow
2Hey GGgala_
Its wierd when i look at my games, like it shouldnt be that high
If i had all that i could id have like 60000
if that tutorial taught me anything it's "don't be afraid to make mistakes"
Riiiight
06,15Haha... I dunno, in some cases I think the mediocre drawing in books like that is a good thing, like "don't worry if it's not perfect"
06,15In this case, it's WAY beyond that.
but THEN
WINTER WRAP UP
and repeat
06,15but the one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie!
06,15owwww, my spleen :(
i was thinking "a pony named ariel" then..... WE NEED A PONIFIED VERSION

I still think he should be a shell fish of some kind

The refception was about the Julius Caesar ref
No Macbeth?
2,14 not for that particular assignment

2,14 Macbeth was the year before

06,15Haha
Fluttershy, the ref was unrelated to you
2,14 YOU HAVEN'T READ MACBETH?

He gives away about 80% of his income
06,15That's kind of old news, isn't it? I thought he pledged that years ago. :O
06,15 and yeah, he pretty much is.
06,15I missed an epic group hug? :O
/me hugs channel.
Yeah, the date on it is 2008
I just hadn't seen it till now.
06,15Probably, or I may have been idling...
?
06,15but then I'd still be on the list

I scrolled through the list.
It was three lines long on Mibbit. :3

06,15Removing the Player's Choice titles? Keeping the price on the Wii artificially high?
It's not about being rich. It's about being an outright asshole or abusing customer rights.
whats up
>gives their customers rootkits
They gave their customers rootkits for God's sake.
>Strips PS3 of a feature and gives no good reason why. Ignores blog and posts complaining about it.
Yeah, an advertised feature.
Some people bought the console for it.
06,15Yeah, removing Other OS was shitty
:<
:O
If the company gives them a reason.
Just people gamers weren't 90% sheeple.
*wish
Lawl
>Bill Gates no longer in charge
>PCs become OS locked
It may rely on hardware that serves a similar purpose, but there is no hardware in an OS
*snerk*
06,15Microsoft under Bill Gates did some really shitty things, too.
06,15I doubt it was his personal decision in those cases, though
"Neutrino experiment sees them apparently moving faster than light"
>faster than light
>wut
Tachyons!
dari: It's a poorly done layman's version of it
06,15>nowai
I heard about that.
Let me find the thing again
06,15Either it wasn't actually faster than the speed of light, or we'll have to rewrite the fundamentals of physics.
06,15My bet is on the former.
I heard String Theory predicts tachyons.
HALLO THAR
Basically, nohting to get up in arms about yet.
Wait. You can play virtual console games on the 3DS?
They have GB VC for now, and are adding NES and GBA
Wow, that's pretty solid.

HOWZABOUT PLAYING WITH DOS Games lol
THATS*
Whoa man, that may be too awesome.
06,15So many good DOS games that can't be played on modern computers. :(
06,15Um, no
Is it sad that my only memory of playing DOS was playing Wolfenstein 3D? :P
06,15If I had said "all", then sure :P
:P
This is why I still have XP :3
06,15Though I'm pretty sure the first two series got XP conversions
I don't know. Going back now to play those. . .they're just highly frustrating.
lol
That damn gnome in the first King's Quest, and trying to guess his name.
Or that stupid snake-girdle-horse puzzle in King's Quest 2.
06,15I wait just long enough to forget most of the puzzles :P

06,15Pretty sure he wasn't arrested just for that, lol
It doesn't say he did anything else. O_o
06,15There's not really all that information, I'd assume he worked with them in some capacity.
Where is the exact thing at?
BRB
06,15Yeah I remember that...
06,15Good thing there's still competition and that not everyone is like that...
Either buy Activision's extremely-monotinized CoD, EA's Orwellian games or ones with online passes, or Ubisoft games with online passes or draconian DRM.
And then there's online passes, install limits, draconian DRM, and other crap abound.
Gaming sucks now.
/me sighs
Truth
Or bypass the nonsense and get pirated versions.
*pirate.swf*
good thing we got ponies
The games are, yes.
The ridiculous anti-pirate measures however are getting worse.
And the monotization.
And this "Used games are taking our money!" BS.
^
06,15PC gaming seems to get worse and worse, though...
