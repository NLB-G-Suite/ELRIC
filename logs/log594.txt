Spider just dropped down from the ceiling right in front of my face
11,02Did you eat it?
I tried to catch it but it disappeared.
One of them finally made it into your home.
perhaps you 2 can liven up this dead chat for us, hmm?
seeing as how everypony is in Dashiesauce ATM
If the same thing happened to Jmo4267 he'd probably be missing his face right now.
:P
dat true
He has a point.
Australian spiders.
CRIKEY.
The bastard still made me jump though
I've seen so many house spiders I'm no longer phased
but Australian . . .
Well, that's one thing I don't think anyone gets used to
I would whistle if i could
Same as when they crawl out of the toielt when you're sitting on it
toilet*
HAHA.
You just can't prepare yourself for shit like that.
I find them in my shower
and I wear glasses
all I see a fuzzy black spot in the corner
That moment when you lose sight of a spider when you're about to go to sleep.
if i see it
mine hang out in the bathroom, although I did get ants in my bedroom for over a month
I swear, I killed over 100 of the damn things
used up half a bottle of bleach
I live with spiders
I live with a 6 year old sister
9
You know, I don't think you'd care that much if a spider landed on your head, but when they drop from the ceiling and you see them right in front of your face I swear it makes you jump more.
I just scanned my ceiling
Pfft, it would make anyone jump. :P
Built in response
prince pls.
my bed is elevated, too
05woke up with one on my shoulde this morning myself
I get a metre of crawl space up there
I woke up with an angry mother in my doorway
I got 2 hours of sleep
Lunar_Brony: Anger level?
Here it comes.
Ah.
enough for a normally calm and focused woman to swear at her own son so he would get his lazy ass out of bed and clean his room, bathroom, and spare bedroom
Damn derp chat.
in other words, extremely
My mom would slap me out of bed :p
And teh Starfarer session ends.

05mhm
i like the exacutive tranvesti side of him better
that doesn't help
MakerDusk is very dusk
is MakerDusk even active?
JRP2234_: Right.
blarg
Yes.
^ there's your answer
Yes he is.
why do you guys always trigger my alerts as I trying to go to bed?!!
MakerDusk: whats a dusk
Cause they're evil.
and are you the maker
I blame JRP2234_
^
lol
>_>
<_<
/me contemplates doing some evil...
chat is very quiet tonight because everypony is in Dashiesauce
bastards . . .
actually right now its about the same level
Any time I hear '999', I can't help but think of 0 118 999 881 999 119 725 3
MakerDusk: whats your idle time
/me pushes Cassy over :p
JRP2234_: probably very low
Maker, isn't it the early hours of the morning for you? :|
noname you must have a name
4:42am
D:
JRP2234: It got stolen.
ohia noname
what was it?
makerdusk can i bring DJMidgetBrony to the party?
I've been known to read the ToC for some programs
Lunar_Brony: I've been here for hours, haha, and i've always been noname.
hmm, should totally organise the opers into a random channel raid
LOL sure OtakuTom
OtakuTom: read PonyChat's ToS
it is best ToS
I dared someone to red a ToC once
^_^
05so how you been MakerDusk, all well?
yay drawing time
we stopped after an hour of reading
still drawn out from a couple of days of migranes
Honest! I've read some...mainly the ones for World of Warcraft or any other sort of game I plan on livestreaming or doing a Let's Play of to make sure I don't get in trouble for it...lol
05ouchie
Uh-huh :P
XAX: well, I'm not seeing speckles floating around that don't exist anymore
so that's always a good sign ^_^
what if I am?
For example, I'm in the beta for Reign of Thunder (a mechwarrior-style game). Unfortunately, it's a closed beta with a very strict NDA, so I'm not able to talk about anything regarding the game.
MakerDusk: ._. I see the very occasional non-existant speckle, but were you getting them really bad?
did I hear a yay?
That's fair enough OtakuTom, know how that feels.
XAX: they all flow in the same direction and I try to follow them
I also black out
not a good combo >_<
Most ToS agreements are just "don't modify this program or make illegal copies of it"
I heard a yay
/me rights self before pushing MakerDusk over
:O
ohai Cassy
Howdy
We're becoming active!
yay?
yes yay!
. . . or did you hear one?
/me rights himself like one of those bobble thing that don't stay down and knocks Cassy back down when he comes back up
:p
/me watches the two knock each other over
/me also tableflips DJMidgetBrony :p

Wrek left on a stand-up comedy for us to watch while he went to do 'errands'. It ended and now you shall stare into the black screen until he is done.
;D
P4ngya: you missed Eddie Izzard being funny :D
^
oh wow, FF3 is gonna be an Ouya launch title
oh, thanks for the info though :)
Ikr Chrysalis
Gonna be awesome
i need to go get myself a box on pre-order
I'm gonna wait until I see some more decent titles to be released on it before I touch a pre-order.
But I have hopes for it.
publishers are starting to see people really want a new console
hopefully itll kick sony/ms to get a next gen out sooner
^
cause nintendo are just dissapointing
lolnintendo
its not even next gen
the tech is all currentgen
They've done nothing but go downhill lately.
lately?
theyve been going downhil a LONG time
Ever since the Wii practically.
theyre attempts at attracting the "hardcore gamer" has been insulting at the elast
Yep
I didn't even know they tried
yup
both on the wii and the wiiu
they said they were trying to attract hardcore to their systems
like when they got CoD on there?
cause you know, hardcore gamers are renouned for using out of date technology and hardware, on games that have been slowed down
with unreliable controls
I thought the wii was pretty cool when it came out
I think most peopel thought that.
people*
Until they actually got one
The only game I ever remember for wii that was good is Super Mario Galaxy
psht
Well, Twilight Princess was pretty good too.
I bought the Wii for Metroid Prime 3/SMG1/2 and Twilight Princess.
Super Smash Bros. Brawl was alright
if Shizuschlafen is schlafen, then how is she reconnecting...?
but meh
can we agree that the most useless techonlogy to reach videogames was popout 3d?
^
3D is a joke overall.
DS has just better games overall
night everypony
I would of liked the DS better if the graphics were decent enough.
night Quick_Thinker
At least imo
now im lonley
the 3ds was an appalling waste of money
^
Dunno why I ended up buying it.
join me in skype people
im bored
Chrysalis: you talk for yourself :D
i may talk of my own opinion
but its an opinion which is mirrored by alot of people i know
3.7gb to upload to youtube
fun
Chrysalis: I just think there's a few salvageable games on 3DS :D
MadSurge and do you ever play with the 3d actually on?
i know of no one that does
who puts motion controls
on a system which necessitates the head being VERY still
Chrysalis: the 3d was a waste of money, no doubt
I rather gouge my eyes out.
i will give it one thing
its 3d was nicely done, it was mostly a depth into the screen
rather than coming out
but the screen had appalling viewing angles
hey
I wish I could stream something...
stfu for a min
'join me in skype
maybe if someone else was talking
theres freee candy
meh
and ponys
Chrysalis: Steam still kicks more asses than consoles currently :D
pc = master race
you guys
y u no like meh
we like you

just not enough to bother loading up skype
'[18:39:30] <JRP2234_> stfu for a min'

as long as i can keep it hooked to outlook on my desktop i dont really care, but its got some nice features
Scary Waffles
dunno why i didnt play it much
Doom series never interested me really.
i grew up on theme hospital and transport tycoon
theme hospital. hehe
I've still got theme park somewhere around
hi guys, im back from ze gym.
i got it of GoG a while back
HAD A GREAT WORKOUT
Good 'ol GoG
ima getting my pc upgraded for my BD. and trust me, it needs it 0.0
well actually i only do cardio on these days. Still, feel good!
cant play about half my games
Glad to hear that Malmortius
yup
hmmm, we should try to get a massive openTTD game going
If i had to count all games i have played throughout my life so far i'd say over 100
That's all?
o_o
Jmo4267: Not sure, I had a blurry memory
I said over 100
It is well over that number.
XAX: Doom 2 was my first "serious" game :D
has to be.
killerpony7733 i have more than that in my steam list
^
oh iPod
Jmo4267: Yeah, Started playing games around the age of 4 or 5 so yeah and yes same Chrysalis i almost have 100 games on so 200 maybe?
You're an iPod XAXpod
There we are.
over x gives no upper limit , over 2 can still be 6 million
Jmo4267: I'm a what?
You're an iPod.
Fair enough killerpony7733
But Jmo4267, I'm just XAX.
First game related thing I touched was the Commodore 64 when I was 3.
i might spend too much time gaming, i played nearly double that
That bulky thing..
No XAX, you're an iPod now.
Jmo4267: okayface.jpeg
;D
While i was on the bicycle in the gym i kept looking at the clock behind me incase i was late, and there was a girl in the same direction. After about the 4th time of checking the time she said "Why do you keep looking at me?". So being the genius i am, i said "Sorry, you look like a friend of mine. Shes also very beautiful."
My mom had a copy and still has it around back home somewhere
OH SNAP. IM SO AWESOME
I remember that game being banned in Australia.
;_;
I've actually got a copy for PS1 in my hands. Knew it seemed familiar.
Imported from Italy or UK.
i can't wait for the reboot
Oh jesus, this sandwich. Tuna and salad MMMMMMM
kickstarter you do good work
^^^^
holy shit these cucumber on it. This is awesome.
Highlight of my day.
Malmortius: Lol.
Cuuuuucumber.
While i was buying my sandwich and drink the woman behind the counter said "if you buy THIS sandwich(pointing to a different kind) you can get a free drink, both for £3.50! and i looked at the other sandwich and drink seperately, they came to £2.80. Wtf
Smart.
welcome to capitalism
I asked her why it was more expensive since its supposed to be a deal. She just walked into the back LOL
aw
So i went and got another sandwich from another shop..
bastards
All in all, an eventful day.
Seems like it.
why is it so dead in ere
here
Been like this for hours.
Dem amerucans are sleeping and the europeans are working
mm
I have no job
yay
Same
Yay summer vacation
Life is good, despite having no future.
Leave out the Australians why not :P
auto-rejoin
05ill be back after lunch
05jsut got home after runnign errands
Wrek|Observiking: K
Wrek|Observiking: Going to play or continue streaming comedy shows?
thanks for the update Wrek|Observiking
welcome back
nomnomnom
Luna's in a mood for pranks it seems :D
Care factor was thrown out the window.
Wonder if they'll fly back up there just to re-plant it.
Jmo4267: I hope not
:P
That pleases me
That would be a REAL waste of money
Like they don't waste enough money as it is.
^^^^^^
Jmo4267: exactly
Makes you wonder what they're up to.
Yeah but out of all the places they could of made the deal.
Just makes me curious.
http://cheezburger.com/6219551744?siteId=136
^
that riot officer
is not amused
Jmo4267: I'm happy that i live in a country that don't and never will have a nuclear arsenal
Yeah..
killerpony7733: what country, again?
Denmark
heh Denmark
Yep a very peaceful country
^That doesn't apply to Italy unfortunately...
MadSurge: Yeah you got the vatican on you and what nt
not*
killerpony7733: which is more a hassle than anything else :(
MadSurge: Yep italy has been more or less controlled by the elected popes throughout many years
Dem popes
Thanks to them, no stem cells research, no legalized brothels (which would help economy) and a lot of hate for homos :(
They are generally keeping italy in the dark age to a point,
John Paul II was much better
Or atleast they keep to old and very outdated morals
^^^^^^^^^^^
Poor Italy.
good morning everypony
Like Lovejoy from the Simpsons said, "according to the Bible we wouldn't even be allowed to go to the bathroom" :D
Morning JappleAck
Hey JappleAck!
MadSurge: I could rant all idea about religion but for the sake of respect towards people who do i avoid it
day*
sorry about earlier, my friend decided to be a troll and put that linlk in the chat
*link
:s
JappleAck: Right you had done it like 2 or 3 times over the course of the past mont
Heya guys
Hey MaxTheBrony
month*
MadSurge: Understandable.
Right side tbh.
killerpony7733: it's not all about religion, it's also about the people who become popes :P
^Yeah the other while more sad in general just don't fit
:D allright
Oh ok thanks :D
MadSurge: Just saying i could rant about how much religion has kept us back. But alas i shant rant about it here
I thought there is only one pope?
at least only one at a time :D
MaxTheBrony: I like the left one better
:) Ah
MaxTheBrony: That is so awesome!!
Thank you :D
I'm now gonna stalk your work.
MaxTheBrony: You would need a better angle to portray the left one better it looks a bit too out of place for me. From the angle you have the right one fits most honestly
why is everyone better at drawing then me
Yeah i think so aswell actually :) it feels so much more fitting in a way
Cause they practice! :$
Every day
for hours
:D
^
shana: yeah, but I mean that while John Paul II travelled the world and was more tolerant in general, Benedict XVI is just... ugh. (also he looks like Palpatine)
:S
Jmo4267: Thanks for the watch :D
I b lurkin'
^^
MaxTheBrony: Like it looks like she is crying due to resentfullness
Yeah i got the idea from My little dashie :)
KNEW IT.
She is sad that she left home :D
Knew it was related to that.
and regrets it
Great job tbh.
Thank you :D
MaxTheBrony: Yeah that's why the right face with years works better in that regard, The other would work in another situation but looks to frowny and sad angry to fit
MadSurge: I know nearly nothing about popes, do they have any 'direct' political power?
killerpony7733: yeah :D
So To make this a good wallpaper what should i Add / remove?
The other Rd is going away but what more
shana: officially not, but politicians will still back off immediately if he or the church says "this isn't right", and those who go against it are not taken seriously
I dunno MadSurge, maybe add a box full of stuff she liked? Like the NASCAR hat and such?
dunno.
MaxTheBrony: Hmm let me see, The more nubby and female muzzle on the left is better fitting for oen
one*
ah so i should keep the Muzzle on the left? or should i correct the right one?
MaxTheBrony: The left one is alot more feminine
Helloooo everypony :$
heya MegaMoonShine :D
But the expression from the right one should be kept
Hey MegaMoonShine
/me waves to MaxTheBrony and Jmo4267
That is quite funny cause i just changed the mouth on the left one :) its is exactly the same muzzle as the right one but its flipped , i wonder why it looks so different :D
Angle
Hmm yeah :)
Should i try keeping the right expression and just flipp it?
Possibly won't hurt trying
Then they'd both look the same?
Can always attempt to change something till you get it right
^
yeah :)
the drawing will never be perfect :)
theres allways something i can change ^^
You draw via program w/ graphics tablet I'm guessing?
That is true Max
yeah :)
Nice :3
Im using same program as wrek :) Sai Paintool with a wacoombambo
Yeah Sai is good.
MaxTheBrony: Interestingly for a 16 year old you got very good artistic skills
:P
:D Thank you
MaxTheBrony: I'm not worthy of using SAI :D
yes you are MadSurge :D
Anyone is worthy of using it.
:)
Just needs practice and skills to handle
:)
I've always been better at monsters than humans :D
^I can only draw stickman for serious
Im useless when it comes to anatomy :P
killerpony7733: its a good start ^^
MaxTheBrony: And it's been like that for years upon years
:D Try doing something other than humans^^
MaxTheBrony: Meh, I don't have the passion for drawing in the end. Hm still may i ask how the process wen't for you to draw RD?
I just sat down and drew circles for a while xD Then a shape came up in my head
it was a head looking downwards
But you say you are bad at anatomy?
Yeah i am :D
You clearly know the shape of the legs body and neck
HE LIES!
xD
BURN THE WIZARD.
haha
I used refrences
:D
:P
MaxTheBrony: Pretty much what most artists do, Though some don't due to extremely good memory
heh i have zero memory xD
05so yeah
Having reference points and what not is good
And Wrek|Observiking returns.
Wrek|Observiking: Wb!

Alpha-Omega-Prime: congrats, did you achieve anything important?
Nope I basically just explored the Island not caring for the main quest whatsoever
... I'm now participating in Remix War V ... now I only need a Song to remix, and Idea, and Talent -.-
Alpha-Omega-Prime: that's the way :D
nomnomnom
The game upis buggy enough that it kills some aspects of fun
"Nope, not gonna save myself, just gonna go around and kick the fuck outta zombies!"
MaxTheBrony: Oh nothing major. Just the design phase for a text based adventure on kerbals overthrowing the reign of Phase's space craft massacre. :$
O.o
haha
AdamTheDuck: :D
That sounds pretty amazing :)
AdamTheDuck: they should go after Sumica too
still need more ideas though
MadSurge I wuld pretty much doo the same if a zombie apaocalypse happened
Only problem is my programming teacher won't know what Kerbal Space Program is :/
Alpha-Omega-Prime: well there's noone to tell you what to do, sooo
Teach the teacher.
I shall.
Best part of Fallout 3 was wandering the wasteland and explore randomly

Bai Alpha-Omega-Prime
Peace ponies

Buddha's baby brother benny....say that five times fast
^^
Can't even say it once.
Alright I'm going to need some help
Say I like to math debate 5 times fast! :L
O.o
:|
LOL.
< u <
Alpha-Omega-Prime: What do you need help with :D
Compiling a list of music for a party
God's cousin is named Ted? :D
End up laughing before I can say it.
O.o
Yeah exactly
He gets so much stuff wrong.
and another crash -.- how can this Programm be so unstable :/
what program?
LMMS, it's what i use for music
to make music *
Heh linux.
for windows too
You aren't cool. ;-;
I want to switch to Linux when Steam for Linux comes out
I already tried many versions via virtual machine XD
It feels so akward getting party music
why XD
I dislike half the music people listen to to party
You're not alone Alpha-Omega-Prime ...
yreah -.-
If I cannot speak out against this, then I REALLY have no place here.
I am there with you Alpha
05speak out agaisnt what?
Against this ridicule of my faith.
oh hey, Eddie Izzard still here
Thank you :)
?
The only Solace I take in making this list is that Ponystep will be added to it
BTW: Only my font has changed?
brb need to restart
05i cant see the redicule really
05there's alot worse bashing done by comedians out there
05this is rather light on it really
and back
....I have to add slow dance music...any suggestions?
That's not very reassuring, but I guess this guy isn't quite as bad as George Carlin.
05well really he played a joke on what happened with god n dinosaurs before
05its not like utter bashing down
Alpha-Omega-Prime: Is Party With Pinkie on the list?
Yes
Of coourse
About that 65 million year gap, the way I figure it, God works on sort of a time dilation.
That's not really a slow dance song though
yeah it's not slow, I was just wondering if it's on :P
Hey if It was up to me I would add nothing but rave music. Ninyll Scratch would be proud
Vinyll
Alpha you should put Tombstone's "Like a spinning record"
I love that track^
05though i can see why you'd be insulted in a way
05well insulted might be a too strong word
05but anyways
05but each to their own
Alpha-Omega-Prime use lots of Polka
polka
?
Lol not pony polka xD
morning everypony
Mornin'
Mornin' Ingwaz

maybe not...
^ :D
oh...now that the sounds on
thats not a woman
fuuuu
i wasnt sure but i didnt want to be too rude about it...
fuuuu?
Ingwaz: ever watched Zoolander?
Quantum music makeing... sometimes the song loads, sometimes it doesn't, everything can crash at any given time
been awhile, but yes MadSurge
No way I'm adding polka. Although it would be funny to be trolled by the DJ
Ingwaz: this guy played the villain
i need to get going everypony, catch you later
bye Ingwaz
MadSurge: i thought that was will ferrel?
Bye Ingwaz
See ya
Pk bye then :D
Alpha-Omega-Prime: Did you just watch Polka is Magic? :$
No

You killed it good
Hmm seems to be a habit
wut.
What else is the internet filled with? Advertisments, trolls, memes...
ponies?
Hmm...
That bar moving in the background is distracting me...
The internet is also filled with miinecraft
I was thinking the kerbal found the internet and so I have to describe the scene with the best graphics card available to a text based adventure: my imagination :D
AdamTheDuck, lol

Bye, gonna pop up some tekkit

I hate when steam just decides to hide
XD
i have it open right now
It's like "Not showing up today, nope"
i had to update it
Try to open it again "Another instance of steam is running"
.-.
Phase4, you can always kill it to be sure.
08,01MadSurge: WHAT?

00,02that moment when steam uninstalled itself from wine

00,02sonicandmario85, screenshot?

Tribes
Tribes Ascend or something like that
free
Phase4:i dont have a screenshot of it
00,02sonicandmario85, can you get one is what i meen :P
sure besides that always pops up there XD
also how do i take one?
Press Print Screen on your keyboard
00,02sonicandmario85, print screen button
It goes into your pastebin
fag
i dont have a printer
>_>
then just paste it like MSPaint or photoshop or something
no no
wait, what's this game called?
It doesn't print your screen, it just takes your entire screen and copys it
use 10 PRINT 20 GOTO 10
When you paste something it will be your screen
it used to print the screen a long time ago ^_^
if my HD camera still worked i chould probaly take a pic of it and upload it on a site
PONY Tribes: Ascend
and then send the link here
:|
well, gonna listen too "The Internet is for music" now, 30min well spent :3
:D
imtypingwithnospaceslol

sonicandmario85: press 'print screen', open ms paint, press 'ctrl-v', save the picture as a png and upload the file
0,5ohey

One letter name..Mustn't that be annoying?
I couldnt think of anything :(
0,5As long as it doesnt get on peoples' nerves it
0,5it's fine :)
I suppose he can tell when the chat is updating
Hello BaconMane! :)
0,5Hai :3
Heya BaconMane :d

Calvin, Tribes: Ascend
thank you
this looks like halo
looks fun
Looks too face paced for me
^^
It looks like a paid game,
ohai BaconMane
Its free :D
I'm surprised by how it looks
but my computer wont run it :(
Don't think I'd be able to land a single shot
It has quite a steep learning curve though
But it is oh so amazing
/me is now on memebase, gonna be busy for the next half an hour XD
IT LOOKS TOO GOOD FOR A FREE TO PLAY GAME
:P
It is, isn't it?
Is it a freemium game?
yeah
wheres the print button?
So what CAN you spend money on?
where it says PRT SCR
Its almost P2W
It's near F12
on the top right cornor
Lil_B! :D
but i think they fixed it
Skins and weapons
Classes
Lil_B look: http://www.iaza.com/work/120803C/iaza11052372636000.gif lol
you can buy a starter pack on steam
Can you get the weapons by simply playing the game anyways?
Emmie: You made that ? ^^
MaxTheBrony: I spent the last 2 hours trying to get it to work
Emmie awesome Oo , what do you use to draw these?
xxbignolanxx: Yep takes time but you can yes

O.o
Emmie I already got it via a Torrent XD
Emmie I mean how to find the Tool in SAI
Lil_B lolwow

Just use bitmap, Lil_b and use the smallest one
Im back

Uhh...
wb a
*Binary not bitmap
What a name, a :$
Can't you just run a filter on each layer/frame when you're done, Emmie?
Ah yeah
A pixelate filter
hehe
Bignolan what?
Oh, I don't think Sai has that
There is a binary filter but then theres no colors
hey guys, look what i just found http://m.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/media.media.52120f45-b715-443b-9a35-1d763ebe2c44.normalized.jpeg
Alright
Nice, Dark_Horst

ok, thanks
Anyone in the mood for xbox BF3?
nah
i just learn something new
xxbignolanxx: you dont play battlefield 3 on a console
that'S just something you dont do
cant wait for the new dlc
Dark_Horst PC master race hue
the print button wont work
krazy: Yeah the new DLC made me buy premium
same :D
xxbignolanxx: considering the pc version has better graphics, bigger maps and higher player-limits, yes, pretty much
I don't enjoy the hastle of pimping out a computer
besides
I have it on xbox, only because my computer wont run itt
I have a bunch of IRL friends that play console because it is mroe casual
more*
Dark_Horst I like that the Pirate Partie you can request "Pony Time" to stop the whole meeting for 22min for one ep of MLP XD
Hai
What level are you, krazy?
Lil_B: the world need more parties like them
around about.
hai Thrackerzod
20 ish, I dont really remember
I havent played in a while
getting a good pc is no hassle. order, done. i put mine together on alternate. took me 10 minutes
I think I'm a lvl 12 bird.
Yes, but I'm niggardly.
dark hort: but I cant aford any good pc's
Dark_Horst I don't like thatb the Pirate Partie has practikly no idea how to run the country other than more freedom and more technology, but concidering our current governent I would rather prefer people whomdon't know what to do over people who intentionally do everything wrong
man, when I have a opinion I write a llot >.<
Yeah, I'm gonna play some BF3
I'll still be here though
okie dokie

Soldier and Pinkie pie evolved into Fluttershy and Heavy.

Calvin: It's art?
Why would you put a heavy without a hat?!
ALPHA TF2!
Alpha had ponies?
*givemeitnow*

Applebloom: I want it nooooow.

I could never do art, it takes to long...
Heavy: Scout is tiny little baby, he has no ponies.
then what could you do krazy?
alot of thing take alot of time
He could be a slowpoke.

Isn't Scout afraid of Rainbows?

MaxTheBrony: Could attempt to make it dark like it is now around her but she stays in a focus instead of just her eyes
Ah make her whole body brighter?
the floor shading
Wrek is streaming, correct?
Ah yeah :P the floor is unfinished
Cupcakes.

...Why are we talking about Minecraft in Bronystate...?
because

Back to work! Just give me a ping if ya need me.
00,10because bronys still like other things too
hepike, Because bronies like Minecraft

SeaponiesofLiverpool: No, it's a character in an RP or fanfic that has the cliche "not so good past and always gets the love interest no matter what". It's sorta like the god-modding of fanfiction and RP
she looks like vynil IMO
Pony Sue is ponified "Peggy Sue"

I think that one looks best
cratorkid: would it look beter if i lowerd the tail?
The old one is better ? :D?
What program is this.
SAI
Paint tool Sai
MaxTheBrony: i dont this so , its just her tail isnt at the same angle as the rest of her body
JacknAppleLover: Nope, No one knows much beyond official information
ah shame T_T
it looks so good.
i know they want it to be amazing, but tbh i dont care if its balanced it just looks so fun
JacknAppleLover: Also smart trick to respond to people is to type a bit of their name and press tab, That auto completes it and pings them
thanks for heads up
killerpony7733: ah ha
JacknAppleLover: There you go :)
MaxTheBrony: i didnt see the other pic , can i see it?
Test
The old ?
He's still drawing Vinyl?
yer
thats really good!
:)
c:
Wrek, that cider is too dark :yunoface:
MaxTheBrony: the one that has clouds is definately better
BronyDarth: I think its JD ;D
Jd?
it is :D?
That reminds me i got two cans of strawberry cider in my fridge but i haven't gotten to drinking them yet
It' meant to be whiskey or something to me BronyDarth
Maybe it's cider with extra cinnamon?
Cider doesnt have icecubes!
Maybe scotch
MaxTheBrony: i fav'd your picture btw ;D
Just saw that Thank you so Much JacknAppleLover :D
killerpony7733: if you stay up late enough ( or early if ur in the eu) we have drinking games , or atleast recently
It's supposed to be chocolate milk! :D
x
your names megamoonshine, you should know!
cratorkid: I'm in the EU in denmark to be specific
well i'll have to join tomorrow, only have tuborg atm
:D
With....cubes inside :s
CHOCOLATE MILK WITH ICE CUBES?!
Mabye they aren't ice cubes
It could be from my secret stash
BronyDarth make it happen
IT IS RARITY!
JacknAppleLover: Wait tuborg where are you from?
They might be wierd plastic cubes that bear no significance to this whole picture
:3
Its chocolate milk with rarity in it.
Very_Silly_Filly: they're not ice cubes they're marshmellows O_O
Or it could just be cola with coke in it
psst
guess what
it's scotch
Couldn't it be just a kind of Coke or Rutebeer?
killerpony7733: recently its been hapenning at 3- 5 am at the east coast of us , i think htas like 9 for you , im not sure
Looks too light to be cola
or maybe its muddy water :\
You can get really light cola
Horses drinks muddy water, so I cant deny.
AND THEN GET SOME MENTOS :3
cratorkid: Hmmm what time is it at yours atm?
AND KABOOOOOOOOOOOM
12:o4
1204
its 17:04 here
cratorkid: Am?
I drink coke with mentos in my mouth without it exploding.
Mentos only work with coca cola
No , its 18 04 ...
pm , im using 24 hor time when im talking in stream, easyer for eu
Diet coke you mean
Nope.
Cola.
Not sure actually
Do you know what is better than Coke & Mentos
Pretty sure it's coca cola
pony59780: its 17 for me
Cola.
under rock salt
Maybe it's iced coffee
1) Eat two bananas
Literally
Very_Silly_Filly: Diet coke,
2) Down a bottle of Sprite
How about Whiskey Cola?
Sprite is godly
killerpony7733: am , but i like to use 24 hour in stream , (easy for eu)
Sprites are godly, they are making the games :D
cratorkid: So since it
it's around 6:05 PM now it means early morning for me then
You live in boston?
:/
need me some strongbow and jd thne i shall be ready
BronyDarth: If you are asking me, I live in Denmark which is in the EU
BronyDarth: SC , just moverd down here , used to like in nj
I live in norway.
that ear
18:06 for me.
Seems like the cheapo pizza brand have changed
Mabye they changed the mexican slaves to polish slaves :s
Yay we got more scandinavian brothers joining every week :P
dafuq! :D

alexxm: You should know this considering your British. How many poles do you think there are in Britain?
killerpony7733, Scandinavian hoof /)

Born in Britain, live in Britain. uma
Very.
Britain aint a country
Born in Australia, live in Australia. SUP.
BronyDarth: We aren't as weird as we are very different from others
UK is now a country. good bye scotlane, wales and england.
I don't see anything weird about sheep boiled in cabbage.
*scotland
Britain is the name of the island, no?

Olol, Wrek is listening in on this
I fucking hate historians.
Might not like you shittalking the swedes :3
i was jk D:
owloysius: or drink ale from skulls
cratorkid: the eyes make it a pain to drink ale.
Norwegians: first vikings
it keeps spilling out.
owloysius: Just duct tape it
i always say norway>sweden because there are always more swedes in a chatroom than norgies. so its jus a little teehee
JacknAppleLover: And even less danes
killerpony7733: ikr
owloysius: lol you say this like you tried! :) but i can see that
I have no idea how many Britons we have here
I say Japan>All other countries because nobody is japanese.
I know there's like 4 of us a least

BronyDarth: wreks back on

Yeah, but it's against the rules to speak anything other than English in this chatroom because countryism
"Japanese is good, right?"
*sigh* where is 3PO when you need him...
00,03Well, we are a phoenitic website, so no moon characters please~
owloysius: yes

And my dad kinda hangs with a brony hating community
Very_Silly_Filly: i know the feeling bro
00,10made alot of progress from the last time I saw wrek
BaconMane, I believe that sometime between you disappearing as LordCelestia and returning as BaconMane, I switched from using LightIRC to using XChat, and it was a while before I got around to calibrating XChat's colors to something proper. So you came back at a time when I saw all the colors badly.
Wacombambo fun cratorkid
:d
Because my Dad's a goon, bronies are seriously hated
Very_Silly_Filly: </3
And that's why I'm closet
Very_Silly_Filly: love and tolerate is all I can say

Sumi

SpadeMagnes[R] are they good
LOUDER
Turn up the mic sumi
SpadeMagnes[R]: I mainly watch Josh jepson if I want lets plays
He can't
His mic is as loud as it gets
Which I usually don't, because most letsplayers have NFC what they're doing and take ages
:(
This again...
So how will we be going about murdering kerbals today?
so i´ll hear my music :P
am i in the right place here :S
Sumi maybe you sould consider Aerodynamics this time.
I like Video Games Awesome... I don't get why they don't et more fews (and I watch Game Grumps when they started XD)
Fuck aerodynamics
i like trains
Oh, it's a shuttl
Aerodynamics is overrated, just make it a huge cube
Finally something that can fly
Jim: Make it a huge cup
Needs more boost
So you get the parachute effect
Fly through space in a giant cup, excellent
Give it more boost than Sonic Unleashed
Advanced SAS?
You need more boost tho
A single engine wont last it.
use ALL the engines
Guys, do you know what I want?
Don't think he's aiming for the moon
oh come one... make some music :X
He's aiming for kerbals to kill
so what is the aim of this game?
A new computer :3. El shitbox is well. Shit
Don't forget to add wheels
JacknAppleLover, To reach the moon
To slaughter kerbals
^
kill all the kerbals
Getting to the moon is a bonus
surely just kick Celestia in the flank and getting there would be easy
Getting to Mars is Aisian level
ok... y did this work oO
NEEDS MORE SPEED
interesting
You will need more thrusters.
ALL the thrusters
inb4 the RCS goes out of wack
THRUST
and a fancy painting
ALL THE THRUSTING INNUENDOES!
i have no idea why i am here.
That wont get you off the ground let alone the moon.
so much thrust
Oh my
MadMan: me too man,
Aw... they even added adorable Kerbal Scientests!
MadMan, For the luls?
ot needs to be about 20% cooler :P
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
This isnt even my final form
Yeah, they've been around a while
SpadeMagnes[R], lol
it needs about 20% more explosions
An enitre 2 versions
i think it was Sim'd youtube actually
This game requires more patience and eye for detail than I'd be willing to give.
MadMan: omg same here xd
its growing :D
JacknAppleLover: :D
Pingas rocket?
I'm back guys! :$
Sumica: Looks like you are making a arrow shaped rocket
It looks like... a BRATVURST
JacknAppleLover: Ditto! I dont even know what this is
StinkomanFan: a what?
ooh! im missing something!
Unless you plan on detaching those things during take off, this is a horrid design.
MadMan: yeah my first time on this XD
ooh, that's right, saw that. SimGretina said something on his youtube about going here
where does this "yay" come from oO
aye
That's might be why we have so many new guys today
MaxTheBrony: Nope, just fine
Looks like a spear or an arrow.
Ah.. clippy
SpadeMagnes[R] A german hotdog
How I hate him
Seems fine to me Max
looks like a WEINER O_o
what is this game called???
no homo
Jim: Can you give me a link in PM about that?
MadMan: so far it looks like they making a giant rocketcock to reach the moon and kill some kerbal things along the way
The Aerodynaimcs....
teastri: Kerbal Space Program
Is it time for Sumica to kill more Kerbals? :D
Gone.
JacknAppleLover: Ditto! I dont even know what this is
MadMan: http://i.imgur.com/Lt9oZ.png
cool 8-)
SILLY, THERE'S NO AER IN SPACE!
Getting to the moon is a bonus the real fun is seeing how badly your crafts can fail
i love the music......
theres no air in space.. so no one can hear you yay...
So, we sending more food to Luna?
interesing airplane or hmmm xD
SpadeMagnes[R]: Getting to Mars = Aisian standard
:d
So, what exactly is this?
im off... see ya :3
agreed, what is this madness?
Bye teastri
"aisian" Asian lvl spelling
And by food I mean Kerbals
Look at all the new ponies we have. :D
Rocket building simulator :D
MINIONS
Oh cool
cool!
I can't spell perfectly.
MaxTheBrony: Whats it called?
its okey
Why does it remind me of the sector z missiles?
Serenity: do u also believe in dog?
This thing looks like it's gonna crash
It is kalled Somthing with space programm xD
Or maybe that's just wishful thinking
xD
JacknAppleLover: Dude, that was low.
i have forgoten
You think he's Compansating for something?
JacknAppleLover: Wait, what?
Minus the wings it looks almost like the copperhead missiles from Sector Z
RobertRevenge: lol man dont worry
Kay, now it's looking pretty decent
Serenity, I also have sexdaily
I mean dyslexia
O.o
fcuk
sexdaily?

omg what is this , this is so interesing o.o
Jim: ho dog
Duct tape makes the world go round!
He did that on purpose :3
Make a Q-wing
How in the world does ductape hold together a space craft?
Wtf is a Q-wing?
RobertRevenge: Duck tape is like the force. It has a light adn dark side, and holds everything together
Jim, A VERY SEXY LEARNING DISORDER
SpadeMagnes[R]: Very carefully.
WHAT DO I CALL IT KIF?
Whats up everypony? Miss me? ...remember me?

Hello Jim :)
For some reason, I have this wierd mentality that I can strip in 2 seconds when writing a random sentence
Just how big is this rocket gonna get?
is whatever this game/simulator/whatever this is free?
RabiesBun uploaded no BGM whatcha say = yay
MadMan, Freeware
hi Rainbow--Dash of course we remember you... you are from the kids Cartoon right?

SpadeMagnes[R]: so much Thrusting!
Jim: He is actually
I... like you to?
Brings back crap everyday
Sumica: doesnt it need wheels?
THRUSTING SO HARD.
Who needs landing gears.
USE ALL THE THRUST
Real men crash
We know this thing isnt gonna land.
i dont know how realistic this is, but he needs to wings going in the other axis of he wants to exceed anywhere near 100,000
Landing gear is for wusses
Needs more spinning wheels of doom
Needs moar toast
Sumica: 1 MILION YEARS DUNGEON!
is this the full version?
Yes
ALL THE FUEL
MadMan, The full version is not out yet
oooooohhhhhhh
Jim: It's not finished, but it's avalible
ok guys really, how long is this gonna take?
as long as it takes
JacknAppleLover: Be patient
This is begining to look like a starfox boss to me
Serenity: but its soooooo longggggg
It'll be worth it in the end.
DIRTY WORD :O
That's what she said
Buck is not a dirty word
I can wait long as I know this will end spectacularly
i buck all the time. its not dirty
A spectacular crash

Serenity: How long?

killerpony7733: A year and 2 weeks
So is this gonna get into space?
Serenity: if this explodes at launch, i will be dissappointed.
Serenity: Ah

They'll probably weigh down the back end
StinkomanFan: oh yesh, he definitly it c:

I shudder to imagine the Kerbal Education Program
^
He's only been lurking for the past 6 months
Dont bother sumi
We dont need landing gears
Sumica: dude if this doesnt fly im gonna demand a redo and u have to yeah myanus.
Real men crash land
star trek + triforce = this thing.
StinkomanFan, "Today kids, we learn how do die in a fiery spaceship explotion"
Yes, we'll be landing...
IN HELL!
We all know this isnt gonna land.
MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! :[
Its a one way ticket to hell and back!
it'll land kinda like at the beginning of SW: Ep. III
^
MadMan, We watched that last night actually
4000 munny that this crashes
We did?!
Awwwwww man!

250 Credits say this gets off the landing pad
Yes! Yes!
This isnt gonna end well.

Meanwhile: yep
Now if i said anything about athiesm i'd get a shitstorm
Didnt one time religious nuts called Harry Potter satanic or something?
Celestia*
derpy_pony:bronys are not sexual atleast im not
SpadeMagnes[R]: yeah
Are they retarded?
Brony is all kinds of things to all kinds of people
SpadeMagnes[R]: A lot of people said that
Sumica: I'm guessing it's impossible to get to the moon in this game?
Religious people have problems with everything
nowadays everyone knows that they aren't real
and again he dedz
Discord:ITS POSSIBLE TO GET TO IT PHASE4 DID
SpadeMagnes[R]: and everyone. it's a very small minority of otherwise sensible people
Sumica: Or horribly horribly right, depending on how you look at it
sonicandmario85: most asexual people on the planet :P
apparently not everyone
But where is the fun in getting to the moon Sumica ?
But Sumica luna needs an an ARCHER HERO TO save her
hahhah
so you could rescue luna
Serenity now thats a steriotype because im religious, but i guess im an evil person and i hate everything
most religious people are nice
just like most people are nice
No religious talk in chat.
Thrackerzod: You aren't helping your cause :)
Thrackerzod: So how is life as a perfectly normal pony
I agree, we should stop tjhis before it leads to war
can I ask what the hell is going on in general around here?
I kinda can't do with my gunshed being blown up
We're watching spaceships crash
SpadeMagnes[R] im great
360!?
:o
because atheist are so beloved in… *brick walls*
:D
xd
DO A BARREL ROLL
spaceships? crashing? awesome!
D:<
Tovler: I've always been a cavity wall fan
Sonic has a really broken fanbase
Dont say Barrels pls :'(
IM NOT SONIC ]
IM MY ORIGNAL CHARECTOR
I really want more blindbag ponies
I mean seriously people bitched about Sky Sanctuary in Generations not being yellow enough
but the toys r us stores around here dont have anything
And I'm not tails, I'm my original character, Blails!
http://www.ebay.com/sch/quills_and_sofas/m.html I have a few Wave 5 here. Luna, Celestia, Trixie, etc.
Serenity: Oh no! I'm inflating again!
best game eva :o
PEOPLE really need to get there facts right
How embarrasing
Trixie!?
the sonic fanbase is about the same wavelength as the pony one
derpy_pony: That's a bot response coded to give us the EqD title. Blame them if it's wrong.
God I need that
oh...
AND IM NOT TAILS EITHER IM MY FAN CHARACTER JAKE THE FOX i do not know why i named him that XD
derpy_pony: And no non image links during the stream.
How EMMBERISING
Is it wrong for me to hate part of the MLP fandom because some people make us look like a cult?
hm...
eh foxes :P
Serenity: I like adobe walls myself
I have to be honest, there's about as many fucktard ponyfags as there are fucktard sonicfags
i hate a vast majority of the mlp fanbase
...yeah that is true
all fandoms have people you won't like
kinda
it's fine to hate. just don't hate where I can hear it
I wish I could watch someone on here land on the moon.
GO PARTS
:O
It's ok to not like things, it's ok, but don't be a dick about it.
I look at youtube sometimes, and I remember why I once hated this community
00,03The sonic fandom died when Sonichu appeared...
What the fuck is Kerbalia's water made of?!
no
it merely tranceded
suddenly Scoot-Scootaloo
oh my...someone linked my ebay stuff on eqd ^^
There's many parts of the fandom that don't speak to me, but I don't hate any of it, I think.
Sumica: can you crash onto the sun?
explains everything
AWWW Shit the Chats full of warriors today, well im off to lunch before the shitstorm gets good
mozilla dont come :(
Like Luna: Hey celestia do you have the time IM not CELESTIA im my orignal character Alicorn
xD
Sonic 4 episode two has THE MOST DISAPOINTING ENDING EVER
Discord:go to phase4s youtube channel his youtube name is ariscop he made it to the moon search for the video
quick! run! the shitstormtroopers are coming!
You CAN make it to the moon?
I find Derpy to be Abelist
:D
mor e kerbals?
sonicandmario I WANT SOMEONE ON HERE TO DO GO ON THE MOON!
xD
Tovler: Hush.
Vivx:yes
awesome
im going to the moon with my friends :D
Meanwhile: What? I thought we were having a shitstorm.
didn't phase4 make it to the moon a week or a few days ago?
I've managed to land on mars before
And explode
I had a parachute failure just as I was landing
Serenity what was mars like
Tovler: You're better than that. Don't incite chat.
So we going tot he moon?
SpadeMagnes[R]: me
inciting chat is my job
alexxm: My team died from the landing becuase I blew up
Buytoast:yes he even uploaded the stream on youtube
Meanwhile: entice*
he dosent want to go to the moon
:<
Do any of you think a hd or 3d remake of it would be a good idea?
Sumica can you go inside one of the gas planets?
SpadeMagnes[R] I played Seasons
i heard about it
oh, hello alexxm. how are you?
AttacktheAndalite: Not even the word I was using.
don't remake 2d games as 3d
i'm good sharklion how about you
Meanwhile: Whuups....*braces for cinderblock*
unless you're willing to change the gameplay
I am also good alexxm
the tone sounds the same to this beat but it is still good
entice is to tempt in a good way
Sumica someone said there was mars o.o?
What about updating the sprite work?
AttacktheAndalite: Incite: To provoke or encourage.
xd
lawl Firefox
yes
Entice is a positive word
Meanwhile: Yeah, but it's not a serious opinion outside of Tumblr, so… idunno
Meanwhile: I've heard entice but not incite.
he made my computer...AMAZING
Intice is a negative word, as far as I know
AttacktheAndalite: entice: to attract by arousing hope or desire.
Discord: well theres minmus, which is like mars
look it up on oxford dictionary, beats the crap out of wiktionary
/me slam dunks AttacktheAndalite with a cinderblock.
to intice someone into doing something..... I'm not sure if it's either
Onyx in seasons is a dick.. he uses Din as a human sheild in part of his boss fight
don't spil shit
spoil
MORE KERBALS? LOL
Dude the game is old
i aint played it
/me 's head is pounding.
woah
(Hmm, this is a good Foongus. I think I'll train it.)
more kerbals in the ship
incite: encourage or stir up (violent or unlawful behaviour):
in terms Of Zelda: MM=The Best , LA=My Fav
ALL THE FUEL
I have never played Zelda.
thts alot of fuel!
What the hay are you making?
^^^
thats*
Going to the moon?
00,03This isn't bon-bon, it's my OC, Fon-Fon! http://ask-pegasus-lola.tumblr.com/post/23988706956

So how many of you have actually played Skyward Sword?
This!
<3 this song
Three little ex had sex?

Well I just beat the 7th world in Kh3d and I just got it yester day I think
Discord, Eggs
I have NO LIFE
/me raves
Scoot-Scootaloo: Not sure if trolling or stupid.
:o
I'm listening to sonic youth- I can't hear stream
I just realized that the stream DOES stutter on my old computer.
I have an important Anouncement to make!
Oh I like this song
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo didnt see you get on
lol
Somebody set up us the Bomb!
What is it, Lil_B
homai
this looks like it might work
I think that LoZ: MM or Ocarina was the best. My favourite is probably Twilight Princess thinking about it... I very much enjoyed that game!
Lil_B: Make your time
sumica you do realise your taking off
Sumica: USE THE BIGGEST PROPULSIONS!
not burning a 30 foot hole in the ground
00,03Given my track record streaming, I'd say it's trollin'~
Lil_B: how based are you at the moment?
Where did the idea for mario come from anyway?
20 bits it explodes at the runway
Am I the only one who played Skyward Sword?
Buytoast: I enjoyed it
I played it
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh yeah, right. You're like dari but not as funny.
It was good
bit repetative
and more rockets
jesus
3 little ex had sex?
I'm not sure I've seen a scoot stream
dafuq?
00,03Meanwhile: Y U so cold :(
sharklion all my base are gone
Add all the Fuel!
HOW THE FUCK ARE THEY GONNA GET IT OUT OF THE HANGER?
It had its moments.
Scoot-Scootaloo servers 1.3.1 now
I don't usually see Scoot-Scootaloo, but when I do, it's G3
Scoot-Scootaloo: Because my heart's made of frost.
StinkomanFan, Sumi will find a way.
00,03I get it, it's because he's British :|
THE MINECRAFT 1.3.1 UPDATES EPIC
Meanwhile: I thought it was made of Cinderblocks?
That too.
Lil_B: I'm pretty based at the moment I think... maybe all your base are belong to us.... XD
But Im British...
Ahh, okay
6 little eggs summered up, they fuck each other three goes boom do-be-doom :D
/me sits on a cinderblock
sonicandmario85 ikr
1.4 is gonna have baby zombies :3
1.3.1 looks great, but I'm playing technic so I can't update ;__;
Mmm
I watched my friend stream it yesterday
Zombie sex.
wait, so is 1.3.1 out?
why
people still play technic
The idea of zombies reproducing disgusts me
Other than all the hilarity that went on, it was crap
Vivx:go to options and force update easy
I'd pay for that
Honey, did you pull out? "I think so."
HOW IS IT EVEN FITTING IN THE HANGER?
The shadow looks like the android robot
I can but most of technic is not compatible with 1.3.1
Om-stone: It DOES
none is
Sweetie Belle!
it's set at 1.1 with the 6.0.7 update I like
forge isnt 1.3.1 yet
Android robot with a big dong
Is there a pony of the little Android bot thing? I want to draw it
My Minecraft is still at 1.9
Om-stone: then... what's that between it's legs.. OH GOD!
I haven't played it at all
I stopped playing arunod 1.0
oh uh
OH NO
but technic is a lot more fun, I got horses and a stable..and a quarry
Jesus is this a spacecraft or an atomic bomb.

I don't believe that that blond-haired pony that shares the same name is the same Wind Whistler I know and love.
dammit!
Stargate got nommed
MaxTheBrony: and we're also manchildren that enjoy stupid shit
how do we lose something like that!

AttacktheAndalite: sooo... your friend watched g1... and thats the rreason he or she hates g4?
08,01oh dear

MadSurge: That is typical hate we get xD , but im sure they are looking at kids shows aswell

Sumica, I've just been thinking. If my mom's at home, and you ever start streaming M*A*S*H, it'll just be my mother on the IRC and not me.
Troll Shackle.

What the fuck is that? Looks like a flying scorpion with wings
hmmmm dirt
Yer
lol what
lol. I'm trying to quit.
xD
=/
00,03I stream the Boondocks!
Vivix: The only thing that's actually scheduled here is BMN or when the mods stream trilogies
ah yeah-
Vivix: It normally sorta random the rest of the week
00,03Because everyone loves an anime about thugs~
yeah- I remember that-
xD
its like master and Padavan
Scooterview, I don't love that show.
orly
indeed we do scoots
Scooterview: Boondocks isn't an anime, it just looks like it
00,10dat speed math
Daaaaaamn
afro samurai is, i think
I listened to visual kei (and still do) for almost 8 years, and never really watched anime or manga
o gott... ponys are everywhere :D
lookin goood
owloysius it is
k
my desktop is conquert xD
it only means his planet circles their sun rather quick
teastri: Do you have the Pinki Pie desktop pony on?
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
I see woona onscreen :3
teastri you must've uswed desktop pony for the first time
now yes xD
woona is soooo cuteee
Anime is just a style, isn't it?
<3
Or wwell technically a word that just means animated
hehe... havnt head of it befor xD
:3
Vivix pretty much yea
Ok. I'm back. Steam is working now :P
Wb Ponies47 :d
So yeah, I don't think the anime's origins would matter if it looks like it is what it is
Ponies47: Yaaay
To me and a lot of anime fans, Anime pretty much means it's JAPANESE in origin, no foreign source material or foreign market targetting from the beginning.
Wb Ponies47
Vivix: no sorry, an animation means its animated. Anime really is a style.
teastri well unless your computer has like a beast RAM and processor, running all the poinies might kill it
Well, yeah it is a style
but it's etymylogy
xD
(I can't spell that word)
and its, not it's
O.o
what is that word even
00,03It's the closest thing to an anime that I will stream that isn't a parody >: D
thats y i closed em as soon as possible... but now my 2 favs are on it :D
word's origin and history
omg
KILL HIM HE is attracting them
Oh shiiiiit.
like Anime would be etomylogically animation
O.o
Teal'c
Scooterview, would you consider Ore Imo to be a parody?
Hi everypony
pinkie and rainbow :D
hi :D
Heya Midnight_Splendor
hai Midnight_Splendor
Hello Midnight_Splendor
Ohai Scooterview
I'm addicted to beck atm.. oh yeahh folk riffs
Hey Midnight_Splendor
yay Stargate.
hi Midnight_Splendor
The only thing I noticed while trying to watch Anime is that they put art over animation, the animation is realllyyy cheap, but the drawings are usually pretty nice
00,03Ehhh no
it's --different, but nice, kinda
STALKER!
they have 2 lipsync changes instead of 16, and static talk scenes instead of dynamic
but there isnt the insane version of twilight :D
its missing :S
I hate the animation In king of the hill and beevis and butthead <.< it makes me sick :S
Vivix, I really like the way they cut corners.
Haven't seen either in yeaaars
It's a taste thing, Anime looks nice
Both make me sick in general.
I like the look of it, but not the animation, I'm much more fond of fluid dynamic like..Bambi or MLP
yeah
but i dont like the look either xD
hehe
god... this song makes me wanna play minecraft :D
Yeah it's a taste thing
true
acting
its relative
By fluid dynamic, do you mean the style where everyone constantly moves their bodies all the time?
noo-
I hate it when people accuse me of drawing anime when I can't help how I draw...
WindWhistler: have any pic :3?
reaction shots and moving scenes, more scene changes and facial expressions
Bye every one
woohoo
Bye Cpw
MaxTheBrony: Well actually that was more of a general statement.
cowlFilly:
take care cowlFilly
bye cowlFilly
Ah WindWhistler ^^
/me yaay
bye cowFilly
Bye cowlFilly
Like there was this one person who said they hate cartoons that try to act like anime.
Hey WindWhistler :P
my screen just got 20% cooler :3
teastri: Nice :3
BB cowlFilly >:3
Then one person pointed out that it's just the style of the artist.
she's dumb
yeah
heh
the artist developing and the team working design really decides the look ofa show
dat *god*
teastri: DekstopPonies?
WindWhistler I hate those types of people
hehe... now i know y some of my frinds call me bronie xD
Oh, erm. Morning all
Ello the-omfg Luna and miniWoona!
Allo XAX.
evening XAX
*DesktopPonies
and sure :D
Heya XAX :D! Morning
hai XAX
hi there XAX
Hello XAX
Ah. Okay. My standard for a good animation style is that if characters are moving without purpose, then money got wasted on the animation budget.
Hey XAX
well, all I care about is the end result
hai XAX :)
how you doing XAX
and anime is usually not cheaper in money than western animation, just different priorotiez
Kandarihu: But if its done right its beautiful :d
Good thanks alexxm
Bambi is absolutely beautiful work of animation
Like MLP even though it uses Flash
i think ill play some minecraft... see ya guys :3
and it's just the type I prefer, I can't really feel the characters if they only have two faces during a 2 minute talking scene
Vivix: and an amazing plot
seeya teastri
yees
PLOTS O.O
Bye tea... Aw :(
...........
MLP uses amazing mix of flash rigging and frame by frame traditional animation
it just looks fluid without being expensive
my face -----> O_o
One Saturday night, I had this in mind when I was watching Bleach, and I noticed that it did everything right. Characters were moving for every possible concievable reason, but they never moved without purpose. THAT is what I prefer to see in my animation.
O.O
But Mlp have beutiful environment
-.-
Dat flaw.
yyeah, it's a preferance, I've only really seen parts of death note and some other animes
DAT FLANK O.O
.......
where I just didn't like how statiac everythign was
GOD :(
^^
:'(
good. Throw a vending machine at it.
Firefox: wtf
:)
00,10you would need augs for that owloysius
how about a Brick... or a Stone... they fly even slower!
What's good about modern animation is that you can have that classic dynamic and reactionary speed and details without spending a loto f money on it
haha xD
i didn't ask for this.
Nox're allready using stealth augs sumi. :P
dat Log
like Flint :P
log!
LOGIN?
:O
Q IN THE FACE

Fight FIGHT D:<
That Deus Ex line :3
Hehehe
yeahh

Love that guy
love that guy
omg
Kandarihu: have you ever seen pokemn anime? they hardly move at all, and there's like 3 frames per movement
Again.
OH SHIPE
SNIPES >:3
talking in pokemon is like 2 frames, repeated in pseudo lipsync
the soldier's a spy
ponymon*
xD
where
the hell?
*shrug*
xd
he's a spy
o.o
Vivix: yeah, i dont even count that as movement since the only difference in the frames is the mouth open/shut. i bet you can even copy-paste it without redrawing
yeah
I think that's why they did it
Talking is cheap in animation
00,10the nox are not weak
a castle in the sky
dat kick
big badass ship
>.>
=/
That's one of the reasons I love mlp, talking is like..even the bg actors like..Rarity in a scene between Twi and Shy reacts and moves
11,02:<
It's beautiful
dat gate
hi SuperBrony64
00,10Silly super
11,02;~;
Pfft.
;~:
Vivix: yeah, they all have a lot of facial expressions
Reminds me of the Chozo.
xd
but it iis a way
Vivix: But they keep copy and pasting ponies for crowds.
Derp :o
/me pats SuperBrony64.
/me glomps SuperBrony64
/me hugs Meanwhile ;A;
Oh yeah, saves a lot of time and money
/me hugs WindWhistler back :D
potatoes
they only have 6 months on an episode? Simpsons have 9months, and it's all hand drawn
did oneill just wise?
YYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!
/me gives SuperBrony64 a hug and a filly Twilight
THE END ?! :O
Firefox: nope, chuck testa
YES
/me hugs AttacktheAndalite back and plays with the filly Twilight :D
I think as they expand their library of bg ponies we get less and less repeating chars in crowds
there needs to be dirt stairs in minecraft
sooo.... they didn't brought back tecnology...
:O a filly twilight! <3
I admit that the animation style in Pokemon can be underwhelming during the dialog.
00,10I has a filly twi
THE END~Applejack T_T
:s my internet
Lil_B: nope, they brung back dead babies
MOO
00,10see

Pokemon probably had an underwhelming budget too
<3 it

Aww, so cute

Flyboy|Gaming great... support the stargate... they'll bring us dead babies :|

Chocolate!? CHOCOLATE?! CHOOOOOCOLAAAAAATE!
Meanwhile: CHOOOOCALATE!!!

Chrysalis, but really, what Minecraft needs now is a red block. We have Emerald blocks, We have Lapis Lazuli blocks, we need a Redstone block or a Ruby block.

what's a pony?
CGI has been absurdly focused on hyper-realism. I would honestly like to see what can be done in CGI with anime-style corner-cutting.
I haven't seen ponies on here for like 2 days >.<
MaxTheBrony, just check on Dash's Determination
MaxTheBrony: dat RD
Needs more ʸᵃʸ
valoreins|Drawing what is a man?!
ponies everywhere <3
CGI can be great, but CGI is tween animation
Michael: :D
I hate CGI in live action movies
Lil_B: miserable pile of friendship
MaxTheBrony: nice job BTW
Michael: Thank you so much :D
valoreins|Drawing Enough Talk! Have at you!
Also, correction, you can animate CGI same way you would traditional- so it's not solely tween
:D

NOOO

So awesome :s
is just simply beautiful
CrimsonPhoenix: It is <3
OwO
magical
I wonder if Beck's truckdriving neighbour is his realy neighbour in the screaming sample
Actually, I downloaded this one anime series that might server as an interesting inspiration for that. It's called Happy Kappi and it's REALLY childish. I only keep it because there's a magical mascot voiced by Emiri Katou (Kyubey), and of course the fact that it's all an interesting take on CGI

Probably more popular than in the USA
where are my friend MOZILLA D:<

AtacktheAndalite: Agreed :D
Hi!
I watched some Digimon as a child, but didn't watch so much TV I started following it-
AtacktheAndalite: anime isn't bad on its own, it's stupid if you say "it's beautiful and it's the only media worth watching snort snort"

AtacktheAndalite: It was mostly Myotismon being dead sexy, going around biting people and all that.
Wait, is the floating head Bruce Campbell?
MadSurge: Not the twilight vampires. Shit no. I don't really "like" them, per se. Just a little fascination. But Myotismon.....

twilight_sprinkle: well, he was at his peak in Beijing. He's been laying off the training since then.

Unicorn Dragon? Unigon...Dragacorn...?
Damnit Satan
Gah, buffering.
Evicted "D
:D
StinkomanFan: It's not Satan =P
is this where it get's weird?
too bad.
Vordox, yes it is. He came in the form of a snake.
snake =/= Satan
Whoa, really bad buffering.
Kandarihu: No
Kandarihu: How can something exist before he was created?
RIP the last unicorn
I thought it was Noah who forgot the Unicorn
And again buffering. I wonder if something went wrong with my connection.
mmm, dat midi
nyst i have bad stream too
The Adam & Eve bit suddenly ended and they're back on the boat?
They'll get back to Adam and Eve later
Save the frog :D
Satan existed before the universe was created. He started out as Lucifer, an angel who rebelled against God and tried to form an army of 1/3 of all the angels. God cast Lucifer and his army out of heaven. Lucifer became Satan and the angels became demons. This was before God created the universe.
Nyst: twain told them kids the story with the book on the boat
Fou_Lou: does the sound hang for you too?
Well, that's just silly!
PULL THE OTHER ONE
Nyst i have buffering sometimes and "bad fps" more often.
Stupid woman
But heaven is supposed to be on earth? :)
Vordox, no.
I find that very funny...
So does that imply heaven is extradimentional?
There's so many holes in it from all the stories.
Vordox, If Santa isn't on Earth, neither is heaven.
Santa?
Firstly: Angels before humans? What is the purpose of Adam and Eve if the humanity has yet not become angels thereby bucking it up itself? :P
Oh, I thought this was a sea-vessel. Is it an airship now?
don't cha know? santa is satan
Meh, dat religion.
I genuinely have no idea at all what is going on
It's always been an airship.
Vordox: I blame the repeated retranslations over thousands of years >_<
Kandarihu: was an airship all the time
Fou_Lou, okay.
Celes: Which version? choose between 1-1000000
And this version of Adam and Eve is Twain's version from his book Letters From the Earth
No religious debate in chat.
Well whatever it is, we know it's nowwhere we can see, and that noone has ever returned from it.
BUFFER
*nowhere
Celes_Chere: not to mention it was written by man anyway after hundreds of years goin from mouth to mouth
O_O
so he's in his story?
Meanwhile, as long as it's civil, there's no problem with it.
Vordox: I don't hink humans CAN become angels.
I agree with them. WHAT'S GOING ON?
hahahaha
Kandarihu: It never stays civil. Ever.
Nyst: so no reason to think it actually exists
Vordox: I think they're supposed to fulfill two entirely different roles in creation.
