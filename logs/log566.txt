Just returned from a walk
With my sister

00,02hmmm
Around three years old
I see
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i was gifted it today ^_^
I KNEW IT
I'm the youngest at 28 :P

00,02its the smaller moon thats father away

She told "No, that's not Celestia! That's Trollestia!"
yes
*said
lets do it
the worst that could happen is splosions
*best
lol
Yep
that's a little disturbing
Well
:D
I call Celestia "Trollestia" sometimes
that would be worse
Hur
Yep
oh ok jw.
Well we just call her Derpy
your*
its easier to i guess
oh
My parents wouldnt care but my brother in law would tease me about it
Well, when we bought a pony for my sister, my parents told me to help them to choose a pony for her cause I am "the expert at that stuff"
lol
aww :3
that would be awkward
this song
<3
Let alone my parents
do you watch the show?
Yes, primarily with my sister
I felt that way at first
Yeah
I clipped my McDonalds Pinkie Pie to my schoolbag and kept it there for like a month.
I only left at home because someone stole the clip -_-
first episode, WHY AM I WATCHING THIS I MUST BE GAY
2nd episode, not bad
rest of season BEST THING EVER
Hur
pinkie used twilight as a minigun.
Hur
Ponies have cannons
Meaning they can guns
&have
They have handguns
lolwut?
00,02 /)_-
when i watched the 1st episode, i kinda got unconfee.. but then i suddently just watched all of s1 and i watched s2. in 1 day.. or maybe 2
00,02staging broke
00,02deorbit time
uh oh
00,02mission failure
My sister has 14 ponies
U jelly
?
Yep
I found out about the show from furry sites and friends :P
and no i'm not really jelly, i wouldnt buy merchandise unless it's a t-shirt
00,02probably could have made it actually
00,02but meh
They call it Cancerousel
00,02realy need the staging to work right
yeah the show is a family show more than a childrens show
Trains.
Well
00,02THE ENGINE
00,02IT DOES NOTHING
<3
night everyone
it's definaely below average
and they still use the English names, which just makes it sound like awkward Swenglish :P
And Cakes
i thought that'S petty normal... then again, we have more english influences in our language nowadays
Which are
same here, modern Swedish slang contains a lot of English words
00,02all in all that went well
i missed the explodes
lol
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i has idea
random boom
whoa, explosions AND surviving astronauts
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirozhki
goodnight
Dur Horst
We failed worse
No, seriously
I'm not sure how it's translated in the Swedish version
I've only really seen clips of it, never a whole episode
okay, that is kind aawesome xD
We do not have a direct translation for Winter Wrap Up
00,02that worked well enough
when in doubt, NOAR ROCKERT!
http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/27700000/Surprise-Angel-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-27716364-600-600.png

it'S gonna break
I am normally anti-Imperial
BUT SHIT

LONG LIVE THE REBELLION
Beard = Skjegg

Hi everypo- ooh Skyrim!

My cabbages!
Infinite room
I can't speak for Arena, however, because I've never played it.
I LOVED the imperial arena.
I actually do kinda agree about that whole "colour" thing
not me
It's a retex of WoW.
Yeah, even though, I'll probably also buy it.
NOO ZE LOOT
I'm gonna be too busy with GW2 to start with another online thingy
GW2?
Oh, Guild Wars.
Guild Wars 2
I've heard of it.
00,02MegaMoonShine, loot
I to looks like they got rid of everything that defines TES gameplay to make it look more WoW-ish
7 imperail swords.lol.
Because, we don't have enough WoW-alike MMO's:|
gotta go back administrating cya
which one?
40k.
Grab ALL the imperial armour!
To be fair, many fans of TES have wanted some form of multiplayer
There be narwalls in these caves
spider time
But this is ruining that wish.
I mean, a WoW look-a-like?
All we wanted was a CoOp mode.

00,10Saturn that sucks man. Not cool that he would do that.
08,01and he said that acting has to take priority
Well, in the end of the day, he needs money....
it is his job
^
00,02well if its work
there are many voice actors out there
08,01which is why acting must come first
08,01still, it's a bummer
Especially since that also means more work for you eh, Saturn?
00,10still not cool you would think he could some how work both in.
08,01oni_link: yup. that's why i've not been around much lately.

Mmmmh...
One ammo? That doesn't sound correct..
he was going to kill with just one bullet

08,01i'm a firm believer in making education accessible
Calarts? As in, the California Institute of the Arts? o.O Wow.
me as well, Saturn
08,01i think education is *the* most important thing, in many respects
Of all the important things that could happen, this is The. Most. Important. Thing!
it's the only thing that's important
08,01i actually... i have plans for my career which intend to shake up the education system in this country
says the physicist
08,01big plans
well if you do it within the next 5 years it'll affect me, Saturn ^_^
08,01but i think education in the UK is ridiculous
08,01and the US is worse
you're telling ME saturn?
08,01even *i* don't know where to start there
08,01scrap it
08,01scrap it all
08,01throw it out, start again
Lol
the main problem are the institutions
you can always come over to Germany, where (most) of the education is (almost) free...;)
Twilight is my guess
08,01i don't even know if the US system *can* be fix
08,01it woudl rely on the country as a whole being fixed
MASF123...its...twi...do you really have to ask? you could of just gone to the info page
lol
Saturn: We need the metric system
08,01and honestly, i think the best thing that can happen to america is for all the clever people to evacuate, and nuke the whole site from orbit
Saturn: not necisarily
no
NO
I don't normally check that out, I've looked at the info page like once.
It'll take more than the metric system to fix you.
THEY ARE BACK
not if it was offered by a corporation

08,01oh, i'm not being literal
Saturn, our system is easier to fix than the U.K.
Saturn: i knows silly
08,01i don't literally want to nuke the states
Stab.
08,01i'm just saying that it needs a huge shake up
08,01Kandarihu: i'm sorry hun, but it really isn't

WIZARDS AWESOME :D
11,01I suck at aiming.
there isn't really an inventory

13go figure
...
OOOOH! You need some aloe for that BURN?
no
13yeah bots are good sniping targets cause they don't worry about you, good practice
11,01Something easy for me.
Fun facct source's net code can make perjectives bend in flight to get hits if you laggy
not you either
11,01Even though Heavys are vunlerable to snipers and spys.
No read him any american nove;l
hey guys

13projectiles and flames are serverside
hmm
BULLSHIT
UNACCEPTABLE
How could he remember if he doesn't exist?
Wambo
PARDOX
13since they take multiple ticks to move, but hitscan is a single tick, and with VAC in play, servers can trust a client when it says where a hitscan landed
6_9
. geeee. or maybe I just have had a craving for ice cream for a long time and don't get it for myself..
Aw....
