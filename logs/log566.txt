Pudge: Why did my parents have to give me the dumbest name ever. They gave my brotehr a good name. But no I got stuck with a really dumb one -_-
Phase4: you gunna stream?
i'm sure it's not thaat bad
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, maybe
Pudge: It is. I hate it when poeple call me by it and when I have to write it down and such -_-
get your name legally changed then
Pudge: I'm only 14
wait
you have to be 18?
idk
I only hate my middle name (well, technically my first name, since it's written before my main name, because apparently Swedish people write names in a weird order)
my middle name is dumb as hell
mine's Jens
Mine's Everett
My first sucks, my middle is meh, my last is also meh -_-
why hate it that unique
00,02mines Robert
mines Karl :p
00,02karl is best middle name
Ponies47: look on the bright side, if your last name is meh, then your brother's is also meh. :P
/me doesnt have a middle name
/me hugs Phase4 thanks :$
though, I really like my last name, since it's got some history :3
hey guys I'm back, I was working on this http://soundcloud.com/g3nesis-warfare/pilot-wip-teaser

Just returned from a walk
With my sister

Imperios: older or younger sis?
00,02hmmm
00,02another flight or another game
ive spent like 2 hours on my youtube trying to find something to watch. anybbody like courage the cowardly dog?
00,02gota pass the time untill skyrim has downloaded
Pudge: Younger
Phase4: you gonna stream skyrim?
Phase4: o u haz skysrimm?
Around three years old
I see
i wouldnt know what that's like, I'm the youngest of the family at 20 years old
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i was gifted it today ^_^
I KNEW IT
I'm the youngest at 28 :P
i'm the youngest at 18
You know, you will easily recognise my sister XD
not counting cousins
00,02could take this one to minmus
Imperios: how so?
00,02hmmm
Well, when we have bought a gift to her birthday
00,02so what'ya guys say
00,02minmus attempt?
go for it
+Phase4: Go for it
00,02its the smaller moon thats father away
sure :3
She told "No, that's not Celestia! That's Trollestia!"
yes
*said
lets do it
the worst that could happen is splosions
*best
lol
She did not like the pink hue of Celestia toy
Pudge thats not that bad
question: anyone can stream through brony state? or is like phase 1 of the staff mems
You're little sister knows what trollestia is?
Yep
that's a little disturbing
Well
:D
I call Celestia "Trollestia" sometimes
oh my bad i was thinking molestia
She started doing the same
that would be worse
Hur
are you answering my question or just saying yep?
SkylerArmor: only mods and phase can
And she also knows who is the pony postman
derpy hooves
Yep
oh ok jw.
hell yeah
Well we just call her Derpy
so you're family knows you're a brony?
how many mods are there for brony state if you mind me asking
your*
its easier to i guess
SkylerArmor: 20 or so
Pudge: I am not sure TBH
oh i was jw, because i'm a closet brony myself
oh
Well guys, going off to get ready. I might not get back on, so see you tomorrow! (maybe)
Well they seem partially aware given how much do I know about ponies and stuff
later MadSurge
Imperios: I see
my family doesnt know im a brony and if they did they would care less about it
I haven't told my parents, but I don't think they'd really care, and both my brothers are bronies too :P
My parents wouldnt care but my brother in law would tease me about it
Well, when we bought a pony for my sister, my parents told me to help them to choose a pony for her cause I am "the expert at that stuff"
lol
aww :3
half my friends know but they dont care and they arent bronies. i could try to make them one but im just too lazy
Not sure did they mean MLP or just toys and cartoons in general
that would be awkward
this song
<3
After all, not even I do know whether am I a brony or not
Let alone my parents
do you watch the show?
Yes, primarily with my sister
brony at the bare minimum means fan of mlp
you dont have to be a great artist or make music
My inner sense of honour forbids me from watching MLP alone
yeah, if you enjoy the show in a non-ironic manner, I'd say you could count yourself as a brony
I felt that way at first
this sounds like lunar republic. never heard that mix before, who did it?
Yeah
I remember there was a chat that I visted sometimes that was full of bronies
i think phase is going around the planet
I clipped my McDonalds Pinkie Pie to my schoolbag and kept it there for like a month.
i was a hater at that time but then I finally decided to see what it was all about so I forced myself to watch all of season 1
I fell in love with the show after the first two episodes :)
I only left at home because someone stole the clip -_-
first episode, WHY AM I WATCHING THIS I MUST BE GAY
2nd episode, not bad
same here Hrafn
rest of season BEST THING EVER
Pudge: Sounds about right.
Hur
im sure i became a brony after watching winter wrap up
People were laughing at my bags irony. A pink pony hanging from a BF3 satchel bag.
Who said ponies cant use guns
pinkie used twilight as a minigun.
I was bored and thought I'd give it a shot since I had been seeing a lot of fan art of it, and expected to see something silly that I could make fun of to myself, but I pretty quickly fell in love with the show and just kept watching
Hur
I think I really fell in love with the show during the sonic rainboom ep
dude, pudge my story is a bit similar... except i wasnt a hater. my friend (girl) told me about it, showed me clip art.. and i was like... wow, so i was decided to watch a episode.
Ponies have cannons
Meaning they can guns
&have
And according to Russian translation of MLP
They have handguns
lolwut?
00,02 /)_-
when i watched the 1st episode, i kinda got unconfee.. but then i suddently just watched all of s1 and i watched s2. in 1 day.. or maybe 2
00,02staging broke
what Imperios
00,02deorbit time
uh oh
In Cutie Mark Chronicles' Russian translation
Phase4 does that mean the mission is a failure?
Instead of asking for a cannon Scootaloo did ask for a handgun
00,02mission failure
fission mailed
insert coin?
Derpy can mail fission yes
i found it in the first few month after i was bored and went on 4chan. sw the pony-threads and since that fit as much like a step-dancing potatoe, i decided to find out about it. watched the first few es that where out at the time (4, i think)
My sister has 14 ponies
U jelly
i actually almost stopped after the pilot. i'm happy i didnt
?
Imperios: and it's supposed to be a kids show?
Yep
I found out about the show from furry sites and friends :P
and no i'm not really jelly, i wouldnt buy merchandise unless it's a t-shirt
Russian Bronies HATE the official translation
00,02probably could have made it actually
00,02but meh
They call it Cancerousel
whats the point of collecting mlp fim dolls?
i think lauren said that she wanted to make a kids show that the whole family could watch
00,02realy need the staging to work right
well, I kinda hate what I've seen so far of the official Swedish translation
00,02^ Dark_Horst
Carousel + Cancer, Russian is Rakosel
yeah the show is a family show more than a childrens show
Also, there is a cool way to watch MLP, improve your English skills and help your sister
Hrafn: be lucky you're not german
alright well i'm gonna hop off here now. bye everypony and good talkin to you Imperios.
Trains.
Dark_Horst: I'm guessing the German dub is really bad? :P
Watch the Canterlot Wedding, in English, with your sister, while translating it
Well
my internet derped
Russian dub is good voice-wise
00,02THE ENGINE
00,02IT DOES NOTHING
<3
Hrafn: technically, there are probably worse, but somehow they made it sound a few levels more infantile. it's like a different show
night everyone
bye Pudge
it's definaely below average
yeah, that's kinda how the Swedish dub sounds to me, it's just... more childish
Same with Russian dub
Extended song, Phase? O.o
and they still use the English names, which just makes it sound like awkward Swenglish :P
it's like "bork bork bork Twilight Sparkle bork bork"
Russian uses English names with all ponies but Rainbow Dash, NMM and Twilight
And Cakes
i thought that'S petty normal... then again, we have more english influences in our language nowadays
Which are
same here, modern Swedish slang contains a lot of English words
Imperios: curses B)
Perfect
00,02all in all that went well
nice, Phase.
congrats Phase4
Phase4: at least theyre alive...for now....

but you know what'S bad? we dont have a direct translation for cutie mark. at least not one that's commonly used
good night Noteworthy
Sonic Rainboom is Rainbow too
Phase4: hmm?
Dur Horst
We failed worse
night Noteworthy
so instead, they went with schönheitsfleck. which means beauty mark. and sound stupid
We call Cutie Marks "insignias".
No, seriously
I'm not sure how it's translated in the Swedish version
Imperios: a lot better than what we do
I've only really seen clips of it, never a whole episode
Znak otlichiya. Literally, the mark of difference and usually used for military insignias.
okay, that is kind aawesome xD
We do not have a direct translation for Winter Wrap Up
00,02that worked well enough
Phase4: did you see that there? your fuel tanks lusted for your blood

heads up though. for DayZ, youll need the arma combined operations package
Dark_Horst: i know that >.>
20% off? needs to be closer to 66/75 before i actually get it
/me wants Shogun 2 but has no money to buy it ;~;

Skog Mc Nord
vampire dungeons are gross

AdamTheDuck, Run Forest Run was surprisingly fitting then ^^
Skog is Skyrimian for beard

Take everything that isnt nailed down - first rule of Skyrim :P
nb4 overcumbered Phase4
Dammit, I even just made up a theme song :(
My cabbages!
Cypresswolf: only if you have infinite bag room
Pff, strap a TARDIS to your back
^ Thats what Hax are for :P
Phase4: This is your obligatory reminder to get that pony mod for your character. I'm heading off to work now. Laters all!
Infinite room
No.. why Skyrim? :C It sucks.
Cypresswolf: :D is there one for room in backpack? i use godmode when too much stuff
Chocobunny: WHY DO YOU SPEAK SUCH BLASPHEMY?
AdamTheDuck: Skyrim doesn't have shit on Oblivion, Morrowind and Daggerfall.
Why do people always complain about what's being streamed :c
I can't speak for Arena, however, because I've never played it.
Skyrim doesnt suck, its a very well-made game. even if you dont like it
Chocobunny: In what Oblivion is better than Skyrim?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: :3 I actually used god mode on a game in Oblivion and tried to take everything I could grab - never did collect everything
:SirGanjalf Oblivion at least had colour to it.
Kinda sucks that Skyrim doesn't have a battle arena like in Oblivion, I really liked that
^^
I LOVED the imperial arena.
got bored with it when I had a hard time finding a certain item - hundreds of a duplicated items just scrolling :D
Cypresswolf: That was so great :D
what ever happened to the gates of oblivion? i never finished the game xD
I find Skyrim pretty colorful for a land pof perpetual snow
AdamTheDuck: I'm not going to spoil it.
nice job Phase :D
I actually do kinda agree about that whole "colour" thing
So.. anyone here going to buy The Elder Scrolls: Online when it gets out in 2013?
not me
Chocobunny: looks kinda horrible
It's a retex of WoW.
Chocobunny: i will maybe
Yeah, even though, I'll probably also buy it.
NOO ZE LOOT
I'm gonna be too busy with GW2 to start with another online thingy
Phase4: Y U take so much stuff?!
GW2?
Oh, Guild Wars.
Guild Wars 2
I've heard of it.
00,02MegaMoonShine, loot
I can't wait until Dishonored gets out.
I to looks like they got rid of everything that defines TES gameplay to make it look more WoW-ish
That's like the highligt game of the year for me.
7 imperail swords.lol.
Because, we don't have enough WoW-alike MMO's:|
gotta go back administrating cya
Bye BrOnyxia :)
Lol, Wrek is playing more Warhammer.
which one?
40k.
It saddens me however, that TES:Online is ruining what every fan of the TES series ever wanted.
I'm back everypony :$ What happened while I was gone
40k is the one with the space marines right? been ages sinse i played that
Not a lot lowfn
lowfn: phase is being greedy with the loot
Grab ALL the imperial armour!
/me slowly drifts into sleep when he snaps himself back awake
Chocobunny: yeah, typical class system, no 1st person view
yay mages
SirGanjalf: You know that every TES game had a class system (excluding Skyrim), right?
good guy phase
i hope phase likes spiders
Chocobunny: I meant TYPICAL rpg class system
in which you define your class at the very beginning
To be fair, many fans of TES have wanted some form of multiplayer
There be narwalls in these caves
spider time
But this is ruining that wish.
I mean, a WoW look-a-like?
05Unnr: yes, but since they are makign basically a wow clone for a game like TES
All we wanted was a CoOp mode.
hai everypony :3
05Chocobunny: aye we would have been hapyp with coop

if you're going stealth and magic

Phase4: yup. and AdamTheDuck recommended you go into ilusion with such acombo
Phase4: Oy! Don't ignore my suggestion! Get a good dagger!
There's an invisibility spell for illusion isn't there?
There is.
Phase4: Illusion = invisibility and you can get enemies to kill each other rather than take them out yourself
00,02hmmmm
Phase4: Get a dagger.

Wait...

05and delay 2 motnsh and 2 weeks
Did he activate two of the stones?

killerpony7733: no its probably gasoline for the nordmobiles
twi_sprinkle_GS17: pimp-nord-mobiles
So they use them it for their horses then?
:O
twi_sprinkle_GS17/killerpony7733: even their cars and horses have beautiful beards
the gasoline fuels the beards as well
glowing mushies
I wanna see this character in 3rd person
Phase4 is such an environmentalist, he only takes what he needs and makes sure not to disrupt the ecosystems with his gathering

00,02well if its work
Kinda true when you think about it. Putting food on the table vs seeing fans, money wins.
there are many voice actors out there
+Phase4: you need to get a horse its awsome
08,01PonyNegZero: well, it's not just that; he's an actor. if he'd turned down, say, torchwood or even MLP to do a convention, we wouldn't have as much awesome stuff to squee about, right?
08,01which is why acting must come first
08,01still, it's a bummer
00,10still not cool you would think he could some how work both in.
08,01oni_link: yup. that's why i've not been around much lately.
lol
Sorry to hear that
Sumica: the events are probably not even in the same country, so time clashes cant be fixed
well it depends Sumica, what release date the show/game comes out
00,10and acting is not a oneday gig
00,02how i sell
00,10is't buck on the weekend?
00,02also cant give him claw
00,02funny that
Phase4: That's good
+Phase4: did you loot the claw
Phase4: claw is needed
oh boyyyyy
00,10Claw is plot element
00,02tigher1001, yep
00,10game comes to dead end with out it
odds are with all the crap, Phase probably dropped it
00,02apanrently i misread what swords were worth
00,02:(
glitch/bug?
Phase4: rofl
00,10no you read it corectly
Phase4: no,its like i said earlier, vendors dont pay as much as the pricing says
00,10but the prices are based on vendor and skills
00,10the most you could get is 300
Phase4: you still have that save game so you can go back
00,02ah
00,02so i effectively got screwed there
+Phase4: its not in your invitory
00,10yup
Phase4: Shouldn't you level up?
did you accidentaly dropped it maybe?
00,02tigher1001, yes it is
yup
00,02killerpony7733, probably
00,10it's ok Phase4 every one learns that lesson
yup
real life lessons in Skyrim lol
00,02health magicka or stamina?
00,10SuperBrony64 was looting every thing not nailed down
Phase4: Health
Phase4: prolly best to start with health
Sumica: lol rly?
dat theme
00,10I totaly have a mod to recomend to yah
Two more months, I cant wait.
Sumica: SuperBrony64 is best Phase4?
i remember when i looted everything in Fallout 3, then came the infinite cap glitch :3
dat 20%
00,10it's like extra packs that have +carry enchants
PonyNegZero: What sorcery dost thou speak?
oni_link: I'm not sure if Sumica typed out SB64 rather than Phase4 in an earlier message
00,10PonyNegZero no I ment SuperBrony64
hello all
Phase4: what are you doing now?
PonyNegZero: I hate when that happens. I tend to mix things up alot.
00,10he has stremed this game as well
hoi Kingman725
Hello Kingman725
00,10same with Wrek and myself
Sumica: ahh, I see, Phase was picking up everything including what was nailed down.
00,10altho super is the only one to pick fights with imortal shop keepers
lol
00,10lol wut
Sumica: excellent entertainment value if you ask me :D
00,10how did you increase sneak hoping around
and by that much
Sumica: Phase is a ninja
00,02i like how she's complaining i didnt help when they killed it faster than i could prepare my bow

Bronysith: I'm probably just gonna get the bethesda package

00,02bethesda games are inexplicibaly more expencive here
steam seems to be intent on slowly taking all your money this summer :P
Potanity: Thats another reason I love being here
http://mmofallout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/saletime.png
00,02not sure if buy now or hold out for pack deal with fallout 3
Jim: :D
Phase4: well its 5 bucks for fallout 3
00,02that is a point
I'm considering telling my friend that I don't like ponies anymore so he stops talking about them. Would that work or would it just make things worse?
00,10just ask em to stop
If I had to pick 1 FPS and 1 RPG to buy, what would you reccomend?
00,02prince of persia fun?
Phase4: YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS
i just bought the trilogy
Sumica: That's like asking someone who wants to kill you to stop.
00,02i take that as a yes
00,10sounds like not much of a friend
Potanity: Don't die, dying is bad.
HOLY CRAP giant spider crawling on my computer desk brb
Dying is a natural part of like
what is with that PonyNegZero?
Phase4: i loved it so much
aw no tf2 stream
Kingman725: it only wants friends... :(
00,02still waiting on mass effect to drop a bit more
loL? bullshit steam, all those games are still a lot more expensive on my client
00,02pony_3220, where you live?
So thats a nope on my question i guess...
00,02ignore my personal details
Spider: Hey i'm here to kill that wasp that was bugging you.. hey what are you doing with that book?
well it cant be friends with me.... but i wont kill it, it can go look for friends outside
05did you take over streaming sumi or shall i jsut put on the tf2?
hmm
Kingman725: Its... Its a spiderbro though :(
00,02problem is i'm out of space
00,02like zero space on my hdd
00,10was thinking of trying that game you gave me wrek
05yey!
00,10especaly seeing as skyrim seems to be broken
Sumica: did they ever fix giants?
I want to go to the moon one day.
00,10how should I know
Wrek i played some deus ex original. pretty kewl
Europe, belgium. Typically things are a lot more expensive but that just encourages people like me to buy games through black markets
well doesnt matter now cuz as soon as i left to get a container it took off like a bat outa hell
00,10looks like Phase4 is still streaming though ^_^
Phase4: get new vegas
>.>
/me nuzzles Phase4.
its funny how new vegas still has a bunch of bugs
spiderbro: http://i.qkme.me/7ay7.jpg
00,02and thus ended the first chapter in the adventures of Skog Mc Nord
Help me out here. If I could only buy 1 FPS and 1 RPG for PC, what should they be?
cod and runescape
XD
IMO bf3 and fallout 3

Phase4: I want to buy that game too, but it looks very very time consuming :P
Potanity: I have tetris on my giant grey gameboy :)
well i played with friends on the xbox so we had a very fun time working as a team....especially in jets cuz jets are awesome
speaking on Tetris(well me), i'm going to go play some now! Cherio!

05you'll find/buy them durign the game
protip: this is a protip
protip: Lifehacks are essential
/me Purrs more
It's always better with a trenchcoat.
Meanwhile: EVERYTHING is better with a trench coat
Sumica: Protip, search everything, you'll find a ton of energy bars
Protip: Insulting a persons protips got me banned on a chat once
05sumi: what diff are you running and 2: would you ratehr disable the HUD usable object display? :3
Really. You can access the in-game menu in the game? Astounding.

Meanwhile: How revolutionary
Very_Silly_Filly: Human Revolutionary.

Sumica: so what are you gonna be, close range or long range?
Very_Silly_Filly: It's Latin :S

Troll Sumica
Barbetos|Atwork: The game is damn near impossible if you go full frontal assault all the time
Did he say "Come on out I'm a physicist"?
When I played it I sneaked all the time. Course I was trying to do a no kill run,
05Sumica: remember iron sights :3
Which I managed to not do somehow.
Meanwhile: "I'mma finish ya!"
05middle mouse
05iirc
MegaMoonShine: "I'm a physacist" sounds better.
Wrek: Iron sights are nothing compared to floating white markers
Meanwhile: Yep, wouldn't want to mess with a physicist :D
I wish there were some good mods of this game...From the LPs I watched it isn't RPish enough for me.. :/
Meanwhile: He would kill us all with SCIENCE!
you shoulda dropped a box on one of them
morning everypony :)

Meow
That dude broke his hip.
It's 5 o clocl somewhere

lol
It's 5 o'clock where I live Eulshy
HAH! I caught up to Sumica :P
It's 17:10 here
See I'm right
Time for the ultimate test, Pacifist again, Ghost and Fociest trophy GO!
Very_Silly_Filly: UK?
Da
that mod does look nice...
Yay.
Very_Sillt_Filly: yay! another englishman!
Let's try and ignore the fact that he's fooling around with corpses...
Compromising positions.
Meanwhile: Um, what
/me englishman chant!
Meanwhile: Hard to do when it's in front of your face.
I actually still have Deus Ex installed :D
Stealthy is AWESOME Mica!
Indeed.
CMC englishmen, GO!
BronyInstrumental: Dibs on being Sweetie Belle in this analogy.
did you guys see the 2 songs from season 3?
wasent Phase4 playig this game also?
i call scootaloo
sorry Meanwhile
Well, golly. The cloppers are making the rest of us look bad.
God damnit.
jumpyjumpyjumpy
Chocobunny: Welcome to hell
place corpses in boxes
Chocobunny: This is news how?
Pfft, as if we needed cloppers to look bad.
guess what, bronies are also humans - does that make all humans terrible (moreso than they already are)
Chocobunny: The cloppers have ALWAYS made the rest of us look bad
dem unburnable bixes
boxes*
05as a amtter of fact
05this game is mostly eurpean
orly?
05or french
05for that matter
Wrek is feeling proud.
Again, we look pretty bad anyway from an outside perspective.
What do you mean Meanwhile
To the rest of the world we're tsundere, no?
there is porn for every cartoon. every. single. one. and there are people who masturbate to that porn, haters need to stop acting like we are the only ones who do it
not so sneaky
We watch a little girls show.
sneaky sneaky BANGBANGBANG!
sneak points -10
Yeah, who is Howard Stern?
Sounds like a dick.
slip or mag?
Meanwhile, and?
clip*
05use painkillers for HP
Almost ded.
05y
Aren't we a groupd that will break that gender stereotype?
CrimsonPhoenix: That reaction isn't the average persons reaction. Their reaction is more along the lines of "What? Really? Pfft."
headshot is credit to kill
05it'll regen to a 100. but to reach max hp you need painkillers or boosters
Meanwhile that does not help their arguements at all, as stereotypes are bullshit. if all men and women followed stereotypes, then men would always be drunk, and women would never leave the kitchen
Meanwhile, well that's one goal of Lauren
Louis needs those painkillers
she wanted to break that stereotype
Point being that you shouldn't assume we only look bad because of R34.
PEELZ HERE
How did i manage to get 3 rp's at the same time
We look bad because by social norms, we're weird.
05you'd have 125hp
05if you used it now
I always believe that there is a seed of truth in every stereotype, but that shouldn't reflect upon everyone/everything
Meanwhile i agree, everything ever has rule34
Mmmmh...
One ammo? That doesn't sound correct..
he was going to kill with just one bullet
Concussion Grenade, do you beat people with it?
One bullet sounds more correct.
sounds like R34 ruins mlp fandom more than any other fandom don't you think...
he had the golden gun
Nope
to be fair sum ica did kill them with one headshot a piece...
valoreins|Drawing not really...
Chocobunny: :D
Put a concussion grenade on a stick and go demoknight.
Omelettes are delicious.
Wrek: Can't you stream Mirror's Edge? It's a great game.
AttacktheAndalite: Indeed
katamari domacy!
this game could use more Demopan
/me goes to make herself an omelette
Be Snake
05played it, didnt like it
i mean, r34 animes are so widespread people think it's normal. but mlp... people get butthurt over it...
>Mirror's Edge
>Great game
Wrek: :o
Hahahaha no.
oh god...
Sumica: You can hack the computer
you know what i hate?
"Wait a minute, the Society for the Creation of Reasonable Opportunities for Talented but Underdeveloped Mares? Doesn't that shorten to-"
05Sumica: if oyu get close you can press or hold Q. pressign will knock unconciouss, holdign q will kill.
I lol'd at this line
best fic ever
Valoreins: R34 animes? Y'mean hentais?
You mean porn?
05using a melee attack will drain 1 energy battery thing under oyur health bar
even his shneezes are graceful
dis topic
0-0
05you currently have 2, but the first will always regenerate
when i get into a fandom like mlp, or homestuck, and i catch up with all the episodes/pages.
it makes everything so slow
05protein bars will regen furtehr past the first one
R34, no exceptions.
^
Wrek: Can you only stream PC games?
because i actually have to wait for my episodes/pages
Take computer, u need the money
05Chocobunny: i hate consoles
Chocobunny: Streaming consoles requires a capture card
05so you will onyl see me streaming from my PC
Amen to that Wrek.
Congradulations, your now a Facebook level hacker
I hate consoles as well, but there are some only-consoles games that are good.
consoles, pcs <3
Example : Brütal Legend.
Great game.
Only console.
parkour!
I heard Brütal Legend sucked.
Uncharted is a great game
Meanwhile: It's awesome.
Brutal Legend was globbing hilarious
05yeah Sumica: each "level" will have atleast 1 way to beat it eitehr if you go sneaky, kill or dont kill anyone etc
RobertRevenge: You've played it?!
and i like dragon's dogma, is the PC version of it out yet?
Chocobunny: Duh, I love Jack Black
Sumica: soon you can turn invisible
valoreins|Drawingconsoles and PC... I will never understand the war (well, I'll understand why there is a war, but I don't see good arguments)
RobertRevenge: I repeat from yesterday, stop becoming more awesome.
hi ViolaGrey :)
i just got completely up to date with homestuck, and guess what? its in the middle of a pause, so no new pages for atleast a week
Lil_B: all about fanboyism
Sumica, you have reached hacker level Facebook

Spray and pray.
Man down? He became less manly?

I should replay Deus Ex, I still have it downloaded

^
Valoreins: Play Brütal Legend.
valoreins|Drawing: chrysis 1
Too bad most games these days suck.
he ran away
valoreins|Drawing There are Pros and Cons for both, but both are around for years now and that proofs that these Pros and Cons are rather well balanced
Meanwhile: There are gems, however.
yup
He became invisab;e
so its really just personal opinion
Call of Duty 7 Revenge of the Return of the Lens Flare. HD.
05its equipped
Sumica you can even kill people with vending machines later on :3

Meanwhile: Release date?

Meow

Nurse_Major: Didn't you know?

All right, I need to take off folks.
Bye Everlasting_Joy
00,10so basicly what I did get was lag the network by taking over useless dead ends first
later Everlasting_Joy
Sumica: fortify nodes that you took over
05dont forget to fortify them ocne you cap them to slow down the tracer
05but ill teach you a trick sumi
05on this one
Sumica: it heightens their rating, the higher the rating, the slower the anti virus can take over
05as you capture the node with a 2 at it, fortify your IO port
05go directly for the one after that
05then capture the big red thign
05and it will give you everythign on the network
Only if you can reach the IO :P
Some are one way
What 6_9
dont foregt the cube
the cube contains neat shit

Well while I have the time I should say that if you don't hear from me for some time or don't see me online at all. It will because I will have been Sectioned for my own safety.
05and yes sumi, if you get the heavy lifting aug together with robot domination
05you can convert that turrent and carry it around as it shoots stuff
I stupidly told my doctor of some mental health issues I've been having and may end up going bye bye.

Hey ponies
Hey filly
Nice one valoreins|Drawing
Got some nice British Chips from the nice British Chip Shop
ohai Very_Silly_Filly
And 7 play coins :)
Very_Silly_Filly, ^^ Hiya
Vordox: i can't even choose :[
Drpy
:p
fail
i want to vote everypony there... :(
Sumic really needs a silencer
Sumica: what difficulty are you on?
oh yeah, silenced guns, he'll love them
Sumic is best arms dealer...
valoreins|Drawing, wow. That's one sadistic choice.
Build a baracade of dead bodies
Kandarihu: yep...
05one hell of a work place if they serve beer in the offices
bullet logic works every time!
Wrek: and tranqu darts. and tazer darts. and rifle ammo. and...
Dark_Horst: Best Boss ever
Your a pimp
Wrek: Office Wars :D I'd love to work there
No toilets?
must aquire wire
hey guys
Eulshy: No cargo dropoff's, nope
ello alexxm
heyup, alexxm
ohai alexxm
Hey alexxm
I'm fine. And you?
alexxm: im doind good you?
I have GB chips
Your argument is invalid
alexxm: just meditating to the inner side of my soul to find a real answer of life from this: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/351/723/bfb.png
Sumica: take the box. fun things in the boxes
i'm good AttacktheAndalite and Very_Silly_Filly
win
I'd say Vinyl, she's the least seen so far
but you did
Sumica: the upper right one
oh yeah, and hacking gives esp
*exp
05here id say go straight for the goal
05fortify as you capture
05you can fortify everythign that you capture
^
Dat DX1 unatco theme!!!!
well i am completly bucked in dead island
Very_Silly_Filly: i dunno, tavia and vinyl is seen once in a season, but yeah still the least
You were completely bucked when you bought Dead Island.
you're toasr
but i like dead island :<
05also sumi: if nodes are already taken by the system
Dead Island is Borderlands, but with more and more zombies
05no need to go for them unless they are crucial for the goal
Meanwhile: how come?
05goal is green circle
05sphere*
Wrek: Data boxes
Sumica: shits and giggles. also, sometimes there COULD be something useful in an email
valoreins|Drawing: Oh easily, just not that great on it's own merit.
05sicne you cant capture the red box
05the game stores all email your read
05in your tab menu
Wrek is like the Na'vi of Deus Ex, only far more useful.
Hello, everyone
Allo Vinco.
ohai Vinco
Hi Vinco
05well each time you hack you get xp
05so you are technically doign it right
05soften makes it easier and faster to convert nodes
Sumica: rule of thumb: do EVERYTHING
THERE
and it's midnight here, time for me to rest, baii everypony :)
The red one!
Bai valoreins|Drawing
awww
hey Vinco how are you
Night, valoreins|Drawing
night, valoreins|Drawing
bye valoreins|Drawing
alexxm: I'm good
/me yawns loudly.
alexxm: how are you?
i'm good Vinco
good night valoreins|Drawing
Hey, I remember seeing that e-mail before... the one about rules for plant security, and the last one is about never playing shareware games on company computers
05ok soften is the one that gets lower tetection percentages
Data storage = Bonus item/Exp
05transfer is speed
okay morrowind is pretty good
05see?
05one now has 0
05makes it muuuch faster to cap
actually, soften lowers every node by one, tranfer juggles them
hm
transfer takes rating from one node, and puts it somewher else
Hmm, that was delicious, yum yum
Dark_Horst: What if we take the node rating, and push it somewhere else?
05lold
we shoudl totaly do that
Meanwhile: I was thinking the same thing
Meanwhile: XD
Now's a good time to go for the box
THE CUBE
oh R.I.P Mermaid Man
05i say cap cube
05adn then cap goal
05use a nuke virus
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG what killed him
and while it'S capping, fortify your stuff
alexxm: something about a bad kidney
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG damn was it at least peaceful then
Right, that;'s enough loitering and raseing around, back to work for me
05scrool wheel zooms out
05and yes
you could
05dooo eet
05but fortify your IO as it converts
alexxm: i dont know
ok
05wait
05sumi
you'd have to fortify
05nuke that 100% notde
05node*
05or not
hello again everypony :)
hi BronyInstrum|Drawing
hey BronyInstrum|Drawing how've you been
i've been fine, alexxm
how about you?
Allo again BronyInstrumental.
i'm good BronyInstrum|Drawing so what have you been drawing
alexxm, it's a little obvious given the name
oh nvm i misread
i've been drawing my entry for the art contest
Sumica: well, it IS the future
maybe
05mayeb sumi should replay the advanced hacking tutorial :P
ok hope that goes well BronyInstrum|Drawing
ha. made red easier to cap
Get reeed!
In the future all computers run on PLSHCKME-9 Operating systems.
05go north
05hard and furiously
O_O
Oh my.
05and btw sumi you can actually forify more than jsut your IO, you jsut gotta cap them first
Meanwhile is that good?
Scary butt fun.
oh my
you also should always fortify the ones closer to the red node first
at what level Dark_Horst ?
Vordox: always
becasue as soon as red starts to capture a node, you cant operate it anymore
Red vs blue
Sumica: Save first
05save bef entering
shit's on fire, yo
The future's bright, the future's orange.
too late
even in the future, there are no hover cars 6_9
Meanwhile: Orange and teal.
Same in crysis
HELLO EVERYPONY! :p
Doobinz: its acceptable
Doobinz: Since when could your PC run Crysis?
Hello, Ponies47
hey Ponies47 how've you been

My PC costs £1400
so this is what happened to nick fury then
i miss the saying, if you can run Crysis you can run anything :(
Well cost
Number 1 is better then 2

Doobinz: i will in the future
05yey dickjensen
Ohai Wrek
I finally got it to work
but i cant survive on my own
way to hard
Sumica: well, the stram is about 20 seconds delayed
His dickishness is augmented.
Dick Jensen is a Dick
Who's worse, DickJensen or DickShep>?
DickShep
look out here comes super douche
Dat 419
My stream is dlayed at all
05holh h
05hold*
He's got it out.
Put it Away Sir
Wait what.
Put it away!
he seems so calm about the gun pointed at him
I like how the cops are all casual about someone pointing a gun at them.
DOEET
CriticKitten: their bosses are obviously worse
:3
Check zeke

Fail.
She ded, bro

Idiot.

LOL
Pfft.
Yes you can
use Q
ded
all the save...
shotguns. arent they fun?
EPIC FAILURE
Sumi didnt do it right
>puts bullet in cop's head "that was mildly annoying"
LOL
Hahahaha
>take bullet to head "DED"
And Sumi. Just quick press Q
you'd think the cyborg could take more damage
He heard that.
XD
Quick q = Silence but not kill, Hold Q = Insta kill
05i did tell you about Q thoguh :P
Sumica: and you forget about the Revolver 6_9
xD
Oh, Sumica...
Hah.
05press q to knock out, hold Q to kill
I saw that coming, his batteries are not charged
08,01hold Q to kill?
08,01goddamnit.
08,01DE LANCIE!
YOU'LL GET YOUR RENT WHEN YOU FIX THIS DAMN DOOR!
USE Q in close quarter
Sumica: btw, if you tap q, it'S a non-lethal attack. also, you need a full battery on the upper left to do it
Press or Hold
"Do you think he's still here?" WHERE WOULD HE GO?!?
hi Ponies47
08,01killerpony7733: eh, the rest of the con will be awesome
Hi Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
Sumica: was it really worth it XD?
08,01hey all <3
I AM SURROUNDED! By food, that is.
08,01i always feel the love when i come in here
gotta make some room
never get a gun between Sumica and yourself
so much stuff
GilDash: John De Lancie got called to do voice acting during the Convention
08,01GilDash: read our front page (http://bronyuk.org)
Hey man, you never know how important that revolver might be to Sumi's general strategy of dickishness.
You know odds are.. Sumica wont use the revovler
revolver*
08,01Ponies47: <3
Yes.
He might use it to shoot a dude in the knee.
1 ah ah ah 2 ah ah ah 3 ah ah ah...
08,01hey wrek, did you get my pm?
08,01or did i accidentally send it to someone else...
08,01that'd be horrific...
Sumica: you can augment your inventory
Lol
Oh my god.
XD
What if Fluttershy was aa defense attorney? "OBJECTION! Uh, I mean, if that's alright with you..."
Lol
Did you just literally shoot an innocent bystander?
Sumica: she'S your pilot
Goddamn
shes tough
Man, that civilian can take a lot of rounds.
A witness to whaaaat.
Meanwhile: What's wrong with that? I do it all the time in games!
oh lol
MELEE
wat
whos playing
yah, tis a shame about Mr. de lancie :(
SUmi
You're in my spot, sir.
Imagine Nigel Thornberry in the new Smash Bros. game. Super SMASHING Bros.
Lol
Gently press Q and release it quick to get non lethal kill
Yeahhhhhhh
Vordox how is that possible
You'll see
Vordox: Knock out?
alexxm: he means tap it
Vordox i mean how can you have a non lethal kill
Hey, in Sumi's defense, she was in his way, sir. :|
Wat
I DO NOT KNOW
Sumi: There's several animations for take owns
Dat woah timing.
A non-lethal kill is like eating a non-consumable object.
PAWNCH. "woah"
falcon punch!
I SEE NOW
my weapon is my fist!
Police in the future are horrifyingly incompetant.
People die when they are killed, but not all fiction agrees.
Lol
xD
Cost 1 cell, Mica :P
Meanwhile: no different than now...
Did you just levitate?
XD
OH MY.
Sumica is best DickJensen
LOL
....
LAWL
HAHAHAHAH
WAT
what why
they seem to like their doors
LOOK OUT HE'S GOT A DOOR
^
Closing Doors is a Crime apparently
XD
OH
I see
The door is hitting that dead guy
Opening Doors must be a sexual offense
why do they do that
Sumica, that is like the chicken of Skyrim, no?
Bumped the corpse and the corpse bumped the police dude
Pfft.
Lol
Wow.
That's FANTASTIC.
And the cop is like "LOOK OUT HE'S GOT A CORPSE"
05wait
05sumica
....
05use the body to sweep the revolver
Hahahahaha
XD
Sorry about your wife, here, have her back.
Wow, Sumi
Oh my god.
its in a worse spot isnt it
I can't believe that worked.
so you can move the corpse and not have anything happen but close a door and shit just got real
This is NOT Dick Jensen
This is Arsehole Jensen
XD
^^
WOAAH
Cop is really casual about you dragging evidence and corpses around
Vordox is there a differance
its like playing with a Claw machine XD
Lol
Imagine this IRL.
Lmao
Those are some nice boots, you should take them
05think you can grab it now
Irl the police would be like "Dafuq are you doing?"
you can take the revolver!
LOL
Hahahahaha
Oh, I hate claw games.
This looks like Gary's Mod. Ragdolls everywhere.
05jsut throw away some stun darts
LOOOOOOOL
I'm laughing for real right now
HA!
Thats Hilarious
Sumica: see if you can upgrade it
I'm at work and I'm laughing, this is bad...
05dont wory about auto sort sumi

00,10hory hell, one year ago today I became one
for what reeezon?
All I know is that it's been about a year and a half
08,01anyhoos, i would just like to say this in here: in the last year, my life has changed in so many ways that would have been unfathomable to me when i first started watching the show. i've done things that i wouldn't have dreamed, i've made so many new friends, my outlook on life has changed a lot, i've become more confident and less socially awkward, and i've had an absolutely rollicking time being involved in this community
Sumica: What's that, a mod?
00,10what mod?
All the good ebay Dashie plushes cost so much..
You.
00,10oh no a brony
I hate you Hasbro for making those disgusting pony merchandise.
Ahh
08,01my life has become very strange since then, and i'm still weirded out by some aspects of what i do day-to-day now (read: most con-related things)
11,01My mod birthday isn't for another 8 months?
1 year and 2 days I joined this site :)
Nurse_Discord: :P
00,10sorry I did't become a mod here till like last november

Sumica: I dunno, I'm still laughing at it.
But I have a weird sense of humor. :3
I have a British Sense of humour, any other type I find unfunny :3
08,01i had the weirdest moment the other day when skype popped up a notification to let me know that John de Lancie had come online

Very_Silly_Filly: in C++?

This looks like I Wanna Be the Guy, but there's scrolling.
Oh dear, totalbiscuit

08,01Vordox: believe me, it's not as cool as it sounds. i shit myself every time i fire him off an e-mail or such like.

That game is hilarious
It's an abomination of a game

But its a game :P
08,01alexxm: yeah, it was rather boring
This game is gorier than fucking happy wheels
Woot PM? :P
Very_Silly_Filly: Happy Wheels is more detailed

alexxm: Hardly a troll if you just call people some random things thats somehow is mean't to be insulting
XD

Clever.

This game isn't as hard as the original. <.<
well not 'teach' but like pointers
Wait, what?
D:
lol
man i remember playin Bionic Commando Rearmed on 360 that was fun
XD
:(
Oh, a barrel landed on your head, even though it was stationary.
Where the hell is the "retry" button on this keyboard?
Did....did the terrain kill you? ._.
Ok wow is this game designed to make you lose everytime?
so does the gun actually do anything
00,10yeah Pork_Chop
My god
Pork_Chop: It's a Trial and Error game
00,10seems to be the new version of IWTBTG
Maid_Discord: Ponies? :D
what'S this?
^_^
l0l
Dark_Horst: a game that provokes much rage
....
Can you guys play I wanna be the guy, next?
lol
hi Shamroc
Wait, what?
did that happen
I still don't get that.
lol
The blue of the sky is the same blue as the m, p and s of mips.tv. I find that funny
MASF123: Played it once, completed it once, never touching it again :P
Insert another coint
11,01iPhoneGunny: PONIES!
Coin*
00,10must be somthing that comes out of the barrel
does the gun work
^_^
Is he or IT wearing a cloak or something
._.
lawl
xD
alexxm, yes, but it's not very useful
00,10see
Oh of course.
what
Knew it already Mica :P
Pfft.
Vordox, I've never played it, but I heard it is harder than Super Meat Boy.
lolz
XD
MASF123: ...
I cri erry time
MASF123: I wanna be that guy is the most unfair game ever created
Ded. Ded. Ded. Ded. Ded. Ded. Ded. Ded. Not big surprise.
Close up there ot the BUllet hells.
There IS no equal to IWBTG
l-o-l
00,10go up the other side
/me ded
Entire team is babies!
In the words of a youtuber I can't remember the name of: "This game hates you, in every way imaginable. It hates you, it hates your kin, it hates everybody relating to you."
LOL
Gotta jump fast there
So, is the Contra guys heavies? And the guy you play Scout?
Vordox, it is even harder than the impossible game...
No
MASF123: ....
Yeah, there you go
MASF123: Go play IWBTG
Okay...
No I won't.
QWOP is hardest
08,01ha!
You missed the orb to swing :P
08,01IWTBTG is awesome
Once upon a qwop.
Rofl
so is the guy supposed to be a little kid or something
Rofal
alexxm: No, it's a reference to the original
thanks Vordox
Can you go through that door?
Good luck with the swing
...
Derp.
XD
Is there a pony edition link to his game?
That was EEEEEEEVIL
MASF123: Nope
11,01Aww :<
That grapple point fell down
Is this a GAme maker or C++ or Java game?
Wr3k should play some happy wheels
The guy who made this travelled back in time and became Hitler.
Robbaz should definately check this game out.
Kandarihu: Eveyrthing you see kills yo, everything you don't see kills you, here play. :P
/me is best maker
:p
I know, I know
MakerDusk is best Dusk.
/me makes MakerDusk
Does he really need to use the Grap there?
Has anyone even tried to think what the use of the building he is jumping on is?
Look at this ad on the stream..Russian Girls. WTF.
Like really what
Barrel and fish warehouse?
MASF123: We're in hard times
You know, there's one thing in this game that doesn't kill you, where other games might. Falling damage.
MASF123:lol
00,10guard tower duh
Sex and prostitutes are high regarded now =P
GUARDING WHAT?
of course
MORE TOWERS?
Guarding the fish and the barrels.
08,01finally
Pork_Chop: They're guarding Barrels silly
Ok well that makes sense I guess
Deeeeeerp
08,01the Brony Thank You Fund are doing something i can really, honestly get behind: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/07/brony-thank-you-fund-announces-calarts.html
Although
This looks more like a game so far, more ever then IWBTG
08,01they have just become absolutely awesome in my mind
So this game is about a fish lover trying to destroy guard towers protecting a barrel warehouse
08,01from asinine to awesome in 10 seconds flat
I would donate if I had money...or a job.
We must make a movie of this NOW
05and i give up for the day
05lets play somethin easy
00,10it's just not the same with out hearing wrek rage
I wanna be the guy plz.
He was playing?
Lol he was?
Wrek..haha...this game is full of the rage juice
I thought it was another vid. Derp.
Same here
Meanwhile: niced
lol
00,10MASF123 this is the same thing
i would donate if i was god damn old enough to
05alteast i came further than TB xD
Wrek: Err...
Holy shit guys! I WON 2 FREAKING I PADS!
Wrek
OMFG
That was very easy game :P Just traps
Sounds legit.
Wrek: by maybe 5 seconds
Pork_Chop: GOOD GOD WE DONT CARE!
08,01Vordox: i hated their original thing of making that advert on The Hub
D:
08,01i still hate it
11,01Wrek beat TB.
lol 100 friends
08,01i think it's stupid at best, creepy at worst
HADOKEN!
08,01and asinine throughout
Are you going to play Tribes: Ascend?
Awwww
Kandarihu: he cant, its bugging out
YAYA
:P
Tf2
00,10now to see if I can fix the rim of sky
tf2
I shall now play tf2
08,01i'm a firm believer in making education accessible
Calarts? As in, the California Institute of the Arts? o.O Wow.
08,01i think education is *the* most important thing, in many respects
Of all the important things that could happen, this is The. Most. Important. Thing!
it's the only thing that's important
08,01i actually... i have plans for my career which intend to shake up the education system in this country
says the physicist
08,01big plans
08,01whether i can actually do what i intend to is another matter
well, you have at least one person on your side ^_^
08,01but i think education in the UK is ridiculous
@Wrek, I've never asked you this question before, but I always have myself needing to ask you this particular question but have always felt so nervous to ask you...Do you mind if I ask you this question Wrek?
08,01and the US is worse
08,01by god, US education system...
MASF123: that question question..
08,01even *i* don't know where to start there
08,01scrap it
08,01scrap it all
05how should i know? i dont know the question
canada is bad too
08,01throw it out, start again
Lol
What is your favorite pony @Wrek?
the main problem are the institutions
you can always come over to Germany, where (most) of the education is (almost) free...;)
Twilight is my guess
08,01i don't even know if the US system *can* be fix
08,01it woudl rely on the country as a whole being fixed
MASF123...its...twi...do you really have to ask? you could of just gone to the info page
lol
no
NO
OH GOD NO
I don't normally check that out, I've looked at the info page like once.
It'll take more than the metric system to fix you.
THEY ARE BACK
not if it was offered by a corporation
http://see.walmart.com/furby?cid=sbo.320.1456
pony politics..
FURBIES
08,01Pork_Chop: Scotland
Ok...well that explains it.
Ahh
Meanwhile: I mean in addition to all the other stuff
aren't you voting on your independence soon?
08,01oh, i'm not being literal
11,01How do your teachers get paid?
08,01i don't literally want to nuke the states
Dat Steam?
Stab.
08,01i'm just saying that it needs a huge shake up
08,01Kandarihu: i'm sorry hun, but it really isn't
00,10So is sater trying to start shit?
08,01not your whole government, system, and culture
Takes 4 ever to boot...
08,01anyhoos, this isn't the place to tlak politics
11,01US Govt needs a reboot. Ban lobbying.
Und dann Wrek was Rarity.
11,01Oh.
Eish
08,01i can get rahter... enthusiastic about politics
and I have branched out in my field
Eish my bru
so from i wanna be the guy to team fortress
08,01MakerDusk: two if i count myself
XD
08,01well, one and a half
Who is the one to the right?
how's your nuclear physics and high explosives geometry?
I mean left... :)
genorosity? he must be rarity
We just need to return to our spiritual roots and figure out how to prevent the country from going so wrong the way it did.
Is she smoking a blunt?
?
Hmm, invisibility contacts, I guess.
Dat medic.
:$ OMG OMG Deadpool is getting his own game, Marvel's Pinkie Pie is gettin his OWN game :D awesome /)^3^(\
Or is it an invisibility scarf? Whatever.
11,01Kandarihu: Kick big business out. It's corporate lobbying that's screwing us up.
hay
11,01Hi Flutterswag
Heavy is ready.
:)
Maid_Discord: It'smore the that
Damn, whats the Ip for this server
if its not private
Maid_Discord: Please don't start politics here
tD:
I'm sure you're thinking the entertainment industry, right?
11,01I won't.
I did a few times and it caused hell
Anypony ever heard of Poker Night in the Inventory?
Yes
The Heavy plays Poker there apparently.
Yeah he does
11,01Wrek gets Rarity a lot.
11,01Wonder if he ever played as Twily.
With Max, Strong Bad, and....Tycho??? :O
Is Wrek streaming?
Maid_Discord: he probably doesnt xD
and hai everypony
MASF123: Got it when it came out, amusing little aside.
Yeah @Wrek is Streaming.
Maid_Discord: Nerf Pyros and Rarity
If we're going to forbid big corporations from lobbying, then we're going to have to do the same to small companies, and everything else. Equal protection goes both ways.
Maid_Discord: Then I'll come back to PF2
yes got it right
11,01I've never played PF2.
Dat Pyro
Dat Applejack
Told you Meanwhile
Nothing can beat Rarity
And Pyro owns everything, even the ponies
Not even Rarity.
MASF123: "ish"
Pyros... EISH
11,01Two Raritys.
Told you Maid_Discord ...Rarity is OP, everyone knows how godlike she is =P
Compare dto the other ponies who are just crap
Generosity (Charging)
how's it going everyone?
Rarity fight.
lol is that rarity?
sharklion, fine I guess...just really bored as always.
hehe, that's what the internet is for!
Yeah I noticed. :)
I woke up this morning without my shirt on...

Lol wrek is 20% cooler
MASF123 make it happen
I think you should lock your door better TheHoodyNinja
sharklion: D:
TOP SECRET.
Well, anyone is godly when controlled by Wrek.

woona?
Hey I have the same glasses and hat!
Cool

Very_Silly_Filly: So what gamecode was it?

Wasn't she the Medic?
Maid_Discord: Applejack is kinda op tho
Fluttershy is medic.
I thought Flutters was Medic
Very_Silly_Filly: she is
Pinkie Pyro?
seriously ponies should not move like that
I'd say Bigmac would be heavy
11,01Didn't know Heavy had a different shotgun.
Weilding the Twilislov?
Maid_Discord: Yeah, family fortune or something
Twilight is best Gatling gun
Tribes Ascend seems to be working for me.
I'm gonna try that next weekend
This shitbox doesn't have any of the specs
Lol I'm gonna be gone for a couple days this week, guys. :l
It's maid hour o.o

oh ok
got a problem with it ._o?
The voice in the dark shall guide us!
yay!
Phase4: how did that happen?
Phase4 suddenly everything borked
but if we have two hearts, they are connected. If one blows up it wont matter we have another one because the system is open and it would just pump the blood into the tissue
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, i was shifthing partitions around, and i misplaced my lvm volume
11,01Phase4 accidentally Linux.

no wait, get the pegasi to stop
/me 11,01stretches his wings
I can hear the bass a bit
Lil_B: I dont think even that would help, because then it created a blockage, the blood cant pass through.
cloudsdale doesn't need more water
Maid_Discord: did you get to see a witch?
00,02and then interderp
I love this song :)
Did anyone here catch what gigas Youtube was?
Alchemist yeah... I think the broked heart would have to get removed imiediatley
MaxTheBrony: Hang on, I'll find it for you.
Lil_B: anyways Im far too ignorant about the human circulatory system to have a meaningful conversation about it :D
11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Wut?
Maidwhile: Thank you :)
the bass sounds a little out of tune
maybe if we put the hearts pumping in parallel
Alchemist dito :)
Maid_Discord: Wizard of Oz Reference silly
11,01If one heart of a two-heart system failed, it would be extra work on the still-working heart.
11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Oh.
Maid_Discord: so 2 hearts in one heart?
lol

L4D2 is taking ages to install ._.

DWR: Think I found you.

Side note - I saw my doctor today and finally told her some stuff I had been holding back for years. So if you don't hear from me for a long time it'll be because I've been sectioned.

Anyway, I prefer regulars. Manechat just gets too confusing at times.

And very, very weird.
>confusing
ogod. the COMMUNITY VOTE on steam is going to be, Deus ex HR for 75% off, vs skyrim 50% off, and COD MW3 for 50% off. i wonder who will win?
amongst other things :p
Skyrim
clearly
DEHR
Bronysith: I'm hoping HR.
Dis shit.
Rest.
D:
"In the confusion you find the answer2
CriticKitten: same
Fimfiction Y U NO WORK
i am interested in my little pony. *Troll Face*
Mhmm.
No interest in CoD, already have Skyrim.
That is the answer to everything
Although I've had good convos on Manechat
I HAVE NO MEMORY
We gonna stream the Harry Potter franchise?
Bronysith, hopefully the one that's 75% off. Hopefully it's not CoD
At all?
they come up once in a while
Like that one time we all argued with Vordox about math, and then philosophy
And then art.
StinkomanFan NEVER!!
Kandarihu: as long as it is not cod. or skyrim. ill be happy
Troll: You are the greatest troll I have ever seen
we gona read it instead
How does one argue about art.
Vordox >_<
WHY NOT?
I'm going to get off.. this movie looks like shit.. =/

05,15Firelight OH GOD sorry it's not ALL ACTIONA ALL THE TIME
StinkomanFan: yeah , sometime , not sure when
Firelight: You just glance and think you know it?
Vordox was complaining about "modern" art.
I wouldn't mind if it's Skyrim... but being less than 75% off makes it a waste of a deal. I'm voting for DXHR
Ah well.
lol..... fine i'll watch it god damnit .lol
i'm seeing HUGe potential here
That I can understand.
I had to explain to him the difference between modernism and whatever the hell they call today's art.
art is beauty in perspective
Andd I haven't seen Bourne yet
Since I have nothing els to do.
HOLYPISS A FILM :O
theres no judging it
I searched my name and i got 14,900,000 results

Art is expression of the soul.

What I've seen of Rifftrax leaves me generally unimpressed. These are the guys who riffed truely bad movies that honestly deserved to be riffed. Now they're riffing movies that aren't quite as bad. And I feel like they're just coming across as jerks for it.
i swear to god that guy looks like john cena *Troll Face*

You have a dislike of the establishment's treatment of art, thus you are projecting it on the the current works in vouge.

Art, does not equal your aesthetic opinion.
I smell a kick
I usually fall asleep around 6 A.M.
BaconLurker: it's more likely than you think
OMG Ok...
YOU'VE WOKEN BACON
Ironically, the art movement that was supposed to make no sense made more sense than some of the art that is supposed to make sense.
^
There is a limit to what can be called art.
you need to make a gui in visual basic
13he hates trains
Wait... are you kidding me Shizuka BaconLurker ?
inb4 mods go nuts
That limit is enforced by the rarest of things. Common sense.

Dont judge me for being 11. Were mainly all male people that like a show that was made for little girls. what is there to judge about :3

Photography as a medium should be treated the same as the brush and the marble.

13you know
13that thing
Yay...
0,5Shizuka: SO did I ;____;
13needs more railings
shizu is best
In my opinion, yes.
11,01Why is there coke covering the ground?
/me opens up a can of Brisk
Jesus now we're into "what is art".
Vordox: So whats it to you :D
WAY more railings.
Baby don't hurt me.
Is it only art if it's real, or imgened?
This movie needs more Parkour and Ponies.
Nittany_Discord: Das a lot of coke
I can't talk anymore
:P
13like a hundred more railings before that thing is safe
11,01Is this a junkie dream?
rockytoppie85: Nothing, I'm just happy your parents aren't covering you from the world. :P
Drop, you'll be fine
LIIIIEEEEES
That thing isn't remotely secure enough.
sarsaparilla is a root beer. who woulda guessed
05,15Because Charile Sheen was there
where was gondor when you needed more railings
you'd think they would maintain a fire escape or whatever that is
Art is interpretation of soul.
Winning?
CriticKitten, no kill like overkill
and structural reinforcement
Long story short, I've written essays on the topic, let's not get into it =.=
Shizuka: more like 200

He's Spiderman.
My computer is a dinosaur
13if i remember the commentary right, that scene was all matt damon
Dat landing
I have never written anything longer than 2 pages. Deal w/ it.
Anyway, I think the conclusion I came to was that art is an attempt at communication.
SLOW DOWN THE CAHT I CANT KEEP UP
I use XP. :P
13with safety nets obviously but i think he did his own stunts for that
otakon: eh?
ponibas: i'm now imagining a computer with wires going to a few hundred gerbil wheels
well, it as either geerbils or carrier pigeon
05,15Longest thing I ever wrote was 12 pages
damn skippy
Meanwhile: gerbil powered internet and all that
0,1410 or so pages
what the buck is this?
nah, he can't afford gerbils. Probably mice
if somone mean comes on, ill just leave.
0,14footnotes saved the day
Mostly because I felt like including music, dance, theatre, and writing in my definition.
11,01I wrote a 50-page thesis.
ponibas: carrier pigeon is extinct
rockytoppie85: Look at the world, create your opinion, be a thinker, don't look away from stuff unless you wish, create the world how you want
easy enough... right?

Okay...just stop talking about my age and awtch the movie.
13but i like money :<
Wait, why are we having an essay-size competition?
they end up married
Idiocracy!@
11,01Rough draft was 80 pages. A lot of it was thrown out.
Now kiss!
Shizuka: Dem rules are guidelines, but not to be followed unless shown other circumstances, no?
SaxyPretender: Yep, she was in that movie
xD
I like money
ive seen 11 year olds cussing and stuff. im like. wth
Money solves all problems

what comes on next?
So is that what doctorate students do when they're not getting laid?
don't bet on that
/me is anything but

Vordox, it's the responsibility of parents to protect their children from harm. And that does include corrupting influences. And there ARE corrupting influences in this IRC and on the stream. The ponies are fine. Certain fanworks, maybe not so much. There are M-Rated games streamed on here sometimes, as well.
11,01So, yeah, I have to throw thesis size around.
SirGanjalf: He was talking about the "Die tasche" and 100k marks reference specifically though. :P
lunac: you get the point, i havent.
Anybody here read cupcakes>
What people will do for jsut one person.
Which borne is this?
Well, if it's 50 pages it might hurt a bit.
C'mon guys, type on those 1990's keyboards!

Sumi: Probably just high traffic

Kandarihu: Innocense is created by influences.
Pfft, I can't throw either around.
Kandarihu: Innocence is overrated
00,10no it like loads to my page instead
And 50 pages could qualify as a blunt weapon.
Has anybody else here read cupcakes?
They're sending Mister Bean after him?

Not created from lies and deiceit.
Sumica: hmm I'm still downloading Magicka myself
You're have the same problem too?
Iron_Waffle: no and don't plan to
Sumica: try http://store.steampowered.com ?
Iron_Waffle: We don't talk about that round these here parts.
Iron_Waffle: We don't discuss Cupcakes here
I watch streams of people playing things like Amnesia and other things.... stop worrying about me and watch the movie
0,14not about the size of the thesis
Iron_waffle: DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT
0,14it's all about the content
But the answer is yes
lol
13Sumica: try going to your games list on your profile and follow one to store page, that should reset it
The Shining?

rockytoppie85, I hope I haven't scared you off.
05,15I go to a community college even though I was accepted to several good schools. Why? Because I didn't want to leave home yet. Now that's sad.

00,10what game dari?
I have SERIOUS issues with "Corruption" bullcrap that every parent(Good or bad) takes up
Shadowrun was announced and hyped at Comic con and that game ended up being crap.
-_:
"Dear Esther"
11,01I consider mine crap.
Meanwhile: No, size doesn't matter. It's how long it lasts. Ask Twilight. As long as the book has a good plot, she doesn't care about its length.
13um he does obviously

I honestly don't listen to music.

Irone_Waffle: GTFO

Fuck it, we'll do it live!
No, all our minds are in the gutter.
Twilight_Spark: Nice Touhou Reference
SaxyPretender: isnt that where everyones mind is?
You find a lot of toonies there.
Tovler: I still see a decent amount of people playing Shadowrun when I boot it up
Fun fact: The average monopoly set has $20,300 dollars in it.
00,10was that the thing that was playing last night?
Ahh, meh. I was thinking it was some kind of puzzle game.
Shizuka: Yet it won awards?
11,01My mind is always in the gutter.
dr-whooves: no u
Thanks!
13the guy pulled a lot of tricks out of source to do it, but it's otherwise wholesale lifted from like a 2007 mod
00,10the guy that would not shut up
11,01I wrote my thesis with a gutter mind.

Chat is in the gutter.
Iron_Waffle: NO U

dr-whooves DDDAATAIGHIAFANGASFOIN

Actually, I think chat fell out of the gutter and into the sewage system.
Vordox: Lots of games win awards. >_>
When Ii was in Preschool we used monopoly money as a type of currency.
13elf elf baby
lol
CriticKitten: Yeah but awards doesn't say it's great.
ZOOM AND ENHANCE! *derp*
0,14I no clean that
Where is this enhance feature that all computers have in movies?
Man, this whole drama over Rockie totally distracted me from the movie.
Why doesn't my computer have it?
13actually fun fact, we're getting close to enhance mode
ZOOM AND INPANTS
brb
Vordox: There are so many awards nowadays they're starting to become meaningless. There's like ten different "Game of the Year" ones.
those crts look old now
05,15Barbetos, you have to delete system 32 to use it.
^This
CriticKitten: INdeed. It's a Hype machine
/me 11,01goes deep
13there was a paper released recently taking like a 100x100 image and blowing it up to 500x500 with sharp detail

How is that even possible?

CriticKitten: Still, I say my own awards. :P

Wait. I saw Dear Esther mentioned. Who's played that?
I remember when Win98 was high tech.
Mah first PC ran win 98
THIS LOOKS SHOPPED
05,15AttacktheAndalite since this was made in like 2004, it's probably XP or 2000
Howdy y'all!
Derpity.
Like Nier = Best new game(Storywise, Music and characters) of 2010
That chick does look like the Run, Lola Run girl.
Fakrosoft

Meanwhile: Because she is
Shizuka: Hoh damn really? That'll be why then.
Kandarihu w00t
05,15inb4 awesomeness
fluttercry: I'm gonna go with 2000 because I've seen XP in Windows Classic mode, it looks different than that, slightly
ahhh, Win95, good times, good times
My first PC had Windows 3.1 and no CD-ROM drive :P
Hi everypony, BTW :P
Hi OtakuTom
my furst pc...
I started out on a PC with Win 2k. It couldn't upgrade to XP because I'd get lag. I ran on that girl until late 2011.
In fact, I got to run a beta of Windows 98. One day, on the turn of the year, it just refused to boot. That's when I had to buy Win98 retail.
Was a... Coleco ADAM

NO
I still have the same PC.

CriticKitten, because it was my only computer. In retrospect, that was pretty dumb of me.

Iron_waffle: DONT SPEAK YOU DONT LKE MUSIC
The shenanigans that would happen with time travel.
0,14pfft

My first OS was Linux
Responsibly, Saxy?
I miss my old printer, with this perferated edges, and its loudness.
i later upgraded to a 386 with that imitation dos, i cant remember what that was called
dr-whooves: NO U
My first computer was in 2000 B.C. It was called Imagination-o-Tron 2000
Windows 95 for me
<you know how old I am?
I HAD A FRICKING TAMAGOTCHI
I liked her better in Run Lola Run
05,15If we were going to invent time travel, we would already know because someone would have come from the future and told us.
0,14...I would use to do decent things
Vordox: I had a Digimon
0,14*use it
I miss the little guy :'(
0,14^
Okay bronystate, I'm gonna explore more of the site.

Shizuka: Kill me

Is anypony here a psychiatrist or in training? I could really use your help...
Vordox: The worst part is knowing that somewhere he's surrounded by poop
13okaaay
I also had a Tamagotchi. It was one of the original models to come in the U.S. The one where the creatures actually died instead of flying off in a UFO or some silliness.
Danke
/me 13axes Vordox <3

SuperBrony64|AFK: how are you typing?
I'd like to learn Japanese
Weeping Angels /are/ fantastic bad guys though.

He owns a little place in Aspen...
Why?
fluttercry: Why, for the drinks? Because that's the only reason anyone I know goes to Quebec.
too many pointless items. Which ones will be chekhov'd?
Vordox: ... Why don't you bend over

The whole concept is horrifying.
They are indeed.

/me gently caresses Vordox's cheek.
Moffat's at his best in stuff like Blink and The Empty CHild.
05,15Reikim for the experience of being there.
AttacktheAndalite, Japanese is one of 3 languages I've always wanted to learn. The other two are Hebrew and Python.
they send you back in time right?
Do you mind iof I shit? lol
I'm glad I got my first computer when I did. It was what really turned me into the nerd I am today. I watched a neighbor of mine install the CD-ROM drive and more RAM, and it sparked my interest in how computers work.

I saw a YTMND about the N64 kid and some guy fighting to the death like this
Bronysith: Dude, you should know this already. Series 1 and 2 are Rose, 3 is Martha, 4 is Donna.

eeyup.
It was sweet
and then Bourne was better

These dudes are very robust.
AttacktheAndalite: Oh glob, read the books. They're amazing, about 90x better than the movies.

Don;t just stand their girl get a knofe or a frying pan and help yopur abducter
05,15Oh you got a knife? I've got a pen
Amy and Roary are some of my favourites.
He has a medical sign on his shirt, so that is one badass medic
Pen mightier then a knife atleast.
RobertRevenge: Do stores like Barnes and Noble have them?
FINISH HIM!
They're very good characters in their own right.
Daaaamn.
LAWL
THE PEN REALLY IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD
11,01He's deadly with that pen.
This is basically a writing technique to escape writer's block. If you can't figure out what to have happen next, have someone bursting through the window (or a door or a wall) with a gun.
it hurts
00,10owwww

that is the point
AttacktheAndalite: They should, it's a pretty well known author.

@Nittany_Discord. :(
because he can only regenerate 12 times right?
I've got no lag
Bronysith: Actually no. They got around the Regeneration issue recently.
00,10you would think with the balls to jump out a window he could at least not flip fail over the railing.
I think he just lagged and went of the ledge by accident.
So if you do, it's probably your internet
That's at the end of...series 6 I think? So I won't spoil.

He's no Tennant, but he's interesting enough to watch.

11,01Too good a Derpy to be shot.
SO?
00,10he killed him self
So you want to know how they got around the regeneration issue?
SO?
Yeah, I don't dislike Matt, and a lot of the recent episodes are cool if a bit convoluted, but Tennant still wins.
FUS_RO_yay Celestia is far too nice to be good.
Sumica: Not according to the police

I enjoyed Eccleston TBH
Hello, can anyone tell me what's playing? ^^'
Oh a Renualt cop car what a challenge to escape

I love this music.
It only goes a maximum of 30 mph Sumica
who in the hell uses a road map anymore!?
05,15He was very good, but being followed by Tennant...that ends badly
So there isn't much braking to be done. :P
OohShiny: The Bourne Identity
oh
Bitish mini vs european cop cars de ja vu
and then THE CHASE!
I loved eccleston.
Petrified_Discord: She's an adventurer
00,10oh so you just put your foot out the door to stop
05,15Same thing is happening to Matt Smith. it's hard to follow Tennant up.
lunac: Yes.
Being positioned anywhere near Tennant is bad for your rankings. This is part of Smith's problem.
SirGanjalf: Ah! :)
seriously, this was one of the BIG draws of the movie
Sumica: Yeah, it's small enuogh just to push along. :P
the car chase

WHEEEEE!!!!
Remake had no Michael Cane.
Therefore had nothing.
I'm getting a serious urge to play Need for Speed
he is a great actor though
Sumica: I like Seth Greeen, he's funny.
Eccleston had too much fun beating up Pete in Heroes.
So: stars, pavment all thats missing is inside a building
That's a turn!
05,15This scene is so awesome
BOOM
TAKE THAT TOYKO DRIFT
I think i wanna play midtown madness 2 again
otakon, GTFO, the remake was so boring it's the only film I've ever wanted to turn off.
That car is going to need a complete overhaul, new suspension, a new paintjob and a change of ownership.
I like Eccleston's last episode. Bad Wolf and all that.
I liek turtlez
11,01This awesome is so scene.
00,10silly euro vans

God is he talking or gargling rocks?
05,15I want to hug the girl that plays Amy Pond <.<
I would like to have Tennant's fashion sense.
^
Eddie Murphy can never be cast in a serious role he;s good enough but it just doesn;t fit
Da cure iz, Nudity
o wait
that voice could crack concrete
Michael Kane is deeeeeeeeeeeeeead
Few men can unironically pull off the pinstripe suit that well.
one of the 4th doctors companions was on an episode with tennant
Would that be Sarah Jane?
05,15Sarah Jane
Eddie Murphy was in Dream Girls and that was serious
Micheal Caine is in TDKR
QUICK CHOP HIS HEAD OFF
act like it never happened!
You would think that they would have shot the corpse to make it look legit
0,14Amy Pond is...
0,14well,
I remember reading that Tennant was VERY excited to do that.
Reikim: whatever the episode with the school and the drugged chips
yeah but no
05,15Michael Caine is a boss
Yes, I rememebr that.
ballistics can be traced
0,14she's Scottish and a redhead and super cute in interviews
11,01Hot.
Mm, good combination, that.

05,15admit it Saxy. You'd hug her
so sorry
...thats a awkward stance
0,14INDEED
not
sweet
AND THEN SOME no I hate myself now
otakon: For appearances, something similar would work fine. I doubt they would have gone far enough to track down a bullet, considering he was supposedly shot out at sea.

SirGanjalf: In Damon's defense though he is clearly TRYING, and he manages to make that face work for his roles. Stewart just has that same dumbass stoner face in everything she does, even when it doesn't fit.

Shizuka: wub? do you clean on a microscopic level?

Can't afford the dlc atm.

Only 33 minutes left
rockytoppie85: probably not, Pony is a rare thing here except on Friday night and Saturday afternoon.
Dog is dead:(
13it was $2 but i dunno now that the sale for it ended
Get to the choppah now!

SirGanjalf: NOES! WHY THE PUPPY!?

THE BASTARD!
Hey rockytoppie85 what element am I?

Kandarihu: what is to your right?
GET TO THE CHOPPA...IN DA BASEMENT! :[

Eh, I might be able to scavenge £3:50 from somewhere.
Well, my computer in an awkward place that it normally isn't.

/me 11,01dusts lunac1
I guess, normally there's a rather clingy kitty cat to my right.
Nittany_Discord: makes sense
Rockytoppie, don't ask for ponies outside of the Friday and Saturday showings. If you do they tend to put the other gens on
WOAH

scootaloo will show us games to play, when she gets her cutie mark

That was just annoyingly distracting!
Celestia: gotcha

Reverse hipster.
Shot his eye out /shot for reference
rockytoppie85: I am the Elelment of Comfort
The item to my right is a coke can
I liked tribes it was fun
just waiting another 31 minutes...
okay!
I am the element of thirst-satisfaction
Flare_Dancer: you are the element of trains
new tribes aint so much
Meanwhile: It's not a gimmick if it's a legitimate improvement of hardware <3
*shovelling coke
Flare_Dancer: Your elemnt is sode.
Dat guy with a gun
i enjoy tf2 so much
RobertRevenge: Gimmick, deal w/ it.
owloysius: trains?
bad idea to go out there
Flare_Dancer: Soda*
I think he is using it as a battle rifle
dat steam sale
Duck Hunt
like a sir
Ok, he's fired two shots, hasn't reloaded
Flare_Dancer Nothing wrong with trains
/me is the Element of Comfort~
Dat Duck.
Lets see what heppens
dat steam sale
0,14...speak of the sale
inb4 that damn dog
Xaiden: he'll have to now
so true
Great, that duck hunt dog is now laughing at me
it is so true
00,10reload off camera
Meanwhile: Not really, graphics capability was greatly improved. It actually competes with PS handhelds now.
No, nothing wrong with trains, but how did he draw that connection?
13t2 was fun
13played that for about six months
Ok, hes reloading, some damn continuity for once
SirGanjalf It;s my anthrax for duck huntin
Awesome, but is it practical? That's the line between a gimmick and an upgrade
RobertRevenge: Gimmick.
11,02otakon: i liek gaming ^-^
13before burning out from adminning
i am currently enjoying new vegas, then ill play morrowind
BAM!
tf2 is ok
Flare_Dancer: coke as in the coal
I need to get a PAnther ^.^
Meanwhile: Whatever, it's your opinion.
How you talk in blue :O
oh

OH GODZ MORROWIND

13i'm falling out of the right mindset for tf2
Dat Shotgun

I do not lie
when I say
Double Tap
ohai Clive Owen
00,10that must hurt like hell
11,01I thought you hated T2 Shizuka?
I have played morrowind to death
13game of the year all years
What ever happened to KwakLad, MahBoi777?
okay so can anyone get my element correct i have my glasses to my right and what would that be rocky said its intellect but thats lazy
sumi, let's try it :p
well i just started it
13Nittany_Discord: was more burning out from managing the kids
well over 10,000 hours
Mahboi I wonder whats for DINNAH
Heck. Even if it's not that awesome, if it makes things better, it's an improvement.
Its dangerous to go alone, here take this
still figuring it out Dumori . it is very good so far
Nice assassin
13though i did always like eliterenegades for tribes 1 more
11,01Arloria hated the tribes kids.
Are they gonna be friends now?
13classic was okay but they always played terrible maps
That would make me laugh
Never played Morrowind. Have long since lost my big TF2 surge.
i have been spoiled by quick travel and the whole arrow to where you gotta go
13bookend line there
Defeat = Friendship
Not for long
Its dangerous to go alone take this! -----:P
We should watch "Children of Men" once
brb
yeah he's dead
MASF123: KwakLad? I haven't seen him in forever
He's dead Jim.
Gave Tribes 2 a whirl, thought it was neat but then I started getting horrible latency and became useless.
Or hes dead\
ded
kind of feel sorry for him though
Friendship is the brief moment before your mortal enemy dies
11,01book hates bronies because of two evangelical bronies at his job.
aaaaaaaaaaand dead
Wow.... that's legit
11,01According to him.
otakon: Richpeople make good guys do bad stuff to become bad
okay that was kind of sad
inb4 hurry the bloody hell up
thought car went boom?
wow
Here... I'm fine.... Ded
not car
alot of people on my friends list are playing half life 2
stop startin
13oh wow
Quick_Thinker: gas tank for natural gas for house heat.
ah
...
it wont stop startin
13Meanwhile: fun fact, i once introduced a friend to tribes 1, he started sniping... from dialup
MahBoi777, he was the 1st person ever to greet me in Bronystate...
There are so many things wrong with the way a real Black Ops soldier would work in this movie...
13like 700 ping
otakon unfortunately for most of us house heat is the only kind we'll know
13and he was getting so many kills
lunac1: lol
also, I'm done downloading Magicka yay!
back
it was a cheapie
Magicka?
Hax.
And now for something completley different
whats Magicka?
11,01Anticipated lag?
X3
MASF123: it sure has been awhile since he's been on, or maybe he changed his name >.>
it's a game
Magic spelt poorly
the doctor started the 2012 olympics
I couldn't even snipe on Tribes 2 with working ping.
is it fun?
PLEASE LET TENNANT DO IT
yes
I love forgiving netcode :P
with wizards, fighting an evil guy
okay.... OHHHH
Pokis dokis a phone
11,01I don't even try sniping.
think it's a parody of others of the genre
13iirc you had to lead targets so him having so much lag was probably making things easier
AT4W Because poor literacy is kewl
WIZARDS AWESOME :D
11,01I suck at aiming.
there isn't really an inventory
brb :3
13not like source where it's compensated clientside
Scheiße
who is this?
13was like a very fast projectile, not hitscan
Bourne Hi are we stil on for saturdauy night?
lol
13code in e?
code in RoR!~~
11,01Code Ni?
13nopony saw it
I get class mood. Can't play anything else if I want to play something specific.
"I don'tknow who you are. But i will find you, and i will kill you."
seriously no pony can get my element figured out?
"He's ONTO US!"
knowledge
Magika is not what i expected. I will check on it later
11,01I just play whatever I think works.
13DED
SHE DED
13pyro exclusive .-.
ded
i killed her yo
11,01But I'll play more classes against bots.
ded.
dead
shit thats cold
d-e-d, DED
rockytoppie85, it's this video game where you're in a party of up to four wizards (all of them player controlled) fighting monsters along the way. But you can pretty much kill each other too. It's less co-op and more troll-op
I'm back went away for a bit :P
On TF2 I try and go for the class no one else is playing as. Or if the scenario'd be useless, the most unused class.
lol.
Is Magicka 75% off again?
yes
maybe
apparently and i have no money
Did he say to tell somone she was a..... fat pickle?
check yes or no?
13i like being able to zip around mostly cause i get tired of walking all the way back to the front after one of my extremely frequent deaths
13but scout is too fast
13go figure
...
OOOOH! You need some aloe for that BURN?
no
13yeah bots are good sniping targets cause they don't worry about you, good practice
11,01Against humans, I'll play heavy or demo.
11,01Something easy for me.
owloysius: Not you :/
My laptop's on battery right now, so I closed out of Steam just to be safe.
If you want to talk him to death you just have to read some Vogon poetry.
Fun facct source's net code can make perjectives bend in flight to get hits if you laggy
Yeah you have to either roll with scout at the start of the round because swapping to him makes you flail at the sudden boost.
not you either
owloysius: Then the red herring! :O
hey guys
11,01Dying to backstabs and headshots is annoying.
Soda popper, sandman and winger
think I should get E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy?
ello everypony :)
for 11 years old i have read the harry potter searies Earagon and... who knows what else.
ellllo
=D
eww
13could be worse... could be shizupyro running up to you, setting you on fire, and taking like six smacks at you with the ax cause you have too much health to die the first time
very convincing ear pieces
So many agents and police
rockytoppie85: have you tried Chronicles of Narnia or The Hobbit?
Barbetos agreed apart form Star Trek Vanguard
lamp posts shine.. not vampires
11,01You have a flame axe.
Shizuka: sharpen the axe sometime
11,01I don't have that.
going to be honest here shizu, you are the scariest pyro I have ever met on that game.
Twilight= Vampiric pixies
11,01I do have a flare gun.
Original narnia? yes. I have ADHD i couldnt get through it. The Hobbit? yes. same.
13i have a really really easy counter.... ping...
11,01I like pyro for hit and run.
lolbuhbye!
i...dont care for pyro
13if my ping is above like 100 i can't do anything, airblasts don't go off when i need them too
I have ADHD its hard to read book like that without getting bored.
it seems everyone can kill me with it, yet i cant lol
11,01Fire, then switch to shotgun to finish them off.
I've been playing TF2 for years and usually, pyros are no trouble at all, they mistime, they aren't looking, or they aren't aiming right. But you are absolute hellspawn.
..
11,01Or try and light them with the flare gun.
eh just do what i do imagine it happen in your room it make all the more fun
Whats with the low amount of comments?
00,10takes only 5 min if you got a can of gassoline
Oh he looks soo normal
like i imagine the harry vs voldemort battle was in my room and it was pretty damn cool
Sumica: But that's not what nerds do
MahBoi777, if that were the case, he would have greeted us and told us he changed his name. :/
proros are fun
11,01Heavy is just easy. Pick the right minigun and get in.
The most fun I ever have as pyro is on dodgeball maps.
Sumica your using ocmmon sense
Bookwise, you're better than me. I've been a visual guy all my life. And my experiences with books are rarely pleasant.
bad Sumica
11,01Use a sandvich if there are no medics.
Everywhere.
MASF123: true true, I'm not sure what happened to him:S
trolling?
smells like a trap
Vinco nerd is not a person its a thing some fool made up
Or Wrek
Dem car alarms
BWEEEWOOP
is this the first one
BWEEEWOOP
Like I said.
MahBoi777, did he...did he...leave the herd? :O
i know
I am a twilight sparkle with books when i want to be. But my rainbowdash ADHD takes over. Then sometimes i want to work on my AJ garden before my dogs ate it.
HAX!
05,15I hate having sensitive teeth. it takes all the fun out of ice cream
he headshots me everytime, even as a spaztastic scout
lol :3
13fluttercry: ikr :<
MASF123: hopefully not
11,01Wrek makes it look easy.
lol ikr
............
THANK GOD THE POWER WENT OUT
Learn your lesson and just play Bourn;es game idiots
now i want ice cream..
Quick_Thinker: I guess so. They are also delicious candy.
yes it's Bourne
you're as good as dead
ponibas that was nonsequitor
"spaztastic"
this is the first one right?
Now i want icecream. brb.
MahBoi777, he come around some day. :$
he came around... euuu
lol
i love this right here
13if the client says "i hit that guy" server is all "yup you hit that guy, HEY GUY YOU ARE DEAD"
so smart
move=dead
o wait i thought this was something else
00,10you raf you ruse
i dont ever think RD was thought to have ADHD she just gets bored easily like me so i use my imgaination to spice life up and damn is it fun
MASF123: *shrugs*
And everyone leaves the stream to go out for ice cream
Hey, he moved!
Did the dogs get sick?
11,01Client doesn't wait to see if the guy was really there?
LAWL
bucking chat crashed
PROPERTY!?
13from the client's point of view the guy was
but i have amnesia
/me 11,01is a weapon
so...... hes a robot
11,01I'm a dusting weapon
/me is property
bnvhbhcftgffgvgfxcfc
13hitscan is all clientside
13projectiles and flames are serverside
hmm
BULLSHIT
UNACCEPTABLE
How could he remember if he doesn't exist?
Wambo
PARDOX
13since they take multiple ticks to move, but hitscan is a single tick, and with VAC in play, servers can trust a client when it says where a hitscan landed
a boat number 13?
6_9
Kandarihu: nobody likes a literalist
eating icecream bar now.
. geeee. or maybe I just have had a craving for ice cream for a long time and don't get it for myself..
Aw....
/me ran out of ice cream earlier today.
/me early waits for Legends of Equestria to come out
aww so sad...
yup
13don't kill eddie murphy!
DONT!
hitscan gets fun
13wait what am i saying SHOOT SHOOT
a government agent with a heart? what is this?
/me hugs Shizuka
But then he had feelings?
double tap!
DONT KILL him!
Whyyyyy.
13rain rain~<3
best yet with barndoor hitscan weapons
/me 13pounces rain rain <3
DONT!
MY FEELS! :'(
too many human shields
they just get weird

suddenly: feels!
lunac1: INdeed
/me cuddles with Shizuka
11,01Damn, I'm so hungry.
hiya Rain
lunac1: hey now
Jspang1, sorry, but I'm kind of like that.
Wt-
13<3
/me hugs Rain "How are you?"
<3
/me 11,01hugs Rain
you can get noregs for no reason ie client and sever side it hits but it doesn't
Kandarihu: its ok i was kidding ;)
And the bullet gave him amnesia, obviously
huh now to spice this up with my imagination i would add dragons :D
Im.. ok I guess, otakon
13yup
finally he catches on to the fact Bourne has memory loss
Damn amnesia-riddled bullets
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Okay
11,01Barndoor hitscan? Like shotguns?
Kill dat boi!
13it's why pyro gets stupid hard at higher ping, flames are particles and are done serverside
SHIT
hes wired
Rain: that seems a bit off but I'll take it at face value. I could be better though, got stung by a wasp(again) and the pool kept draining on me.
oh no D:
13so you end up lagging behind your own flame
Spy sapped my secret agent!
11,01Lol.
/me waves goodbye
CriticKitten: because people get amnesia from bullet wounds in the back, just like you apply aloe vera on the back if you get shot in the foot
ouchie
11,01Set yourself on fire?
very secure door
/me leaves
owls?
It;s Murrie I betyou
bye MASF123!
13happened when phase ran a server, all the lag compensation gets more obvious the worse your ping is
nope
Bye MASF123
inb4 Saw trap
and ded
13melees can still hit but only if you've got the guy pinned
inb4 HOLY SHIT kill
00,03INCEPT- oh wait it's Bourne :/
13since melees are extremely short lived bullets
Pinkie trigger pull
why does he hold it like that?
why you hold it upside down-
shooting while holding the gun upside down
WHOA dat Arab is good :P
hiya Scoot-Scootaloo
11,01Melee is funny in TF2.
damn, tough Arab
lunac1: like a boss
THAT GUY IS BAD
Ah...so THAT'S where Death The Kid learned to hold his guns upside-down :P
OUCHIE
00,03Because he is an MLG LEGITT
Oh yeah, I might or might not be on tomorrow~
hai Scoot-Scootaloo
well he's dead now
13but airblast and detonator and flames are all projectiles so i would click and like half a second later it would remember to puff
Demopan.
11,01I don't really like to melee because it's funny.
AttacktheAndalite: well that sucks
13by then the guy ran away
Is that a combine?
00,03and evening y'all~
fuck yo body
13chkchk
DAT HEADSHOT
Hi Scoot-Scootaloo
wth.
Dat Arab is ded...
11,01Hi Scoot-Scootaloo
dat fall.
woah
and the universe is calling bullshit
WUT
thats right run up the stairs to an enemy who has the drop on you... literally
00,10I am calling zomby bulshit
that ragdoll
That is some amazingly awesome bullshit
LOL
13so that happened
Another Hollywood staple cartoon physics
Yeah, flame aim is tragic when it misses at near point blank range.
Sumica: MYTHBUSTERS!
that sucks, otakon
lawl Jspang1
Lol.
otakon: Internet's getting cut off either tomorrow or day after. I hope it's the day after and if I can come up with 50 bucks, we can get it cut back on till we can pay the late fee
Rain: yh your telling me.
11,01I'm not sure of the "range" of melee weapons in TF2.
Gota love movie phisics
Ohey Rain.
"I'm awake! I'm awake! What happened?"
what physics?
11,01Like if it's a foot out or if you have to be right next to them for them to hit.
Staircase later used used in Blade:The Series
13it's about what you would expect iirc, the range of your weapon outstretched or so
Ohai Rain
and thats how that guy got amnesia. again.
((FFFFFFFF- chat broke, gimme a second))
shtte...
13but best results are when you're right there obviously
AttacktheAndalite: damn that really sucks man, try your public library or a Denny's with a labtop then if you don't want to miss the movie stream tomorrow. Good luck with that.
The range of melee weapons is melee range :3
13since it's really bullets
Yeah until you take a magic 12 foot fist to the spine.
welp, he's dead.
So creepy french is left PLEASE KILL HIUM
i never got wy this guy died, why did he have him killed?
NO
13spies is where it gets dumb cause a facestab is all lag compensation
NOT MARK WAHLENBERG
NO
team killer!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jspang1: to cover it up
what is the difference between all the channels? like pinkiepie, rainbowdash, etc,
otakon: I'm gonna miss the movie stream anyways because I have school tomorrow night. But my school has Wi-Fi
YOU TEAMKILLING COCKBITE!
DAYUM
13WHACK WHACK is not what a silencer sounds like...
Uh...k?
YOU TEAM-KILLING FUCKTARD
Jspang1: Because he mailed his fission
You have to go to school!?
melee in source is fun
ITS SUMMER D:
11,01He's ded.
05,15Silenced guns are about as loud as a jackhammer
AttacktheAndalite: night school?
you've always had long X
otakon: its fucktard... get the reference right
13that and the spy's backstab range is like a full 180 degrees on your back
He's dead, Jim!
So the higher up actually cleaned up the mess. lol
Dang team killer
otakon: Unfortunately, I can't connect to #bronystate on mIRC because...school Internet. But I can get on PonyChat
Jspang1: no it's cockbite
I rember dystopia with ping
Rockytoppie during the episode streams there are so many users they open up the other rooms because of all the users here
rockytoppie85: it only makes a difference when there's a big event. it's not split right now. At least that's how I understand it
Turning off the lights and monitors is how you get rid of computer right!?
otakon: Yep. 6pm to 10:30pm
you could get lagkilled by closing doors
NINE MINUTES
Jspang1: you get it right, cockbite=roosterteeth
run though door it closes after your you die
...............
Jspang1: I've watched the old eps many times
New episode streams that is
FUCKING LIES
gmae?
BUCKING FUCKING LIES
oh k
More often than not backstabs are alright, it's when you get lag clipping that stupid occurs.
13okay.. this... is FORESHADOWING
tbh most face stabs
so easily glossed over
Church
otakon: au contraie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08xYvO4iI_Y
