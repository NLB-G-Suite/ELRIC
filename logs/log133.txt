Fluttershy =/= PI
Gotta love the Weapon chief!
I tried that stare on my cat, my nose got torn afterwords
The CMC remind me of Donald Duck's nephews.

5x Lyra!
I love the dubstep version!
Riff = epic
i need a live stream and i need it nao
bad 1980's music
I would say so?
scenes like this are hard to watch
Derpy does not approve
karate
DOCTOR WHOOVES
SUN!!
i love this
I like it ^^
the 1980's where a hell of a drug
I feel very, very sorry for Ingram for having to make this song worse than it was originally
EUrobeat version is the best
the dub step one is the original one in my headcannon
I like the chorus lines
Celestia will banish them for they're paper sund
i
Am I really the only one who loves Scootaloo's singing?
this is just a lame remix
dem moves
eurobeat version is amazing
IM IN THE BACK P;LAYING THE GUITAR
one day pony ill be muffinproof
I hope they get their Cutie Marks in S2. I can't stand this.
was just gonna say about the eurobeat
Yeah, he actually had to make it even worse after his first try
they'll never get their cutie marks
fog machine
solo 2
SOLO 2
I like the 8-bit version
I feel sorry for the poor singer for having to forever more hear herself singing so poorly
I think I might as well mute the feed and put on Ballad of Autumn Dreams.
Ghostie: nope, i like it too :D sounds like MY singing...
Ghostie there's a version of this on youtube with the music removed so you only get her singing
Better then Lady gaga videos, eh?
way better
Blue2: zing!
at least its not rebecca black
Hahaha
I dunno what's worse
the fact that scootaloo's singing blows
Fan creates a windstorm
So True
or that she sings better than me
wat
oh god, rebecca black noooooo
ENDING SOLO
song remix on youtube makes this song kick ass
Fuck Scootaloo
ded
crash
crash!
duflam
they died the end
The only way to rectify the situation is the release the good version of the song.
Does anypony else find it funny that they say who they are, and then say that they are on a quest to find out who they are?
what a hit!
Rebecca Black's cutie mark is an autotuner.
rebbeca black and justin bieber cant compare to the awesomness of this song
Normally i don't chat with bronies, but when i do it i chat in Bronystate.
AND THEN THEY DIED. THE END.

rainbow dash always dresses in style. :(
what would the cutie mark of someone whose special talent is cutie mark crusading even look like?
the vg cats comic is my headcanon for this
Apparently, the crackheads at Hasbro also made a good version, but stuck with the bad one.
I'm a huge metal fan

I'd buy a soundtrack in 10 seconds flat if they released one

Does this mean you young guys are more mature for your age, or us old guys are immature for ours?
I am Rarity
correct
im 12 centuries old and what is this?
mylittle brother is the youngest here though
Amazing how a show about candy colored ponies can get so much attention from teenagers, despite all the stereotyping in society today. :P
soooo many blankflank fillies
/me glomps MASTERLINKX

I love the diamond dogs.
I'm a pony and this amuses me.
screw sleep its 10:00 am in UK
its saturday, the young ones especially have no need for sleep
MASTERLINKX IS HERE?
I really hate the Diamond Dogs in this episode
we are in the presence of a god
But like how Rarity is the star
:þ
probably the most disturbing scene in the show
FINAL SMASH
MAMA's COMING!!
/me glomps MasterLinkX as well
11:18 here in denmark!
diamond dawgs
Flutter dont let them know your here
SOOO BORD MUST GET TO THE TRMINATOR!!!

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOO
/me holds a sign labeled: Scream.
Spike is Darth Vader.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Masterlinkx, everyone reacts to you like Fashion-Fluttershy :D
NOOOOOOOOOOO
...And that's the story of Spike became Darth Vader.
Rarity
Everypony is the best pony
stream hiccup.
Te flashback is the best part.
Wat
alkisdhjliahihSAVE HER!!!
somebody needs to remix that scene with Captain Kirk screaming "KHAAAAAAAN"
^
rainbowbrony rarity
@rainbowbrony Rainbow Dash
just saying
3 hours, 40 mins yall
duh
y'all are silly ponies is why
Everypony is best pony, but some ponies are more best pony than others
Rainbow, absolutely.
rainbowdash is the best pony.
Twilight pony is best pony
9of course
When does episode 1 show?
Twilight is the best
Rarity is best pony...at least for this ep
Dashie is best
9we're the silliest ponies
9am EST
Kirk, Vader, Spike, Zero, all screaming out. anyone else to add to the list?
rainbow dash is over rated
can't wait for AAppleloosA
I'm kind of torn between RD and Fluttershy.
besides silver spoon and tiara bitch mc bitch
rainbow dash is best pony
rainbow dash only cares about being cool most of the time
they can go die for all i care
All of the above
Who's a silly pony?
hey look
MAKEOVERS
Mud is best pony
but fluttershy is cutest pony
Nostalgia Critic Says Twilight is the best
9till next episode > http://ponycountdown.com/
@Frostys_Den, Luke Skywalker,
I like pinky pie myself :3
Rainbow is best pony.
What's the EST time right now?
That must be Camp Green Lake they are at.
once me and some of my freinds were playing a gmod rp server and we all changed our names to the mane cast
he just says she's better than RBD
DSNesmith: heh. and that's when i realized that 2 ponies + 2 ponies = 5 ponies
Rainbow dash is for sure the greatest; but not of much use if the situation doesn't call for running fast or flying.
I'm sure NC knows rarity is best pony
All of them, but if I had to choose only one... TD
dem mode
Hmmm
it's 5:19am EST
5:19Am EST
*mud
Is there a way to watch the OwnCast stream in lower quality?
Twilight>FLuttershy>Rainbow>Pinkie>Applejack>Rarity
2:19 am PST
UStream cuts it with ads
imported mud
dat BGM
MAKE IT STOP
And OwnCast is lagging
Okey dokey lokey.

dat dirt
FILTHY DISGUSTING DIRT!!!
Poor Rarity!
DIRT

7.20PM
casper so true
oh no look at her hair
I'll kill you Dirt!
horrifying
DART DART MAKE IT STOP
NOT THE DIRT!! ITS IN MY I'S
Did everypony see John Cena whining like Rarity?
they all have the same vision of rarity
6:19PM Japan:D
dirt stings and burns
was wondering who TD was XD
time for whack a pony
Twilight > Fluttershy > Pinkie Pie > Rarity > Rainbow > Appajack
twilightdash sounds good to me :|
Hey i'm a dwarf and i'm digging a hole, diggy diggy hole!
9and then Cena was a brony?
Japan? way to got bronie! xD
I like that Rarity sounds particularly like Audrey Hepburn in that sequence
twidash is best ship
Sup fillies and gentlecolts!
YOU SHALL ALL BURN FOR YOUR HERESY
lol krokben
courtyarddroll you dont like rainbow much Heresy
So Rarity has mysophobia, then?
Are ponies known at all in Japan?
dashfire is best ship
TwiLuna is best ship!
G'day, Omagma.
Omagma: and a good evening to you too, fellow brony!
<3 Twilight Sparkle
:D
Not so much yet Nyst
I know transformers are/were pretty popular in Japan for a while, but I never heard of MLP working over there.
Hello,eh
HMS Thunder Child is best ship.
But also <3 Rarity
group hallucinations, they're all drugged out or something.

Spike used Spike Install and became manly
You will know when it catches on when niconico starts cranking out vids.
This is so ridiculous it's hilarious
Rainbow > Fluttershy > Pinkie > Twilight > AJ > Rarity
this scene is delicious
the whistle
It started around Nov 2010
I turn gay for spike in this scene
05you dissapoint me flutterwhat.
9GO! GEM ROMANCER!!
SPIKE HAS THE POOOOOWEEEEER
seriously, all I hear is johnny bravo right now
Apparently Spike lacked the soul for getting down.
If we can use equal signs, then Pinkie Pie = Fluttershy and AJ = Rainbow
9>Spike Install
why would an adult dragon need a lance??
Did you seriously just put Rarity at the end
THIS IS AWESOME
MLP FOR MEN! MANLY MEN!
Cur used to be a swearword
Spike has a steel codpiece.
I HAVE THE POWER!!
Are you shitting me?!
9SPIKE SPIKE SPIKE SPIKE
Frostys_Den: Me too XD
9SPIKE-U DAMASHII
SPIKE used FLAMETHROWER!

spike's looking forward to being able to breath fire
9I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER THE LYRICS TO THE BANG INSTALL SONG NO KOKORO NIIIIII
Shouldn't Spike really turn into a full grown dragon?
Kiss the Poni
It super effected
Spike leveled up twilight to level 32
LOOKS LIKE SPIKE HIT PUBERTY
this is yucky
whats this
suddenly, a princes dress
ohh yea
twilight is evolving
Awwwww...Oh
SpikexApplejack
If I had to order the mane cast... Rainbow > Fluttershy > Twilight > Applejack > Pinkie Pie (I don't like random humor, sorry) > Rarity

WHOAH THERE LOVER BOI
I like how AJ is totally cool with his little fantasy :)

So much cliffhangers in this episode
I don't understand this logic
Twilight can copy? HERETIC!
Figured the lack of watermarks was a dead give away Thunder_Dash
sharingan
Twilight Uchiha
Twilight just took over Rarity's special talent
How could Spike see the gems?
ride like the wind!
Rarity has nothing to live for now :/
Twilight's talent is cribbin everyone's notes
superbrony64, haha
PLEASE LET ME GO
dogs now have llittle pony
Of Course!
Sumica; I tend not to pay attention to watermarks in general, so I didn't even notice that actually. XD
FOREVER1

9also
All the gems? :(
9BronyState Watermark is best Watermark
inferior unicorns will be delegated to menial earth pony duty.
Faulty logic there; you actually want to take the tunnel with the -least- gems, As they would have mined them all as Rarity found them.
TAKE ALL THE GEMS!
what is that instrument in rarity's BGM called? harpsichord?
dig.

Moral of the Story: Apple Pie is best Pie.
pie's are awesome!
When you think about it, there's more to it. They planted the apples there because it was the only flat land around; but the land is probably that way because of the decades of stampeding from the buffaloes.
...so they're stampeding THROUGH the orchard? ALIENS!
:')

why does fluttershy have one of the dresses that pinkypie and twilight wore to the gala
either she's looking after them
Angel can't be a watch because Angel is satan.

I might close chat during season 2, just to make sure there is no chance of any stream lag...is it worth it? or is sharing the experience with bronies more important?
Why is the chat so far away from the video? :(

NO
what am I saying
Pinkie made me say birtday
my like, 27 year old big brother got me into this, not even joking
This episode is in a class of its own really, its great because it adds a depth to Pinkie Pie's character that we never saw before, and it also opens up speculation to who Pinkie Pie might've been before she met all her friends, and as to why she is so afraid of losing them (perhaps she was regarded as nothing but an abnoxious pony in whole of Ponyville befor
dat dance
haaha spike wasn't invited
It seems like this is everyone favourite episode
great, now I'm watching guile's theme and random video

I didn't think rainbowdash was interested in diamonds
We've been dreaming, we've been waiting, to watch these grat ponies.

0now rainbow dash
Been dreaming, I've been waiting, to fly with those brave ponies. The Wonderbolts, their daring tricks, spinning 'round and having kicks. Perform for crowds of thousands, they'll shower us with diamonds! The Wonderbolts will see me right here at the Gala! (All we've longed for, all we've dreamed, our happy ever after, finally will all come true
right here at the Grand Gala, at the Gala!)
Got on time.

Hi there. Does anyone know how to get the bronystate chat on a separate client? I tried mIRC but I couldn't figure out how to do it
Haxan is a good example of an origin for the found footage style
9Hey! Not too many caps!
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The reason the ponies feel so out of place at The Gala is because they're all working class ponies (or anti-social, in TWilight's case), and the Gala is a high-class society gathering. Each pony's idea of how the gala would be is based on their personality as well. Applejack sees it being one big State Fair, Pinkie sees it as a huge party
11And Dash sees it as a big performance. Only Rarity and Twilight foresaw the setting for the Gala, and in both case, their failure for a dream come true is due to other ponies rather than their misconceptions.
HEY
I'm good. APPLE PIE! MIXXY! There's your pie!

Out of all the guro art that comes with MLP, the only piece I ever liked was one with Blueblood's throat slit, and his blood was actually blue. xD
1000 people?
BLANK FLANKS
Rainbow has the best part of the song.
I'm pretty sure these videos are being streamed separate from The Hub.
So if you went on The Hub right now, it'd be some show we don't care about.

think about it; she not only did the "impossible" [sonic rainboom] but she saved 3 wonderbolts, and Rarity, while breaking the sound barrier all at the same time.
but realized later, if she became a wonderbolt, she'd have to leave all her friends in ponyville. possible [pinky pie] ForEVer!
I am on a seperate chat window, the lag is THAT BAD
