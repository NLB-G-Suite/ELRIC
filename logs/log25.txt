I've learnt to
my TV tuner card is not supported
because Video4Linux is an immature and stalled project
I am really pleased with the BGM too
V4L is really crap.
0oh hai spring

Only when she wants me to do something and I say no.
Both of you need to understand each other more
Yeah, a dictator parent >>
Somewhat like my mum as well
Both of them are.
families with parents like that are never healthy
It's just "because I said so."
And no my family is not at all healthy.
6I don't really understand dictatorship parents
6cuz I'm compliant with whatever my parents say
6I never talk back
I pretty much despise my sister
But still
fail?
Seems like my parents
hi
hi
why fail NS?
And she's a hypocryte, according to my reacent understandings.
u talking about my name? if u are, i know i typed it that way :P
let us make a few mistakes, else we never learn
She agreed to her friend Nancy about how kids shouldn't respect their parents because they're parents.
"RESPECT ME."
F*** no.
A bit like my mum
She's a bit of hypocrite at times
XD
Oh and this is rich
To the playroom

He was... violent
She says "BS."

My parents are seperated
I wish I was seperated from my parents.
Two more years...
He's not violent now, but he has... hygiene issues.
Too more freaking years...
Ew
Yeah
I have learnt to deal with it mostly
And keep it clean
It's really bad when you are a clean freak like me
But ugh
Like
Lol boyfriends
Lol parentds
*parents
I want to leave with something GOOD to look back at
Hiya!
Even if it was just one or two good years.
But nothing can be simple. -_-
I go against everything my parents say that I don't agree with ;p
Life's like that
sigh
if it doesn't fix something, then i'm not going to let it happen

i still go for Asus
03so it's hard to find them
:3
just be glad it wan't an apple product
03I have no problem with Asus
agreed
03Damos, if it was, I would break it intentionally
03:P
I agree
13Scar defeated!
03MSI is my favorite

...........................................
4What about you Dari or Cynder?
No I'm not getting it.
4I think it might
4I just wish they had more Characters
6Basically I kinda feel it will..Despite the evilness of the design..
...........................................
4They need over 9000
...........1....................0............
6Don't they have like 32 or something? o.o
4Yea but i think it might but fun
4Yea
...........1,0....................0,1............
...........1,0....................0,0............
4but Everything over 9000 pawns
hur
6Don't you have to buy half of the characters?
4I'm not sure
13Just finished Twilight Town
4i think you get like 5 and they sell the rest
13I'm going for all 32!
6I'm pretty sure I read something like that somewhere..
13It said you get three
4I heard somewhere they where going to be like 10$ us a pop
1....0.....2...3....4....5...6...7...
12What if I wet mine when I take a bath with it?
4Icy ....
I don't get why you'd want extra characters that are essentially irrelevent to gameplay, if they're free maybe, but to pay for them?
6Then you can hold a funeral for it.
4Dari it's like DLC
6Indeed..
6DLC?
DLC usually adds something to gameplay.
4I figure they might be 2 to 4 $ a pop
Not always, but the worthwhile ones do.
6Shame the site doesn't have much to see..
6:O
4Maybe

4It's not like they could have kept going
4It would have gone ot the ps2 sooner or latter
4then GC xbox GBA
Spyro 1 and 2 were the best.
4It's just you
I would've like more like them.
6Yeah but they could've continued with something similar to the trilogy for PS2 and then on..
12prince-dari: agreed
4Consoles move on
13Right
4We can't have the ps for ever
4Yea that
4Yes
4But they don't stick with the same person
12Anyone here know if the playstation store is up?
4I think it is
12I'm too lazy to go get my ps3 right now
13I'd check, but my PSP does not have interent
4I'd check but mine died
13Yes, I did
4No getting games
6Wow..I see everyone's PS-objects are in great shape.. o.o

Mine's fine.
13I've only got three PSP games
6Whatever.. :P

I probably won't be able to make the next few movie nights as I have exams pretty much non-stop for the next couple of weeks, and I'll be on holiday for a week after that.
I can probably leave the computer on though.

but dang I'm sick of doing this college work now

6But I must say, you know you're doing something right when you start getting haters. Just means we're getting somewhere.
no I need that to earn a degree D:
6Exactly. Like I told him. I have no issue if he's trying to be constructive, but at this point he's just bitching about it every week.
/me goes on DW
13I haven't been on this in ages
4To be fair, I do feel like Darken may have been influenced by the rest of us though.
13and wow, after I got 1 dream pal I've suddenly had a lot of visitors
02o-o
4I don't think we should go that far. Though, I humorously suggested that we slap a "EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT TASTES" text on the rules
Lol, suddenly ferris wheels everywhere.
4Still, I'm gonna stop influencing people to pick something. I feel kinda like shit for pushing Darken to pick something else
6Oo Dari
4The chatroom notices us
Hey. :P
13o-o
4Yeah, that may work. I have no qualms about that
6But getting everypony to stop may be difficult the first few times around.
4In fact
4Why DON'T we just switch over to that?
6Because it could make us seem biased during picking.
Why?
4Bleh, there's no catchall fix here
6But they shouldn't be in the first place.
6But my mane problem with it is it may make the picking seem biased, causing more of an uproar.
6It makes little difference, I just don't want the bias argument later on.
4Yeah
Stream the random pick live. :P
4We'd have no way to disprove it
6True...
4He's the streamer, and it's hard enough to get him in here for mod meetings
/me sits on the floof
4Exactly
4We need to get all the mods together for a proper discussion
6We do.

She'll be back tuesday night

Yeah?
Well, I sorta own it *cough*
02LoL
4Alright, done
4Either we gather tonight or tomorrow evening
6Yep.
I'll be busy the whole of the next few weeks. :/
4Fuck, I forgot to put dari's name in the post *facepalm*
4Oh well, he's always here
6I noticed that.
Haha, that's cool.
It looks really awesome.
6Was like... eh, he'll be here anyway.
4Hah, yeah
4Dari, do you think you can be here tonight and Monday?
I need to go in the next half hour to get some sleep, and I have exams the whole of the next two weeks.
4FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU but you're like one of the smartest mods we have
4(no offense to any other mods)
6...I'm the only other mod reading this.
6>>;
4Nah, I was including the other mods too
6I know.
Pff, I'd hardly say that. :P You flatterer. XD
4In the next 24 hours
6nope.avi
That's not very helpful. :P You're going to have to be more specific.

4Specific?

4Oh, haha

02urgh, such a busy weekend. ;_; I didn't even play MH that much

6So add 5 hours, get GMT.
If it's in a couple hours I doubt I can make it (unless the beeping from you guys highlighting me wakes me up :P), otherwise tomorrow maybe, if it's not longer than an hour, and it's after my exams.
4Shit, it's 11:30 over in the UK

I'm impressed by how much some people manage to get the time of the stream wrong by.

8ok, how do you do that?

8me gusta
4*claps* good job
4Alright
11oh hey, I understood that spanish word.
11I failed spanish in high school.
4We need to discuss the movies. Talk about how they are being picked
I was going to take Spanish - ended up doing Economics instead.
Fun, fun fun.
11Oh yeah.
4Since Turni has brought it to our attention -so-many-times-, I think it would be a good idea to discuss how movies get picked
11So far, all the movies we watched fit the peramiters of the (albiet lenient) guidlines we set.
8my reaction to it: http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b197/FinalValkyrie/Pinkie_Pie_haters_gonna_hate.gif
4Sprinkles and I talked about that earlier
4Once someone is picked and said they are there, no one should be allowed to post or, at the very least, not try to influence
8the problem with that is when we get duplicates
/me flails about
I don't see why that matters.
Magikarp much/
11Prince-Dari: But then it can seem like we're being biased when we choose the movie selection.
4The other problem with that is that people may think the mods are just choosing whatever they want from whatever was put in the posts
/me blinks
I thought people thought it was biased anyway?
11choose the person posting, I mean.
4Only Turni REALLY thinks it's biased
8hmmm
4He's the streamer, after all
4He being turni
6But while we're on it we may as well figure out the best course of action for the future.
8ok
8i like the idea of doing the selection during movie night
4Turni just wants to see different films get picked and I am thankful that he is standing up for difference of opinion. However, I absolutely agree that he's just being bitch about everything mostly
6Honestly we could eliminate the thread entirely.
6We could use the sidelist during the movie night.
8I'm trying to think of logistics of how to do it
11Logistics.
XD
8doing the selection during movie night
6We could set it to mute, and give the chosen person voice.
4...
4Well
4Wait
8we could put it up before movie night, tell people during pre-show announcements that its up
Or you could let them give a movie choice when they submit their entrance to the 'raffle'.
8and do the drawing after
8mute the channel
o_O
8yes
6Yes.
4Oh, well
4There's the solution for that I guess.
hello
hi
6True, dari.
You can't be pressured into a choice you've already made.
8it's just another thing I would rather not deal with, dari
8people asking if this or that movie is acceptable
8incomplete entries
6Who knows how to give voice?
6So I can demonstrate.
8whereas right now i just log the names into a word file and paste them into a list randomizer
6Somepony give the other me voice
11I can't read the whole name.
11there we go.
Tada
11and chanserve help saves the day...for me.
6And there you have it.
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHkiyuqsfIc <-- This is epic.
6The channel is muted.
4Ohhhhhh
4I see
4Alright, well, at least that problem is solved
11And voice is gone.
6Once they select, we remove voice, and go on.
:O
11When on mute, only Voiced people and Mods can speak.
8ok, another thing to talk about
4But, I still think that we may divide interest if we have the selection thread going at the same time the stream is airing. Oh well, I guess that's a risk we'll just have to take
8I want to set up a listserv for BMN
You can't set up services on a network you aren't running.
11?
8ghosties, it only takes like 5 seconds to enter the selection thread
O_o
8but anyway
8how do we do a listserv?
humm
11What's a listserv?
6Uh... dari?
11oh,like with The Daily /oat/
8yes
09,01O00,01-o
11....I haven't a clue.
4What is the purpose of the listserv?
11Yep. It'll be really useful for regulars, especially when the threads get swamped by /oat/ and /chat/ nonsense.
lolwut
4Very nice. As you said, it'll filter out all the bs
11oh, my bad.
8well that and it would allow us to notify people of the schedule, any changes we make and tell them when the pre-show is starting
09,01o00,01hai 09,01y00,01ou 09,01200,01
derplesurge
8exactly
11....in fact. We could ask ARGH how he does it.
6Though ARGH is supposed to be having issues with writing the daily /oat/ soon.
4Yeah, ARGH is trying to make a team for The Daily /oat/
4True

!colscripton !colscriptoff to turn it on and off, !addmod to add people to the list, and !remmod to take people off it.
11Nice. Thank you, Dari.
11Hipster's going to monitor /chat/ and /oat/ for stories. I'll be collecting from everyone and publishing the thread.
4Awesome guys! I was thinking of asking to join myself but decided against it
11oh. Still, we're part of it, which is cool.
Well gratz on that you two.
8indeed
8herd mind
Got that already. :P
/me 6was in the middle of googling it
11I think that derpy email thing lets you use listerv. It's how ARGH does it.
INB4 all of you.
:P
8and now i have all these pony related things that i do
8BMN, the daily /oat/, etc...
11Ditto. It wasn't until my last two years of school did I really get into anything.
6I had... D&D Club... doesn't really count much.
11I'm a nerd.
4...I was also in the Poetry Club my freshmen year of high school (though I left after the second meeting)
8i literally never joined a single club in high school
8yeah
+aren't
4Fucking awesome man
8i write for an NFL Draft website right now
8unpaid of course :(
4Are you an intern for the NFL?
/me 6hasn't had a job for five months.
8im a journalism minor too
6I'm a bum!
8nah, i wish
8im interning for my school's football program though
/me 11never had a job. unless one counts working concession stand at baseball games and wrestling tournaments.
4:O
6Nope, he's more of a bum than me.
4Sprinkles IS the bum at the cafe
4Oh
6He's the HOMELESS kind of bum.
6I'm the JOBLESS kind of bum.
6I think he actually has a job...
8worked at pizza hut
6I would lose count as to how many jobs I've had.
8was a scene director for a haunted house at Lambeau Field
8worked custodial at the university of wisconsin for a summer
6Am I the only one that would crack up if one of the other mods showed up right now?
I have yet to work being that I am still in secondary school (or highschool for you Americans :P).
6We've already finished the discussion.
4We have?
8i currently call high school students to recruit for the university
8i worked maintenance at a laboratory last summer
4Sorry I wasn't very responsive this meeting. I was distracted quite a bit
11Did you get to play with chemicals?
11Chemicals are fun.
8nah
8it was a terrible job
8so I have had 7 jobs already and i'm only 20
8ah, yeah
Hey, you still have yet to tell my why 20 is the worst age.
4He answered you dari
4I think
When?
4More responsibilities, yeah?
8old enough for responsibilities, not old enough to drink
6not old enough to be taken seriously in the world
4I'm old enough to drink and I don't drink XD
8eh, to each their own
11Age and its pros and cons Depends on where you live.
4How old is everybody?
6 20
11 19
I'm 15.
6We've been over this I think.
Probably.
6HOLY FARKING FARK DARI
8im a little worried about going to bars now though
4 23
8Ohio just passed a law that makes it legal for people to carry loaded weapons into bars
4Damn, I'm the oldest mod here at the moment :/
11good for you. :P
Well, I suppose that makes me the youngest.
11Yeah, it does, Dari.
8yeah dari, i though you were like 17 or something
8i wish i was a kid again
4Dari's a freaking minor minor
6I thought you were 17-18... Oo
8being an adult blows
4Indeed
4Don't ever grow up dari
4Seriously
6*get taken to neverland*
Haha, if I had a choice in it maybe I wouldn't. :P
6*be a kid forever*
6*realize neverland doesn't have ponies*
6:(
4I refuse to touch alcohol or drugs
4or even cigarettes
Cigarettes, meh. Alcohol I see no problem with if it's not to excess.
11I guess I wouldn't mind it just for a hands-on experience (drugs and alchohol, not the cigs), but I know how much of an addictive personality I have.
8cigs are terrible, i cant stand them
6I gave them up.
11Billy Madison?
8i drink fairly frequently, but i dont like beer
6I still drink.
6But not frequently.
11very nice.
6Never go to parties anymore.
6I still smoke, but I never pay for it.
8i would probably do it more often if i had the opportunity
6I've smoked people up enough times that they'll smoke me up every now and then.
I only drink at parties really, sometimes at meals with my parents.
8let me tell you
11I wouldn't mind drinking. It's actually getting drunk that I'd like to avoid.
Hahaha.

6The day before my b-day, too.
6I've stayed up on ponychan for two allnighters straight.
6Never again.
6I was a pony.
Lawl
8it fucks me up too much for work
11They say that Fatigue gives the same effects as getting drunk.
8my brother once was up for 47 hours for school
8he said he was hallucinating rain by the end
6Everything was the wrong color.
6NEVER AGAIN.
I had some weird thing going a couple of weeks ago.
Slept a bit during the day stayed up all night for my exams the next day.
And I didn't forget anything I revised because I didn't go to sleep that night.
Worked out kind of well.
Speaking of which, I should probably get some sleep, need to get up in a bit over 6 hours.
6lulz dari
6 6 hours of sleep
/me 6has insomnia
11I discovered I can go about the day on only 4 hours of sleep.
6 3-4 for me
11any less and I'm screwed.
8see ya dari
6...a month? Jeebus.
11See you around, Dari.
6See ya Dari.

11Random thought, if someone requests a movie we've already watched, we'd just watch it again anyway, right?
8http://archive.no-ip.org/images/co/thumb/0240/64/1299431379567s.jpg
8i would say no
6If it has been deemed being long enough, I don't see why not.
8at least not yey
michelle
8yet*
6Not for a few months.
8i dont want to watch The Room every other week
11So, say, at least a month in between watching said movie?
6I'd say a three month limit.
8i would say even longer, actually
8i want to get people watching more than just the ones we would expect
6Yeah.
11Alright.
8 3 months seems reasonable
8also
http://i55.tinypic.com/fve4i9.jpg
8D
6I've been keeping a list.
8i think eventually we should have a "best of" marathon
11Good. 'cause my memory's shit.
/me 7meeps.
4WHAT
4What about me?
8i like that idea
4Oh yeah
4We should
8it all depends on when DCD's schedule would allow for the best of thing though
11Yeah, that's going to be our little End-Of-Summer special event.
8i would say we should wait quite a while with that

8do you guys know if theres a mid season break in pony episodes, or do they just go straight through?
4I'm not sure
11Was there a break last season?
8i dunno
8i didnt start watching til march
8at any rate
6The only break was the one on April 1.
8if theres a midseason break, we could do the best of then
4How would we pick the best of?
4Mod vote?
8yeah, mod vote
11I'd say Mod vot.
6Def mod vote
11vote*
8superman IV is a shoo-in
6One pick by each mod?
8that was our 1st movie, after all
8well, let's not get ahead of ourselves
11right.
6Well, yeah.
4True
8there's going to be a shitload of movies between now and then
4But I like the idea that each mod picks one film
8and we're gonna have to only pick a few
8i agree with that as well
4Cool
11That's a good idea.
6Look at me and all my good freaking ideas.
11SirSprinkles: there's a difference between a break and a dry season. This is the latter.
6What?
11<SirSprinkles>: The only break was the one on April 1.
11Late response.
8i have been calling it this "The Great Pony Drought of 2011"
Hi
8oops
8this*
haven been on here for a WHILE
4The break inbetween seasons is The Great Pony Drought of 2011. I like it
:/
is that you
04yes
8my thread killing was once again successful, this time, intentional too
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35612214.html
6Already saw it.
11Epic.
4Nice
4Anybody wanna tell me how the Keldeo thread ended?
no?
8i can
8he got banhammered
8again
11Keldeo's permabanned....again....and the thread was deleted.
8claims it wasn't him
11of course.
8probably lying
8lots of drama
6He's made the claim before
11But IP states otherwise, according to RDmod.
4Wow. Seriously, Keldeo
6And if it wasn't him, why would he care?
No you
4Was he not already permabanned?
seriously
6Yep.
6...hahahahaha. No.
4nope.avi
8i mean
8whats the point of a permaban if it isnt permanent
8?
8are you talking about the one where haackula was bitching?
11what was haack bitching about?
4Yeah, and Sweetwater too
4Sweetwater and Haackula were upset that someone had been banned
11ah.
4Both Haack and Sweetwater were shouting INJUSTICE!
4and CORRUPTION!
8generally insulting everyone
8im pretty sure he got banhammered for it eventually
4I loved that Haack was getting sooooooo upset though, it was pricelss
4*priceless
8my favorite post was one by sweetwater though
8it was something to the effect of:
hiya x-o
11....wow.
4I'm not trying to do anything.....but the mods are evil
?
8it was generally a stupid thread
6Yep.
6Where he "gave advice"
a long day lol
8im kind of mad at myself for getting involved
and lol
11Talk about an ego.
8that one
6Somepony said it didn't work for everypony.
4My favorite post was by Haack when he posted the rage face and was like: NO HE WAS *NOT* LYING!!!! You could tell he was clearly upset, it was hilarious
6Instant RAGE
"this time"
3>8pm
>10am
6I think I've been generally upset ONCE in my time on ponychan, and that was today.
8was it turnibrony?
6Yep.
4Ah
4Well
6The post with the listed numbers.
4Turni likes to bitch
4a lot
fuck timezones
11Listed numbers?
8not gonna lie, i was really upset when he talked about paying us off
8i know it was a joke, but still
11I missed this thread.
6It's in the discussion thread.
8he was saying he wanted to pay us off to pick his movies
11Tell him to fuck off.
11I don't play that corruption bullshit.
6Basically did.
6I warned that if he parasprited more on ponychan I'd call a mod on him.
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/216598.html
8nm
11Thanks.
/me 6was on the thread already
6You can clearly tell where I go from being in a good, polite mood, to being pissed.
8silver: dont
8we told him off already, he'll just keep at it if feed him
11I don't mind when people say they won't be their. That's their choice. But if they start downtalking about it just because they don't like the choices, that's when I think something needs to be said.
11Alright.
6It's been handled for now. If he keeps up, he'll get reported. I already told him that.
11there*
8yeah
4Hah
4Oh yeah
11If he ever comes.
6Agreed.
XD
7Hmm...
7LL?
7Your character is primarily a Latias, right? :P
11ah.
/me nods
why do you ask? and hai
4Thing is
4Turni never once really got upset
7Hello, too.
4So I'm not gonna get upset over him either
7And I'm collecting data.
hai
oh
interesting o.o
4But
4There ARE minors on the site, and even though I'm sure just about everyone is desensitized to violence and nudity, I'd rather be professional than stupid
8exactly
4Bingo
4That's awesome
"I've got a person in my closet"
11I saw that post.
6Nope.
6Like I said, takes a good bit to upset me.
/me lols
7By the way, Eeve?
7Eevee*
11I easily get upset if someone tries to go after me on a personal level. Otherwise, I stick with my logical thinking.
7"the unforgettable sense of being" <-- I've heard that in multiple places. Where's it from?
how did bolb
lsda;kjf
i hate you me
7o.O

11YAR!

4I need to read that comic
4I've only seen the beginning
6Suddenly viking pirates.
11That's a comic? o.O
6Yep.
8i thought it was only those 3 or 4 panels
6I'm pretty sure it's a comic.

11Don't. It's a waste of time.
11Too much talking, not enough action.
6I'm sure.
04Espeon
8i enjoyed the 1st one, but i didnt really like the others
6Like she did the other three.
11I am dissapoint.
11The first one was the best. The other two were good in that they kept a decent plot going in each. The fourth one....bleh.
6I'm not surprised in the least.
8damn
8i cannot find a good "secret butt fun" pic anywhere
11SECRET BUTT FUN!
8im disappointed they took it off the air
8also, the last 3 things i typed would be really, really inappropriate out of context
6*keeps refreshing bank page* I'M SUPPOSED TO GET PAID TODAY WHERE IS MY MONEY?

The page refreshed on me again.

04Like the way I kinda combined B/W's graphics with the pre-DS interface, Quan?
04:P
8im still trying to make the flute one of them

11EVIL CAMERAMAN!!!!
8CLIMAX TIME!
6Just a bit.
7Late, Chimy, but I was AFK>
;o
11that was a little annoying.
8agreed
04k
8so we can work it out ahead of time
04so yeah
04Like?
4Perhaps
stare
6Only for REALLY bad movies though.
8yeah
6Don't want to take away from movies that are actually good/funny on their own.
/me glares back
8for sure
;D
04lol glare |3
11yeah. The guile's theme thing was hilarious.
8i was disappointed he didnt play baker street until the post show though
6New BMN meme is.
4>mfw the kid's name is actually Denny
4That annoyed me to like no end when we were watching The Room
4Nope, it was Denny
11I thought I heard an "e" in there.
6OH HAI DOGGY
11lol that scene.
7Pre-DS interface? *late*}
7The font might need to be changed. :P
8right after that part
11How wooden can one's acting be?
4I just like to watch you guys
11I swear, I saw absolutely no emotion from Wiseau through that whole movie.
4It wasn't JUST the acting, the personalities were creepy too
11Hara Kiri.
8i would have lol'd more if it we're "HEADSHOT" from unreal tournament
8were*
11Hara Kiri is the MK term for suicide. :D
11*themoreyouknowstar*
8unnecessary apostrophe
4Actually
4Silver
04Hm?
04And what's wrong with the font?
7I can see this becoming really popular, seeing how well it's done.
04Wow
04Thanks :D
7Well, the 'pokemon' one in particular; it's rather squished.
4*pulls out nerd glasses* Hara Kiri wasn't originally from MK. Hara Kiri was the term that old samurais and shoguns called a honorable suicide in feudal Japan
04Ah
04I made them squished for a reason
11But it's still the term MK uses for the suicide moves.
04so the curser could fit
04It's readable at least, though.
8good lord
8somepony made a gen 1 appreciation thread on /oat/
11...
/me 11gets the napalm
4*wears pocket protector* And Hara Kiri isn't pronounced "hara" but "harry" and Kiri is pronounced "karry"
4Or carry
6WRONG
04and by pre-DS interface, I meant the lack of a bottom screen
4Your rebuttal?
6That's the poor English mistranslation.
7Ah.
6It actually is "Hara Kiri"
04And how, like the GB, GBC, and GBA, the moves' stats are listed on the right, while the selectable moves on the left.
4Not how I've seen it
04Btw like that arrow effect I made?
8Fun fact, Harry Caray was a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs, the most pathetic franchise in baseball
7Arrow? O.o
04K
7Oh, Z?
04yep
7Computer logic tells me to press Enter.
8it's legally required that I hate the Cubs
8but even if it wasn't, I would still hate them
04Game logic says Z
04:P
7Computer logic says Enter. D:
04k
04So, like it?
7And after you press Z, do you have to refresh to reset it?
4I'm not either
6I have nothing against it, I just don't care for it.
04there added
04yes lol
8i like all sports
7An annoyance. :P
/me 11returns from watching all MK: Deception Hara Kiris
8except nascar and golf
8which arent even really sports
11I watch any sport that happens to be on the tv when I turn it on.
6Nascar is not a sport.
04Because again this is not finished.
bbl
6Golf is barely a sport.
11Nascar is a waste of gas.
8i would argue that neither are sports at all
4@Sprinkles: Don't say that around where I'm at >_>
11Golf is a leisure activity.
6I can't say that around where I'M at.
6And I'm in PA
8nascar is just retarded
4People like Nascar in PA?
6Quite a few people, unfortunately.
11Yes, they doe.
11do*
4Wow
8never would have guessed
4And here I thought it was just in the South
6PA is pretty much where it ends.
6But for some reason PA likes it.
11Seriously, can you imagine how much gasoline we'd still have if Nascar didn't exist, though?
8Nopony I know in Ohio likes it
04yes
kk
6THEY'RE MAKIN A LEFT TURN!
6Twenty? Ha.
11At minimum.
4There's about 43 out there
4Eh, that is a good point. By the end, there's only about a handful left
11I don't get the appeal of watching a race either.
6Not lately. Anymore there's a lot more safety involved.
11It's just a bunch of douchbags driving in a circle.
6Most cars make it through the race.
4I'm waiting for the day when Nascar races are peeled back to about 10 a year
6The only real appeal in it is the betting.
8idk if any of you guys read the onion but...
8http://www.onionsportsnetwork.com/articles/nascar-awards-driver-50000-for-homophobic-comments,20611/
4But I'll read it
8the onion is sheer brilliance
8they do that all the time too
6lol The Onion is hilarious.
8people constantly mix up their stories for real ones
4Hah, it was pretty decent
4There's only one sport that I actually like and keep up with (usually)
4If you could call it a sport, I know some people don't
6brb
4Your own personal BMN?
8http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSoIuUfwZdxLQYqBWWdIrA0qDR94ZU4F4CXkK6ifwNsUEZAZV8S&t=1
11Well, a little movie thing for me to enjoy. Whatever you want to call it.
11Skateboarding is a cool sport.
8http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kpowqoR2Wn1qzma4ho1_400.jpg
11I used to bowl.
11used to.
4Unfortunately I can't skate at all >_<
04chat died XD
11....why do my posts silence this place?
8lol
11Then again, I have a bad habbit of leading into an RP.
4WOAH
8do ALL of them die when you post though?
8he said brb a few mins ago
04heh
4....oh yeah
8when i post in a thread, one of 2 things happens
8 1. it instantly kills the thread
7(It is based off of an earthworm... partially.)
8 2. people ignore whatever i wrote and continue as though i never posted
04lul
4Whenever I post in a thread, it's rare
4I mostly lurk Ponychan
8i try and post frequently
11I'm a little in between. I'll lurk when nothing interests me, then I'm ignored if the thread's moving too fast.
8trying to get to know more people on the site by posting as much as i can
4Yeah, I'm posting more and more lately. Though, I don't post in /oat/ much
4Yesterday, I was involved in a combat thread though, that was fun. AND, in the same thread, someone drew an OC pony for me.
8i dont think ive had that happen to me yet, fortunately

4Yes
11The whole college's IP got banned.
11I guess.
hi ecco
hey Kosovo
02Hi Ecco~
perp
;o
11Oh, both threads know of each other know. -grabs popcorn-
03lolz
8should be entertaining
6There's another thread?
6*not even paying attention*
4Sprinkles is back
6I've been here.
6Oo
4or some shit
11http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/223144.html
11Ponychan's reaction thread.
4 4chan's /v/ is supposedly raiding ponychan or some shit
11I really didn't see anythign about them wanting to raid us.
8i lurked on /b/ once or twice, but thats it
11All I saw was them bitching about ponies being in /v/
/me 7feels partially guilty for using the scientific word for the last part of the digestive tract.
8the 2nd psot
8post*
11I read that as sarcasm.
;p
8oh, thats not how i took it
6Ghosties, why did you just explain what's going on?
6Dunno.
8i took it to mean that he wanted people to raid ponychan long term to generally make it a shitty place to post
/me 11reads Ponychan's reaction thread now.
6I must say, we really shouldn't be posting ponies there if it does tick them off. It's like we're asking for a raid.
6And yeah, /v/ is incredibly disorganize.
4Someone from /v/ asked us to not raid their board since they weren't going to raid Ponychan
4But, alas
6I saw.
4I do believe someone posted Ponychan overthere
4Especially the "newfoals can't whatever" thread
4And everyone's posting the Triforce
6It's... bleh.
Bananas?
8but posting ponies =/= raid
7Okay.
6Honestly the rivalry, if you can even call it that, between ponychan and 4chan just needs to stop.
And baked potatoe
4There's a rivalry?
8its not even really a rivalry though
6It's not.
4I just thought they were insecure fags that didn't like FiM
7Isn't that sodium?
8its pretty much some assholes on 4chan that try and raid us from time to time and fail miserably
11This.
Not sure, but the skin might have it o.o
8yeah, thats pretty much right
4Yeah, pretty much.
http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/food/potassium-foods.htm < Here
4And look, in that same /v/ thread over there, they're fighting amongst themselves
4AGAIN
:D
Hi!
6Not surprised.
7Ooh, beans.
;p
8tee hee
6Basically.
8that was me
6Nice.
4Hipster
4But still, even in that particular thread /v/ is fighting itself
4Oh, and let's not forget that fucking cryptic thread about a week ago on /oat

/me 11prepares pony image. >.>
I said... "WAH"
4lemon gave a specific time?
11Ghosties: He specifically said he'd do it once he got his Rainbow Dash toy. That's pretty specific.
4Oh right
Sneas, you recommend the movie then?
I was thinking about seeing it
or it's just not working
4Oh man, one particular post on that thread on /v/ actually made me laugh
sure be pessimistic
>:o
jk
XD
8which?
bbl
4I laughed pretty hard at that
4For two reasons
4One because it was from a /v/irgin, and two because he's paraspriting his own board
8i lold at that
4Haha
6*knockknock*
6Who just posted the RD HGH image?
"It was THIS close to my arm!"
"I felt my spine shift... it was like I was imploding..."
o.o
I agree with RDX
"There was just silence... then we heard a gurgling noise from the back room."
8wasnt i
o.o
4Fucking lol
Wagons And Hills?
umm
I'm lost
8lol, that was me again
yeah
or at the very least behind the "WAH"
8i try my best
that's not good
6This whole thing is just hilarious.
Nah, it's cool. I'm sort of getting a high from the asphyxiation.

4And juuuuuuuust when it looked like /v/ was about to start talking about games in that thread
8finally got deleted

6I loved their comments about furries.
6And they completely ignored my response to it.
11yeah, I was biting my tongue over that.
11I was biting it pretty damn hard.
8somepony on /oat/ tried to organize a raid and got slapped down by the whole community and 2 mods
hi
Hello
8anon
other than that not much
11....damn 4chan. got me using that word.
you?

03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
6And it's only 1 day, with an appeal.
8how do people know that?
8ah, ok
8which is more often than not
8just had a thought
6I'm honestly surprised we haven't.
4Silver was trying to get something like that off the ground
8that could be an issue i suppose
4Yep
6Especially since most of us are same timezone.
4There'd have to be mods around all the time
Midd_Knight: !!!!!!!!!!
Heya J.
8well, to be perfectly honest, people can do that now
How goes it?
#chatshack
8if they wanted to
I need to do somethings that I cant do here
lol, I saw.
4I don't know
It's gonna be intense.
6If the place got a good bit of traffic throughout the week, it would mean spammers and trolls.
Don't ask
:P
8too bad dari left
4Yeah
/me 11pokes Princ-dari with a stick.
6They know how to handle them, doesn't mean they have any way to make them stop.
11I'm available all day sans 12-5
^ Good advice
6Honestly, I don't have any real time restrictions, seeing as I don't have a job.
8but you can't do it overnight
6I can, actually.
8i think thats where we have the biggest problem
11Overnighting things?
11I'm always awake by 9
8im up at 7, but i have to go to work
8lol, i always forget other people have personal lives
4Since I have classes this summer and all that
/me 11is available from 9-12 then from 5-2
4And I should really come out of my room at some point >_>
11What's this "Personal Life" thing you're talking about?
11:P
/me 11pokes mib_i54urz with a stick
8so if we were to do it now, we would be unmoderated between 2 and 9 am, pretty much?
11Yep.
11Unless we set up a board about getting Euromods for it.
11er, thread, not board.
8yeah
4There's a problem with leaving the room unmoderated though
8well, we would be getting mods for those hours
6Again, I can cover whenever.
11So far it isn't a problem, but that's because there's nopony here.
8I don't want to ask you to mod from 2-9 am though
8thats not really fair to you
6Honeslty wouldn't be difficult.
6...anon in the room.
8well, we have to change it now
4>___________________________________________________________>
8ghosties, just PM us the name you want to change it to
4Oh shit
11interesting.
8what should the name be?
4Flutes and Barrels?
11we could have a floating room.
11meaning we change it every week.
6Not a bad idea.
4Yeah, might as well go with that
4Yeah, I'm fine with that
8#Flutewood
8join it now

4Yea
4But it is sorta like the old games
13I'm horrified!
4Yea
4Hopeful i am that it pawns all of them
13 44 good, 433 bad
6D:
13Yeah, it is! :)
6Or basically not all but most of it..
4I like the idea of a two player Spyro but you can also pvp
13Yeah, he looks bad, but does it really matter?
4I mean it really shows right there how much time you put into it
4Yea
6It seems that it does matter to quite a few.. ._.
4Yea
4But i like how in most games doing pvp fights don't really matter
4Here it's all about the levels you put in
13UPDATE: 46 fans, 458 haters!
4I don't know
13Why can't the haters grow brains?
4I think i like the idea of a toy of Spyro
6I hope the levels are really huge areas..
4With friends or without
6I'm not sure about how much I like it.. :P
4:p
4Fly like free fly mode?
4I'm not sure
6Yeah..
4But he has been seen to hover and fly around
6Why did they cancel the movie?
6Yeah..It'd be cool to have the flight again..
6Ah.
13That's why
6Was the story going to be all the TLoS?
4Yes
4I think it was going to be all of the games in one
4It would make about a hour long film
6That'd be fun :3
13I've got ideas that could be possible if we had permission and money...
6Oh yeah..iFail..I was thinking more about the scenes of TEN and didn't think much of the time of the others..
13You mean a prequel to AHT?
4Yes
6Yeah..
6Aaah,Red's awesome..
4Right

I'm worried about that

6everyone is saying the same thing
6parents mentioned tonsils might need to be removed
6which is fine by me, I've lost 7 pounds in a week and a half
6because it takes me an hour to eat a meal that should take 10 minutes
Wow, that must be painful
Then again, you could be in a lot of pain if it was that
6yeah it doesn't hurt

Allergies eep
I think I might be starting to become allergic to mint
6allergies, temp low blood sugar, a heart that decides to have random spaz moments
I can't use any mint-cooling shower foam without feeling tight afterwards
And a heart that spazzes?
No good
6nope
Well, for me I have my teeth and my disgestive system messing with me all the time
Now it's constipated ><
Oh yeah, and skin problems as well
eczema, dry cracking hands, etc.

that's not necessarily a bad thing, if handled right
I mean
and the inmersion
14QUAN
14HI
it always is
4As well as the immersion
7How've you been?
14okay
14Sheena
14just
I just mean the whole ambient I guess
4But I really liked the world they had with the older games
6Hey guys
14just
just
14whyyyy
EW THAT FACE
EW THAT FACE
14the existance of das boot
oh, Strangereal?
4Now, it just feels realistic *shrugs*
EW THAT FACE
I'm not too worried about that
because of Joint Assault
which takes place in the real world
14just
why are you trying to get me to press my up arrow? yes my phone has one
14its just
02CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN <3 ~
14just
13:3
EW THAT FACE
also keep in mind that that's why I'm not too worried is because the Real World games are not numbered
4I never played Joint Assault...I just hope that the old canon isn't tossed away
...LOL, You Spin Me Round is on the radio
YOU SPIN ME ROUND LIKE A RECORD BABY
6Cool.
13I've got like 16 others
er youre
'
EW THAT FACE
May!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me glomps a May
8i had a great monday, up until one specific moment
Long time no seey!!!
see*
and
DRF
/me glomps a drf
4Eh, I'm having a bleh Monday
drf, have you heard that iOS5 their copying android's notification thingy
/me waits for drf to rage
o.o okays
awesome.
I'd never expect them to steal other people's ideas
4That's awesome, Hip!
8then when i was riding my bike home from the stadium, it fell off my shoulder and got caught in the spokes
Yikes.
6Ouch.
in any case
I wish to know what's the situation with TurniBrony
8from the tire
8ok
XD
8ill take it
8he has been paraspriting the shit out of our threads
everyone steals from everyone else
get over it
yeah
pour example?
oh right
o.o whats that
well
I loved that movie :D
a movie
4Corrupt? Is he too spouting INJUSTICE
yeah
OK, bbl
for the following reasons:
4o.O
a) We have no control over Ponychan, and he'd continue posting and paraspritin' even worse.
8but i told him that he needs to stop with his constant criticism
b) He might start going around saying shit about us that could make us lose viewers.
c) He's basically harmless
8he literally does nothing on the thread but complain about the movies and criticize the mods
Let the Chihuahua yip
8oh, i agree
we should just give him a stern talking to, I'll take care of that
8hes harmless, but i hate that he messes with the the thread every week
<May> 14you canadian <-- Yes, I is Canadian.
:)
02<Angel_Espeon> 13I've got like 16 others <-- Give me the Flandre one.... I know that you made one. plz?
04Sky :D
drf: kay, I'll check it out
6It's the way he expresses those points that's the problem.
4But yeah, he's getting to the point that he bitches and moans
8i agree with some of the points, but he is an asshole about most of them
14I'm addicted
14to this stupid commercial
13http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/flandrebanner1.png
like which points?
also
6I agree with some aswell, which is why I suggested the live streaming of the picks to rule out pressure.
14omg
14no
14i want that
don't some of the Color Schemes look like certain ponies to you? http://www.giantbomb.com/blazblue-continuum-shift/61-28321/all-images/52-371507/ragnacolorchart/51-1548200/
/me hugs Angel Tightly
02Thx~
02In reward
if the Intermission is by playing Blazblue
which should I pick?
6Rarity
13xD
14can I have a Remilia one?
13http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/remiliabanner.png
A point we've constantly went against when people got to choose their movie.
which we really can't do anything against
oh
OH
The mute setting
however
Hello everyone.
there IS a problem
4?
8well, it's something we have talked about
13ohai Creideiki :3
only Registered Nicks can be given voice
6Nope.
8i thought of this today
6I used my unregistered secondary yesterday.
We tested it with an unregistered nick yesterday.
Only Mods need to be registered.
8we already have kind of a problem with people in europe not being available for the selection because of the time change
4Yeah, we should be fine with people picking their choice during the stream
8it's going to be that much worse if we do it after the stream
6How about around a half hour before?
but half of the eurobros aren't even awake for the event.
4Well
8we're trying to change that though
Creideiki!
hai :3 long time no see
Hiya
8unfortunately, dari just went to sleep
4We could do the drawing live during the preshow
nah we should do it
between movies
as in
8but he said he knows how to stream
during the Intermission Period
8he could be our european streamer
p+p
4Eh, if you think it would be best. But yes, Dari could be our euro streamer
yeah
I mean, the only reason why we changed it is because our threads were moved to /chat/
7Porque?
mrewwwo
not to mention that now that I know how to GET
I would be getting Trips all day erryday
My KSR-33 Teletype has become a massive write-off...
And slightly biohazardous.
6IMO
6Hence why we'd be doing it during the stream now.
I need you
o.o
where are you?
kk
Ok
o/
well
6Every system has kinks to work out initially.
4Exactly, this way we can get rid of the whole "bias" bs
okay people
when should we make the Roll?
4By way of streaming the drawing live we can finally get rid of all the corruption calling
4Roll?
during Intermission, Preshow, or at the end of all of the menu?
well
not roll
the drawing, then
4You mean the draw?
4Ah
8well, here's the thing
8but
Intermission show, then
convince me to buy a PS3
8ok
XD
oh.
8and we can let people know during pre-show and during the pre-movie announcements
I just thought of something.
"Now my editor friends tell me nothing makes their day like a controversy. My answer to them: You're welcome"
in regards to the PSN incident
also
If TurniBrony ever wants to give his choice of movie, he'd have to watch some of the show if we continue to use this.
now he's apologizing to everyone else
:P
8silver: trollface.jpg
4Do you think Turni would finally stop complaining if he won a drawing?
8nope.avi
nope.avi

THE HORROR
THERE'S A LUNA TOY?! o.o
4That picture...*shudder*
4Those proportions ARE NOT RIGHT
6God I hate this keyboard... >>;
I'm here
Yeah, I know
4KITTY GOES ON BACK
4You mean those toys?
just no ports are binding

and its all messed up
4Like Twilight has a cat
Looks okay to me
try to run: /home/stefan/inspircd/inspircd
run it
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmabalWDIv1qcoci5.jpg
.....
yeah, no.
8like this: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e0aUHfpu9dY/Te08g8kR8dI/AAAAAAAAFhE/GmgHA-ufw3A/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg
8pink celestia: do not want
6So, again, where do we stand on the listserv?
4...Why is Luna one of the previous gens and Celestia a re-color?
also
No idea where we are with the listserv.
8sprinkles, [spiderman i dunno lol pic]
how about I talk to her aboot this?
8people would know each other more
We don't outsource. :P
8stuff like that
it definitely won't be "smaller"
4The listserv is sending emails and notifications to other people, right?
yeah
sorry, did I time out again?
still feels kinda dickish
this is kind of their turf
4Ah, okay ^_^
Are we talking about moving to a different server or something?
4Are we doing another channel?
8no
8well
8kind of
Right.
yeah, how about no?
8so we wouldnt be hosting it
We're already catching shit from 4chan and the like for invading them with ponies.
8no no
8silver
wat
8we wouldnt be invading anyone
the channel that, incidentally, I am a regular on
4All it would take is for some wiseguy to leak it to 4chan
4And oh boy
fun fact: #mylittlepony is known to 4chan, they just don't visit it
4I think we'd be pressing our luck, but hey, maybe it'll work
how about this? I'll tell her about this, and ask her to come here
if the case is that, I'll add another widget to the site
4That's asking for a lot
linking to that channel

6I know.
8well, we basically have moddig covered except for like 3-9am
8if i remember correctly
12:P
6But some shifts only have one mod.
6What if they can't do a day.
8we need to recruit more mods anyway
8we can check with dari next time he is on
04Anyone remember me being disappointed by the Pandora?
04I TAKE THAT BACK.
04:'D
8probably one or 2 at least
How expensive is it o.o
02O-o
7o.o

wow Aero
haythar
you just missed flandre
Aero too
7Question: What's 3:00 PDT in EST time?
PS3 is great if you want a blueray player and a good gaming machine all in one
laaa
6:p
FLANDRE?
D':
14uhm
14PDT?
yes, but I don't see the point in buying it when it hardly has any good games that I can't already play
14Whats that?
7Pacific.
the uncharted series is really it for me
pacific daylight time
14oh
145 PM maybe
well then if you are an abscent gamer don't invest in such things
Personally I got it for GTA4
I thought it was +3 hrs o.o
Odd
and a few good games after that
yeah, I could play that on my 360
and I'll need it for KH3
KH3 is coming out?
14I don't know
I need to finish the first two yet
not for awhile
it's not even announced yet
good, I have time :P
13-2
14normally
a sequel to a sequel
yeah whatever it is
XD
eh
6lawls
still gonne be about 3 or 4 years though
I'd like a 3DS, but not until it either drops in price or more games come out
as of right now I'm only really interested in the Ocarina of Time remake
I should've done that actually
I got my DS first last year
and KH ReCoded
-1:30 from here
Roughly
no need for me to pay attention for a little while
:P
Yep.
NBA 2ksomething
oh
yeah I don't play those
Pacific is 3 hours behind Eastern
cept Madden once in awhile
6Honestly if dari could cover that we'd be good. Though we won't be able to ask him for a while.
7Hmm...
graphics look pretty amazing
14six then
7So 6:00?
Since I'm in Eastern
8its gonna be more like 30-50 at most i think
but sport games don't really intereest me
7Thank you, Sky.
Yeah :P
No problem :)
8dari was just on earlier tonight
well
8hes asleep now though
it's fun in a group
6Oo
but by yourself it's boring
6So much for being away for a month.
4Like Hip said
:P
Hey
Gahhhhh
8and you have to think, we get 200 people for movie night because it's pretty heavily publicized and it's on a specific night and time, with movies being shown
14draw
whee glitches
Say wha
I can't draw
I could never draw
14excuse me
14GO DRAW
14NOW
How can I draw if I can't draw
:P
/me blinks
8we could use more half-ops i think
8especially the way this is expanding
8we got 150 even with basically not having an EQD post
14well
14go write then
7Even if it's a derpworm. :P
XD
Mugshot *shot*
7Ah, nah.
8think about that
7I'll probably be revamping Taigar's details.
8 55% of ponychan
/me 6will probably still be available whenever in fall
That's why they'll only be half ops.
8let's deal with fall when it comes
4I definitely wanna see how it'll turn out
8at least til we find out if dari can do it or not
6And with him being busy for a while, it may have to wait.
4Yeah, I guess we'll just wait for now
8dcd, are you still here?
/me went to the mods room, there are no mods. returns here.
we should basically start working on Movie Night East
And we start doing the drawing durring BMN's intermission.
QUAN
YAILS
LIEK HAI :D
6And we find out about the listserv
8yes, the listserv is a must
Oh yeah, and the listserv.
I can't write
How can I write when I can't write?
13I'M
13HERE
6We could always just ask ARGH about it.
/me pokes May with a tablet pen

I'm sooooooo pumped to write it again

When RP forum was live
Might as well link it
That was bomb
But yeah
I feel like writing
then draw
.......
BUT I DON'T WANNA DRAW, I SUXX.
plus, fun fact: they still link to the /b/rony IRC even if the /b/rony IRC no longer links them in their topic
NUUU
then wash it down with some butter
it's basically because it helps the fandom stick closer together
and mayo
don't think to hard about it
don't forget the mayo
Alright.

I've been good }D
How 'bout yourself??

Sky
Not too bad, execpt that the holidays are boring~
...and I guess it also didn't help that I met them all through RPing.
14Ronnie died

4Something about RPing tends to bring out different personalities and attitudes in people
blarg
14This is Deustchland
4And not in the proper sense of character either
SKY Y U NO SEE?
14U NO SEE OUR PHILOSOPHY
8maybe the fact that they're using different personalities and attitude http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/trollface.jpgs
oh, none taken. I learned my lesson.
8http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/trollface.jpg
8there we go
;p
13I can't RP well.
13At all
8lol
13Acting unlike myself is
13...
13:P
8i dont rp at all, ever
8just seems...
I RP, but my character always ends up acting like myself.
8idk
8unnatural
And talking about beer
eggs
4RPing in itself can be fun
13The only RP
13I've done
and sugar and cinnamon
13is that uh
13Ship with Rarity Sauce
4You get to be other people and act, which is something I've wanted to do for a while
I saw that. It was interesting.
<3
<3333
8rarityXrarity?
8lol
13Well.
i guess the fact that one of my hobbies is acting kinda helps.
13I'd post with that.

It's a miracle!
Autotune ruins songs.
they can use autotune even on live concerts
Eeek
She should try singing other songs
She could try jazz
Fly Me to The Moon
Maybe
I think she might do I Believe I Can Fly well too
ahahahaha
her voice is kind of bothersome
She should ditch ARK
my fingers are freezing off
Let her undergo a few years of training and such
Then write GOOD songs for her
She has the potential

trust me it sucks
04I need experience.
just do SDD
04yeah
04I'm definately doing that
I'm going to do Unit 4 maths, unit 2/3 english, SDD, mind and morality
04Although the SDD teacher is thinking of changing our first topic from HTML coding to fucking LEGO Mindstorms crap.
oh and music extension
LOL Lego mindstorms
04We did that this year and it was terrible.
I did it for mindquest
in year 6
it was pretty awesome
04I hated it.
but we did it in year 8 for inno
it was shit.
04I hated the drag-and-drop thing.
it's a shithole
04I would've preferred 'regluar' coding, like how we're doing Java script now.
lol javascript.
I don't know a lot about javascript
why do you want to learn C++?

EW Apple iD
;P

Oh yeah, I also use a different password for my NickServ (which is the same across all networks) and that IdleRPG as well

13That's right!
13Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
i heard it sucks
4It looks good
13;)
It looks bad.
:P
i like the old spyro games for ps1.i first played them when i whas 1 years old and i still play
13Again. haters are not fans
I'm entitled to my opinion.
I think it looks bad.
13So does most of the other "fans"
4aggelos_the_dragon me to
yeah
13I don't want that
Have I done that? No.
Did I say I was going to do that?
No.
are you arguing?
13No
4Yes
4they are
oh fuck
4Like a married copule
4DAri wow man
13That's my though!
4Shes right
4Don't hate
she?
I don't hate it just "BECAUSE", I have my own reasoning.
and there wont be more like them
4You never know
4Uxie is a girl
i wish they were more spyro like the first ones
13Yes, I am a girl
13The seires was once popular: now there are more haters than fans
13They ether became fans of Ratchet & Clank or took drugs
13That was sarcasom
you have to do that uxie
i hate ratchet and clank
4GA?
13GastrodonAmy. She's a... friend of mine
UxieLover1994: Hahaha, you make me laugh. That's the opposite of the truth.
Fans usually get pissed off when the slightest thing doesn't go the way they want it to.
i didnt said i dont like the legend of spyro games i just want to say that they are different am i right uxie?
You be trollin'.
13Yeah

13No, no, and NO
4No
Yeah.
4He lived
Only to die.
13Spyro Lives!
13He did not die!
i thought that this was the valley of avalar at the end
I don't believe you.
Trolls lie all the time.
13Hey, there is proof!
STOPPPPP ARGUING WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT SPYRO AND NOT TO ARGUING.ARE YOU DOING THIS ALL DAY?
4Yes

4Don't shame the ponies

4Yea

13I want them all, as well!
13There is no such country as Equestria!
I'm not that bothered about there being no more proper Spyro games though, kind of got used to the fact that they don't make platformers that good any more.
4I live in the US

13You are not the only person
13There is plenty of time!
4Well i was born the year it came out
13Yep!
aggelos_the_dragon: In that you would be 100% correct.
13Yeah, meanly
6i was born the year that came out 1998
6well sometimes is a bit annoying
13I was born four years before
6not for me
UxieLover1994: Coming from Ms "MLP fans are gay or little girls", I'm mean? O_o
13I was born in 1994
4What month where you born?
At least if you're going to insult someone do it properly, calling someone gay isn't an insult, if you're 17 I'd have thought you'd have grown up enough by now to realise that.
6me/
6i was born 24 march 1998
4ah
6you?
6oh
