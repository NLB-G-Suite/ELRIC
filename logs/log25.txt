cheers wolfman
windows is quite crappy in general aspects anyway
03that's why I use Windows
03since I use a CableCard and record premium stuff
Linux has a huge number of faults
it's slow, bloated etc.
14nice.
but then again Windows also has its faults
yes it does
8yes, and if you haven't entered for next week's selection, feel free to do that now
I love you man
14I love the 8-bits.
OH GOD 8 BIT
Mac OS also has its faults
linux and windows both have their ups and downs
lol macs
0YES <3
>most played song on my iPod
4Art of the Dress, nice
in a way EVERY OS SUCKS
4WAIT
Yay 8 bit
4NO
FAIL
4This
LULZ GHOSTIES
they suck in some aspects lol
8ghosties fail
WINTER WRAPUP
4Winter Wrap Up
GOD!
WINTER WRAPUP
!
it's purely opinion
it does not matter what you use
4STOP GANGING UP ON ME
they will all have problems
bashing is a matter of opinion
does anyone else get goosebumps from the songs in the show?
linux is my OS of preference
I can't live in a Linux world
DCD? Where be you?
I've learnt to
my hardware will not allow it
ah
I've gotten a few from Eurobeat Brony's remixes.
my TV tuner card is not supported
because Video4Linux is an immature and stalled project
I am really pleased with the BGM too
V4L is really crap.
0oh hai spring
which is going nowhere fast
lol
i don't get goosebumps much.. i just smile so hard it impairs my hearing (true story)
9I'm here
9a bit tired but yeah
winter warpup!
I did a few times yesterday, but I was watching with the fan on and windows open.
wrapup*
if you code your own alternative, provide me with a binary, and guarantee that it supports my Express Card TV tuner then we will talk
poor twilight
>winter warpup
s
sounds good to me!
I can't be bothered lol
and I probably can't either
4DCD, can we get you in the mod chat?
you will have to
in order to get me to run Linux exclusively
until then I am happy with 64 bit Windows
and its over all superior hardware support
this is amaizing but I need to go to sleep because is 6 am in Poland and I spent all night before computer.
UHN TIS
0Well, Im off too, thanks and see everypony later!
the USB to RS-232 9 pin adapter I had did not work either
but then again it did not work with 64 bit Windows either
See ya! Thanks for coming!
It's been a blast, but I'm off to bed too. Definitely gonna come back for the next one! :)
8Good night everypony, see you next week if not sooner!

Yes?
9BY THE POWER BESTOWED UPON ME BY THE ROYAL CROWN
9I DUB THEE
64 bit windows is dodgy

64 bit Linux is really dodgy
9KNIGHT OF THE ROUND TABLE
64 bit freebsd is even dodgy ;x
dodgier*
WOOOOOOO GRATS
6Woot
but 64 bit Windows has seamless 32 bit backwards compatibility for applications
hey gaiz, im back.
*brohoof*
who's a knight? im confus
6...still getting color warnings...
you can make beer with those HOPs
Congrats
32-bit windows is okay
0DARI
128 bit is fun to play around with
0You there?
alienware is cool

o-o
64-bit Windows don't do 16-bit
anyway
im bord
bord
.
bored
you?
WINTER WRAP! WINTER WRAP!
bored
hence why I said 32 BIT BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
Which is mostly not a problem until you find some stupid app with an installer wrapped in 16-bit code >>
lol 16 bit
4Ahaha, Sprinkles couldn't kick me :P
0lulz you're lucky I can't kick you Ghosties
14I think I'll turn in for the night. Another successful Movie Night, guys.
that is a problem
4Good night, Silver

4Yeah, thanks for attending every brony

I groaned
so... derpy or trixie?

Who's better in your opinion
Trying to get ponies to talk and all...
fun isnt it
Trixie.
Everytime I'm about to leave a new song starts and I get entranced.

Well, from canon only, I'd say Trixie
I go with Trixie
bah
Trixies
4Good night to all who are leaving
well, a bitch.
Derpy has no qualms with me.
At least Trixie had actual lines.
Well, you got a point...
nice stream! i really liked it.. well cyall
She's a bitch but I enjoy her hamminess. Derpy's cool too though.
6I'm going to get kicked constantly for colors since I'm not on script yet, but I don't really care. XD
What if, for just a gag, somepony up high gave derpy her own episode for S2?
6LOL I can't be kicked because dari's only halfop
4Really?
*brohoofs all*
That might happen
6Yep
derp
4I thought halfops could kick halfops
4Wow
4huh
can we get AT THE GALA up in here?
9we just gotta add you to the exception list, Sprinkles
9in any case
9I am tired

9the mibbit chat has youtube video embed
9so sharing youtube links is recommended
Im proly just gonna go to ponychan now...
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntIFhbtmwCc
Hmmm
I once saw this ToDo app I wanted
But couldn't install because lolwhut 16-bit installer
But then I have an idea
I just had an idea for a picture!
4Sprinkles, didn't you request that earlier?
6Yep.
Install 32-bit Windows 7 on my VirtualBox, install it there, and then swipe the executable from there
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSmdOlRokM
6I was also the one who requested the dinosaur ytp
But now I can't find the app
6Argh. GreySmoke's video is buffering
k
signing off for the night
4There we go
gotta spread the aids
Ponies, Klingons, and The Room?
This is excellent
indeed.
>:
well, i'm out
4Have a good night CowboyTJ
Hrrmm
I think imma bounce
6G'night Cowboy
6And GreySmoke
night
4Night GreySmoke
4Damn, now it's almost back down to the regulars again
missed it didn't I
6...where is dari, is what I'm wondering.
yeahhh
6Yeah, sorry anon.
yup figured I would
6I can't stop watching my video.
you made this?
6Nope.
but 64 bit Windows has seamless 32 bit backwards compatibility < sortove, but not totally
6Just posted it.
congratulations anyway
6ty
4Dari is lurking
4He's always here, he's the freaking chatroom
6Yeah. But what else is new.
6Dari and his crazy awesome text.
4And now all that's left, besides Enterprize, is the idles that probably forgot about the stream
Cool
6Yep.
6Odd, somepony's on auto away after only 18 minutes.
6It usually waits an hour.
/me is about to go to sleep as well
4MPD has been autoaway for about five hours now
6...lulz
4Alright, have a good night, Enterprize
6Even weirder.
6Night Enterprize
;o
cheers
6I know dari is watching. Always watching.
I prefer VMware over virtualbox
6Hello dachi
Howdy, did I miss the movies?
6Unfortunately so.
awe, my bad.
But VMware = payware
6They started nearly six hours ago, for future reference as to when they start.
03VMWarez isn't
03as it's warez
what about parallels?
Good to know. Always on friday correct?
6Yes.
...
4Sorry dachi, but you can enter into the selection thread currently on /oat/ at ponychan and if you're selected you can then choose a movie or mlp fim episode...whichever you were picked for
4Oh, and yes, every Friday at 7 PM EST
Ah!
Found the app I was looking for
Cool, thanks. I'll be sure not to miss the next one.
Now let's see if the developers updated the installer in the meantime
6And make sure to watch the main thread once it gets put up so you know when everything is starting, in case you don't want to watch specific parts of the stream.
night all
If not I'm going to plop in my 32-bit Windows 7 into VirtualBox and grab it from there
Next time
6G'night!
4Good night dachi
Bleh, I guess not
Gonna install 32-bit Windows 7 rbr
what about aids
4brb
6k
;o
ohai Revy
Installing RapeLay...
revy IS aids
Alright
6lulz
6What was that about?
MtChar IS retarded
4Did mpd say something while I was gone?
so suck my dick faggot
6Nope.
Yeah no.
oh, he said yeah
6How so?
that means i get a free bj today
4Because it says what we're currently streaming which was what we streamed earlier
4it needs t obe changed
4*to be
I said yeah in reference to my no.
6Ah.
6...why is there a red line on my screen? Oo
or did you?
6And now it's gone.
6Weird...
4It signifies when you've been away and there's been more talking
Seems like youre having trouble deciding whether to get some free penis or not
4At least in the chat anyways
with yeah's and no's
6Ah. Never noticed it before.
6*lures dari out with some coding* HEEEEEEEEEEERE channelchannelchannel
6Hello DonkeyPunch
Hey
How's things
6Good.
6The stream's currently over, unfortunately.
figured
Just found out about it
6Yeah. It's 7 PM EST every Friday, so be sure to drop by next week. There's usually a preshow too.
Awesome. Will do. I might see you next Friday then!
6I'll be here.
6Hope to see you then.
You as well. Good night.
6G'night.
4Alright, the entry message has been changed for Brony State
6Cool.
4So Sprinkles, how does it feel finally being a mod?
6The only way I have to describe it is...
6WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
4You deserve a sgon
4*song
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5TXyJlEMc
6I freaking love this song.
4You're like my second in command, Sprinkles
6Mods are now pirates. XD
4Mah second mate
4Er
4first mate
6yep.jpg
4But yeah, pretty much. I thought it was awesome that you knew what I was talking about earlier today
6I'm just amazed I got the lyrics right.
4Did you know of Alestorm?
6I always want to say Diddle dee dee instead of Fiddle dee dee
12kk
6I had heard of them. Originally heard the song from that one kids show.
6Name currently escaping me.
4Lazy Town
6Yeah. That.
4I only know because I looked up the original today
6Their video for it is entertaining.
6As well as being a frequent meme in the local area.
4I thought it was a pretty awesome song in general, even without Alestorm's touch
4Pirates are a general meme in your local area?
6The VIDEO is.
6Pirates are too, but in wider area.
6We legit have people that dress up as pirates or ninjas randomly.
4Lol nice
6I actually used to work at a Halloween store. Dressed up as a pirate every day for work. Was awesome.
4Sweet

4Lol, the joke is still in effect
03you're as addicted to that as some guys are to porn
6So odd how that works...
03neither one is any better IMO
/me hides
4They're scared of you :P
6Clearly. No idea why.
/me 6laughs evily
4I guess you actually are something of a god in this chat now
4Well

6Shame, I wanted you to be my first kick.
4It's alright, Sprinkles. I want you to kick me when you become full op
4Just for all the kicks I've given you
6lulz after 4 more weeks? XD
6Or 3 really, since I never said anything the first BMN
4I think it depends, I opted for you to be a full op off the bat
9you guys
9you might
9WANT TO CHECK THIS OUT http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/547307
6Randomly DCD comes back from the dead with an awesome video
5ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PENISES?
4YES WE ARE
4PENISES EVERYWHERE
6Or whatever it is... I can't see due to my internet failing...
9It's

6Unfortunately my internet is being fail right now... >>;
6Stupid cafe.
...
12so whatever happened to that dark ring and tower?
Hmmm.
Crumbled
;o
/me 2is currently playing Dissidia 012 Duodecim
4LOL random anon troll leaves
6Aww...
6I wanted to see if he'd keep posting colors and get kicked.
12good i knew it was not enough to control me
4Oh well
12bbl
6So, testing time is Thursday at... 8:30? Any other times I should know about?
4Hold on, Sprinkles
k
4We usually have mod meetings throughout the week starting on Mondays
6I figured as much.
4And yes, usually test streaming is on Thursdays
6...still no trip. :(
4That's why I asked you to get internet as soon as possible because we get together fairly often
6Not really an issue, like I said I can get down here easily.
4Ah, that's good :)
6...I just saw my horoscope on fbook, because I NEVER check fbook.
6Mentions having to take on a leadership role. Laughed ass off.
6First time that thing's EVER been right.
04:33
:D
6...did ponychan just put in a new wordfilter?
4Sorry about that Sprinkles, I was AFK
6Not a prob.
6I figured as much.
bbl
o-o
03what
4Haha, leadership role
4That much is true
4And I don't know if Ponychan implemented a new word filter...why do you ask?
that
6It looks like mfw is being wordfiltered, though I haven't tested
04um
04okay?
03no, it's not okay
6The picture to the left depicts my reaction to these proceedings
/me runs
6To that.
4Weird
04liar.
03LOL what
03also that link you posted
03didn't load
03at al
03*all
03but that's probably fine
04?
03it didn't load,.
4Well, as I mentioned, I opted for you to be a full op but I guess everyone has to "pay their dues" I suppose
6I'm fine with it.
4And once more, it's just us
4In a chatroom
4with *dari*
6He's here... always here...
6CURSE YOUR AFK
4Indeed, he's quite the lurker
One of my sister's friends on Facebook is saying she's listening to Justin Bieber right now
._.
6I need to find an mp3 for You Are A Pirate
04eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
The only worse thing could be if she;s listening to Rebecca Black

4Yes you do
4If you have YouTube to MP3 Converter then that works perfectly
6I can get one easily, but not now... don't feel like looking for it.
/me brofists
4Ah
/me brofists back
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song) <---
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song)#Critical_reception <- this part specifically
04After reading the harsh reviews of "Friday", Black said that "those hurtful comments really shocked me." Ark Music offered to take the video down from YouTube, but Black refused the offer, saying that she did not wish "to give the haters the satisfaction that they got me so bad I gave up."[62] Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential accosters.
04lolwow
04"Those hurtful comments really shocked me" Well people suck.
6;-; I want my applebloom trip...
04And if they don't like something 90% of the mwill send death threats.
04*them will
4How many tries so far, Sprinkles?
6 70 billion
4You are a brave man, Sprinkles
6I am determined to get this trip.
6I feel like kicking people...
4Eh, it's not my say. You are in control of your own destiny now
6lawls
6Just gonna kick mpd
4I think at the least you can kick Enterprize too. He's sleeping, after all
04bbl
4There we go, you're becoming a regular pro at this!
6lulz
6It's not hard.
4Look, I'm trying to be a mentor of sorts. If you keep devaluing my mentoring you're just gonna ruin the whole experience >_<
6XD
6But it's so fun!
4Sprinkles, you're like the punk protege
6XD
6I'm too hyper to be.
4I'd say wise cracking, but I'm a bit of a wise cracker myself
4Sprinkles, you're like the Bat to my Kenshiro
6XD
4I do believe so, yes
6I thought so.
6I thought for a second I was just being spacy... Oo
4Spacy? Nonsense
4Unless I'm being spacy oo
4..nah
6I should probably get home and get to bed...
4Yeah, go sleep. You're a mod now and that means you have *in a deeply dramatic voice* RESPONSIBILITIES!
6FULL LIFE CONSEQUENCES
6So Monday?
6Though I'm sure I'll be on before then.
4Generally Monday, yeah. Keep an eye on the Mod Discussion thread on /chat/ however because that's when one of us will let others know what we're talking about or when we're meeting here
6Is it currently up? If so could you bump it so I can watch it?
4I'll check to see if it's up
4Here, it's not the "new" Mod Discussion thread but it should suffice for now
4http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/188267.html
6Got it, ty
6Heading off now.
6G'night.
6AND G'NIGHT TO YOU TOO DARI SINCE I KNOW YOU'RE LURKING!
4Goodnight Sprinkles, sleep tight. See you soon.
6You too. XD
4And now
4It's just lonesome old me
eeyup
4Woah, I'm not alone anymore
That would appear to be the case
4Indeed
4Welcome to the chatroom
mhmm
I'm usually in #mylitlepony
4Ah, didn't know about that channel. I may check it out some time

Amy is supposedly out there, along with two policemen and a psychiatrist. Maybe it took them three days to think of what to say to me – the psychiatrist’s claim could be pretty convincing, if I decided to think this has all been a crazy misunderstanding, and not some entity trying to trick me into opening the door.
rofl at the last part

It’s a perfect explanation for every single strange thing I’ve seen or heard, and I have every reason in the world to let all of my fears go, and open the door.

after a quick google I see a deal on a ViewPad 10 for £302
more typical price point around £435
though I'll point out that better tablets have been around for notably longer, if previously for around the iPad's pricepoint (will be less now though)
6WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Lol.
I care really?
:P
the ones I'm thinking of being basically laptops, that you can reposition the screen on to make it into a tablet slab. (or just use it like a laptop)
Aurora: Just play equestria girls. :P

Aurora, play some Daft Punk
Or chiptunes ;D
Touchscreens have been around since late 1980s/early 90s (random(
Yet apple's evil marketing (and the nice DS) have made them popular
Now the coolest touchscreen I have seen is a Cameboy like one on a radio controller from 1989, expensive but neat
...Cameboy? You serious?

It has bulging eyes, throbbing vein on its forehead, and a shock of spiky green hair.

It also screams something unintelligble that may be Japanese.
Also, it exists only within the confines of my imagination.
oh okay
04Well that's stupid.
6my god lol
04Apparently in Flash
6 124% in my health class
04if you write a script to append text to ANY text box
04if you make a text box with letters in it, only letters within that text box will be able to be appended.
Lol wrong.
You need to embed the font...
04Which means you need to have a text box with all the keyboard characters- this means lowercase and capital letters
:P
04not wrong
No, you're wrong.
04because it just hap- what
04:c
You need to embed the font.
04How do I embed font
04I did the option of embedding it
What version of flash are you using?
04but nothing happened
04CS5
04:E
Let me open it so I can have a look.
6I love that

6"no, you're wrong"
04124%
6:P
04nice job
04also yeah |D
04thing is, I DID embed the font
04but apparently I didn't do it right o.o
I've had no problems with appending text into a text box.

It's another one of these stupid troll accounts
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4932.html
I think LOLOwl from OFF is a troll account.
yeah that's gotta be a troll account
have they posted at all?
I don't think I've seen them at all
06~
oh yeah I have seen their posts
interesting fact about LOLOwl I just noticed
May 31st: "I'm the one who's gonna die tomorrow."
June 1st: "I'm the one who will die today just from the mere fact that I'm afraid my boat will sink."
has not posted since June 1st
what is that supposed to mean?
trying to see if anyone notices his/her "death"?
Gnita all
not: I do not actually beleive he/her is dead, this was just something I just noticed
13I saw a group of like 20 men cycling down the street completely naked earlier today
Yeah, I noticed that also. Kind gave me the chills.
I took it as a joke
but if not, that's pretty creepy and sad
06what
Hm.
04Espy~
04also wtf
He/she isn't really dead, I can tell.
13I can only assume it was for charity or something, since other weird things were going on today too xD
04Yesterday someone was outside mowing the lawn
04in his underwear
04|D
Vying for attention like most of the members.
04We saw it in our bus
yeah, that was what I thought too
04He flipped us all off LOL
06sounds weird
06yet amusing
It's funny. Sometimes I feel like the loneliest person alive, but I'd never do what some of these people do to make people notice them.
04You would, Espeon
04|D
/me slides Espeon onto his back
12!espeon
/me still belongs to Global for 6 more minutes
most of them are pretty young though, aren't they?
a lot of what they do seems like childish ways of getting attention
That's also true.
Maybe I'm just too private of a person to understand.
trust me, I don't understand why they do it either, the just seem immature in their methods of attention seeking
3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]

I'm selling Grappling Hooks in Terraria
i shall join you!
hey Nighty Chan
You'll have to wait for me to craft them
13Goodnight all :3
nono
i don't care about your hooks ):
I've got an ivy whip
lol
I'm going to host the server
But, I'm busy farming hooks since I seem to get the dropped like crazy
i only ever got two in 36+ hours of playtime
The Hook is a component used to craft Grappling Hooks. It is dropped rarely by Skeletons and Dead miners
You can "farm" them in the Cavern layer if you build an area with platforms that lead straight to you. A Water Candle will make the Skeletons spawn more often, which can help. Skeletons have a 1:300 chance of dropping a hook.
neat
you guys have a server?

03so Aurora
03I just went to Target
03I overheard some employees whining that the store was open til 11
03like "when can I get out of here"
03XD

12noooooo
12you'll never take me alive
12...
hello sir
sorry, was in a LoL match
did i miss the movie?
DRAKE
;o
WHY does my mom need to be such a *****?'
*?!
because that's what mum's do
>_>
don't worry
I hate my mum too :D
She just kicked me off
And locked the door
Even though I'm not doing f***ing anything tomorrow
And I got a compiler error in Flash.
But does she let me fix it? No. She forces me out of the room and tells me to turn my computer off.
>_>
Honestly what does it matter to her if I sleep late or not? It doesn't affect her *at all*
For what? D:
waz poppin?
6The movie was actually yesterday.
fail
*is still pissed*
:c
12:/
Your mum sucks
Only when she wants me to do something and I say no.
Both of you need to understand each other more
She doesn't even let me have a choice; it's only "I'm the parent and you do what I say."
Am I the only one who gets MAJORLY P!SSED OFF from that?
Yeah, a dictator parent >>
Somewhat like my mum as well
Both of them are.
Drives me INSANE.
families with parents like that are never healthy
What really drives me up the wall is that almost all the time, she doesn't tell me why I should do something.
It's just "because I said so."
And no my family is not at all healthy.
6I don't really understand dictatorship parents
6cuz I'm compliant with whatever my parents say
6I never talk back
I pretty much despise my sister
Cya Roara :/
But still
My dad acts like a jerk and my mom wants her way all the time.
fail?
Seems like my parents
hi
hi
why fail NS?
And she's a hypocryte, according to my reacent understandings.
u talking about my name? if u are, i know i typed it that way :P
I think they need to understand that, while they ultimately have our best interests at heart sometimes, we have free will ourselves too
let us make a few mistakes, else we never learn
She agreed to her friend Nancy about how kids shouldn't respect their parents because they're parents.
You earn your respect no matter who you are.
Indeed
But you know what she says when I fight back?
"RESPECT ME."
F*** no.
A bit like my mum
She's a bit of hypocrite at times
XD
Oh and this is rich
When I got home one day she locked the door apparently
To the playroom
>>
I was able to push it open
And then?
http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/253742_206181236090619_100000962322868_563446_6343164_n.jpg
XD
i lol'd so hard at this
6I'm glad my boyfriend's mom is cool
But then when she gets home she goes "WHY did you pick the lock?! I locked it for a reason! >_>"
6I've had enough of lunatic parets
I didn't pick the lock
6for one life
My dad's usually the lunatic when I was young
He was... violent
I tell her that the door could have just been pushed open
She says "BS."
I RECORD me pushing open a locked door
My mum, less so, but when she gets mad she's violent as well
She watches the video and goes "Oh SHUT up!"
...
So yeah I'm done with my family.
My parents are seperated
So now I only have to deal with my dad on a daily basis
I wish I was seperated from my parents.
Two more years...
He's not violent now, but he has... hygiene issues.
Too more freaking years...
Ew
Yeah
I have learnt to deal with it mostly
I just retreat to my room and set it up as a complete living space for myself
And keep it clean
and ban him from coming in
It's really bad when you are a clean freak like me
Lulz
But ugh
I really WANT my mom to not be so psychotic
Like
Lol boyfriends
Lol parentds
*parents
I don't really just want to leave the house knowing I left behind my family being insane
ohai Zephyr
I want to leave with something GOOD to look back at
Hiya!
Even if it was just one or two good years.
But nothing can be simple. -_-
I go against everything my parents say that I don't agree with ;p
Life's like that
sigh
if it doesn't fix something, then i'm not going to let it happen
:D
Or at least happen their way .v.
bbl going to lie down in my bed for a bit
Seeyas
night
erm

The part with the light gem to the left in the water and the egg to the right
just after the Sparx mini game but before Hunter
Egg? No.
what the hell is bandb in linux
I'm able to get that easily
ok
Just wodnering
It's not really a glitch, but something very clever...
I'm able to destry all the Dark Gems in Lost Cities without needing the 24 Light Gems. I know a way to get through the Sunken Ruins without going into the toxic lakes.
Man one more light gem and one more dakr gem and i'm done with listing everything here
I just have to do that platform jumping near SGT Byrd
I love Sgt. Byrd! And I love Speedways!
How many Light Gems have oui got? (Oui mean you in Al Bhed)
14
That's a good nuber!
I mean number
Also something i read somewhere
is how come there all these eggs?
What happen to the Year of the dragon?
I've already beaten the Sorceress
About the eggs, I'm unsure
Maybe they are going to be idle for the next ten years?
AHT takes place two years after YotD
/me glares at Ray
Maybe
Also whats funny is Ember is in more games then Flame
Yet tehy both only come in once
*they
So, you've already met up with Flame, eh?
Naw i can't get the Dark gem near SGT Byrd
It's easy!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTxtV6hPQm4
/me glares at a cake
Oh, this is the maps for the worlds in the game
Not really for me
oh well it's one
am
Night Uxie have a good day see you in a few
1am? Yikes!
Night! I'll provide you with the Dark Gem info later!
ok
Oh, by the way, 4:30pm here in Adelaide

It even got Derpy from MLP who isn't even an official character with an official name. O_______o
(it asks around 20 questions then guesses)
OLD
It's also pretty much user generated
so it's about as smart as the people who use it.
That's pretty obvious.
It doesn't retract from how cool it is.

6What do you mean?
/me awakens finally x_________________________x
It probably wasn't very good out.
Then when it guessed wrong people would type what they were thinking of.
Possibly adding questions it could ask to determine what you are thinking of.
So now it's pretty good.

Ah yesssss

Ponies aren't sexy so no
I didn't say they were...

I wouldn't start with either of the first two episodes if you're serious about watching any of them.
12Eh too late....
Never mind, it's just they give a bad impression of what the rest of the episodes are like.
12What is this?It's just.... cute.... I'd rater watch lulzy cats
6Wha?
You should watch dragonshy, that's a pretty funny episodes.

13Isn't this ment to be an IRC for the Spyro series?
12Pfft rarely
No more messed up than it's always been here.
Unless you've forgotten about our 'marriage'. :P
13Well, maybe we should talk about Spyro-related stuff! ;)
12Shut up, I was experimenting
Hahahahaha,
Sure, whatever.
13Er?
6Sorry Uxie but that never happens here.. :P
12Well... kinda still am, I prefer girls
Right.
13Girls? You mean the normal ones or the gross ones?
13We women have feelings too, y'know!
12Wha?I didn't say girls in a disrepsectful way... if you were offended
13Oh, sorry
/me 6lols at the sight of a pic.

6* :/
12lol
13BRB
6I'll bbl.. >.<
12Well it may not be on hub in the uk idk
Like I said, first two episodes aren't a good judgement of the whole thing.
We don't have the Hub in the UK.
But ponies are coming to CN sometime.
ohai
This video is still epic.
12Fine fine I'll give it a chance, idk maybe I'm judging it cuz it's a girly thing
As I said maybe you should watch Dragonshy or something, if you don't like it, fair enough.
hey nicky
12Ok, I don't like ruining stuff for other people by just hating it
ohai Nick
ello :3
hihi
hey Bety Chan
I just got my PC fully repaired
12Aaaaaanywho...
I kind of feel sorry for people who don't like it because it's being posted EVERYWHERE on the internet right now.
Which could get pretty annoying if you don't like it.
12Yes
hi lu and Ecco!
12Soooo....

03ohai Articuno
/me is kinda pissed
03I think I broke a brand new $250 motherboard
ouch
wich brand?
oe
03Gigabyte
....
let it be
03it's like THE most hardcore motherboard for LGA1156 ever
03...LOL what
03you don't like them?
....what?
03I like MSI myself, but unfortunately MSI doesn't make a board that good
03dude
03it has 10 SATA ports
033 PCIe x16t
03-t
03it's awesome
ok...
03and the hting is, LGA1156 is kinda dated now
i still go for Asus
03so it's hard to find them
:3
just be glad it wan't an apple product
03I have no problem with Asus
agreed
03:P
I agree
Asus is my personal Favourite brand for Motherboards
13Scar defeated!
03MSI is my favorite
i figured
03but Gigabyte isn't bad, I've used one of their boards and it works fine
03why
heh
3Mainboard Vendor: MSI
03;P
you said it yourself
12I enjoy fighting scar.... but the Mysterious figure was just amazing to beat
ever heard of Medion?
13I'll say!
03only from you
it's a dutch brand
but they're fine
13Twilight Town's next! I cannot wait to visit Space Paranoids!
12How did I do it the first time?!?!
03and man, this laptop cooler works pretty well
03LL and I might be able to have kids someday now :D
/me runs
but the motherboard ventilators go like...4 years, then they're dead
13Huh?
03but nah, that whole "using laptops on your lap is bad" thing is kinda bogus if you ask me
12Beat MF
03I mean
...
right...
03the heat on mine comes out the back
03which is my leg
03not that part
...
03maybe if your laptop has fans in the front
03it might make senes
03but eh
03*sense
13Try to remember!
mine fans on the bottom
13I'm happy, 'cause the next Party Member is Tron!
and the back
12I got his health bar half way down then I got lucky
12I love how this guide I read said it's just luck beating him
03mine is just the back right
03no fans on the bottom
03I've also read reports saying that it's sitting in that position with your legs together that's what's bad
03in which case all the coolers in the world won't help you
heh
Hey
12AHH!
looks like i scared Icy
Oh well i'll just go
12No don't go!
Why?
:P
12I'm lonely
I keep my laptop on the bed or on a pillow
Lol.
Or between my knees XD
12What dari?
03I'm sitting on a couch
03not much choice
03so I juts put it on my lap
Nothing. 0Just when you get close, and you think it's safe, that's when he strikes!
03but I got this cooler yesterday, it's USB powered and has a fan that blows the air away XD
03it's cool, and it raises the laptop up by a couple inches
Hm

4Monday to Friday or so
6*icypoke*
12Oh god yes
/me 6wants feedance. D:
4So any of you guys getting the new spyro game?
12feedance>?
12fffffffffffffffuuuuuuu no
4>.>
...........................................
4What about you Dari or Cynder?
6Firstly I'm hoping to get a PS3..If the game has good reviews and whatever I might..
No I'm not getting it.
4I think it might
6Hope so..
4I just wish they had more Characters
6Basically I kinda feel it will..Despite the evilness of the design..
13I'm getting the new Spyro game!
...........................................
4They need over 9000
...........1....................0............
6Don't they have like 32 or something? o.o
4Yea but i think it might but fun
4Yea
...........1,0....................0,1............
...........1,0....................0,0............
4but Everything over 9000 pawns
hur
6Don't you have to buy half of the characters?
4I'm not sure
13Just finished Twilight Town
4i think you get like 5 and they sell the rest
13I'm going for all 32!
6I'm pretty sure I read something like that somewhere..
4Also Dark Spyro is said to be in it
13It said you get three
4I heard somewhere they where going to be like 10$ us a pop
1....0.....2...3....4....5...6...7...
6And you get the little models of them and they can be used to save your game or something and then connect it so some other console and be able to load your game..
13I just hope Stealth Elf is not the only female...
12What if I wet mine when I take a bath with it?
6I don't even know who Stealth Elf is.. :P
4Icy ....
13She's the ninja from the tralier
I don't get why you'd want extra characters that are essentially irrelevent to gameplay, if they're free maybe, but to pay for them?
6Then you can hold a funeral for it.
4Dari it's like DLC
6Indeed..
6DLC?
DLC usually adds something to gameplay.
4I figure they might be 2 to 4 $ a pop
Not always, but the worthwhile ones do.
4Dari new characters new gameplay
12DSD: So it's like a scam to waste your money
Add new areas, new things to do. Not just a new character for the sake of a new character.
6Shame the site doesn't have much to see..
6:O
13I just hope it will be good...
4Maybe
4I think it will
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x9Yn9YASAA&lc=I6HW7OFzp00aera-5btGOwp8jTXo1Y8Lousgd83m5g0&feature=inbox
4But i'm a true spyro fan
13I am too!
6Same.
Hahaha, look at all the dislikes on that video.
6I do like how they used Thunderstruck.. :3
Looks like the game has some critics. :P
13Yeah, I'm angry with them!
6:P
13With the haters, of course
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePT8PtPzRaM&feature=channel_video_title Uxie
4This is the vid that pawns
6Aaah,I saw the Stealth Elf.. :P
6Yep.. :P
12I like to refresh rebecca blacks video and watch the dislikes go up
Hahaha.
13Aura's already shown me it.
6Is it me or does Spyro sound like Bugs Bunny in the first few seconds? o.o
4He does
But I actually like Bugs Bunny.
12Rings!?RINGS!?
13At least he's no longer voiced by Tom Kenny
What were you saying about sonicfags? LO
:P*
6What's wrong with Tom Kenny? D:
12I hate them with a passion
4Maybe now he'll be a real dragon with no english
4Uxie you a hater
12I liked Tom Kenny as Skids and Wheelie
I'd give this game a chance, but I really don't like the look of this game.
6I basically like him and Elijah most as Spyro voices..
13I never said I hate him...

The original Spyro games were so popular, I don't see why they felt the need to completely change everything.
7Why are they all even? o3o

See
7Yay!
13Yes, he did!
4Dari after the thrid game then what?
4It's not like they could have kept going
4It would have gone ot the ps2 sooner or latter
12I'm I the only one who find a hero's tail extreamly boring?
4then GC xbox GBA
4Yes Icy
Spyro 1 and 2 were the best.
4It's just you
I would've like more like them.
6Yeah but they could've continued with something similar to the trilogy for PS2 and then on..
13Insomiac games sold the seires so they can do the Ratchet & Clank seires
4Dari yes but i think the new one might also be
4Consoles move on
13Right
4We can't have the ps for ever
6I hate it when they get rid of all the original characters..
What is it FF14 or something now? Never played that series of games but they still seem to be going pretty strong.
4Yea that
4Yes
4But they don't stick with the same person
12Anyone here know if the playstation store is up?
4I think it is
So? I bet they don't reboot the game and make it completely different every couple of games.
12I'm too lazy to go get my ps3 right now
13I'd check, but my PSP does not have interent
13I mean internet
4I'd check but mine died
Meh, who cares about PSN when you've got homebrew.
4Yea did you hear about the new 3DS?
13Yes, I did
12I really don't but I'd like to download ad hoc party so i can play online with da pap
4No getting games
6Wow..I see everyone's PS-objects are in great shape.. o.o
4Mine is
4A dead shape
Mine's fine.
13I've only got three PSP games
12once I get a 3ds that's it, i don't care about nintendo 3dsi xl now with a coffee maker
6Whatever.. :P
6"I want my RPL back please,pl0x,whatever.."
4So if Spyro could be redone like any of it's gmaes which one would you like it as?
13Great. The Gullwings!
6o.o
Spyro 1 or 2.
6Any of the first three..
13Cutscene
6:P
13lol Rikku!
12MEN!
6WOO! ^
13Men?
6I had forgotten about that.. xP
12MEEEEEEN!
13Hey, I like Rikku!
12Me too
13Almost there!
4Who would you want in it from any game if they could be in it?
12what?
13Bentley! I can imagin him boxing a yeti in front of Sora!
6Not sure about who exactly but probably original characters..
13Bentley is playable in the third game.
13lol Experiment 626!
6Sheila was quite fun.. :P
4Yea
13Sheila would be a good character as well!
4Although i would like Cynder in a game like that
13Wow! Tifa!
13I'm unsure about Cynder
4Cynder >>>> Ember

How about Gnasty Gnorc?

7Cool.
I live in northern Minnesota, so that explains why

I can probably leave the computer on though.
I'll add something to the script so mods can be added and removed and it can be turned on/off.
Just wondering if you could take the message for me in case I'm I don't see anyone else today.

oh, nvm, sorry Quan
4I think we should just ignore TurniBrony
7Yeaaaaaaaah.
?
7Hey, Nick.
hi Quan
6At this point, if he parasprites again, I'm going to report him, otherwise, he's being ignored.
!pokemon
o.o
I'm not a smelly purple skunk....
4I think we should make him a mod. I mean shit, he's more avid in the BMN more than any other brony out there. Maybe it would make him more complacent
/me sad faces
zomg
noez
6And have constant arguments within the mods?
kitten :((
4*sigh* You're right...
god I'm nearly finished
but dang I'm sick of doing this college work now
Burn i
t
6But I must say, you know you're doing something right when you start getting haters. Just means we're getting somewhere.
4I'm conflicted. I mean, I appreciate that Turni is standing up for difference of opinion and all that but we have a set structure AND it's not biased. Anybody can pick whatever the fuck they want, so he shouldn't be so damn bitchy about it every week
no I need that to earn a degree D:
6Exactly. Like I told him. I have no issue if he's trying to be constructive, but at this point he's just bitching about it every week.
/me goes on DW
13I haven't been on this in ages
4To be fair, I do feel like Darken may have been influenced by the rest of us though.
13and wow, after I got 1 dream pal I've suddenly had a lot of visitors
6We should put some rules down on that to make sure people don't crazy post every time somepony gets picked.
02o-o
4I don't think we should go that far. Though, I humorously suggested that we slap a "EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT TASTES" text on the rules
Lol, suddenly ferris wheels everywhere.
4Still, I'm gonna stop influencing people to pick something. I feel kinda like shit for pushing Darken to pick something else
6Oo Dari
4The chatroom notices us
Hey. :P
o-o
13o-o
6I didn't really try to influence anypony, though I did jokingly suggest SWHS for the bad movie, knowing it would never be picked anyway.
4Even if we were just joking, there were a few people (myself included) that said we didn't want to see what Darken was originally going to pick. That in itself is pretty biased
6I honestly think we should make it so that once the person who's name is called shows up, no suggestions. After they pick, sure, but not while they're thinking.
4Yeah, that may work. I have no qualms about that
6But getting everypony to stop may be difficult the first few times around.
4I just don't want any inconsistencies with what the mods have laid down or in what we've said
6Yeah, but to be fair, it would just make it more consistent, since we already have the rule about posting your movie in your entry post.
4That's true. And see, that would clear up ANY lingering doubt over what you'd pick. You put what you want to see in your post. If your name is chosen, then we show it. End of story
4In fact
4Why DON'T we just switch over to that?
4That way, if the guy isn't there to respond it wouldn't matter because he's already made his choice
6Because it could make us seem biased during picking.
Why?
6As well as there being multiples showing up so some movies would have larger chances from the getgo.
4Bleh, there's no catchall fix here
6No system is perfect.
If you have a choice in mind when you first post then whether you say what it is you want to see then or later it makes no difference?
Most poeple seem to know what they want already as they often say so in their post anyway.
6But they shouldn't be in the first place.
What difference does it make?
6But my mane problem with it is it may make the picking seem biased, causing more of an uproar.
6It makes little difference, I just don't want the bias argument later on.
6It would be a heck of a lot harder to disprove than this, so... yeah.
What is the bias arguement?
6If every picked movie is known, even though we're using a RNG or whatever, people will start to assume that we are simply picking whatever movie in the list we most want to see.
4Yeah
Stream the random pick live. :P
4We'd have no way to disprove it
6...dari I love you.
4I don't know if DCD would be down for that
6True...
4He's the streamer, and it's hard enough to get him in here for mod meetings
6Big setup for something so small.
/me sits on the floof
4Exactly
6We could make the selection thread a day early and do the selection at the end of the stream Friday night.
/me sits on ray
4We need to get all the mods together for a proper discussion
6We do.
/me somehow avoids
/me sits on....a chair
02You are too heavy o-o
02OMG it's a chair
02[/reference]
04:D
Where'd the sound go?
4I'd call for a meeting now, but, it'd be so shortsighted and without warning
04out the window
6Yeah.
04because lag
Ah right.
6And we do have the meeting tomorrow, yes?
04It works if you download the swf and put the external files in the same folder of the .swf.
02Awesome Chimew~
04The files I didn't provide as of yet |D
04Ray.
04Only SKY calls me that |D
:o
SKY, wher-
04not here
04:P
02is that name copyrighted?
4I'm about to post in the mod discussion thread
She'll be back tuesday night
Yeah?
Well, I sorta own it *cough*
04What do you think of the little "select your attack" thing I added? |D
04and lol HML
02LoL
4Alright, done
4Either we gather tonight or tomorrow evening
6Yep.
I'll be busy the whole of the next few weeks. :/
4Fuck, I forgot to put dari's name in the post *facepalm*
4Oh well, he's always here
6I noticed that.
Haha, that's cool.
It looks really awesome.
6Was like... eh, he'll be here anyway.
4Hah, yeah
4Dari, do you think you can be here tonight and Monday?
I need to go in the next half hour to get some sleep, and I have exams the whole of the next two weeks.
So it kind of depends.
4FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU but you're like one of the smartest mods we have
4(no offense to any other mods)
6...I'm the only other mod reading this.
6>>;
4Nah, I was including the other mods too
6I know.
Pff, I'd hardly say that. :P You flatterer. XD
4Don't feel bad Sprinkles
6It'll take a lot more than that to make me feel bad, silly filly.
They do say that flattery gets you everywhere.
4Dari, it's true. You rarely speak, but when you do it's usually awesome
What time would this be anyway?
4In the next 24 hours
6nope.avi
That's not very helpful. :P You're going to have to be more specific.
6?
4Specific?
6I was refering to the kick.
4Oh, haha
SirSprinkles, this:
[23:34] What time would this be anyway?
[23:35] <Ghosties> In the next 24 hours
4Ohhhh
/me yawns
4Either tonight (like in the next few hours) or tomorrow sometime. I can't really judge time well for you because you're in the UK and I'm completely derped when it comes to international timezones
02urgh, such a busy weekend. ;_; I didn't even play MH that much
6Ghosties, what timezone you in?
4EST
4I'm NC brony, mang
6So add 5 hours, get GMT.
If it's in a couple hours I doubt I can make it (unless the beeping from you guys highlighting me wakes me up :P), otherwise tomorrow maybe, if it's not longer than an hour, and it's after my exams.
4Shit, it's 11:30 over in the UK
Hey Silverscreen.
Hey, Dari.
4Hello Silverscreen
Hey, Ghosties.
6Hey Silver
Hello, SirSprinkles.
Hello Chat.
Hello broadcastless stream
4You already said hello to the chat
hello brony state
Oh, I get two hellos.
4Lol
....I think I"m done now.
4Hope you're feeling better, Silver
6You forgot shutterfly, who hasn't posted yet.
6And has been here for a few days.
11Hello, Shutterfly
/me 11pokes Shutterfly
/me 11pokes again. With a stick.
11Is it dead?
6I think so.
4What the hell is it
11A shutterfly, aparently.
4Awww, I was hoping Silver was going for a Silent Hill 2 reference ._________.
6Not using mibbit... using some individual IRC
11never played Silent Hill 2
4Oh well, are you feeling better since yesterday Silver?
11Oh yeah, much. Thanks.
4It's no problem at all
/me 11pokes shutterfly again.
4I don't think it's gonna respond
11so?
/me 11pokes again.
6It's been there since Friday.
/me 6pokes
/me 4loves how the gender of shutterfly has degenerated into an inanimate object
6Hello polyagon
11polyagon?
6*point*
/me 11pokes polyagon with a stick.
Bye then.
6And now it's gone
11....
11I killed it.
4Good job, Sprinkles. Once again, your infamy of having people leave after speaking to them remains intact XD
6Might have been yet another person thinking the stream was going to start.
6Had one last night too.
4We need to get Hipster in here
6Only they actually asked...
/me 11is lurking in the Keldeo thread.
/me 6is surprised he didn't come in as soon as he saw Ghosties' post.
I'm impressed by how much some people manage to get the time of the stream wrong by.
4Hah, he posted
4But now I actually asked him if he would join
6Had one by four days last week.
4the chat
11Dari, the white on light grey doesn't look too good.
4I've also seen the Keldeo thread, Silver
What about this?
4That's better, dari
11better.
11Still sticks out like a sore thumb. :P
6I like your rainbow text.
Hmm...I'll just try some different things out then.
The rainbow text rapes your eyes. :P
11Rainbow text is cool text.
6Hey Hipster
Hey.
8yo
11Hipster.
4Hello Hip
4ster
11Hello, Hipster.
/me 11pokes Hipster with a stick.
8ok, how do you do that?
/me says "What, this?"
/me 6pokes Hipster
6Just "/me"
8where it's like 3rd person
03difiigfin
/me 8testing
8me gusta
4*claps* good job
4Alright
11oh hey, I understood that spanish word.
4Since I honestly don't think we're gonna get anyone else in the chat, let's just go ahead and get started
11So, what is it that we gotta talk about?
8my roommate is a spanish major, so i know a bunch of basic spanish
11I failed spanish in high school.
4We need to discuss the movies. Talk about how they are being picked
I was going to take Spanish - ended up doing Economics instead.
Fun, fun fun.
8what about them, ghosties?
11Oh yeah.
4Since Turni has brought it to our attention -so-many-times-, I think it would be a good idea to discuss how movies get picked
11I honestly have no problem with how we've been doing it. Just because one person doesn't agree with it doesn't mean we need to change. Don't fix what's not broken.
11So far, all the movies we watched fit the peramiters of the (albiet lenient) guidlines we set.
8my reaction to it: http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b197/FinalValkyrie/Pinkie_Pie_haters_gonna_hate.gif
6I honestly just feel that the people who are chosen, once they're chosen, are instantly pressured by everypony else in the thread.
8yes, sprinkles, i agree with that
4Sprinkles and I talked about that earlier
8i will put something in the OP about that next week
11Indeed. I noticed it. But that had no impact on my selection. B)
If you put your movie choice beforehand it removes that, surely?
4Once someone is picked and said they are there, no one should be allowed to post or, at the very least, not try to influence
8the problem with that is when we get duplicates
/me flails about
I don't see why that matters.
4The other problem with that is that people may think the mods are just choosing whatever they want from whatever was put in the posts
/me blinks
I thought people thought it was biased anyway?
11choose the person posting, I mean.
4Only Turni REALLY thinks it's biased
11I never heard of that. We've only had a mod choose the movie twice so far, and that was just the past two weeks.
8if people honestly start thinking it's biased, i will screencap the results and post them
6I think we should put the selection thread up a day early, and then stream the selection live on Friday after the movies. No way for anyone to say it's biased.
8hmmm
4We'd have to talk to DCD about it
4He's the streamer, after all
11The streaming thing sounds good, but I don't think we should put the selection up a day early.
8although honestly, I think we're spending too much time addressing the criticisms of one guy who is clearly just upset that he never gets picked
6Agreed, Hipster.
4Hold on, I think he has some validity in what Turni's saying though
11Now that I think about it, the streaming idea could ensure that the people ARE there when their name gets called.
4He being turni
6But while we're on it we may as well figure out the best course of action for the future.
8ok
8i like the idea of doing the selection during movie night
4Turni just wants to see different films get picked and I am thankful that he is standing up for difference of opinion. However, I absolutely agree that he's just being bitch about everything mostly
8it would also give people an incentive to stick around for the whole thing
6Honestly we could eliminate the thread entirely.
Also that way you could have people say movies beforehand. No way they can call bias, and that eliminates what you were talking about with people feeling pressured.
6We could use the sidelist during the movie night.
4But what if the selection thread divides interest?
8I'm trying to think of logistics of how to do it
6How to do what?
11Logistics.
XD
4If we have the selection thread air during the film, that'd be even more chance for people to influence what others want to see.
8doing the selection during movie night
6Not really Ghosties.
6We could set it to mute, and give the chosen person voice.
4...
4Well
4Wait
8we could put it up before movie night, tell people during pre-show announcements that its up
4How would the person get to vote without being completely washed away in a storm of posts?
8and do the drawing after
8mute the channel
6Mute the chat, give the person voice.
o_O
4Can we do that, Sprinkles?
8yes
6Yes.
4Oh, well
11Yes, we can, Ghosties.
6One moment, will demonstrate.
4There's the solution for that I guess.
hello
6Hello conjure
hi
6True, dari.
You can't be pressured into a choice you've already made.
8it's just another thing I would rather not deal with, dari
8people asking if this or that movie is acceptable
8incomplete entries
8it would make it so much more work on my end
6Who knows how to give voice?
6So I can demonstrate.
4Oh yeah, and, if the person comes up with a film that isn't appropriate we'd have to stream it at a later date and then try to find the guy and ask him for a different film
8whereas right now i just log the names into a word file and paste them into a list randomizer
Need an op to do it though.
6Somepony give the other me voice
11I can't read the whole name.
11there we go.
Tada
6And there you have it.
4Wait, what?
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHkiyuqsfIc <-- This is epic.
6The channel is muted.
4Ohhhhhh
4I see
6But we gave voice to somepony.
4Alright, well, at least that problem is solved
11And voice is gone.
6Once they select, we remove voice, and go on.
:O
11When on mute, only Voiced people and Mods can speak.
8ok, another thing to talk about
4But, I still think that we may divide interest if we have the selection thread going at the same time the stream is airing. Oh well, I guess that's a risk we'll just have to take
8I want to set up a listserv for BMN
indeed, this is epic
You can't set up services on a network you aren't running.
11?
8ghosties, it only takes like 5 seconds to enter the selection thread
O_o
8but anyway
6And most people will likely do it during the preshow.
8how do we do a listserv?
humm
11What's a listserv?
8does anypony know?
6Uh... dari?
8silver, it lets us mass email the people who opt into it
o-o
11oh,like with The Daily /oat/
8yes
09,01O00,01-o
11....I haven't a clue.
4What is the purpose of the listserv?
8it would make it so that people wouldnt have to rely on seeing the ponychan thread every week to know what movies and such
8basically, it would give us a reliable way of disseminating information to people who want to come
4Ohhhh, so we could just send emails out to people that have entered into the selection threads
ohai you 2
11Yep. It'll be really useful for regulars, especially when the threads get swamped by /oat/ and /chat/ nonsense.
lolwut
4Very nice. As you said, it'll filter out all the bs
6Why does shutterfly still have voice?
11oh, my bad.
ohai
8well that and it would allow us to notify people of the schedule, any changes we make and tell them when the pre-show is starting
09,01o00,01hai 09,01y00,01ou 09,01200,01
11We could even put Sethisto and ARGH on the list to keep them updated as well.
derplesurge
8exactly
11....in fact. We could ask ARGH how he does it.
6Though ARGH is supposed to be having issues with writing the daily /oat/ soon.
6But we could put his correspondents on the list, so, whatevs.
4Yeah, ARGH is trying to make a team for The Daily /oat/
4True
11True, but since both Hipster and myself will be helping to pick up the slack for ARGH, that won't be a problem.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgg86krmZb0&feature=related < Win
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7lEIcK7cJU <-- this is just as epic
Since I'll won't be on much/at all for the next few weeks/month just thought I'd say that I added some commands for the colour bot.
8yeah, getting our stuff in the daily /oat/ shouldn't be a problem since 2 of the BMN mods are working for it now
8infiltration complete
!colscripton !colscriptoff to turn it on and off, !addmod to add people to the list, and !remmod to take people off it.
So !addmod namehere or !remmod namehere
11Nice. Thank you, Dari.
4Oh, Silver and Hipster got selected to join The Daily Oat?
11Hipster's going to monitor /chat/ and /oat/ for stories. I'll be collecting from everyone and publishing the thread.
4Awesome guys! I was thinking of asking to join myself but decided against it
8well, actually im on /chat/, /collab/ and EQD
11oh. Still, we're part of it, which is cool.
Well gratz on that you two.
8indeed
8ok, so we need to look into how to do a listserv
11So basically we need to find somepony who knows how to work Listserv.
8herd mind
11or look into ourselves, like hipster said.
Got that already. :P
11I was about to google it myself.
/me 6was in the middle of googling it
11I think that derpy email thing lets you use listerv. It's how ARGH does it.
INB4 all of you.
:P
ehow one is probably better.
8i think its funny how i was never involved with stuff when i was in high school and im not in any campus organizations in college
8and now i have all these pony related things that i do
8BMN, the daily /oat/, etc...
4Same here, Hipster
11Ditto. It wasn't until my last two years of school did I really get into anything.
6I had... D&D Club... doesn't really count much.
11Actually...not entirely true. I had the drama club until then..
11Then I had the HP club the last two years.
/me pokes Altair
11I'm a nerd.
4...I was also in the Poetry Club my freshmen year of high school (though I left after the second meeting)
/me 6points to "D&D Club" It's okay Silver, we understand
8i literally never joined a single club in high school
8the most i have gotten involved in college is writing one article for my campus newspaper
4Are you a writer, Hipster?
Ehh, school clubs very big or popular in the UK in general.
8yeah
+aren't
4Fucking awesome man
8i write for an NFL Draft website right now
8unpaid of course :(
4Are you an intern for the NFL?
/me 6hasn't had a job for five months.
8im a journalism minor too
6I'm a bum!
8nah, i wish
8im interning for my school's football program though
/me 11never had a job. unless one counts working concession stand at baseball games and wrestling tournaments.
SirSprinkles: So actually you're the man sitting in the corner who lives at that internet cafe place? :P
4I've worked three jobs in my life
8i am jelly, silver
4:O
6Nope, he's more of a bum than me.
4Sprinkles IS the bum at the cafe
4Oh
6He's the HOMELESS kind of bum.
6I'm the JOBLESS kind of bum.
6I think he actually has a job...
8lets see how many jobs i have had in my life
8worked at pizza hut
4I'm an English major, Hipster. My current minor is in Sociology, but I may change it to Philosophy
What so he's just thinking "I'll save on rent". XD
6I would lose count as to how many jobs I've had.
8was a scene director for a haunted house at Lambeau Field
8worked in the campus post office my freshman year
8worked custodial at the university of wisconsin for a summer
6Am I the only one that would crack up if one of the other mods showed up right now?
11I busted my rump trying to find a job before moving to campus. Hell, From my consession stand work, I figured I'd be more comfortable working in one of the dingy fast food places. But no. Either they wouldn't call me, or if I called them, they'd tell they meant to call and say I'm not right for the job.
4Why would you crack up, Sprinkles?
6We've already finished the discussion.
4We have?
8i currently call high school students to recruit for the university
6It would seem so.
8i worked maintenance at a laboratory last summer
4Sorry I wasn't very responsive this meeting. I was distracted quite a bit
11Did you get to play with chemicals?
11Chemicals are fun.
8now im an intern for my school's football program
8nah
8it was stupid shit like filling the brine tanks with salt
8it was a terrible job
8so I have had 7 jobs already and i'm only 20
11The one that upset me the most is when I applied for a job at Sonic. Waited eight fucking hours at this job fair thing they had going on. They didn't choose me because I let it slip that I left for school in 3 months.
8ah, yeah
Hey, you still have yet to tell my why 20 is the worst age.
4He answered you dari
4I think
When?
4More responsibilities, yeah?
8dari, you guys can drink at 18, so its not for you
8old enough for responsibilities, not old enough to drink
My sister's already 18, so I'm fine. :P
6not old enough to be taken seriously in the world
4I'm old enough to drink and I don't drink XD
8eh, to each their own
11Age and its pros and cons Depends on where you live.
4How old is everybody?
6 20
11 19
I'm 15.
6We've been over this I think.
Probably.
6HOLY FARKING FARK DARI
8im a little worried about going to bars now though
4 23
8Ohio just passed a law that makes it legal for people to carry loaded weapons into bars
4Damn, I'm the oldest mod here at the moment :/
11good for you. :P
8i think DCD is older though
Well, I suppose that makes me the youngest.
4And holy crap at dari
4Yeah, DCD is 29 I think
Lack of responsibilites is fun, I will admit.
11Yeah, it does, Dari.
8yeah dari, i though you were like 17 or something
8i wish i was a kid again
4Dari's a freaking minor minor
6I thought you were 17-18... Oo
8being an adult blows
4Indeed
4Don't ever grow up dari
4Seriously
6*get taken to neverland*
Haha, if I had a choice in it maybe I wouldn't. :P
6*be a kid forever*
11Yep. 19. No drugs. NO alchohol. Refuse to so much as touch a cig. Very few parties. Didn't even go to prom. My life is rather dull.
6*realize neverland doesn't have ponies*
6:(
4I agree with Silverscreen though
4I refuse to touch alcohol or drugs
4or even cigarettes
8this video sums up my feelings on adulthood: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5gw0qUPxgU
Cigarettes, meh. Alcohol I see no problem with if it's not to excess.
11I guess I wouldn't mind it just for a hands-on experience (drugs and alchohol, not the cigs), but I know how much of an addictive personality I have.
6 20. Have smoked weed. Used to drink daily. Used to smoke daily. Used to go to parties constanly. Went to prom with two dates.
8cigs are terrible, i cant stand them
6I gave them up.
11Billy Madison?
6Took me forever to quit.
8i drink fairly frequently, but i dont like beer
8indeed silver
6I still drink.
6But not frequently.
11very nice.
8i have smoked weed a few times, i liked it
6Never go to parties anymore.
11The only booze I drink is a single glass of whine every year for New Years.
6I still smoke, but I never pay for it.
8i would probably do it more often if i had the opportunity
4Pretty much Hipster. Cherish your youth, for as long as humanly possible
6I've smoked people up enough times that they'll smoke me up every now and then.
I only drink at parties really, sometimes at meals with my parents.
8let me tell you
8one of the greatest experiences of my life was smoking pot at Pitchfork last year and watching Delorean
11I wouldn't mind drinking. It's actually getting drunk that I'd like to avoid.
8it was like the happiest moment of my life
11Delorean? As in hitting 88 and seeing serious shit?
Hahaha.
8nah, they're a spanish synthpop band
6I don't smoke weed much anymore. If anything I'll smoke red magic, since it's legal and like, six times as strong.
I love Back to the Future.
11ah
8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_hcOtYv9E
8delorean
8its pure bliss even without drugs
11I see the pic and I instantly think WHIP IT!
6 6:08 That's a lot of my time to devote to a song.
11this song is freaky.
8it will make you happy
6This song already makes me feel high.
11I know, right?
/me 11gives derp eyes.
8it has a weird effect on me
8on start grinning oddly when i listen to it
8i
6Is that image moving?!
8why did i write "on" there
8i dont think so
11because you're high?
6I need to get glasses...
6I used to have contacts...
6But they got stuck in my eye, started getting infected, and I had to go to the ER.
11anyone stay up so late that the computer screen images start to swim in front of your eyes?
6The day before my b-day, too.
Hmm, sounds nasty.
6I've stayed up on ponychan for two allnighters straight.
6Never again.
6I was a pony.
8i cant stay up past midnight much anymore
Lawl
8it fucks me up too much for work
Your brain must have melted.
6It was like Double Rainbow Syndrome, only reality.
11They say that Fatigue gives the same effects as getting drunk.
8my brother once was up for 47 hours for school
8he said he was hallucinating rain by the end
6Everything was the wrong color.
6NEVER AGAIN.
I had some weird thing going a couple of weeks ago.
Slept a bit during the day stayed up all night for my exams the next day.
Didn't feel tired until after I got home, so it went fine.
And I didn't forget anything I revised because I didn't go to sleep that night.
Worked out kind of well.
11I only managed to stay up a full 24 hours once. And that was because I was determined as hell to beat Sonic Adventure.
Speaking of which, I should probably get some sleep, need to get up in a bit over 6 hours.
6lulz dari
6 6 hours of sleep
/me 6has insomnia
11I discovered I can go about the day on only 4 hours of sleep.
6 3-4 for me
Well I'll talk to you guys in what, a month? Bye.
11any less and I'm screwed.
8see ya dari
6...a month? Jeebus.
11See you around, Dari.
6See ya Dari.
8i have trouble functioning on less than 7 hours
Cya (not actually leaving the room BTW)
<Drake> I'm angry.
11of course you aren't. XD
6THE ROOM
6*brain melts*
11TOMMY WISEAU'S ASS!
11*brainbleach*
6CAN NOT UNSEE
11Naval sex. XD
6lobotomy.jpg
8DAT ASS
:o
11Random thought, if someone requests a movie we've already watched, we'd just watch it again anyway, right?
8http://archive.no-ip.org/images/co/thumb/0240/64/1299431379567s.jpg
8i would say no
6If it has been deemed being long enough, I don't see why not.
8at least not yey
8yet*
6Not for a few months.
8i dont want to watch The Room every other week
11So, say, at least a month in between watching said movie?
6I'd say a three month limit.
8i would say even longer, actually
8i want to get people watching more than just the ones we would expect
6Yeah.
11Alright.
8 3 months seems reasonable
8also
11That means either we need to keep track of what we watch.
http://i55.tinypic.com/fve4i9.jpg
8D
6I've been keeping a list.
8i think eventually we should have a "best of" marathon
6I agree, Hipster.
11Good. 'cause my memory's shit.
6Like how Ghosties said one weekend we should do the LotR trilogy over three nights.
/me 7meeps.
4WHAT
4What about me?
8i like that idea
4Oh yeah
4We should
8it all depends on when DCD's schedule would allow for the best of thing though
11Yeah, that's going to be our little End-Of-Summer special event.
4Also, I think 6 months instead of 3 months would be better
8i would say we should wait quite a while with that

8im cool with that ghosties
Also known as the Zekrom/Resh battle theme
4A half a year since there's soooooooo many films in existence anyways
8do you guys know if theres a mid season break in pony episodes, or do they just go straight through?
4I'm not sure
11Was there a break last season?
8i dunno
8i didnt start watching til march
11I don't know either. I watched all on Youtube.
4I also started in March
8at any rate
6The only break was the one on April 1.
8if theres a midseason break, we could do the best of then
4How would we pick the best of?
4Mod vote?
8yeah, mod vote
11I'd say Mod vot.
6Def mod vote
11vote*
11So far, I'd have to say Supes IV, Holy Grail, and The Room.
6One pick by each mod?
8that was our 1st movie, after all
4Well, in that case, I already say that Fistful of Dollars should definitely be in. Flute and barrel in jokes for the win
8well, let's not get ahead of ourselves
11right.
6Well, yeah.
4True
8there's going to be a shitload of movies between now and then
4But I like the idea that each mod picks one film
8and we're gonna have to only pick a few
8i agree with that as well
4Cool
11That's a good idea.
4Man, who knew the BMN would turn into such a project
6Look at me and all my good freaking ideas.
11SirSprinkles: there's a difference between a break and a dry season. This is the latter.
6What?
11<SirSprinkles>: The only break was the one on April 1.
11Late response.
6Yeah, that was the only time there was no ponies, is what I was saying.
8i have been calling it this "The Great Pony Drought of 2011"
Hi
8oops
8this*
haven been on here for a WHILE
4The break inbetween seasons is The Great Pony Drought of 2011. I like it
8i cant tell if it caught on, or if somepony else came up with it too, but i have seen it used other places
11I just call it a long ass wait.
it seems that Im the only one on right now or something. :
:/
is that you
04yes
8my thread killing was once again successful, this time, intentional too
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35612214.html
6Already saw it.
11Epic.
4Nice
4Anybody wanna tell me how the Keldeo thread ended?
no?
8i can
8he got banhammered
8again
11Keldeo's permabanned....again....and the thread was deleted.
8claims it wasn't him
11of course.
8probably lying
8lots of drama
6He's made the claim before
11But IP states otherwise, according to RDmod.
8Spike mod told everyone to save the picture and use it to troll him
4Wow. Seriously, Keldeo
Ryan take better screenshots
6And if it wasn't him, why would he care?
No you
4Was he not already permabanned?
seriously
6Yep.
8well, according to him, he's trying to get the mods to give him a 2nd chance
6...hahahahaha. No.
4nope.avi
8but there is 0 chance of that happening
11According to some, he's been trying to get the ban lifted for "Good reasons"
8i mean
8whats the point of a permaban if it isnt permanent
8?
4At least that one thread on meta didn't have to do with Keldeo, thank god
8are you talking about the one where haackula was bitching?
11what was haack bitching about?
4Yeah, and Sweetwater too
4Sweetwater and Haackula were upset that someone had been banned
8he was complaining about the mods banning somepony
11ah.
4Both Haack and Sweetwater were shouting INJUSTICE!
4and CORRUPTION!
8was calling the mods corrupt
Heya LL :3
8generally insulting everyone
8im pretty sure he got banhammered for it eventually
6Haack's such a troll I generally ignore anything he says.
8agree sprinkles
4I loved that Haack was getting sooooooo upset though, it was pricelss
4*priceless
8my favorite post was one by sweetwater though
11I generally like Haack, despite him being a parasprite.
8it was something to the effect of:
hiya x-o
8"im not trying to start a flame war, im just trying to prove how corrupt and unfair the mods are"
11....wow.
4I'm not trying to do anything.....but the mods are evil
6...so he wasn't trying to start a flame war, he was trying to start a mud fest.
What happened this time :<
?
11Hey, did anypony else see that stupid thread made by Hal last night?
8it was generally a stupid thread
6Yep.
6Where he "gave advice"
a long day lol
8im kind of mad at myself for getting involved
and lol
11Talk about an ego.
8oh god
8that one
6Somepony said it didn't work for everypony.
4My favorite post was by Haack when he posted the rage face and was like: NO HE WAS *NOT* LYING!!!! You could tell he was clearly upset, it was hilarious
6Instant RAGE
"this time"
brb class
3>8pm
>10am
6I think I've been generally upset ONCE in my time on ponychan, and that was today.
11I know. He seemed cool about it, until somepony (don't remember who) said "Just accept that your advice isn't the holy grail" or something.
actually I was in class an hour ago
8was it turnibrony?
6Yep.
4What was it Sprinkles?
4Ah
4Well
6The post with the listed numbers.
4Turni likes to bitch
4a lot
fuck timezones
/me np: Black Eyed Peas - The Time (Dirty Bit) m4a@256kps
11Listed numbers?
8not gonna lie, i was really upset when he talked about paying us off
8i know it was a joke, but still
11wait, what?
11I missed this thread.
6It was a combination of that, and that he called us soft. I went full rage mode.
6It's in the discussion thread.
8he was saying he wanted to pay us off to pick his movies
11Tell him to fuck off.
11I don't play that corruption bullshit.
6Basically did.
8i honestly considered banning him from BMN forever for that post
6I warned that if he parasprited more on ponychan I'd call a mod on him.
4Again, Turni just likes to bitch because he doesn't like what other people pick for their choices
/me 11needs to find the new discussion thread now.
8it was funny that sprinkles and i both posted lists telling him off
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/216598.html
8ill post for you silver
8nm
11Thanks.
04Hi LL :3
/me 6was on the thread already
hai Chime
11Pardon me. I may be late to it, but I'm going to take my gloves off for this guy.
6You can clearly tell where I go from being in a good, polite mood, to being pissed.
4I wonder if it was too much, but I was kinda upset that he announced to us that he wasn't going to be there Friday
8silver: dont
8we told him off already, he'll just keep at it if feed him
11I don't mind when people say they won't be their. That's their choice. But if they start downtalking about it just because they don't like the choices, that's when I think something needs to be said.
11Alright.
6It's been handled for now. If he keeps up, he'll get reported. I already told him that.
11there*
8yeah
4Hah
4Oh yeah
8and honestly, if he pulls anymore shit in our threads, he's ban on sight from BMN
11If he ever comes.
4I remember he called me soft a week ago
6Agreed.
6Called me soft this week. I flipped. I don't take shit.
8i can put up with a lot of shit, but i will not have someone like him questioning my integrity or professionalism
XD
11Seriously, what evidence does he have about calling us soft? I'm logical, but I'll bomb anyone who gets on my bad side.
4Well I'm not gonna RAGE if he calls me soft, I'll be the bigger man and keep my cool. It's just that he didn't see what the big deal is with nudity or excessive violence
7Hmm...
7LL?
7Your character is primarily a Latias, right? :P
11ah.
/me nods
6I didn't RAGE, I kept my cool. I just did so in a more... threatening manner.
11so that's what it was about.
why do you ask? and hai
4Thing is
4Turni never once really got upset
7Hello, too.
4So I'm not gonna get upset over him either
11Considering our judgement on it, I don't see us being soft at all.
7And I'm collecting data.
7Of primary pokemon personas. :P
hai
4And I know you didn't Sprinkles
oh
11I mean, we watched Evil Dead which is packed with violence, and we watched the room which has (horribly done) sex scenes in it.
interesting o.o
4But
4We let people know about the content in advance
and hai Eevee
11Which isn't being soft, it's being cautious.
4There ARE minors on the site, and even though I'm sure just about everyone is desensitized to violence and nudity, I'd rather be professional than stupid
11Right. Not to mention that the last thing we need is to be chewed out by someone's over-moraled mommy or daddy for streaming stuff like that without them knowing about it.
8exactly
4Bingo
8there was actually somepony in the thread who said he left during the room because he was underage and it wasnt appropriate
11I wanted to give him a big gold star.
4That's awesome
"I've got a person in my closet"
11I saw that post.
4Sprinkles, you're not upset are you? I didn't mean to offend you if I did, bro
6Nope.
6Like I said, takes a good bit to upset me.
/me lols
7By the way, Eeve?
7Eevee*
11I easily get upset if someone tries to go after me on a personal level. Otherwise, I stick with my logical thinking.
7"the unforgettable sense of being" <-- I've heard that in multiple places. Where's it from?
what
how did bolb
lsda;kjf
i hate you me
7o.O
it's from a song
bold*
also
6The only real way to get to me is on a personal level, which is why I reacted as I did when he called me soft.
yeah song
7All right.
4Alright, I just don't want any bad feeling between us man. I like you, you're mah pony pirate ^_^
i've been using that for years
6Yar Har
didnt Xeli have that in his profile at one time?
11YAR!
it feels odd to say that to be honest but it's true :V
11BY CELESTIA'S BEARD!
4I need to read that comic
4I've only seen the beginning
6Suddenly viking pirates.
11That's a comic? o.O
6Yep.
8i thought it was only those 3 or 4 panels
11I thought it was a one-time gag pic.
8eh, im not really a comic kind of guy
4I've seen that it's a comic, but I could be wrong? Sprinkles?
6I'm pretty sure it's a comic.
6From what I hear from my brony friends around here.

4YES
4DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE. YOU ARE A PIRATE
8silver: photoshop?
11No photoshop on dorm comp. Can't do it right now.
4Here, I found this yesterday. I think DCD should play it during the pre-show sometime

8unrelated, but hilarious: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrIpPqcln6Y
6I was watching the full PotC trilogy last night. Need to go to theatres and see the new one...
11I lol'd
11Don't. It's a waste of time.
11Too much talking, not enough action.
6I'm sure.
/me 7suddenly wishes that the convention center where AnimeNEXT is at has a piano.
04Espeon
8i enjoyed the 1st one, but i didnt really like the others
04you're up so laaaate |D
6Plus, my sister will end up getting it on DVD when it comes out anyway.
6Like she did the other three.
11THere's not even a boat fight in this one.
11I am dissapoint.
6Dissapoint indeed.
11The first one was the best. The other two were good in that they kept a decent plot going in each. The fourth one....bleh.
6I'm not surprised in the least.
8damn
8i cannot find a good "secret butt fun" pic anywhere
11SECRET BUTT FUN!
11Seriously, how the HELL did that get past censors?
6COVERT ANAL MERRIMENT
8im disappointed they took it off the air
11With all the "DON'T LET CHILDREN SEE IT" going on these days, it's a damn miracle that phrase occured.
8also, the last 3 things i typed would be really, really inappropriate out of context
6*keeps refreshing bank page* I'M SUPPOSED TO GET PAID TODAY WHERE IS MY MONEY?
6lulz Sunday
8damn, how is it already sunday?
11I know that feel.
6They really should pay on Saturday.
6>>;
8i dont want to go back to work
11You see, HIpster, there's a little thing called time...
8i want to fritter away my time on ponychan
6I want... food.
6All I've had to eat in the past three days is a bowl of soup and some brownies...
11I want another pizza, but the pizza place is closed on Sunday.
6I'm IN A CAFE. People are eating all around me.
11SirSprinkles: I've lived off of Ramen and water the past month.
6I need to get paid so I can get some.
6That's what I've been eating mostly.
6For the past five months.
11I put Adobo in mine.
11I put Adobo in everything anymore.
8i have a large stockpile of soup, chef boyardee and easy mac
11I fucking love Adobo seasoning.
13It's only 1:36am ~
/me 7takes a deep breath.
4I have a SECRET BUTT FUN pic on my laptop but I don't know how I could get it up here in the chat
6I need to get paid so I can get all my cheap food.
1312 hours from now, I'll be doing an English Language exam |D
7I'm gonna be up writing an hour's worth of biology for a fakemon. O_o
11ghosties: use Tinypic.com
6Last week I lived off a giant box of poptarts.
13o-o Dedication
7Creativity, more like. :P
6$5 for a box of 18 packs of poptarts.
8oh, and i inexplicably have a shitload of bagels here
11I live a good fifteen minutes away from anyplace other than the college's cafe, which is expensive as hell.
7Wanna see a preview of what the fakemon is? :P
8im not entirely sure how they got here
6My dad buys bagels constantly. They never last the day.
11Fifteen minutes, by driving.
04Wuan
11DO you have cream cheese?
04*Quan
7Yeeees?
11Can't have bagels without cream cheese.
7o3o at button.
6Usually.
11Creamy cheesie cheesie creamy creamy cheese.

04PRESS IT
6Why do I feel like it's going to rain? Oo
7Wow, nice job.
04thanks
11Because the Pegasi ponies told you it would?
4Thanks Sprinkles
4Er
4Silverscreen, thanks ^_^;
7But isn't Hilbert's backsprite in one frame the sprite?
8i have lots of cream cheese
6lulz
04yeah
8and i use it liberally
11You're welcone.
04unfinished |D
11welcome.
6I get all credit for everything.
4Hipster, I hope that picture works
/me 11<3's cream cheese.
8it did
11it works.
04Doesn't need to be for 3 more days
04so yeah
6Cream cheese = pure win
8i was looking for just the screencap of the dog tho
4Hmmm
8its cool though, i just used a small one
4Wait
4I may have that
oh DAMNIT
The page refreshed on me again.
stupid.
04Like the way I kinda combined B/W's graphics with the pre-DS interface, Quan?
04:P
8im still trying to make the flute one of them
11lol, Clint flutewood.
04hi sheeeeeeeena
8http://www.taalmusicals.com/images/20110429_63503am_flute6holes.jpg

http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=35ipz0y&s=7
There you go, Hipster
6Clint flutewood will kill you with barrels.
8and as pissed as i was at turnibrony, i loved that he kept putting HEE HEE HEE HEE in his posts
11That damn laugh.
8awesome, thanks
4Not a problem :)
4WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER
4that's one
8theres the wall repair vision too
6CAMERAMEN ON MOTORCYCLES
11Major props for DCD for the cool music overlays he did with The Room.
11EVIL CAMERAMAN!!!!
8CLIMAX TIME!
8Captain Marvelous
4I was getting a littttttttle frustrated however when DCD kept stopping the movie to play more music over it
6Just a bit.
;o
4I thought the first time was excellent, but then it started getting annoying
11that was a little annoying.
6It was awesome the first time. Not the tenth.
4Exactly, Sprinkles
8agreed
04k
8we should do a test screening in the future for stuff like that
8so we can work it out ahead of time
04so yeah
04Like?
4Perhaps
stare
6Only for REALLY bad movies though.
8yeah
6Don't want to take away from movies that are actually good/funny on their own.
/me glares back
8for sure
;D
04lol glare |3
11yeah. The guile's theme thing was hilarious.
6O HAI DANNY
8i was disappointed he didnt play baker street until the post show though
11OH HAI SPRINKLES!
6New BMN meme is.
8its the perfect sex scene music
4>mfw the kid's name is actually Denny
6ULTIMATE BROHOOF
4That annoyed me to like no end when we were watching The Room
11ULTIMATE BROHOOF!!!
8i always thought it was danny
8i have watched that movie like 5 times and always thought it was danny
4Nope, it was Denny
6I thought it was Danny too...
11I thought I heard an "e" in there.
6Curse you and your bad accent!
6OH HAI DOGGY
11lol that scene.
7Pre-DS interface? *late*}
6So how's your sex life?
7The font might need to be changed. :P
8right after that part
11How wooden can one's acting be?
4I just like to watch you guys
8DCD should have played the Flutterguy "I don't want to talk about it" clip
11I swear, I saw absolutely no emotion from Wiseau through that whole movie.
4It wasn't JUST the acting, the personalities were creepy too
6The Fatality when he killed himself was pretty awesome.
8even his end of movie tantrum was strangely calm
7And you might need to expand your audience for that flash.
11Hara Kiri.
4Denny was like the overbearing landlord who "just liked to watch" Lisa and Johnny have sex
8i would have lol'd more if it we're "HEADSHOT" from unreal tournament
8i played that game so much when i was a kid
8were*
11Hara Kiri is the MK term for suicide. :D
11*themoreyouknowstar*
8unnecessary apostrophe
4Actually
4Silver
04Hm?
11o.o what?
04And what's wrong with the font?
7I can see this becoming really popular, seeing how well it's done.
04Wow
04Thanks :D
7Well, the 'pokemon' one in particular; it's rather squished.
4*pulls out nerd glasses* Hara Kiri wasn't originally from MK. Hara Kiri was the term that old samurais and shoguns called a honorable suicide in feudal Japan
04Ah
04I made them squished for a reason
11But it's still the term MK uses for the suicide moves.
04so the curser could fit
4*pulls up suspenders* And in MK Deadly Alliance, Kenshi was the only character to have a true "Hara Kiri"
04It's readable at least, though.
6*took three years of Japanese* I couldn't stop but twitch my eyes at that.
8good lord
11I remember. He did the whole *sword to gut* samurai death.
8somepony made a gen 1 appreciation thread on /oat/
8KILL IT WITH FIRE!
11...
11KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!
/me 11gets the napalm
4*wears pocket protector* And Hara Kiri isn't pronounced "hara" but "harry" and Kiri is pronounced "karry"
4Or carry
6WRONG
11....so you pull a Harry Carry? Sounds like a creeper.
04and by pre-DS interface, I meant the lack of a bottom screen
4Well, dear Sprinkles
4Your rebuttal?
6That's the poor English mistranslation.
7Ah.
6It actually is "Hara Kiri"
04And how, like the GB, GBC, and GBA, the moves' stats are listed on the right, while the selectable moves on the left.
4Not how I've seen it
04Btw like that arrow effect I made?
4*shrugs* Hell, I don't particularly care anyways
8Fun fact, Harry Caray was a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs, the most pathetic franchise in baseball
7Arrow? O.o
rawr!
6lulz Hipster
04K
04When you get to "What will Snivy do?" press "Z" on "FIGHT"
8I'm a Brewers fan
04make sure you click the flash, though
7Oh, Z?
04because it won't register your key press unless you do |D
04yep
7Computer logic tells me to press Enter.
8it's legally required that I hate the Cubs
8but even if it wasn't, I would still hate them
04Game logic says Z
04:P
7Mention that in your description. o3o
7Computer logic says Enter. D:
04k
04So, like it?
7And after you press Z, do you have to refresh to reset it?
6Not a huge fan of baseball myself.
4I'm not either
4Though, I will admit that I watched the World Series while I was in high school and I was absolutely THRILLED that the Red Sox won
6I have nothing against it, I just don't care for it.
04there added
04yes lol
8i like all sports
7An annoyance. :P
/me 11returns from watching all MK: Deception Hara Kiris
8except nascar and golf
04pressing "X" or pressing "Z" again will bring you to a "That's all folks!" screen.
8which arent even really sports
11I watch any sport that happens to be on the tv when I turn it on.
6Nascar is not a sport.
04Because again this is not finished.
bbl
6Golf is barely a sport.
04Nor is it really a game atm |D
11Nascar is a waste of gas.
8i would argue that neither are sports at all
4@Sprinkles: Don't say that around where I'm at >_>
11Golf is a leisure activity.
8golf is a game
6I can't say that around where I'M at.
6And I'm in PA
8nascar is just retarded
4People like Nascar in PA?
6Quite a few people, unfortunately.
11Yes, they doe.
11do*
7I love all the details you put into it. :O
4Wow
11My dad was a Dale Earnheart fan.
8never would have guessed
4And here I thought it was just in the South
6PA is pretty much where it ends.
6NY and NJ not so much.
6But for some reason PA likes it.
7The pokeball (opening), the background gradient, the pokemons' animations, moves, etc.
11Seriously, can you imagine how much gasoline we'd still have if Nascar didn't exist, though?
8Nopony I know in Ohio likes it
6My dad is a HUGE fan of Nascar.
4@Silver: My dad still IS a Dale Earnhardt fan. One of the biggest ones I know, actually
04yes
04I have an eye for detail :3
kk
o3o
8i regularly troll nascar fans IRL when i see them
6THEY'RE MAKIN A LEFT TURN!
11Think about it. Five hundred laps with twenty cars. Not to mention all the fuel that's spilled durring fillups AND the driving.
6Twenty? Ha.
4It's not just twenty
11At minimum, SirSprinkles.
11At minimum.
4There's about 43 out there
11I've seen races dwindle down to only twenty, hence, it's the minimum. :P
4Eh, that is a good point. By the end, there's only about a handful left
11I don't get the appeal of watching a race either.
6Not lately. Anymore there's a lot more safety involved.
11It's just a bunch of douchbags driving in a circle.
6Most cars make it through the race.
4I'm waiting for the day when Nascar races are peeled back to about 10 a year
6The only real appeal in it is the betting.
8idk if any of you guys read the onion but...
8http://www.onionsportsnetwork.com/articles/nascar-awards-driver-50000-for-homophobic-comments,20611/
4Nah, I'm not a fan
4But I'll read it
8the onion is sheer brilliance
11lol at how The Onion caused a huge Facebook war with a Harry Potter story.
8they do that all the time too
6lol The Onion is hilarious.
8people constantly mix up their stories for real ones
4Hah, it was pretty decent
4I'm generally not a fan of sports in the least
4There's only one sport that I actually like and keep up with (usually)
/me 11is thinking of having his own personal Brony Movie Night tonight...
4If you could call it a sport, I know some people don't
11...or tomorrow night, considering how late it is already.
6brb
4Your own personal BMN?
8http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSoIuUfwZdxLQYqBWWdIrA0qDR94ZU4F4CXkK6ifwNsUEZAZV8S&t=1
11Well, a little movie thing for me to enjoy. Whatever you want to call it.
4@Hipster: Skateboarding, I've been a big fan since I was a kid
11Skateboarding is a cool sport.
8http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kpowqoR2Wn1qzma4ho1_400.jpg
11I used to bowl.
8thats better
11used to.
4Unfortunately I can't skate at all >_<
8ah, not a big fan of "extreme sports"
8i pretty much tune out everything thats in the x games
04chat died XD
4The X Games vibe is pretty fucking douchy, but I don't particularly pay attention because I just want to see how the skaters do
11I only watch the x-games to watch the carrot top Shawn White snowboarding.
7Derpworm is what I think of when I see my fakemon. O_o
11....why do my posts silence this place?
8lol
4That's another sport that I also like, I'm sooo looking forward to the new SSX this year
8at least your posts on Ponychan don't like mine do
11Not true. I've seen several really good threads die when I post.
11Then again, I have a bad habbit of leading into an RP.
4WOAH
8do ALL of them die when you post though?
4Where did Sprinkles go?
8he said brb a few mins ago
04heh
4....oh yeah
8when i post in a thread, one of 2 things happens
8 1. it instantly kills the thread
7(It is based off of an earthworm... partially.)
8 2. people ignore whatever i wrote and continue as though i never posted
04lul
4Whenever I post in a thread, it's rare
4I mostly lurk Ponychan
8i try and post frequently
11I'm a little in between. I'll lurk when nothing interests me, then I'm ignored if the thread's moving too fast.
Earthworm Jim?
7Nope. o3o
8trying to get to know more people on the site by posting as much as i can
4Yeah, I'm posting more and more lately. Though, I don't post in /oat/ much
4Yesterday, I was involved in a combat thread though, that was fun. AND, in the same thread, someone drew an OC pony for me.
4I was pretty freaking happy about it ^^
11You know what really annoys me? When I get to know someone in places like this, then they randomly vanish into oblivion.
4I'll never vanish Silver
8i dont think ive had that happen to me yet, fortunately
11inb4 elderscrolls reference.
02Kosoveon~~~~
/me 7gives her earthworm the move Nasty Plot. :3
4Yeah
Ray~~~~
4....
4I thought of Elder Scrolls
What's up~~~~
8prison is back from his ban
11who?
02Homewooork, like usual xD
8hes the guy that haackula and sweetwater were stirring up shit about
8it was a bill nye the science guy thread
11Wait, so the ban was a temp ban?
/me plays with Kosov(e)o(n)'s tail
8and he posted some stuff that was a little bit racist and some sexually explicit stuff
Same
/me huggles
8he got a 3 day ban for it
have like 3 projects due this week x.x
11Eh, a bit excessive, but still, it was only temperary.
4INJUSTICE
4CORRUPTION
8yeah, even some of the mods acknowledged that it was a bit much
6Back on this topic?
8i think one of them implied he had been posting inappropriate stuff on other threads
7Long list of potential moves is loooong.
7And I feel the same way, Kosoveon.
8yeah, cuz the guy who originally got banned is back now
7Four projects, actually.
11he's not stirring up shit is he?
6oh joy.
4Lol Sprinkles comes back to Haack and Sweetwater
8nah
8he actually wrote a big long post on /meta/ apologizing for the stuff that got him banned and for haack and sweetwaters actions
11That's awesome.
4FUCK YES
derp
4I FINALLY found the version of a song I've been looking for
4Oh, that's awesome that Prison stood up like that
4I mean, really, that's really man-ish of him
/me 4is going to /meta/ to read the post
4*claps* that was a pretty awesome post by Prison
8some dude on 4chan is trying to start a "long term" raid on Ponychan and failing miserably
11Oh?
11Hehe, THIS I got to see.
11link, please?
4Woah
4Whoa
4Where?
11When will they realize that 1: We can see their threads when planning to raid us and 2: We'll love and tolerate the shit out of them no matter what?
8http://boards.4chan.org/v/res/97585285
02x-x
derp
/me late hugs back
4>those that are knowledgeable about video games.
4BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
4Oh those /v/ guys
4they're a laugh
11I find it hilarious that he's referring to us as a cancer.
8the whole thread is just a giant exercise in fail
8post about hating poines
8ponies*
4>They can't stand anti-love.
4Holy fuck, it's like 4chan NEVER learns
8immediate influx of bronies
8i also enjoyed this post:
8Ponychan has a video game board? Maybe I'll go there to actually discuss VIDEO GAMES
4Bronies respond to trolls and parasprites through love and tolerance, the fuck is /v/ smoking
11Friendship is Magic is a fantastic show and almost everyone who actually likes cartoons should enjoy it. But the fandom is terrible. Note that this is no different from most other good things.
11An interesting assessment.
11And, surprisingly, quite true in most fandoms.
4Yeah, I saw that same post Hipster
4See, I don't mind that post Silver brought up
4Because I do think the fandom is flawed
/me blinks
ALTAIR
11Agreed. We can be excessive in some things, but that's what happens when you have something you're really into.
8theres certain things i like, certain things i dont, but as a whole, i love the fandom
11http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1307318329649.png
11Ha.
/me burps
6Just finished reading the thread. Just... wow. What idiots.
6http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1307318964418.jpg
8those links are just 4chan logos
6What?
8the pics
derp
4Alright, posted in the /v/ thread on 4chan
8all i see when i click them is 4chan.org
11Hmm....the one guy brought something up.
8is yours the derpy post?
4Yes
11The whole college's IP got banned.
11I wonder if the mods realize this.
4Mine was the Derpy Dragon Age II pic
8they can just use a proxy
11I guess.
hi ecco
and it's okay ray :P
hey Kosovo
02Hi Ecco~
perp
hey Ray
;o
11Oh, both threads know of each other know. -grabs popcorn-
03lolz
8should be entertaining
/me saw the new Xmen movie last night and it was kickass
6There's another thread?
6*not even paying attention*
4Sprinkles is back
6I've been here.
6Oo
4or some shit
11http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/223144.html
11Ponychan's reaction thread.
4 4chan's /v/ is supposedly raiding ponychan or some shit
4but /v/'s so goddamn disorganized most of the time to do anything other than become distracted by shiny objects or bicker amongst themselves about who's gaming dick is bigger
8im so glad i never got into 4chan
11I really didn't see anythign about them wanting to raid us.
8i lurked on /b/ once or twice, but thats it
11All I saw was them bitching about ponies being in /v/
/me 7feels partially guilty for using the scientific word for the last part of the digestive tract.
8the 2nd psot
8post*
11I read that as sarcasm.
;p
8oh, thats not how i took it
6Ghosties, why did you just explain what's going on?
4What do you mean, Sprinkles?
11Judging from other posts, half of /v/ talks about anything but video games.
6Dunno.
8i took it to mean that he wanted people to raid ponychan long term to generally make it a shitty place to post
/me 11reads Ponychan's reaction thread now.
4I said what I said about /v/ because it's usually true. There's way too much infighting for them to ever actually organize to do something
6I must say, we really shouldn't be posting ponies there if it does tick them off. It's like we're asking for a raid.
6And yeah, /v/ is incredibly disorganize.
4Someone from /v/ asked us to not raid their board since they weren't going to raid Ponychan
4But, alas
6I saw.
4I do believe someone posted Ponychan overthere
4And so there's a couple threads on /oat/ that are pretty 4chan like
4Especially the "newfoals can't whatever" thread
7Uh, question:
4And everyone's posting the Triforce
7Where is potassium most found?
6It's... bleh.
Bananas?
8but posting ponies =/= raid
7Okay.
6Honestly the rivalry, if you can even call it that, between ponychan and 4chan just needs to stop.
And baked potatoe
Tons of potassium there :P
4There's a rivalry?
8its not even really a rivalry though
6It's not.
4I just thought they were insecure fags that didn't like FiM
7Isn't that sodium?
6Just, for lack of better word on my part.
6Basically, Ghosties.
11It's because of you dumbasses who keep bringing it up why people spam ponies. Jesus I don't even watch the show but when a picture of a colorful cartoon can send up in a raging fury, they have pretty much the perfect trolling tool to hold over you tools like the OP. Just ignore it and most of them will stop spamming it. Or will continue to post reaction imag
8its pretty much some assholes on 4chan that try and raid us from time to time and fail miserably
11This.
Not sure, but the skin might have it o.o
8yeah, thats pretty much right
4Yeah, pretty much.
http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/food/potassium-foods.htm < Here
4And look, in that same /v/ thread over there, they're fighting amongst themselves
4AGAIN
:D
Hi!
6Not surprised.
7Ooh, beans.
;p
4And why exactly would it be such a horrible, life-altering thing for them to post on those boards? People do it with anime shit all the time, why not ponies. Pretty sure you just aren't secure enough in your masculinity to accept someone else posting ponies on "your" board, so you have to act like a 7 year old who thinks he just got cooties
8tee hee
6Basically.
8that was me
6Nice.
4Hipster
4You silly filly you
8i finally got a chance to post my "everyone is mad" image too
4But still, even in that particular thread /v/ is fighting itself
4Oh, and let's not forget that fucking cryptic thread about a week ago on /oat
4I saved the picture
8what was the deal with that anyway?
6I love how the "typical thread on ponychan" image one guy posted was one of Hal's fail advice threads, which nopony really likes.
4Are you on /v/, Sprinkles?
4Oh, here's the pic
7Yeesh, what's with my fakemon and decomposing?
6Yeah, I'm on /v/
4and I have no idea Hipster. I think it's just 4chan being completely retarded again
4http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2cdzyq0&s=7
11I'm actually posting logical replies. See how much flame I get for it.
6...what post is you just now?
6Three just popped up.
4Silverscreen, is that your post about Hal's thread?
4As a frequent poster on Ponychan, I can say that that thread was dumb as shit and just some attention whore trying to brag about what awesome people skills he has. The rest of the thread was basically people telling him to fuck off and not be a giant faggot
4Was that you?
WAH
6lol chat window just refreshed itself
11nop, that wasn't me.
7Well, good night.
4Probably Hipster then
6If you looked up the site information, you'd find that you were in /oat/, a section of ponychan dedicated to randomness. /pony/ is where the serious discussion is held. Please do the research before you try do bash something.
11That one is mine.
8wasnt me
11also:
11You do realize that the first example you gave (somepony) was from the show itself, right? So it wasn't the fandom that did that. The second one, however, we happily accept.
4Well, whoever's post that was that I put in here is awesome
8i lold
8wait
8i think i was responding to the wrong thing
8im so confused
4Huh
8that thing you posted ghosties
8that was me
4I think someone on /oat/ is trying to stir up trouble on /v/
4Good job, Hip. For someone who never visits 4chan, I can truly say that you could pass as one of them (what with the lingo and all that bullshit)
6*typed up a huge post* *forgot to put in the verification captchalog* *not bothering with it again*
8lol sprinkles
6I need link again. Lost the tab.
8http://boards.4chan.org/v/res/97585285
6ty
11If you backspaced, you would have been fine.
11Backspacing brings back all you typed.
11"I didn't say I wasn't a tripfag. You assumed. Way to be wrong. And actually, I'm not completely supportive of the love and tolerance, seeing that I certainly approved of the banhammer being brought on those who trolled that suicide thread."
11:D
6You sir, win.
4I wasn't a part of that drama thread on Ponychan, though I most certainly was around for the lemon thread
11Yeah. that thread was insane.
6Waiting for their responses...
11I could tell it was serious from one thing: He gave a specific time.
8waiting for responses
8preparing trollface image
11lol
/me 11prepares pony image. >.>
11....note to self. Save trollestia image sometime.
I said... "WAH"
4lemon gave a specific time?
8silver, ill post one so you can save it
8god, these captchas are a pain in the ass
11I love the captchas. I'm pretty damn good at them.
11Ghosties: He specifically said he'd do it once he got his Rainbow Dash toy. That's pretty specific.
8i love this pic: http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhgduthh7a1qaylh3o1_400.png
4Oh right
4I thought you meant like a specific hour or whatever :S
Sneas, you recommend the movie then?
I was thinking about seeing it
!lag
o-o
o-o
lagging lag is laggy
or it's just not working
4Oh man, one particular post on that thread on /v/ actually made me laugh
sure be pessimistic
>:o
jk
XD
8which?
bbl
4We're not 12 year olds. We're just really mad. Every day. All the time. DUKE NUKEM HAS TWO FUCKING WEAPONS ENJOY YOUR SHIT GAME CASUALS
4I laughed pretty hard at that
4For two reasons
4One because it was from a /v/irgin, and two because he's paraspriting his own board
8i lold at that
8i dont even know shit about video games and i lold
6GEE IT SURE IS MANE-STREAM /V/ IN HERE. noob tube team kill lone wolves PRESTIIIIIIIIGE MLG FUCK YOUR KIDDY NINTENDO SHIT IMMA PLAYING HALO AND COD AND MADDEN BOOOOIIII
6lol'd so hard
4Haha
well apparently nobody has realized
6Okay, who just responded to my post with the RD Haters Gonna Hate image?
6*knockknock*
6Who just posted the RD HGH image?
They thought it was just a normal chat. They were wrong.
When WAH returns...
"I can't believe it -- it just flew right over our heads and left a trail of fire"
WAH?
"It was THIS close to my arm!"
what's WAH?
"I felt my spine shift... it was like I was imploding..."
o.o
4Not me sir
4I only once posted the Derpy Dragon Age II image
I agree with RDX
"There was just silence... then we heard a gurgling noise from the back room."
8wasnt i
o.o
WAH Season Finale, this Tuesday at 8/9 central.
4Fucking lol
Wagons And Hills?
4Some guy on /v/ made a valid argument for them against Ponychan and do you know what the response was?
Woot, All Happy?
umm
4"But I am better than you"
I'm lost
8lol, that was me again
!lag
yeah
or at the very least behind the "WAH"
4Stay salty Hip, you're doing your chan proud
ah
Then I got bored so I formed something to go with it.
why so frustrated?
Life is suffocating me.
8i try my best
that's not good
6This whole thing is just hilarious.
Nah, it's cool. I'm sort of getting a high from the asphyxiation.
you should make it better so it isn't suffocating you
oh, okay
03Yes I recommend it :3
Well, I punched Life's jugular. It backed off for a bit.
Then I reached for a bag of Fritos and it started strangling me.
Snuck up while I was off my guard, ya see.
8i almost wish there were more pony hatred threads like this, im having fun
4To be honest, I just wish the bronies on ponychan would stop trying to stir my shit up
4./v/'s gone back to fighting amongst themselves, let's just stop all this bs
8isn't that what 4chan does though?
4Yes, but we should be the bigger chan...
4Having said that, I do acknowledge that I am following the thread on /v/ and I am proud of my brony brethren for sticking up for the fandom and the show
/me plays Final Fantasy Dissidia 012
4Ahaha, the thread got 404'd
4And juuuuuuuust when it looked like /v/ was about to start talking about games in that thread
8finally got deleted
4*meanwhile, back on Ponychan*
11I was actually enjoying that.
6That was quite fun.
11I don't know if they think I was trolling or what, but I think that's the most I got to stretch my intelligent argueing for a long time.
http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/886263/4koma-comic-excadrill-pokemon-pokemon_black_and_wh
11Hey, they started it.
Had to go underwater for a second there.
6I was half being intelligent, half trolling.
11IF they butthurt over something, that's their problem. But don't go after us because you don't like what we like.
03I see black a white
/me doesn't click
03*and
6I loved their comments about furries.
6And they completely ignored my response to it.
11yeah, I was biting my tongue over that.
11I was biting it pretty damn hard.
8somepony on /oat/ tried to organize a raid and got slapped down by the whole community and 2 mods
8i fucking love Ponychan
hi
Hello
sup
11was it an anon or a tripfag?
8anon
other than that not much
11....damn 4chan. got me using that word.
you?
D:
11tripony.
8tripfriend*
11there.
4Wait, Hipster
I was out all day, had some good fishy lunch, went cd shopping and walked around seattle center
4Was it the "ITT: Post a pony image on /v/, /co/?"
Nice
siounds like it was a good day
YEPPP
8no
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35613915.html
8he got banhammered right away too
But did you slay any foul beasts? It's not a good day without a nice foul beast slaying.
6Saw that. Laughed so hard.
I devoured fish if that counts but it probably doesn't, so no
11This thread is made of win. Minus OP.
4Ah
8it got moved to /nop/ too
:O It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings.
yup
8nope*
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
11hmm, it's probably just a type 1 ban (view, don't post), so I don't think the ban was a bad thing.
6And it's only 1 day, with an appeal.
8how do people know that?
6I assume the anon that posted that it was was a mod.
8ah, ok
8it always confuses me when they post mod stuff without their mod tags
8which is more often than not
8just had a thought
8we should encourage people to use this place as general pony-related chat during the week
6I'm honestly surprised we haven't.
4Silver was trying to get something like that off the ground
4Like a channel dedicated to chatting with bronies
6Only problem would be that people could create trouble without a mod around.
8that could be an issue i suppose
4Yep
6Especially since most of us are same timezone.
4There'd have to be mods around all the time
4So you're talking about having bronies from different timezones at different times
Heya J.
8well, to be perfectly honest, people can do that now
How goes it?
#chatshack
8if they wanted to
I need to do somethings that I cant do here
lol, I saw.
6It would be harder to cause trouble here without any traffic, though..
4I don't know
You missed the promo for the WAH season finale.
It's gonna be intense.
6If the place got a good bit of traffic throughout the week, it would mean spammers and trolls.
what's wah?
Don't ask
:P
11ponychan bronies know how to handle spammers and trolls on their own. They've proven that already.
8too bad dari left
4Yeah
/me 11pokes Princ-dari with a stick.
6They know how to handle them, doesn't mean they have any way to make them stop.
8we need more half ops anyway, so we should try and get somepony from Europe
11but most of the Europe bronies are snoozing by the the time we really have anything going on.
8I mean, I can hold down chat from 2 PM to 11 PM
11I'm available all day sans 12-5
^ Good advice
6Honestly, I don't have any real time restrictions, seeing as I don't have a job.
8but you can't do it overnight
6I can, actually.
8i think thats where we have the biggest problem
8so like what times?
11Overnighting things?
6I'd be bored to tears, but I could.
4Sprinkles can, but what about sleep sprinkles?
6I'm up until like, 6 in the morning every day anyway.
11I'm always awake by 9
8im up at 7, but i have to go to work
6Only problem is it would kill my personal life.
8lol, i always forget other people have personal lives
4Yeah, patrolling a chat would kill my personal life as well
hi aurora
4Since I have classes this summer and all that
/me 11is available from 9-12 then from 5-2
4And I should really come out of my room at some point >_>
What if... computers... ran things?
11What's this "Personal Life" thing you're talking about?
6look, an anon
11:P
/me 11pokes mib_i54urz with a stick
8so if we were to do it now, we would be unmoderated between 2 and 9 am, pretty much?
11Yep.
11Unless we set up a board about getting Euromods for it.
11er, thread, not board.
8yeah
4There's a problem with leaving the room unmoderated though
8well, we would be getting mods for those hours
8im just trying to think what hours we need to fill
6Again, I can cover whenever.
8For the next 2 months at least, Ponychan is pretty much my personal life
11So far it isn't a problem, but that's because there's nopony here.
8I don't want to ask you to mod from 2-9 am though
8thats not really fair to you
6Honeslty wouldn't be difficult.
4Here's how I see it, if you leave the room unmoderated for anybody then while paraspriting may not be an issue, what if somebody gets smart and tries to find out about the brony state mods room and shit
8we can create a new mods room then
8honestly we just have to create a new room that only we know the name of
4On that topic, we should really create a room that wouldn't be so easy to crack
4Brony State Mods is way way too obvious
6...anon in the room.
8well, we have to change it now
4>___________________________________________________________>
8ghosties, just PM us the name you want to change it to
4yEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT. i HONESTLY DID NOT SEE THE RANDOM ANON UP THERE
6...now the anon leaves
6I pointed out the anon as soon as they joined.
4Oh shit
11interesting.
8honestly not a big deal
8we're alone now, so we dont even have to PM
8what should the name be?
4Well, at least now we can finally come up with a new room ^_^;
4Flutes and Barrels?
11Dunno. I'm getting too tired to think of a name right now.
11we could have a floating room.
11meaning we change it every week.
6Not a bad idea.
4Yeah, might as well go with that
11decide during mod meetings what the name is, based ont he week's movies.
4Yeah, I'm fine with that
8#Flutewood
8join it now

way to be original dude
it was that or a dwaggy

I admit, half the reason I just said that was to get on dari's auto-ignore
That's right, herpaderp.
I invented that fursona, but Pokemon STOAL IT.

Espeon, you are a 10Darumaka.
06I'm... surprisingly fine with this.
06It's what Flareon should be. Kind of.
!pokemon
ew
Cynder good to see you again.
6Hey :P
6Good to see you too ^^
13Hey!
13DSD?
13Uxie here!
13Man, I was too late!
6Hey!
6How you doin'?
13Good!
13Just got up to Sunken Ruins in Spyro: A Hero's Tail!
13I also just completed the Light Cycle in Kingdom Hearts II
Late?
Did you not bring tea to our party?
13Opps, sorry
13Oh, how far are oui (you) on Spyro: A Hero's Tail?
When your late your sound like the white rabbit
I just mad it past Gnorc
I tried the glitch
13Good! :)
13Where are oui now?
But all i could do is charge past the tree
aand then i fell over the edge
13Yeah, it's very trickey...
Uxie e3 starts in about 30 to an hour
13Alright! But how are fa (we) going to get the infomation?
13Oh, I'm currently at the Sunken Ruins
6Aaa..Sunken Ruins..I had gotten stuck there for a little while the first time..
6Have you gotten to Cloudy Domain yet or is that after?
13Cloudy Domain is next!
6Awesome :D
Well i think i have found a live stream for me since i don't have tv to watch
6I love the music in that level.. :3
13Yeah, I've adapted it into one of my videos.
6:3
4So what happens is we list of stuff they talk about like the names off new characters or other stuff.
4*off
13Yep!
6I'm going to be silent for a while..BlameTruth time ftw!
4ok
13I'll keep an eye out for any videos of the E3
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuftrsG4WCg
13Spyro video with theme of Cloudy Domain, in case you are wondering
13It's got scenes from FFXII
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEpFkClI8F0&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
4Uxie did you see the pic i uploaded for that spyro game?
13Video about the E3 Spyro. (Reaction is quite negitive)
4Well Haters going hate
13This is horrible!
4But i want this game and the little figures
4?
13Me too!
13Those haters are not true fans... :(
4Yes the figures will pawn
4Now i can have fun alone with figures or with friends
4:D
4UxieLover1994 in the e3 vid at 0:17
4to the far left moves slowly to the right
4It looks like a red dragon
4Now it's not the black griffon but it looks more like a red dragon flying
4That or it's a flying croc
4Maybe a lizard or a hippogriff
13At least we can get all 32 within' days.
13The over-hating of a new game has really shown how much people have changed...
4Yea
4Well i'm not sure about the figures
4They maybe days apart maybe weeks or a complete set
4They also may do so different stuff
4For all we know they might do a dark spyro and spyro set
13E saih: We could get all 32 at the same time, because nobody would want them. (This is a joke)
4Really i think you might be right
4Anyways in the vid Spyro is seen talking to gill grunt and trigger happy
13Yeah, I estimate that only 5% of the fans of the classic games would buy the game and toys! And two of us are right here!
4But it doesn't look like talking
13Maybe they don't talk?
4Maybe
6Hell yeah! Cloudy Domain music! Now I wanna play AHT.
4Or he is just shaking his head at trigger happy being crazy
4WB Cynder
6Thx :P
4:p
13I just showed a video for the E3, but almost everyone hates the new game
6Basically I'm gonna watch another video but I'm just taking a small break.. :P
6*watches*
6Is it me or does the whole thing kinda sound like Spyro 1 and 3,where in 1 the dragons got frozen and in 3 they got banished..?
4Yea
4But it is sorta like the old games
4Hm my game isn't working
13Only 42 out of over 450 like the new game!
13I'm horrified!
4Yea
6Spyro looks even uglier in this video.. :P
4Hopeful i am that it pawns all of them
6Idk but something just tells me this game'll be at least better than the previous ones..
13Yep. All those haters are not true fans...
13 44 good, 433 bad
6Honestly I've kinda gotten over Spyro in the past two years but still..If anything new and good comes out,I'd be more than willing to play it..
6D:
4Whats funny is the day i looked up to see if they had a new spyro game not long after you pinged me uxie
13Yeah, it is! :)
6No doubt all the negative stuff is coming from the fact that Spyro looks shitty..
6Or basically not all but most of it..
4I like the idea of a two player Spyro but you can also pvp
6I'm so happy that SC is alive again! :D
13Yeah, he looks bad, but does it really matter?
4I mean it really shows right there how much time you put into it
6Same..Online would be pure awesomeness..
4Yea
6It seems that it does matter to quite a few.. ._.
4Yea
4But i like how in most games doing pvp fights don't really matter
4Here it's all about the levels you put in
6Maybe they dislike the fact that now they made Spyro a toy or something..,think the whole storyline seems rather lame.. -.-
13UPDATE: 46 fans, 458 haters!
4I don't know
13Why can't the haters grow brains?
4I think i like the idea of a toy of Spyro
6I hope the levels are really huge areas..
4Where you can play off game or on game
4With friends or without
6I'm not sure about how much I like it.. :P
4:p
6Can Spyro fly in this game? Like he did in DotD?
4Fly like free fly mode?
4I'm not sure
13I've made up plenty of Spyro stories (from the classic series). Why not make it into a TV series that takes place after Shadow Legacy?
6Yeah..
4But he has been seen to hover and fly around
6Why did they cancel the movie?
13That's what Activision should also do to keep the old fans
6Yeah..It'd be cool to have the flight again..
13Because of the new game
6Ah.
13That's why
6Was the story going to be all the TLoS?
13I think so
4Yes
4I think it was going to be all of the games in one
6I wonder what extra stuff they'd put in the story..I mean,even if you put all the cutscenes together and some fighting stuff,it still won't be much..
13If I could, I would make a small show with the classic Spyro characters for YouTube use. Maybe Activison would hire us to put it on TV and keep the fans, while they continue with the new game
4It would make about a hour long film
13Also, a comic book on the classic games would do, as well
6That'd be fun :3
13I've got ideas that could be possible if we had permission and money...
/me 4thinks a story about Red before Spyro would be nice
6Oh yeah..iFail..I was thinking more about the scenes of TEN and didn't think much of the time of the others..
13You mean a prequel to AHT?
4Yea theres maybe about an hour in each game
4Yes
6Yeah..
6Aaah,Red's awesome..
4I want to know more about red from his point of view
13Okay! We should also have a side-story on some of Spyro's friends, such as Bentley or Sgt. Byrd
4Right
13Yeah, I also wish I could se how Red became evil
/me 4wonders if Uxie is really going to do this
4If you are count me in.
13I could draft the stories. Once I've written about five, we'll get to the next step: animate it
13I would be voicing Bianca, Elora, Greta and maybe some CotDs
6CotD?
13Who would you voice?
13Character of the Day
6AH
6*Ah
13Negitive comments are getting worse!
6D:
4D:
6Just a few more months till they're all proven wrong!
4 4months
6Guess we'll have to wait till then.. ._.
4I wish there was a dragon news site
4That hosted Stuff about Spyro
4like the game fan art work
13Yeah, but until the game's released, it will be four months of negitive comments and anti-Spyro bullying
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADnZrhFAmm4&feature=channel_video_title :3
13Not interested.
13Sorry
/me 4clicks
4XD
4i choose the win
6:P
6Same :3
4:3
6Except from hitting his head on the light,the rest of the thing must've felt quite awesome.. :P
4Yea :p
4XD
4Thats funny
6x3
4The colors you guys use are the base of red
4So in a way we all use red
6:O
4:o
4And then icy uses blue a part of purple
4So e3 is set to happen in about 43 mins
13UPDATE: 65 good, 707 bad
13Make that 67 good, 712 bad
6:3
6How come people are watching it so much?
6Woo! Msn time. :3
4Uxie we need mods
13People are not watching the video: they are trashing the series!
4Make it so
4Also they are socks
13There's only four of us at the wiki
4They use more then one account
13And we're all admins
4K i'm demoting Mecha kthxbai
4<Joke>
4Anyways we need to fuse with Spyropedia
/me 4is just going to link to the spyro forums
13Okay
13There are no active Burocrats, sadly
4well
6Stupic heat.. ._.
4if we fuse we should be able to get a b-crat
4Yes
13Hopefully...
4Maybe we could convert Cynder and icy to us
4Also we need the ok to fuse
4Then get the rights of admin
6?
6*slightly_confuzzled_about_what_is_going_on*
13Have you ever heard of Wikis?
6Yeah
4Like wikipedia annd wikia
4Well wikia is where we were from
4Till they forced a skin on us that killed everything
4So we left
13Si! DSD and I run the Spyro Wiki at ShoutWiki. We are hopeing to merge with Spyropedia
!pokemon
4and became shout wiki
4But we need some members
13Yep! Those snooty staff members also ignored everyone
13http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page
13That's our (current) site
4Yea
4So now we need some members
!pokemon
4Now seeing as you have a spyro fourms account we just need to merge with Spyropedia
!pokemon
>:D
4brb my comp is lagging
13That's right!
4Yea
4Yea disk clean up FTW
4Now my comp moves faster
4No just to be sure not to make a mistake Cynder are you a boy or girl?
6Girl :P
6So the goal is to collect lots of members atm,right?
4Yes
4:p
6:3
4We a trying to be a place full of Spyro
4Now becoming one with spyropdia will allow us the right of being a set off the forums
4:3
6Interesting.. :3 :3
D:
4:3 :3
6So you'd want to spread it on the forum and stuff firstly?
4Yes
4brb i need to restart my comp

4And the cotton?
13Please don't mention that word. It makes me sad
6Ok,I do htg for a while..Hopefully I'll be on again soon..
13Remember the other night?
hello
4Uxie your not are you?
13Sorry
4If you are it's ok
13I just... don't want to talk about the incerdent that me made a fan of the Pride Lands no more
4:/
13It's a long story
4It's ok
4I think i have gotten it all up
13Okay!
4Amy cotton was a user of the kh wiki but sorta went bad but i think might have gone good after it all
13Don't mention about her around me.
13Sorry, but she reminds me of the incodent
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
13She... is... very sorry for all this. Please don't make this pubic
4I'm not
4I understand
Roara
Seen the doctor yet?
nope
gonna call today
or tomorrow
cuz it's gonna take a lot more than just walking in
13Thanks! :)
Ich.
Do get it seen as soon as possible
I'm worried about that
6I know lol
It might be something serious ><
6everyone is saying the same thing
6parents mentioned tonsils might need to be removed
6which is fine by me, I've lost 7 pounds in a week and a half
6because it takes me an hour to eat a meal that should take 10 minutes
Wow, that must be painful
Could it be infected tonsils?
Then again, you could be in a lot of pain if it was that
6yeah it doesn't hurt
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003115.htm
4:)
6add this to my long list of problems lololol
Allergies eep
I think I might be starting to become allergic to mint
6allergies, temp low blood sugar, a heart that decides to have random spaz moments
I can't use any mint-cooling shower foam without feeling tight afterwards
And a heart that spazzes?
No good
6nope
Well, for me I have my teeth and my disgestive system messing with me all the time
Now it's constipated ><
Oh yeah, and skin problems as well
eczema, dry cracking hands, etc.
6yay for problems
yay indeed
I'm a bit worried about your heart thing as well
6I don't even know what's with the heart
6it's so random that it would be nearly impossible for doctors to monitor
6without having something on me 24/7
Hmmm
Could be related to your swallowing
Might be your nervous system spazzing, or something
6nah
Tell your doctor about it,
6my heart's done this for a couple years
6swallowing is recent
When did the heart problem start? And how?
6like i said
6I don't know
6heck for all I know, it's not the heart itself
6it basically feels like a muscle twitch
Hmmm
Maybe a chest x-ray or something might reveal something
06o.o
What Espeon
And Roara, you still there?
6yeh
6sorry was in the kitchen
K
But as I was saying, maybe get a chest x-ray done
Might reveal something
Anyway rbr
4UxieLover1994 you died in freenode
13Eh?
4rejoin
13YEah, but I cannot be on much longer
4aw
4ok
13Once SSA comes up (if it does today), please put up as much info on my talkpages as possible
4ok

Wow What
Mac OS X Lion can be downloaded and installed in place from the Mac App store
and it costs US$29
And finnaly resize window from any edge
It won't come in a disc
Only from the App Store
this is retarded
People with slow or no internet, or people who need a physical media so they can reinstall it in case of disaster are going to be unhappy bunnies
i bet apple's going to be like "sorry we <censored> up here's your cds" so people will love them
oh cool
lopl
Heh
At least ship them in thumb drives, or something
EW Mads
or you know
:P
compact discs
*macs
i honestly wouldn't mind getting a mac if i had that much money to spare somehow or i got it for free
See how stupid it is :P
Why spare it on a mac when you could spend it on the best PC ever :P
what if i already got a kick-ass PC and had some $5,000 to spare
:0
12rawr
anyway i need to leave for a while
Spend it on a kick ass 60in TV for your living room and a entertainment center
Such a better choice, since everyone can profit :P
i never watch TV or play console video games
what if i live alone
:0
Get yourself a girlfriend
Simple as that, and spend the money on dates :P
Or movies and jewlrey
Or to your life savings for marrige/retirement
So many smart ways to spend money
/me rawrs~

03as 95% of stuff that exists sucks, that applies to E3 as well.
06The sidebar chat was amusing though
06In the middle of Skyrim and such people just screamed MW3 > BF3 or the other way around all the time
03LOL
They all suck IMO
06And PC elitism and infinite amounts of ignorance
03^
06How fun
But that's just silly old me
is nintendo's conference tommorow?
03the only thing I'm remotely interested in is the Wii 2 and even then, it's prolly not finalized which means we can expect something wildly different to hit shelves

Unless a shooter requires you to use your brain, I don't like it :P
6what is this
03yeah
YEs rora

Oh
Well
This is embarrassing >_>
I thought you were gonna be away Dari
for like two weeks
Yeah, I'm just about to go to bed, been working all day.
BTW for a mod room it'd be better just to have a fixed room with a password, as anyone can find the room in 10 seconds flat with /whois otherwise.
7Back.
wb Quan
hai quan

8color
UGH, too many shooters presented at E3

I just saw the world's most ghetto ice cream truck
I would be scared to approach it
Hey Hip
Just Dance 3 -.-
8DCD is gonna be in tonight
4Nice
4Oh, and Dari said something about a fixed mod room with a password
nah I don't sleep
4If he'd say something again then I'd like to here about it
I was actually delivering my old TV to my neighbor down the street
Well, I'm leaving in 2 minutes. :P
8yeah, DCD was going to bring that up too
[23:11] BTW for a mod room it'd be better just to have a fixed room with a password, as anyone can find the room in 10 seconds flat with /whois otherwise.
8i think he already knows how to do it, so its cool
12Took that long?
Alright, going to bed then, cya later.
8bye dari
4Bye dari
hi
Hey
Well we also had to take the old hutch ou tof his house and deliver it to his office down in town so yes
4XD
sup
not much
But you can fly.
just got back from work
you/
HE'S NOT REAL!
also ew dynamite song
x_x
*?
on neopets
I WISH I was playing pokemon stadium 2 but there's a bee in the house
yah
Cruz's song sucks
so I fled to the back and I'm stuck here til my mom gets home
D:
12Imposter!?!?!
Nah, he's a hallucination.
because FUCKING DOUCHEBAG DOWNSTAIRS left the sliders wide open last night and let a shit ton of bugs in the house
We worked this out ages ago.
last night there were flies everywhere
he was like LOL OH I WAS JUST STANDING ON THE DECK FOR A FEW MINUTES
WELL is it THAT FUCKING HARD TO SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU
The real RDX went to work for Pepsi and couldn't come back because he was so ashamed.
yep
/me trololololololo
lol
what he said
I still wouldn't even care if there was still a fly or two in the house but NO I am not dealing with bees
4Wait, how do we create a fixed room with a password?
Are you alergic to bees?
no.
8i think we have to register it somehow
but I'm not taking the chances of getting stung
8we can ask DCD when he gets in here
Lawl.
/me hmms
hell, I might be, I don't know because I've never been stung.
I don't get why people are so scared of them, they don't sting you if you don't bother them.
12D:
the new Raving Rabbids looks interesting <late>
I'm losing faith with Ubisoft )=
12I thought it was coke?
it is lol
well it freaks me out to even see them and you all know how extra wimpy I am about EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE
he's just screwing with you
You are? O_o
in 4th grade I was afraid of the sky and being open near the sky with nothing to hang on in case I got sucked up into the atmosphere
4True
go ahead laugh
lol
Sounds pretty cool.
12I'm not that stupid sir...
Life would be more awesome if you could get sucked out into the sky.
oh shut up

8we can go through stuff quick then
8!!Derpy likes my music suggestions, HEE HEE HEE HEE
it's okay, let's take our time
I come bearing great news
remember that test that got postponed to THIS Saturday
4Yeah?
8http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kpowqoR2Wn1qzma4ho1_400.jpg
and because of it I wasn't going to be able to stream this past Friday?
it got postponed. AGAIN
4Man
8lolwut
either for next Monday or next Friday.
8thats awesome tho
that means I will be able to stream Friday
4That test just ain't ever gonna get taken :'( Poor test
so no problems there
that brings me to our next point
8i have never had a test get postponed twice
Me?
I've been
Somewhere
actually I think the professor just didn't communicate well and she meant it would't be either of these Saturdays
but still
I'm available this Friday
8continue...
anyways
BronyState Intermission is going to occur before the Mario movie, since it's our B-Movie
Somewhere North
o-o
8ok, so after the 1st pony episode?
oh isn't that ironic
if I can put the finishing touches on the Ace Combat Squad
that will be this Friday
if not
I'm using mIRC, so I won't be changing the color of my text.
I'm going like twice the speed limit to get here in a hurry
4Speaking of which, what do you think of Assault Horizon, DCD?
and my sister isn't even ready
14Well, you should stay here
14more
14okay
14you canadian
I need to talk to my damn internet provider. That's the third time today my internet stopped working.
I'll try to fight Astray man-to-man in Blazblue, since I noticed Ragna has color palettes I like to call "Rarity Ragna", "Applejack Ragna", and "Pinkie Pie Ragna"
8silver is getting trolled by the internet
and I main him so yeah
4DCD, what did you think of Assault Horizon; the new Ace Combat?
also Ghosties: Project Aces hasn't made a _bad_ game yet, so I think that will probably be the case. Whether it's a good entry to the AC Franchise, we'll see when it's out
And for some reason the chat in Bronystate kept resetting on me.
4Ah
7MAY
7*late*
4I dunno...I don't like the new direction for the series with this game.
4It feels way too much like Call of Duty BUT WITH FIGHTER PLANES!!11
I mean
so long as they don't change the _atmosphere_ of the game
as in, the moody music
and the inmersion
8hi sprinkles
14QUAN
4The music is almost always good
14HI
it always is
4As well as the immersion
7How've you been?
14okay
14just
I just mean the whole ambient I guess
Hey, sprinkles.
4But I really liked the world they had with the older games
6Hey guys
o3o
14just
just
14whyyyy
what
EW THAT FACE
what happened? XD
o3o
EW THAT FACE
4It felt almost magical, or anime-ish but with a military spin on it
14the existance of das boot
o3o
oh, Strangereal?
4Now, it just feels realistic *shrugs*
EW THAT FACE
I'm not too worried about that
because of Joint Assault
6Using friend's comp, so typing is kind of screwed up.
which takes place in the real world
I still don't understand that commercial o3o
14just
8wait a minute, why did "the official wingboner thread" get stickied on /oat/?
why are you trying to get me to press my up arrow? yes my phone has one
14its just
02CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN <3 ~
14just
13:3
CHEN?! O3O
EW THAT FACE
also keep in mind that that's why I'm not too worried is because the Real World games are not numbered
4I never played Joint Assault...I just hope that the old canon isn't tossed away
...LOL, You Spin Me Round is on the radio
6I miss anything?
lol o3o
4Right, I hope that at some point we'll see Ace Combat VII
YOU SPIN ME ROUND LIKE A RECORD BABY
4Not really Sprinkles
They're talkking about video games right now.
6Cool.
13it's one of the many Touhou banners I made out of boredom one night |D
13I've got like 16 others
ALL I KNOW IS THAT TO ME, YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR LOTS OF FUN
er youre
'
Well it's Touhou, so it's cool o3o
Sorry in advance if I sound a bit like a douche. My good monday slowly went sour.
EW THAT FACE
6I passed out, Silver. Do I win the bad Monday competition?
4Don't worry about Silver
4And DCD, I hope you're right
13Lol drf, you're starting to sound like a broken record o3o
May!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me glomps a May
8i had a great monday, up until one specific moment
Long time no seey!!!
see*
so are you with that face
and
DRF
/me glomps a drf
4Eh, I'm having a bleh Monday
drf, have you heard that iOS5 their copying android's notification thingy
/me waits for drf to rage
nope
8my boss told me i was the best intern they have ever had at the football program and gave me a polo that only the coaches have
hi Angel o3o
implying I actually care what apple is stealing this time
o.o okays
they've been at it since the 80s, nothing new
awesome.
I'd never expect them to steal other people's ideas
4That's awesome, Hip!
8then when i was riding my bike home from the stadium, it fell off my shoulder and got caught in the spokes
Yikes.
4The Polo didn't get ripped, did it?
6Ouch.
6...wow, Ghosties. XD
same here. Well, my days tend to get screwed when my mom pops up and starts getting annoying, but whatever
in any case
8no, its super sturdy, but it has rubber all over it
I wish to know what's the situation with TurniBrony
8from the tire
8ok
XD
8ill take it
8he has been paraspriting the shit out of our threads
everyone steals from everyone else
get over it
yeah
4o.o wut Sprinkles?
8he constantly complains about the movies, called us soft and implied we were corrupt
pour example?
oh right
that guy
o.o whats that
well
I loved that movie :D
6Nothing, Ghosties.
a movie
4Corrupt? Is he too spouting INJUSTICE
yeah
I'd say we better let him continue instead of downright banning him
OK, bbl
for the following reasons:
8im not going to ban him yet
4o.O
a) We have no control over Ponychan, and he'd continue posting and paraspritin' even worse.
8but i told him that he needs to stop with his constant criticism
8if he does that, i will report him
b) He might start going around saying shit about us that could make us lose viewers.
c) He's basically harmless
8he literally does nothing on the thread but complain about the movies and criticize the mods
Let the Chihuahua yip
8oh, i agree
we should just give him a stern talking to, I'll take care of that
that way people WILL see that this is just some obnoxious fuck
8hes harmless, but i hate that he messes with the the thread every week
<May> 14you canadian <-- Yes, I is Canadian.
:)
but if we were to ban him for that, we'd be basically giving the unarmed man a rocket launcher
4I still think he has some valid points
04Sky :D
drf: kay, I'll check it out
6It's the way he expresses those points that's the problem.
4Or rather, I appreciate his interest in difference of opinion when it comes to films; the guy likes Videodrome, after all
4But yeah, he's getting to the point that he bitches and moans
8i agree with some of the points, but he is an asshole about most of them
14lol anyways
14I'm addicted
14to this stupid commercial
13http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/flandrebanner1.png
let him keep bitchin' and moanin' until HE truly gets out of hand, so people realize he brought this upon himself
I don't mind the criticism, ghosties. It's that he doesn't give them as opinions, he expresses them by bitching at us. Not to mention that he's also paraspriting the mods.
like which points?
also
6I agree with some aswell, which is why I suggested the live streaming of the picks to rule out pressure.
14omg
14no
14i want that
don't some of the Color Schemes look like certain ponies to you? http://www.giantbomb.com/blazblue-continuum-shift/61-28321/all-images/52-371507/ragnacolorchart/51-1548200/
/me hugs Angel Tightly
02Thx~
02In reward
if the Intermission is by playing Blazblue
which should I pick?
AJ Ragna, Rarity Ragna, or Pinkie Ragna?
4Right Sprinkles. And DCD, I said I just appreciated his difference of opinion. He's not afraid to speak up, I like that. But his opinion is becoming obnoxious now. He's been moaning about the BMN for the past two weeks
6Rarity
13xD
14can I have a Remilia one?
4AJ Ragna
4Honestly, DCD should just play as Taokaka. She's the best character anyways
8dcd, he made points about how we were basically getting the same kinds of movies every week because people felt pressured to pick ones that everyone would like instead of what they liked
13http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t190/xxHarmonyAngelxx/remiliabanner.png
A point we've constantly went against when people got to choose their movie.
which we really can't do anything against
hell, the rolling guarenteed that didn't happen.
4And he's kinda right, too. But that's why we're doing the voice only command during the live stream and picking the winners during the BMN
Voice-Only Command?
13the Remilia banner is one of my least favourites, actually |D I might try to make a better one the next time I'm hit with boredom
oh
OH
I see what you mean
The mute setting
however
Hello everyone.
there IS a problem
4?
8well, it's something we have talked about
only Registered Nicks can be given voice
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
6Nope.
8i thought of this today
or at least I think so
nope.,
6I used my unregistered secondary yesterday.
that sounds like a good idea
We tested it with an unregistered nick yesterday.
Only Mods need to be registered.
8we already have kind of a problem with people in europe not being available for the selection because of the time change
4Yeah, we should be fine with people picking their choice during the stream
8it's going to be that much worse if we do it after the stream
6How about around a half hour before?
4Luckily, we got dari for a mod and he's a Brit brony
but half of the eurobros aren't even awake for the event.
4Well
8we're trying to change that though
hai :3 long time no see
Hiya
8unfortunately, dari just went to sleep
4We could do the drawing live during the preshow
nah we should do it
between movies
as in
8but he said he knows how to stream
A bit of my awesome nerd awesomeness was rather... damaged the other day.
during the Intermission Period
8he could be our european streamer
I have a question.
p+p
o-o
4Eh, if you think it would be best. But yes, Dari could be our euro streamer
Other than the minor confusion, what was wrong with rolling for the movies?
yeah
Brony Movie Night East is a thing I've wanted for it to happen for a while
I mean, the only reason why we changed it is because our threads were moved to /chat/
but now that it's back in /oat/ we could simply make it another roll game.
7Porque?
4Rolling was an absolute mess though. Everyone was trying to roll for trips and it was generally a push and shove contest
mrewwwo
but Roll Game has the same problems
not to mention that now that I know how to GET
I would be getting Trips all day erryday
My KSR-33 Teletype has become a massive write-off...
And slightly biohazardous.
6Roll game just wasn't the greatest plan there was.
6New system is 20x better.
6IMO
SIrSprinkles: Sans the whole corruption and suggestion thing.
6Hence why we'd be doing it during the stream now.
I need you
o.o
where are you?
kk
Ok
o/
well
everything has gone to chaos on my server
6Every system has kinks to work out initially.
8if people accusing us of corruption becomes an issue, i will screencap the thing i use for it and post
4Exactly, this way we can get rid of the whole "bias" bs
okay people
the question is this
IMO, I think we should do it on Saturday if we want to do it in the chat. This'll give everypony a good time to get on since Saturday is usually a slow day, and it won't take away from the stream.
when should we make the Roll?
4By way of streaming the drawing live we can finally get rid of all the corruption calling
4Roll?
during Intermission, Preshow, or at the end of all of the menu?
well
not roll
the drawing, then
4You mean the draw?
4Ah
8well, here's the thing
8i would want to do it at the end to give people an incentive not to leave early
8but
8most of the eurobronies wouldn't be able to stay up that late
6Saturday just seems like a lot of setup for such a little thing. I think we should do it afterwards or during intermission since we're already set up, and again, incentive not to leave early.
Intermission show, then
Alright Sony
convince me to buy a PS3
8ok
8here's what we should do then
4So, we do the drawing during the intermission. Sounds good
8on friday, i'll put up a thread on /oat/ to enter
XD
So when does the thread go up?
oh.
8friday morning that is
8and we can let people know during pre-show and during the pre-movie announcements
I just thought of something.
"Now my editor friends tell me nothing makes their day like a controversy. My answer to them: You're welcome"
in regards to the PSN incident
also
If TurniBrony ever wants to give his choice of movie, he'd have to watch some of the show if we continue to use this.
better make sure Seth posts the Brony Movie Night news on Friday
now he's apologizing to everyone else
8for sure DCD
:P
8i'll make sure to ask him to post on friday
4That's a good point, Silver. Turni would actually have to show up
8silver: trollface.jpg
4Do you think Turni would finally stop complaining if he won a drawing?
8nope.avi
nope.avi
8http://cdn3.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/098/410/original/1297321717120.gif?1297327490
4COMBO BREAKER
4dammit, hip >_<
8u mad?
Hipster: How about I web your shit?
4i ain't even mad
02o-o
6How are we doing with the listserv, btw, since I've been noticing a lot of people coming in a day or two late that I guess can't READ that it's on a Friday, not to mention all the people that show up immediately after the showing thinking it's just about to start.
8http://www.meh.ro/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/meh.ro6205.jpg
>just saw the Luna toy
THE HORROR
THERE'S A LUNA TOY?! o.o
8oh god, even our chat isnt safe from a spiderman derail
8the hasbro toys suck massively
6If you can call it that, Silver.
4That picture...*shudder*
8celestia is always pink for some reason
4Those proportions ARE NOT RIGHT
6God I hate this keyboard... >>;
Yeah, I heard that, for some reason, Pinkie comes with a fucking bunny instead of Gummy.
I'm here
Your server is okay
Yeah, I know
4KITTY GOES ON BACK
Hipster some are pretty decent
4You mean those toys?
just no ports are binding
the AJ toy is pretty okay
but this
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/5825b745be2902d374bc8e4c4423e2df/20681%20-%20celestia%20luna%20toy.png
and its all messed up
is pretty OH GOD WHAT
4Like Twilight has a cat
Looks okay to me
/me 6has Pinkie. Disappoint that no Gummy.
4Yeah, those are the ones. Twilight has a cat, and Dash has the turtle
try to run: /home/stefan/inspircd/inspircd
run it
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmabalWDIv1qcoci5.jpg
.....
yeah, no.
8the custom stuff is always much more well done though
8like this: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e0aUHfpu9dY/Te08g8kR8dI/AAAAAAAAFhE/GmgHA-ufw3A/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg
8pink celestia: do not want
6So, again, where do we stand on the listserv?
4...Why is Luna one of the previous gens and Celestia a re-color?
also
No idea where we are with the listserv.
8sprinkles, [spiderman i dunno lol pic]
the admin for the channel I mentioned, Hipster, is on now
how about I talk to her aboot this?
8i still think we should try and run this one though, it would be smaller and a little more "intimate" for lack of a better word
8people would know each other more
We don't outsource. :P
8it would be a lot of people that come to movie night, so people would get the joke when we post a pic of a flute
8stuff like that
it definitely won't be "smaller"
4The listserv is sending emails and notifications to other people, right?
considering this gets like 200 visitors
Ghosties: Yes.
yeah
the other gets like 80 on a good day
6Yeah, Ghosties.
Im here
sorry, did I time out again?
still feels kinda dickish
8i doubt we will get 200 people for regular chat though
this is kind of their turf
4Ah, okay ^_^
so yeah
wait, what?
8whats wrong with having multiple pony chat sites?
Are we talking about moving to a different server or something?
4Are we doing another channel?
8no
Hey HSX :)
8well
8kind of
8so we brought up using this site as general chat last night
Right.
8DCD is saying we should basically merge chat with the IRCHighway channel for my little pony
at least for the GENERAL chat
yeah, how about no?
8so we wouldnt be hosting it
this would still be the movie night chat
We're already catching shit from 4chan and the like for invading them with ponies.
but otherwise, the General Chat would stay in the General chat
8no no
o-o
8silver
8this is the MLP dedicated channel on IRC
wat
8we wouldnt be invading anyone
the channel that, incidentally, I am a regular on
4All it would take is for some wiseguy to leak it to 4chan
4And oh boy
4You wanna talk about a shit storm
8thats what mods are for
fun fact: #mylittlepony is known to 4chan, they just don't visit it
4I think we'd be pressing our luck, but hey, maybe it'll work
it was mentioned in today's general thread, actually
8but i do want to use this site for chat
8outside of the general movie night that is
how about this? I'll tell her about this, and ask her to come here
4As I've mentioned before, I wouldn't be able to moderate the chat all the time.
if the case is that, I'll add another widget to the site
4That's asking for a lot
6Though it will take a while to get this site up and running for that purpose, Hipster.
linking to that channel
which can be used as general chat
The site is merely to host the Movie Night event.
6I know.
8well, we basically have moddig covered except for like 3-9am
8if i remember correctly
12:P
6But some shifts only have one mod.
6What if they can't do a day.
Right. I'm always up and on by 9 in the morning.
8we need to recruit more mods anyway
8we can check with dari next time he is on
04Anyone remember me being disappointed by the Pandora?
4Do you guys think we'll need more mods for a general chat?
8cuz he can mod overnight stuff since he's in england
04I TAKE THAT BACK.
04:'D
8probably one or 2 at least
How expensive is it o.o
02O-o
7o.o
Ghosties: Only for when we aren't available.
7What's this Pandora I've been hearing?
14fangirl script works again
!fangirl
JAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<3
!fangirl
EXCALIBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR!
!fangirl
FLANDREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Boo
14boo you
May oxo
hai
7Ooh, that script!
7I miss it. :3
squeak.
7!fangirl
HIBARIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!
Same here :3
7Ah, nope.
7!fangirl
PRUSSIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
w00t prussia
wow Aero
haythar
4*shrugs* At least we have dari over the in the UK like Hip said. He can mod for when we're asleep. Finding mods that can help us with the workload would be advantageous...but where are we gonna find mods that actually WANT to mod the chat? We were lucky to find Sprinkles
you just missed flandre
Aero too
7Question: What's 3:00 PDT in EST time?
PS3 is great if you want a blueray player and a good gaming machine all in one
laaa
6:p
FLANDRE?
D':
14uhm
14PDT?
yes, but I don't see the point in buying it when it hardly has any good games that I can't already play
14Whats that?
7Pacific.
the uncharted series is really it for me
pacific daylight time
14oh
145 PM maybe
7Okay. o3o
well then if you are an abscent gamer don't invest in such things
Personally I got it for GTA4
I thought it was +3 hrs o.o
Odd
and a few good games after that
yeah, I could play that on my 360
and I'll need it for KH3
KH3 is coming out?
14I don't know
I need to finish the first two yet
14I don't normally check what time it is in New York
not for awhile
it's not even announced yet
8well, hopefully we will get Bristle back soon
I normally check almost every timezone xD
good, I have time :P
they can't start work on it until they're done with Final Fantasy whatever number they're on
14I pay attention only to Aussie time
13-2
14normally
a sequel to a sequel
yeah whatever it is
XD
eh
8i've been keeping an eye out for potential new half-ops too
We're doing good so far, with 200 bronies in the room and the turbo chat only appearing now and then, and in the past five weeks we've only had a total of 8 bans. so starting the chat off wouldn't be too difficult. As we watch the chat, we can keep an eye out for other potential mods. It'll be easier to spot them when they're on for more than eight hours for one night.
until then they'll release Dream, Drop, Distance on 3DS to bridge the gap
6lawls
still gonne be about 3 or 4 years though
I'd like a 3DS, but not until it either drops in price or more games come out
as of right now I'm only really interested in the Ocarina of Time remake
Well I never got a DS so I just got the 3DS so that I could run both
02HML, what time is over hereee~ ?
ah, that's good thinking
6Once we cover that odd morning shift it shouldn't be a huge issue.
I got Pokemon Soul Silver and Platinum to go with it
I should've done that actually
I got my DS first last year
and KH ReCoded
-1:30 from here
So 8:18pm?
Roughly
4So you're saying we could monitor the general chat for potential recruits...yes
exactly. And that morning shift is basically just for the Eurobronies, seeing that just about everyone in the USA will be snoozing at that time.
oh, boo a sports game
no need for me to pay attention for a little while
:P
Yep.
what sport game?
8and honestly, i think one or 2 mods can handle chat in here, we won't be getting 200 people just for general chat
NBA 2ksomething
oh
yeah I don't play those
Pacific is 3 hours behind Eastern
cept Madden once in awhile
6Honestly if dari could cover that we'd be good. Though we won't be able to ask him for a while.
7Hmm...
graphics look pretty amazing
So it would be 8:48 here, and 5:48 in Pacific
14six then
7So 6:00?
Since I'm in Eastern
8its gonna be more like 30-50 at most i think
but sport games don't really intereest me
7Thank you, Sky.
Yeah :P
No problem :)
8dari was just on earlier tonight
well
8hes asleep now though
it's fun in a group
6Oo
4That's true, it would just be a place for people to hang out if they wanna discuss ponies. I honestly don't see it getting more people than the BMN
but by yourself it's boring
6So much for being away for a month.
4Like Hip said
A good point. There aren't that many people who are into IRC, so it's not like this place will be packed with them.
:P
Hey
Gahhhhh
Bored.
8and you have to think, we get 200 people for movie night because it's pretty heavily publicized and it's on a specific night and time, with movies being shown
14draw
whee glitches
Say wha
8with none of those things, fewer people will show up, and they will be spread throughout the week
I can't draw
I could never draw
14excuse me
6My only concern is if one of us needs a day off and it would leave the chat uncovered for a period of time... though my schedule is incredibly flexible if informed in advance.
14GO DRAW
14NOW
How can I draw if I can't draw
:P
4Also, if we find mods for the chat we could recruit them for the BMN. Then again, we may not need anymore mods for that
but yeah get to work on the first two or you will have no idea what's going on :P
/me is going to go to Canada and hunt you down
/me blinks
8we could use more half-ops i think
8especially the way this is expanding
I think hipster is right.
8we got 150 even with basically not having an EQD post
14well
14go write then
/me 7is slightly tired, and slightly satisfied with another fakemon. O_o
6I agree with Hipster.
Four full OPs, who are almost always available, pretty much covers that base.
7Even if it's a derpworm. :P
XD
Can your next fakemon be a coffee mug?
8in the question i put in the pinkie poll, 55% of people said they had hadn't come to BMN, but are interested
Mugshot *shot*
7Ah, nah.
8think about that
7I'll probably be revamping Taigar's details.
8 55% of ponychan
4But let's remember, this is Summer. Everyone is mostly available for moderating. Fall will be a completely different story when school gets back into full swing
/me 6will probably still be available whenever in fall
That's why they'll only be half ops.
8let's deal with fall when it comes
4But alright, let's give the general chat a test run
4I definitely wanna see how it'll turn out
8well, we still have the issue of the un moderated morning
8at least til we find out if dari can do it or not
6And with him being busy for a while, it may have to wait.
4Yeah, I guess we'll just wait for now
8dcd, are you still here?
/me went to the mods room, there are no mods. returns here.
so
we should basically start working on Movie Night East
We do a test run of using this for General Chat
We keep an eye out for other potential half-ops
And we start doing the drawing durring BMN's intermission.
4But we're not gonna do a test run until dari returns, yes?
QUAN
YAILS
LIEK HAI :D
6And we find out about the listserv
8yes, the listserv is a must
Oh yeah, and the listserv.
/me pokes a unactive chat
I can't write
How can I write when I can't write?
8we need to get that figured out, because it will be a HUGE help
I think I brought this up last night, but couldn't we just use the Derpy Mail for listerv? That's what ARGH uses, isn't it?
13I'M
13HERE
6We could always just ask ARGH about it.
4Hi Peanut
Hi, Peanut.
/me pokes May with a tablet pen
6...fashionably late, Peanut?
/me SHOT
8fashinably afk more like it
6lawls, jk. Hey.

Art, I'm meh
But writing
I can't even write a paragraph without raging
8go ahead sprinkles
Wal-mart's open all night. :P
Oh well, doing art now =\
6Wal-mart's too far to walk.
But it sucks
/me flails
So I'll rip it up once it's done
6My friend gave blood today, so we can't walk far.
:D
6Well, I'm gonna head out then. Later everypony.
That reminds me, I'm giving blood tomorrow. *sets alarm*
Bye, Sprinkles.
4See ya Sprinkles
6I was going to give blood. I'm horribly afraid of needles. I passed out. lulz
6And with that, I'm out.
Fun fun fun
8bye sprinkles
8im way too much of a pussy to give blood
Ugh, tablet </3
I'm going to wash down my dinner with butter, brb
This 6-year old piece of junk hates me
.....
4I don't like to give blood either
/me runs
das boot
4But I'm not afraid of needles
Oh noes
DAS BOOT
A bunny

8is there anything else we need to cover?
k brbfor REAL
8oh
/me puts Aero in the age-worn bunnysuit
This'll be the first time I actually gave blood, but that's because I used to be on medication.
/me teehees
:D
4I hope everything goes well for you Silver
derp
13Bye Sprinkles
13Oh
it's been so long XD
13Am I too late
14OHH YAH
14</late>
Did you all forget about it!?
Wow
8should i put the selection entry thread up on thursday instead to give people more time?
I feel so old
:S
14you are old
14hee
13Uh wait
Nu
13While in here
I'm only
13What movies are we doing?
x-100
:D
13I don't follow along with this stuff very well
Which would be a negative
....
14this means you are a fetus
/me pets the fetus
4We're doing Young Frankenstein
4And
8young frankenstein and super mario bros
4Yep
What pony episodes? I forget.
delishus fetus
8you should watch the discussion and mod threads
8over a barrel and party of one
okay guys
14you would say that
this might be what we will do
/me kicks around
we will use this chat as a general chat, okay
atr
Wat
O.o;
/me hushes the fetus
but we will link the other channel in the topic, 'kay?
/me puts SkyFetus in a pickle jar
.v.
Ew
What other channel?
8...ok
8why?
14are logic = no
14*our
hi
We go waaaaaaaaay back
It's an old-
old-TSTer thing
:P
Goddarn my keyboard hates me
because the other channel is better for general chatting as well
plus, it's common courtesy
4But we're still using this as the BMN chat, yes?
nobody has to stick to a single IRC, after all
yeah
we are
14yeah
14very old
14like five years old
/me leaps across the room
8oh, slightly off topic, but !!RainbowDash said he is probably going to come to a BMN eventually
4Oh, awesome
8we wont know its him though, unfortunately
what other channel?
8the IRCHighway one
02[/late]
I've been with TST since like...2005, back when lugia.co.uk was still young
:P
omgyes
I remember .co.uk
.co.uk was the bomb
then there was the whole move thing and stuff
Where Arti and Lugia were like super crazy
14the crazy five were da bomb
o_o
Yeah I remember the move
14hey
active RPs back in the day :'D
I didn't join lugia.us until like September 2007
14where is arti?
Aero
Get this
RPing in the shoutbox
THAT WAS UBERRIFIC
XD
Arti is
I dunno
o_o
But yeah RPing in the shoutbox
When we all pretended to be legendaries
That was epic fun
fun fact
14omg or when
we're all in IRCHighway
/me grows 100 years older
I get that it's courtesy, and no offense to the server or the channel, but, it's not like every single new channel here has to pay homage to it. I mean, that's what the chat is for anyway, making your own channels for others with your interest. I'm not trying to be a prick, I'm just stating my opinion on that.
if you want to visit it
14when your awesome story was still being written
LOL
YOUR STORY
14I loved checking TST everyday
14just for it
IS IT DEAD? D:
I WAS READING THAT STORY TODAY
14OH AND THE RPS
LOL
RPs WERE AMAZING
I'm sooooooo pumped to write it again
DO IT
When RP forum was live
Silverscreen: because making another general chat for basically the same topic in the same Server seems like overkill, yet we're doing it.
Might as well link it
That was bomb
But yeah
I feel like writing
then draw
.......
BUT I DON'T WANNA DRAW, I SUXX.
plus, fun fact: they still link to the /b/rony IRC even if the /b/rony IRC no longer links them in their topic
NUUU
14y'know what
then wash it down with some butter
it's basically because it helps the fandom stick closer together
and mayo
don't think to hard about it
don't forget the mayo
Alright.
and beer
14ohgawd
14OOH YAH
I'm on a diet people
Well
Sort of
DAS BOOT
8lol, i know nothing about chatrooms
we just have to add to the topic
14DAS BEER
"Plus, make sure to check out #mylittlepony as well!"
4...Yeah, I'm just letting you guys talk amongst yourselves because I don't know chatrooms well either ^_^;
8this might be the 1st chatroom i have ever visited on a regular basis
8hell, i dont even im
basically whomever clicks on that channel link
visits the other channel
so yeah
NS!
4Same here, Hip. I do AIM a bit though
/me tackles
What's with this das thing

Take some advice: Internet dating DOES NOT WORK.
4Nope
Aero?
13hmmm
13Alright.
13I see.
AEEEEEERRRRROOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
................
LONG TIME NO SEE
I think my mind has been re-wired by that song.

DVFBGNBF
8my friend met his girlfriend through online dating
YOU TWO
/me glomphugs :D
ARBAETJMONAGN<ASTPH<SGPTNMSRS<PGRTJ
8except he hates her
How've you been? :D
14YES
SPAM FEST
14OOH YAH
14DAS BOOT~
8he just stays for the sex XD
Didn't help that the majority of the ones I found were attention seeking emo girls.
/me glomphugs back
I've been good }D
How 'bout yourself??
awesome! :D
Sky
...and I guess it also didn't help that I met them all through RPing.
14Ronnie died
14crud
14we shocked him with Das Boot
BRB
kk
4Well
...I'm going to shut up about my past personal problems now.
4Yeah, that can be potentially dangerous; especially through RPing. No offense, Silver.
14cpr
I think I did die a little
On the inside
Skyyyyyyyy
Good god
14Its amazing
What is this
I don't even
I'm like
wtfsauce
This is madness
SKY
4Something about RPing tends to bring out different personalities and attitudes in people
blarg
14This is Deustchland
4And not in the proper sense of character either
SKY Y U NO SEE?
14U NO SEE OUR PHILOSOPHY
8maybe the fact that they're using different personalities and attitude http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/trollface.jpgs
oh, none taken. I learned my lesson.
8http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/trollface.jpg
8there we go
Fail link is fail, hipster.
;p
13I can't RP well.
13At all
8accidentally pasted it in front of the s
8lol
13Acting unlike myself is
13...
13Out of the question
13:P
8i dont rp at all, ever
4I've only RPed three times on Ponychan, and two of those times were RPing in a Silent Hill thread
8just seems...
I RP, but my character always ends up acting like myself.
8idk
8unnatural
I see some guy passing out
And talking about beer
eggs
and bacon
4RPing in itself can be fun
13The only RP
13I've done
and sugar and cinnamon
13is that uh
13Ship with Rarity Sauce
4You get to be other people and act, which is something I've wanted to do for a while
I saw that. It was interesting.
<3
<3333
8rarityXrarity?
8lol
13Well.
13If I had more OC of a peanut pony
i guess the fact that one of my hobbies is acting kinda helps.
13I'd post with that.
13 90% of my ponies folder
13= rarity
and buter
butter
I read that as butler lol |D
/me has a folder for each of the mane cast, celestia, a big ass one for both luna and twilight, and one for Trixie.
oh, and the CMC
XD
I think Applejack is the one I post the least of.
bbl
8hipster glasses
8spiderman
8rainbow dash
Of course, she's my least favorite pony, so I guess it makes sense.
8everything else is an unorganized mess
OFFICIAL: NGP is known as PSV = Playstation Vita
I was considering loading up on spiderman pics, but I don't like to derail on purpose, so I leave it to others.
4I just have a pony folder *shrugs*
4Well
8i might have more spiderman pics than pony pics lol
/me is organized when it comes to his files.
4I have a dedicated pony folder, a normal folder, and a wallpaper folder
8i try not to derail with spiderman except in certain circumstances, but i use it as a general reaction image pretty frequently
I have all my shit sprawled around
/me is NOT organized since he just doesn't give a shit
8especially "nope", "come at me bro" and "how about i web your shit"
two of which you frequently use in BMN chat as well. :P
Talking about butlers?
That reminds me of a certain british Lugia
4That come at me bro pic is disturbing
butlersss |D
Too bad he isn't on here anymore
As far as I know
12Hey Aero
Heya
4Spiderman's neck extends outside of it's normal bone structure...*shudders* It's like Sweetie Bell in Stare Master
dklfdskfskl tiem to start this application x.x
8thats what makes it funny
!may
And May
YAY
MINE
:D
8the general surrealness of the terrible drawing is part of what makes it hilarious
Noes
4I wish I could post picks in the chat :(
4Not just links
8u cant?
posting the links is how you post the pic in here.
!may

!everyone
4But I can't get that, I just get links
8weird
you get pictures on mibbit
and links in actual IRC clients
4I know I can't pull them up on here from my pictures, can I?
Pretty much.
No, you can't.
8so the fact that i know nothing about chat helps me here?

Not yet!

okies
damnit
my guitar almost fell :S
I have a friend with a Wacom.
And I've used the extremely early predecessor to a Wacom tablet. :P
Hmmm
I wonder if it's normal for the surface to wear smooth after a while
(Said predecessor is a large metal plate, in a larger desk, with a giant metal stylus.)
o
(Also: "What happens if I touch stylus?" *bzzrt* "Oww my finger!")

In other news there's a Halo 4.
Actually they are supposely releasing 4 Halo games actually
No
They said
Halo 4 is comming out :P
well, halo is stupid :P
Hence CONFIRMED
And yeah I don't like it much
My friend Kevin loves it though
also CoD sucks
And Brandon.
Well
Halo > CoD
But most good games > current state of Halo.
well, any game is better than CoD and Halo
any game that isnt a shooter is better
cause most shooters turn out to be crap

I wonder if the surface wears smooth after a while
12Wacom <3
My Bamboo Pen and Touch is wearing smooth
wait what
the pen or the tablet
Tablet
Pen, I know
dunno
Hmmm
12Hmm, might be pushing too hard
Could be
I sent in a support ticket to Wacom
well if it's wearing the tablet down, that's insane
Waiting for their reply
pen tips, those wear down and that's normal
Yeah
The tablet surface is not supposed to wear smooth that fast, no?
12I have a wacom, and so far, I have not seen any wear
^
what do you mean by wear though
Like, becoming smoother
The surface
It's a pen and Touch
/me pokes
dunno
that actually sounds like mine
that's normal wear too
A LOT
Mouse replacement, basically
that would do it
Hmmm

I'm expecting Wacom support to get back on me regarding this

An ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE VERSION of Rebecca Black's Friday
Sung without autotune
And she actually can sing!
It's a miracle!
Autotune ruins songs.
they can use autotune even on live concerts
Eeek
12Lol, her real voice is a lot better
She should try singing other songs
She could try jazz
Fly Me to The Moon
Maybe
I think she might do I Believe I Can Fly well too
ahahahaha
her voice is kind of bothersome
You know what
She should ditch ARK
my fingers are freezing off
so is my face
it's so coooooooooold
Find maybe an indie label, or someone who doesn't use autotune
Let her undergo a few years of training and such
Then write GOOD songs for her
She has the potential
But unfortunately Friday ruined everything
well she knows how to sing
which is nice
but not terribly important in the grand scheme of things
Freezing...
face
it's freezing down here
tell me about it XD
Australia?
Yup, Melbourne to be exact
nice
I'm in sydney
so. bloody. cold
DRAKE
IT'S SO COLD

04I probably won't be on.
04so
04:<
>:
but brrrrrrrr

04...You fucking serious?
04I have a career expo on Thursday
04I don't want to be outside aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
haha
I have careers day this friday
will be so boring
also today Hensh was like "When I leave school I'm going to give you my WoW account." and I was like "wat"
04We had a career seminar last night
04It was insightful
ah
lol seminars.
04LOLWUT
we had PDHPE seminars
04Give me that account damnit
I went to the depression one and the internet safety one
04I neeeeeed to play WoW at least once in my lifetime.
depression was boring as fuck
and lmao
hey, I'll share ;p
and he was like like "Everybody should have a WoW account."
and heh
yesterday I was like "You tried to run me over with your car!" (in reference to something what happened about a month ago)
and he was like "No I didn't. If I did, it wouldn't have been 'tried'."
04Oh I recall that
04and lol
fucking awesome
04WHY DO YOU HAVE COOL TEACHER(S)
he's like
the only cool one
04FFFFFFSOCOLD
yeah
fucking freezing
we had year meetings today
04I am drinking
04a frozen coke
out the FUCKING COLD
...lolwut?
04my insides are frozen.
XD
out in the*
04whatthe
04Oh
04I had walking
heh
I had taekwondo today
>_>
04we walked for maybe an hour and a half in the cold.
04You do taekwondo?
you didn't know?
I started in year 7 ;x
black belt 1st dan atm
04You
04are suddenly
04even more badass
04and I didn't think that was possible
._.
XD
but yeah, it was fucking freezing
because I was only wearing the taekwondo clothes + belt
out the cold air
04ohshit
04That
04would be hell frozen over.
04/bad joke
It wasn't that bad after I ran around half the school
for 5-10 minutes
04I don't run
04I walk
04Because I'm a lazy shit
04'Sup Xeli?
12!espeon
/me still belongs to Global for 11 more minutes
XD Drake
04?
I was looking for Hensh
just wanted to bug him
and then he ninja'd out of nowhere
and scared the living daylights out of me
04Because bugging people who can run you over with a car is a wise decision.
o.o
lmao
!umbreon
I complained to him again about that when I watched him leave
/me now belongs to Novi for 5 minutes
but jesus
04lol
I hate it when he ninjas out of nowhere
04YOU INVOKED THE NAME OF THE LORD
04SHUN
04SHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
lmao
he always scares the SHIT out of me
04Forshaw is fuckign creepy
04All our Science teachers are.
04One molests my sister and the other likes little boys.
04Oh, and our maths teacher feels himself up during class.
wat
The only awesome science teacher is Kulesz
and I haven't had him since year 7 ;-;
I hate science anyway
going to drop it when I get to year 11
what about you, Drake?
it's mostly because I've been failing in science since year 8 ;x
04I'm dropping it for 11-12
:D
^5
06o.o
06And kind of not here right now, but hi :<
heya and bye >:
I need to go now too
04I'm going to do Extension English, Advanced English, Mathematics, Software Design and Development, Industry Technology - Multimedia, and either IPT or just IT
but yeah Drake
04:<
niiiiiiiice
you're doing SDD too?
and FUCK NO
04I think I'll go with IT because it's more practical
DO NOT DO IPT
04lol
DO NOT
trust me it sucks
04IT has a more practical aspect to it, so I'm more "hands on"
I went through a year of hell
04I need experience.
just do SDD
04yeah
04I'm definately doing that
I'm going to do Unit 4 maths, unit 2/3 english, SDD, mind and morality
not sure what else at this stage
04Although the SDD teacher is thinking of changing our first topic from HTML coding to fucking LEGO Mindstorms crap.
oh and music extension
LOL Lego mindstorms
04We did that this year and it was terrible.
I did it for mindquest
in year 6
it was pretty awesome
04I hated it.
but we did it in year 8 for inno
it was shit.
04I hated the drag-and-drop thing.
it's a shithole
04I would've preferred 'regluar' coding, like how we're doing Java script now.
lol javascript.
I don't know a lot about javascript
04Hey, sir said it's the closest thing to C++ coding so I'm all for it.
I know some of the syntax so ye-
what the fuck.
why do you want to learn C++?
04My friend said something about that's the coding video games are created with.
C++ is a motherfucking assraping buttshiting titlicking cocksucking bitchface
04Naive as it sounds.
04wow
04And here I thought you'd reached your profanity limit for one sentence.
I'm serious
lmao
04Prove me wrong.
XD
but seriously
some games are made in C++
imo python and C are more popular
if anything, learn C or python
04I'll check them all out.
python is easy
it's a good language to start with
and it's pretty powerful
04K
anyway, bbl piano
/me makes some notes
04K
xD
04Cya NS
/me hugs Drake and poofs
have a good sleep
don't freeze in your bed
or I'll be sad
XD
/me poof
04Oh I have an electric blanket
04It's all good.
04Cya
or Umbreon
whatever
PM me the password you want for your oper
Just got permission from Articuno, and I'll add your oper block on island and then send it to Articuno to upload to ocean
now poof
just leave it, I'll add it when I get back
06~
THIS CHANNEL IS NEVER ACTIVE WHEN I AM YOU PEOPLE ARE STRANGE AND IT IS FOUR AYE EM
04G'night
/me pokes Umbreon
/me nips army
oh it's 7am for him
ohai
hi
06Patience time
I'm in no rush
I'd just rather get it done before tomorrow so I don't have to stay up late and wait for him
it's 10:15am now
I want to sleep early
06hehe
if not I can always wait until tomorrow
but then it won't get done until I get back home
and I might be a bit busy
;p
So
Changing passwords
was such a chore
tell me about it lol
24 sites
>30 IRC networks, 15 sites
hurpaderp
then again I could just get on mIRC and /scon -a ns set password newpassword
so that's easy but I tend to use different passwords for every network
Oh, I missed Dropbox
I use the same password for every site
If one is compromised, all is compromised
I could love different passwords but my memory is fail
My ISP e-mail password is different and I already have trouble with that
EW Apple iD
;P
Apple iDerp
Does your iPhone go derp too :o
weird
And then I also have a different password for TVTropes
Which is very simple and guessable since their password system is weak
Plain text transmission, stored in cookies in your browser
oo
06loltvtropes
Oh, and I missed one web site called PixelF--kers
Desktop customisation and skinning
Lair
*Iiar
It's a adult site ;p
/me flees
http://pixelf--kers.org/ <- replace -- with uc, and see for yourself
I don't understand why they call it PixelF--kers though lol
Sounds really like an adult site lol
Could have called it PixelFrakers
Same meaning
Work safe
urgh
I hate setting up bind9
never set it up for IPv6 so I'm struggling atm
/me is using XP so that silly command doesn't work ;p
also I am excellent at remembering which ports I'm running SSH on for each of my servers seeing as they're all different >>
heh HML
not if someone live boots
I know ;p
else deltree works
149 packages can be updated.
99 updates are security updates.
/me bawws
bbl playing Pokémon Dream World
Linux sucks so bad it needs 99 security updates
U mad?
this server hasn't been updated for ages
and at least linux doesn't require reboots every time it updates
>windows
HEY THERE AUTOMATIC UPDATES, NO I DON'T WANT TO RESTART NOW, THANK YOU
I've never had a issue with automatic updates for windows 7 :P
automatic updates are horrible
I barely notice them since I shut down my PC regularly XD

4Remember i have to take it slow log everything and take pics
13Okay!
13Wait, how can you take pictures from your game? You playing it on the PC?

06:3
13I've got the PS2 version. If I knew how to play PS2 games on the PC, and be able to record them, I'd already have some helpful videos for AHT and KHII
Poop
incoming flood of epic win
wheeee
4Welll theres a way
Now whenever I see Lemonade, I think Cave Johnson's Combustible Lemons
I'm playing Pokémon Dream World right now
4see the pcsx2 can
uh okay
so shit got leaked? lmfao
4You download it and put the game into your computer disk tray
4Hm
yeah some guy who had to skim it or whatever
06inb4 not confirme
when i first saw it I was like "uh is this guy advertising cactuses on 4chan or something"
rofl
cacti*
4Spyro seems to be running slowly
4FPS is lucky to have a 1
um why do I need a registered nick To join this channel
?
13Thanks, but how do I record gameplay?
4Maybe my comp is lagging
the console and skyward sword are obvious
dang
13My computer sometimes lags
there was a small attack
ssb4 is like
nothing more/less
expected
xD
4Well not that i tried it (Note pcsx2 right now is lag) but my gba has a record button
13I'll give it a try soon
http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nLhrgVJr
whole thing
4in the meantime i'll get those images
13I've found something for KHII (I don't know if it's a glitch), and I want to show it on YouTube
also ssb4 will have pit, mario, link, kirby
13It's about the Drive Forms
06and then CONFIRMED FOR SSB4 started all over again :p
and maybe a sin and punishment thing
13I've accidently found it in Timeless River a few months ago
4?
4Well i was gonig to be done after the GBA's but i had seen the artowrk in AHT as jpg
13Activate a Drive Form, then go into an area where your allies walk around as NCPs. You will be back in your normal form (don't forget some worlds have you change forms) and your bar is full
4Wow
13It is!
/me 4must kill all jpg
13That's right
13If I could, I'd record it to show you how it works.
4ok
/me 4gets out his scythe to destroy all jpg
13But two problems: I'm unable to record (but what oui said earlier could change this), plus I don't like what Sora's Drive Forms look like in Space Paranoids
4Ah
13Valor, mostly. I activated this form a few months ago in this world, and I was shocked (I've seen the sequal when it was in cinemas late last year)
4Yea
4Dang lag
13I tried to activate Tron's limit, but I accidently hit the Left in the D-pad, and since Goofy was the other active Party Member, Valor it was
zzz
13I activate Limits manually
4Ah
4Off to kill some JPG
13Be back soon, and don't forget to remind me of E3 when it starts!
4http://www.shoutwiki.com/w/images/en.spyro/d/d1/Backgrounds.gif Best image ever
4Also E3 starts in about an hour
13:)
13Oh, just before it starts, can oui give me the adress to the KH wiki's IRC, please?
4http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=KHWiki-social
4Moving faster
4Killing more JPGs
13Gracias! :)
Quiet chat is quiet
06:3
4Your welcome :)
4DAng i wanna rage
/me vents some neurotoxin into the chat
/me likes toxic :P
/me points to his open beak
I really like how the Portal 2 Co-Op ending song Robots FTW have that 80's edge to it
agreed, it's pretty nice
4aw
4Me and Uxie are watching E3
4http://www.gametrailers.com/netstorage/e3/e3-live.html
13That's right!
do you know anything about the new spyro game?
13Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
i heard it sucks
13Ignore all those haters. They are not true fans
4It looks good
13;)
It looks bad.
:P
i like the old spyro games for ps1.i first played them when i whas 1 years old and i still play
13Again. haters are not fans
You can't just say "ignore anyone who disagrees with me, they are automatically wrong".
I'm entitled to my opinion.
I think it looks bad.
im not a hater i love spyro more than annyone
13So does most of the other "fans"
4aggelos_the_dragon me to
yeah
13What are you going to do: vandalise the wiki's page for the game?
13I don't want that
Have I done that? No.
Did I say I was going to do that?
No.
13But there is currently a 99% chance
are you arguing?
13No
4Yes
4they are
oh fuck
Do you honestly think that I care at all about your wiki, much less enough to actually do anything?
4Like a married copule
4DAri wow man
13I hate haters of the game. People who hate SSA hate the whole series!
13That's my though!
4Shes right
4Don't hate
she?
I'm not a 'hater', I just don't like the look of this new game.
I don't hate it just "BECAUSE", I have my own reasoning.
yeah i believe that the only fans of spyro are the ones who love the first 3 insomniacs spyro games. because they are the originals
and there wont be more like them
4You never know
4Uxie is a girl
i wish they were more spyro like the first ones
13Yes, I am a girl
13The seires was once popular: now there are more haters than fans
13They ether became fans of Ratchet & Clank or took drugs
13That was sarcasom
13DSD and I are planning on doing a fannon series for YouTube. GA is involved, as well
13It will be baised on the classic series
you have to do that uxie
13I just hope we get the copyright from Activision to continue it and please fans
i hate ratchet and clank
I am a 'fan' of the original 3 games (more so the first 2). You call everyone 'haters' just becauase we don't like the look of this new game?
13I LOVE that series!
yeah prince is right
4GA?
13True fans love ALL games! Faux fans can love any game. New fans love the new games
13GastrodonAmy. She's a... friend of mine
UxieLover1994: Hahaha, you make me laugh. That's the opposite of the truth.
4I love all the games
Fans usually get pissed off when the slightest thing doesn't go the way they want it to.
i didnt said i dont like the legend of spyro games i just want to say that they are different am i right uxie?
13DSD and I are true fans, Prince and Aggelos are faux-fans
You be trollin'.
13Yeah
13I'm NOT trolling. I'm an admin at the wiki!
and im not a faux fan(whatever that means)
It's some crap she made up to troll people with.
13Faux-fans are haters of the new game
13I heard that!
Heard what? :o
13DSD, help!
oh i am not a faux fan.i love spyro
life moves on and spyro too
13You hate the game, you are not a true fan
who?
13I ment the new game
4Yes
You so crazy.
4Dari lies
4Shes not a troll
can i ask something?
4Yes
Psst, DSD's a troll too.
13I'm here everyday
13He is not!
(everyday, trolling the innocent passers by)
did spyro died in the end of dawn of the dragon?
13No, he and Cynder were shown to be alive at the end!
Did he died?
13No, no, and NO
4No
Yeah.
4He lived
Only to die.
13Spyro Lives!
13He did not die!
i thought that this was the valley of avalar at the end
I don't believe you.
Trolls lie all the time.
13Hey, there is proof!
STOPPPPP ARGUING WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT SPYRO AND NOT TO ARGUING.ARE YOU DOING THIS ALL DAY?
And they lied while the world descended into chaos.
4Yes
4Dari Uxie is not a troll
13Prince, I don't want to argue
13They lived!
I can see no other logical explanation.
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g_ueD-p__g
ok they lived stop arguing
13Proof!
4Dari drop it
they lived ok stop arguing
Oh, this video's not available in my country.
Can't see it, sorry.
4>.>
they reset spyro?
Yeah, he has a killswitch embedded in his tail.
4>.>
whooah that is a little cool
4Yes
4For skylanders
I suddenly want to buy an iPad or something similar
4Yes over 32 characters
So I could load this up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Invalid link.
i know that
4more gameplay then ever
Even TLOS is better than Skylanders.
13How can that video not play in your country?
13Where do you live?
Equestria.
i heard that with the game they will give you a spyro figure required to play the game
4>.>
4Yes
4Now you can play co-op single pvp off game on game
4Dari liess
Well this is just how annoying you guys are with your "OMG U NO LYKE NUU GAME UR H-EIGHT-ERS.
4Don't shame the ponies
13Yep, and since there are far more faux-fans, DSD and I will be abe to get all 32 toys in just days!
i want only the spyro figure
4Yea
then i ll buy the other ones
where are you from?
13I want them all, as well!
13There is no such country as Equestria!
I'm not that bothered about there being no more proper Spyro games though, kind of got used to the fact that they don't make platformers that good any more.

13I was born in 1994
4What month where you born?
At least if you're going to insult someone do it properly, calling someone gay isn't an insult, if you're 17 I'd have thought you'd have grown up enough by now to realise that.
