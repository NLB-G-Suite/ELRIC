08,01Phase4: but for hosts, the main thing you want is stability
00,02Saturn, thats the idea, mysql/nginx/php-fpm/alpine would make for epic small/fast webservers
00,02apline itself only needs ~16MB
08,01alpine looks cool, but it's based on busybox
08,01hmm
00,02dont use it as a desktop os

this is why we need a lottery week
generally not an easy card to get
it costs about 75 dollars
XD
we pick from the lottery 5 people's A movies and show them Mon-Fri
it wouldn't be very diffcult to do
00,02GODDAMNITCRATE
Crates. Crates Everywhere.
but the movies would be picked by Lottery
02Well, I can't sleep .-.

It costs 30$ in store, right?
00,02i might buy another key
00,02SirGanjalf, yup
Good Deal:)
00,02but only one more
00,02AskDerpyDoo, tech
One does not simply buy one more key.
:3c
I think a lottery week would be good
00,02i dont need them
00,02and not gona buy that many keys
stack them into a tower?
00,02Meanwhile, but thats such a waste
wait, same thing.
00,02there must be something i can do with them
That's all you can do with them. Open them or trade them to dimwits.
00,02but i could sell them
THrow them at people
00,02or trade them
I heard the crates makes good throwing objects
:O
00,02i want the rainblower
/me 00,02is yet to play black/white
build a sokoban puzzle somewhere on the map, then kill everyone trying to solve it
Well, I tried buying a key for the scorched crate. I was hoping to get the Rainblower, or that Unicorn thingy. I got a Sniper hat.

its not even the element of harmony
SONG?
I sugest you check out Chubby... Chuppy Checker that is!
did that cute furry thing had a name?
I kept claiming that I wanted to keep it as a pet...then when it was revealed to be Ridley, I kinda had a "...nevermind" moment.

is this TV or not?
Saturn: is it sad if I'm 16 and I know whats going wrong here?
08,01but that's a rant for another day
If it's not one the extreme, it's the other. Is that the way it is?
08,01Spade-Magnes[R]: i'd say it would be sad if you didn't

It's a republic.

Didn't you take first year government classes?
Saturn: BRING BACK THE QUEEN!
That is just stupid Saturn
08,01GilDash: see, our queen is more competent a ruler than anyone currently in the cabinet. a tragedy because she's never ruled.

It goes up to 18
This computer has TWO screens! It's awesome
Yawn.....
Time to stay up all night.
It's epic for multitasking
I gotta find out how to do this.
hmmm, anyone know how to make the ding on hit sound quieter?
Oh crap, that's right! I gotta get Pyrovision on TF2 even though I never play it!
Do you want the link to the vid?
sure, just pm me the link
If I were at home, I'd totally ask for that link.
then i can't hear weapons
Not including DS-ware
Well.... I'm going to play Team Fortress 2.... Goodbye everyone :P
have fun :P
I want Genesect allready
The screen quality is terrible.
Good thing I still have my DSi
I have a Ds but its ready to die
and what's with the camera click noise whenever you take a picture?
Even with the volume off, I still hear it!
It's especially annoying when I'm playing Rayman.
14Hi :D
I'm sure there's a solid money reason behind it
14how is everyone?
And I'm back :P
I'm surprised My ds still works
┐(￣ー￣)┌
brb
NDS was a good investment.
allows you to move diagonal without wasting any turns
14o.o
Near the power light
The ability to hold in place is gone
That reminds me...the top part of my DS is starting to be able to move slightly...
Which concerns me
And it still fucking works
It's only VERY slightly, but it's still worrysome
Just don't cut the wires.
Should I be concerned if one side of my 3ds moves when the other side doesnt?
14people won't stop making noises outside :(
the right side doesnt move but I can move the left side a little bit
yes
Also is it normal for the 3ds screen to wobble a bit?
It still locks into place
The parts that hold the bottom screen in aren't airtight...
just go away!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wwj0tuvoi0
I can see light coming in from the outer border of the screen.
I mean light coming out from
Not in
can u find the light in the night?

Duct tape is probably not the answer here.
THIS IS SURE TO WORK
8,6everything needs more cowbell
ductape the anser to all problems
if you cant fix it with duct tape .. you aint usin enough duct tape
Inb4 mid wing break
nailed it!
they live
Captian Falcon is dissapoint
and it promptly disintegrates
Engineering 101: if it moves and it shouldn't use duct tape. If it doesn't move and it should use WD-40
Remove 4 engines and wings
did anyone come up with a cure to ADHD yet?
Or at least i am 99% sure i am
