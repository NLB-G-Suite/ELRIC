When I brought up TF2 last night, I had the goggles right off the bat. I put them on all of my characters before connecting to any servers. Later on, I would see messages about other people getting those goggles as if they didn't have the goggles until after they started playing.
00,02theres a small ammount of work but no one realy cares
00,02Kandarihu, i had to join and die before it gave me mine

Ninjazz: I don't like the new albums but i respect it i'm just a more older linkin park fan
BRB, gonna watch youtube stuff while i wait for the stream to come back
I'm off. Night guize <3

/me steals Irres
(dis is just like ponies :D)
im writing a song guys
called Somewhere I Belong
No joke?
No joke
Well, damn.
here's what i've got so far
Ninjazz: Hard to say as i listen to some songs for this and that, but umm valetines day?
Ninjazz: i really listen to alot of the songs for different reasons but i think valentines fits me best
So im here,walking down this lonely street,when i hear,the same good old beat,and i now i know,this is somewhere i belong
Ah. Good choise, I suppose.
its not a rap,so dont think of it as one
Though... I do think I deleted that song when I was doing that song purge when I needed the free space.
ofna01: green day i love that song i actually sang to it with my music class they told me i nailed it :)
Ninjazz: What i like about many of the older songs is how they deal with some very good topics
New video of MLP77!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew9_cLbvQt4&feature=g-u-u
killerpony7733: I just liked the power. :D
wb phase
Ninjazz: one of the things i love in one of the songs is leave out all the rest where he sings about how one can be strong on the surface but not underneath
killerpony7733: That's a fun song to sing to.
Heya Espeon
Ninjazz
you dont like my song?
Sorry, I was distracted
Ninjazz: Yep alot of the times when no ones home i tend to sing when i'm in the shower
:D
ofna01: Hmmm? I was more or less here and there.
Chrysalis: seen that :P
0_o quisalis is here
doesnt make it any less cute
Poor Woona.
Chrysalis: omg so cute!
But that must be hard to get all the moon dust out of that fur

Epic Wub Tiem

Skylands, you are a 5Gliscor.
/me hugs MysteryPony
10!pokescram
Scrambled word is "opsnik". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
rəˈjaɫ ˈkɫub dəpurˈtiw əspəˈɲɔɫ də βərsəˈɫonə
10!pokehint3
The first four letters of the current word are "spoi"
10!pokeguess spoink
That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 4200 Points.
00,02ok, so it works, i can capture from the screen with ffmpeg

34 minutes till TF2 is done downloading
00,02i feel sorry for all the people not downloading tf2
00,02they kinda get screwed
How
00,02Gunny, try downloading ANYTHING on steam right now
What happens
Phase4: My steam downloads fine atm
00,02its gotten a bit better, still not fst though
γεια σκύλα ... hehe
08,01Phase4: I think i'd prefer to use CentOS for these cloud machines, tbh
08,01alpine looks cool, but it's based on busybox
08,01and uclib
00,02"Audio format provided by audio capture is not suported by this application"
LOL http://translate.google.com/#en|el|hello%20dude%0A
gtg everypony! il be back in an hour!!
00,02its like power on to firefox in 2 seconds + bios time
TYPE NOOOOOOOOOOOO
08,01Phase4: aye; i'd prefer the robustness of CentOS though
08,01CentOS is absolutely rock solid
08,01i even tend to lag one still-maintained version behind on production VM hosts
00,02i've never worked in a production environment
00,02alpine sounds good to me for 'cloud' environments where the bulk of the work happens inside vm's

08,01woah
08,01what
08,01Phase4: but for hosts, the main thing you want is stability
Rainfall_Night: No, that's Japanese.
00,02apline itself only needs ~16MB
08,01alpine looks cool, but it's based on busybox
08,01hmm
00,02dont use it as a desktop os
00,02mostly useless
08,01y'know, when i eventually have my server up, i might experiment with that for putting bronystate onto
OH MAI GO
You all know that CMC theme that is Terribly good?
08,01hmmpe
08,01anyhoos, let's talk about this on skype
Daniel actually had a "Perfect" version, with SCootaloo's VA actually singing too good. O.o
I WANT THAT
08,01Vordox: that doesn't officially exist
cause im pretty sure over a month ago it was for MC :P
00,02Finaly
08,01Chrysalis: it got sent back to me
08,01because i couldn't pay the hosting bill
08,01because i spent all my money on convention stuff
PARTAAAAYYYYY
00,02we need to talk about that
whats the thing called where you type down something and the computer says it
00,02everyone seems to be in tf2
00,02i'ma join them
ooh tf2
Forgot to turn headphones down. Stream has just blown my ears out
Allo everypony.
08,01Chrysalis: talk to meeeee!
Meanwhile: Way to go!
Ikr.
:[ :D NOOO!
OH GOD
PYROVISION?
HIYA everypony
WOW! I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THIS CHAT IS ACTUALLY CALLED THE MANE CHAT!
VALVE IS OFFICIALLY AWESOME.
00,02i need more pony music
HI Bronysith
Spell-of-Gaming: valve has been awesome since forever man
music needs more ponies
im bored
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, portal, tf2, half life and its pyrovision that makes you think they're awesome?
I haven't played Half Life yet, though. :P
Well, pyrovision is pretty funny.
:O
Also, SOURCE FILMMAKER
Well I dok IFG ERG
Inb4 a million "I'm gonna start making a movie in Source Filmmaker" that never get finished
:PDPD::D
It's kinda too bad Pyrovision only supports normal maps
chat derped?
oh its just silentville
only 95 people :P
I.. donot play this game. So...
question, do you people believe in magic?
So you see, THere is a sun, FERH FERN FERNY GURGLETY
Only when I'm on my mage, druid, priest or warlock on WoW.
:D
08,01that fairy from Fern Gully was such a hottie
08,01i had dreams about her after i saw that film...
O_o
fern gully?
http://192.20.225.36/tts/speech/cb14eee01d15dd8cea8637082e6fde42.wav
08,01Kencolt: i prefer living things
08,01but hey, if it's sapient, it's fair game
08,01if it's otakon, it's even fairer
Prefer lioving means you wouldn't discount the occaisional cute Volvo.
08,01Kencolt: i'm more into guys
08,01SEE WHAT I DID THERE
I tried not to.
08,01Vordox: i'm shipping no-one
i am callin hax on alucard
08,01i'm just saying that he is a sexy beast.
that guy gets headshots WAY too fast
O_o
Yeah but adding spices to Otakon CAN become a shipping, isn't that a setup? ;)
Best friends.
08,01Vordox: sounds more like the recipe for a curry
I like curry.
10Soibeans
Curry is good.
08,01anyhoos, i'm now about 5 hours later than i was intending to be
08,01so i must away
08,01and my mouth tastes of coffee
08,01bleh
Milky Coffee or black?
08,01black
Heck-- to ship otakon you'd first have to find a large enough crate. Line it with enough newspaper, food and water. Make sure he's got air, and even then, I doubt UPS would take thepackage, although I'm not sure about FedEx-- Oh, TAT kind of shipping.
Never mind.
08,01otakon x whipped cream = i'll be in my bunk
Dat blunt joke, Kencolt XD
00,02sudden disconnect
00,02does anyone here have a spared chared thing?
Dem servers, Phase4
08,01anyhoos, farewell
00,02like chared fish or something
Phase4: Think I have 2 charred whatever.
know that feel phase, i start to get into a roll, then massive crippling lag until i die, then fine again
00,02Kammerjunk, i can has one?
Fo' sho'.
00,02:)
I'm to careful a cook to char anything. Well, except for a couple of recipies, but that's rare.
00,02not sure if i have you on steam
Eenope.
00,02name?
Kammerjunk.
00,02seems logical
I'm the one online, the other one's my evil twin.
:O
00,02Kammerjunk and Kammerjunk2
00,02D:
00,02dat pic of aj and rd
00,02i can never feel sad when looking at that pic
I love that picture.
:D
Which one Phase4 ?
...
I think my Steam overlay hates me.
00,02Vordox, Kammerjunk's steam pic
00,02i cant see the tf2 inventory
Aww can't see it
Me neither.
00,02i think its off
goddammit
02I'm gonna rest or something
00,02not sure where to check that
Doomsday time?
00,02Kammerjunk, i'll join a game, join the same server and we'll try again
/me 00,02wants to check something
I had trouble organising my TF2 inventory earlier, too. When I moved items, they stormed all over the place.
Was crazy, yo.
Alrighty then.
Polka is magic 10 hour loop...
brb
00,02yeah, item servers under a bit of strain
00,02lol Vordox
Understandably.
Does anypony know when the Steam Summer Sale will be up?
Last night, the item server crahed, forcing me (and probably others) to use default loadouts
Good morning, everypony!
Also, Phase4: TF2 crashed, one moment.
00,02k
Mornin', Crono_brony.
!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 14Illumise.
how is everypony? ^^
Tired.
ah, too much TF2?
on which maps Pyrovision works like this? Doomsday looked like that, but on Turbine textures are still default
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
So many ponies just waking up. What time is it over there?
OH MAI GOD
I FOUND the most perfect CMC Theme video!
:D
nvm, just found the list
so can you play a video
Sylandest: Good Morning, Sylandest! I'm doing great!
Crono_brony: good to hear, hehe :)
Kammerjunk: here you mean?
Phase, wanna die from ear bleeding? XD
Yeah.
00,02Vordox, ...
Also...
Scootaloo's VA laugh in the show is perfect. <3
how much metal are people giving for lollipop?
...
goddammit
Mai god...
hl2.exe has stopped working
Scotaloo's VA:..how can you? XD
Seriously, what the hell, VALVe.
00,02Kammerjunk, lol crash
TF2 is a silly filly.
00,02SirGanjalf, better question
00,02how much for a strange lollipop :P
Phase4: I doubt i can afford it:(
My eaars bleeeeed. XD
Meh. I'll probably end up buying them in the Steam Summer Sale.
I'm rather proud of myself for that.
Kammerjunk: my apologies, got distracted while answering your question
Kammerjunk: its currently 8:30 A.M here
Aha.
/me glomps Meanwhile
/me is hit by a low flying Bronysith.
Sorry, but where is 'here'?
/me is bored
Kammerjunk: Kentucky, hehe
Ah.
You'd be less bored on TF2
I have returned from the place called STORE!
Meanwhile: there is no such thing as boredom on tf2
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5irrcN8Ff1r3xauuo1_r2_1280.png
Fair point.
Bronysith only revenge
TF2 ucks on my oppinion well having a 500h on it does that
Nerom: ...
;P
hmmm. i think imma play mass effect
It went from fun game to hat simulator
Nerom: but dosnt hat`s just make thing bether!
Nerom: the game is one of the best if not the best pc shooter
Well true Bronysith but I have plainly played it to much
dat chipmunk scoot
/me puts on hat of 20% coolness!
Woopie cap = best hat
it's already 68 days since the canterlot wedding..

AskDerpyDoo: we're here, lol...kidna
*kinda
I still haven't gotten the newsletter this week
last one I got was on the 18th
Phase4 You better get into some light then bro. Your sanity will decrease the longer you stay in the dark, or stare at an enemy. :P
http://pokegym.net/gallery/displayimage.php?imageid=20662
00,02XD
still havent got mine too
I would love to have my pick chosen
A: The Postman (1997)
this is why we need a lottery week
generally not an easy card to get
it costs about 75 dollars
XD
we pick from the lottery 5 people's A movies and show them Mon-Fri
it wouldn't be very diffcult to do
AskDerpyDoo: suggest it to the mods, see what they say. If they like it, they might consider it
AskDerpyDoo But during the weekdays, it would be better for mods to stream when and what they want.
00,02GODDAMNITCRATE
Forever a crate
I mean like at 7pm like what they do with movie weeks
Crates. Crates Everywhere.
but the movies would be picked by Lottery
So crates
02Well, I can't sleep .-.
Erryday ahm cratin
00,02HOLY CRAP
D:
00,02i got the unicorn :3
We can see.
Woah
Hot damn
Gratz
:O
God damn lucky
It costs 30$ in store, right?
00,02i might buy another key
00,02SirGanjalf, yup
Good Deal:)
phase r u mod?
00,02but only one more
00,02AskDerpyDoo, tech
One does not simply buy one more key.
00,02o u Meanwhile
:3c
I think a lottery week would be good
00,02wondering what to do with all these normal crates
00,02i dont need them
00,02and not gona buy that many keys
So scrap them.
stack them into a tower?
Phase4 either discard or just scrap
00,02Meanwhile, but thats such a waste
wait, same thing.
00,02there must be something i can do with them
Phase4: leaving them sitting in your bags and not opening them is a waste.
That's all you can do with them. Open them or trade them to dimwits.
00,02but i could sell them
THrow them at people
00,02or trade them
00,02^ AskDerpyDoo
I heard the crates makes good throwing objects
:O
00,02i want the rainblower
crates? Better get Gordan Freeman over here.
Heck yeah. Pokemon B2/W2 comes out October 7th.
Tovler YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
/me 00,02is yet to play black/white
build a sokoban puzzle somewhere on the map, then kill everyone trying to solve it
Phase4 It's alright. B2/W2 looks very promising.
I've played a bit in the japenese version
oh man, it's good.
they are already working on a Pokemon game for the Wii U
Phase4 I'd skip it and go straight to B/W2
its called Pokemon World Tour
Look at it, just hovering around
Staring. Judging. Waiting.
you get to go to parts of every region, and they added the Orange Islands
yay, another pokémon game.
but only a few of them (like 4)
Dat laugh?
He's so happy
Lemme guess, you start off picking one out of three pokémon?
00,02dats enough for me tonight
Besides, Tovler, have you heard the OST's for B2/W2/
?*
Night Phase4
the starter you pick actually determines what region you start in
see ya Phase4, cheers for the stream.
g'night Phase4
Good night, Phase4. Thanks for the stream.
This site needs more folks on GMT-ish timing.
Aye it does Meanwhile.
Meanwhile: Is denmark within that?
Meanwhile: I feel lazy search it for me :3
But Neil isn't here to lure brits into here.
I have no idea, what time is it in Denmark?
Meanwhile: 15:57 which is just about 4 pm
DashWithRainbows: I've only heard the remade battle themes. They sound too techno-ey.
GMT+1
Close enough.
IIRC Hoenn: Lillycove, Sootopolis, Mossdeep Johto/Kanto: Olivine, Vermillion Sinnoh: Canalave, Snowpoint
Meanwhile: yay! :)'
just rest in bed?
4 orange islands including Shamouti
gah my hand is itchy because i scratched it up x-x
It's just so empty in here during what I consider the day meaning to hang out here properly I need to tank up on tea and sugar and spend all night here.
Tovler Yeah, they've gone for Techno. I dislike the new Plasma theme. The old one had a nice beat to it and matched them perfectly. The battle theme I enjoy, and the new rival theme.
Life's tough Meanwhile.
I just got home from work. I think I win.
Where are you geographically Lasharus?
Netherlands.
And what time is it there?
16:00
Well, 15:59 if you want to nitpick.
you also get to go to Castelia

*facedesk*
I was pleasantly surprised at the Elite 4 champion's battle theme.
AskDerpyDoo, I'm never going to get that name out of my head now.
'thanks' :P
you're Welcome!
Germaneigh
Bosnia and Horsegovina
.......
Tenneighsee
Tovler Aren't they bringing back some old opponents? I rmemeber there being a Kanto champion theme and Hoenn + Johto champ theme in there as well.
remember*
bah, I need to buy a DS fat so I can transfer my pokemon.
Hoofaii
Honolulu, Hoofaii
Now you're stretching it.
Saddlelaide, Oatstralia
Yeah, I'm going back to reading my forum now.
Brismane, Oatstralia
Tovler Ah, you've got the same problem as I do when it comes to transfering.
yep. A buttload of nostalgic gym leaders are returning. I wish Some non-champion E4 were returning too
Cynthia
Same.
Flannery was so freakin hot
Cynthia was in Black and White anyway.
I want to fight Gary again
Because it's Gary.
Mother fucking Oak.
Phoebe was so awesome. A hawaii flower girl that PSYCH used ghosts.
is porking a word I can say?
because I once saw a picture of an Emboar porking Flannery
You can't ignore his girth
Meanwhile ;_;
I can't.
and no I will not link it, I don't remember where I saw it
......
So much I didn't need to know.
AskDerpyDoo I've probably seen it anyways.
3rd Fire/Fighting starter must've hit the spot.
I got out of there as wuickly as possible
HOWEVER, best pokemon ship: Lorelei x Flannery HOT
those were my two most crushed upon characters
Best ship: Brock x Rejection
It was the best ship until the entire show rejected him.
indeed
Please, best ship can best be seen in this video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawUi9s3ENE
and he left to become a pokemon doctor after 100 years of that macguffin pokemon breeder thingy.
/me now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes and has to fly Skylands around until then

/me listens to the wind blow through the dead chat
Well you can hardly make a cynical comment if you logged back into the chat half a second before snarking.
no there is no wind - even that is ded
Meanwhile: lol
dead chat has become self aware. Zombie chat?
meanwhile: drying pan is credit to brock
CCCP: hiya :3
hi killerpony7733
If the chat became self aware it would probably ask what it is
Then what it's purpose is
And then it'd go nuts and starts nuclear war
That's how AI work.
Or it makes peace and harmony all over the world
damn. I was about to say nuke it.
/me pokes the chats dead corpse
Seems dead
perhaps
killerpony7733: don't beat a dead horse
/me makes groaning noises behind killerpony7733.
CCCP: well played
CCCP what!?!!? I...i..wouldn't do such a thing :'(
I'm too busy pirating and watching movies while I still can.
User0: Whut zombies?
:P
/me panics
I didn't like Hugo much but I loved The Artist.
/me makes a creeper sound behind killerpony7733.

Mmm apple cider

killerpony7733: I am at work, after all
Sylandest: darn...
Ohai Sylandest

I've already had 4 vials of blood taken from me and two warts frozen, and it is only 10:22am... Today is going to be one of those days...
User0: You donate blood?
i did once
now they expect me to every time
fucking red cross wants to drain me dry
Well i hate having my blood taken out of me so i steer clear of donating blood
To me it feels unnatural to give your blood to someone else
:(

Is it actually summer?
CCCP: here in KY, it is

killerpony7733: no, allergy testing (sorry, coworker was talking to me)
10In the video, they have a side by side comparison of the PS2 and PS3 version
User0: ah
10I dunno about the PS2 version, but Okami for Wii has better quality than that comparison..
I've donated blood 2 or 3 times now
10I don't think Okami needs to much of an upgrade, that game was a beauty in itself
I think 3
12I agree
The first time, the needle shifted and my arm was covered in blood - fantastic first experience

Hello
User0: O_O
hi Chains
12I have the Wii version
10Okay
12and I must say it's better than those two put together LOL
CCCP, I've been looking for you for days!
10I wanna find someone who has the PS2 version and can confirm the PS2 graphics are blurry :P
12AE has/had the PS2 version I'm sure
CCCP: there is a good reason why they had to use two ice packs on me, and like 8 pieces of gauze to clean up...
10I suspect they've distorted it on purpose though, to give the PS3 version a trump card
Chains: ive been on here for days!
12Most probably
User0: wow O_o
CCCP: I guess I've been logging on at the wrong times XD
Chains: :$
CCCP: Anyway, I've been wanting to tell you I found some reeeeeeeeeeeeeeally good Russian music for you.
CCCP: well, I'm not dead (yet...)
Chains: YAY, link?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zGwKoHNl8k

I loved the show. The problem was it was aired on ABC, and I'm pretty sure that's why it was cancelled. Had it been on something such as Comedy Central or Adult Swim, it would have lasted.
Im sorry Dave

Im sorry Dave
Meh, Ed, Edd, and Eddy was my childhood, even tho i hated it :D it was always on my tv while playing games
Ed Edd and Eddy ended with a pretty good finale

RIP greatest singer ever

It's worth it, IMO, Bronysith. It's one of the only good movies based off of a Saturday Night Live skit. Heck, the only other one I can think of off the top of my head is Blues Brothers.

It took me awhile to relize the summons from Final Fantasy 12 were based off of the Zodiac Signs
whomp whomppuee GAME OVER
I don't think I ever got far enough into FF12 to get summons...lol
The scorpio one is fucking hidious
xD
I regret being a scorpio
and can you believe it... my zodiac is a Fat poisionous thing!!
Dat gangsta
lol
I wish I was a Tarus
BEAN WARSSSSSSSSSSSSss
give me yo beans mothe fucker
lol
but it's a nice key ring
I am never fighting Yiazamat
I would only play the very start of the game, 'cause I knew a game-breaking glitch that I'd use to get all the characters up to insane levels before even breaking into the first castle and meeting Fran and Balthier.
i hope no kids saw this ep
actually if you read the cuchulain(sp?) lore, it was actually a beatiful creature created to contain the filth on the world
but the gods underestimated the filth in the world, and became that thing
valoreins|Drawing the scorpio?
dmannn
yup
A boss with 50,112,254 hp? Fuck that shit
lol
what game are you guys talking about?
Final Fantasy XII
http://derpy.me/FbvG9 This is the Taurus Summon
oh fuck that game but its pretty good (hate the lvl system but love the game)
the goddess boss in ff7:cc had more than 50 mil
i should have done this
CCCP: i did
Bronysith: :o
FFXII rant - TOO DIVERSE I CANT FOCUS THE STORY!! FFXIII rant - TOO LINEAR!!
That's a pretty good buisness model.
hmmmm how will this backfire
http://derpy.me/sljsB I am upset Scorpios got this as their zodiac summon
valoreins|Drawing: lol that reminds me of jontron vid
valoreins|Drawing: both are far inferior compared to FF6 FF7 or FF10
Spade-Magnes[R] wut
FXVIIII too much walking
Every sign except scorpio gets a cool looking summon
no playing just a movie XD
Quicksilver: FFIX
lol
Scorpios get a hidious fat monster
but its kinda cute :3
scarface suite?
lol

Spade-Magnes[R]: Neat, thanks.
Hey, whats LordCelestia like when hes mad?

Spade-Magnes[R]: yo imma happy for you and imma let you finish. BUT KNIGHTS OF THEROUND is the best summon of all time

twilight_sprinkle: actually not really at all
http://derpy.me/Jv8dZ Capricorn gets a lighting Dragon
User0: i know :P
Quicksilver: play by the rules, fillies
Is it wrong for me to hate the My little pony fandom sometimes?

Hi dudes! :)
Spade-Magnes[R]: nope
00,03of course not
but capricorn is a goat... weird designers

Seems like Riley is a buinessman and an artist
Spade-Magnes[R]: welcome to every group/fandom

whats this song, sounds like coldplay
User0: true to that
well when certan 'so' called 'bronys' do some bad things *Cough* Clop fics *cough*
oh
paradis
Spade-Magnes[R] no worries, every fandom has to deal with people like that
I mean some people cant handle insults and make us look like fanatics
There will always be "That guy"

:)
hi everypony
hai Saigneur
Spade-Magnes[R]: hm, i like his vids, ill check it out.
Hi Saigneur
hi Saigneur
Spade-Magnes[R]: sounds more like a compliment to me though
did someone see pikorar recently ?
Im pretty sure Total Biscuit didnt mean it as an insult but some people are over sensitive
Again.. If someone doesnt like it,, thats fine with me... We dont have to get EVERYONE to like it
Inb4 anger.
G3 theme XD
ANd then suddenly: ponies
Spade-Magnes[R]: It's the internet at it's best somewhere somehow people will take it as if it's the worst thing to ever happen
Geez :D
BEST GEN EVAR! :D
You'll always find people that are oversensitive and make some stupid excuse to whine about something :S
Spade-Magnes[R]: yeah thats true
well this would be dream come true if this world existed in RL
Rainbow Dash Always Dresses In Style!
Style.
Not lame!
:s
MegaMoonShine: /)
Spade-Magnes[R]: the thing ive learned after a while i nthis community is that people are still people, just because they like 1 same thing as you it doesnt mean anything in the slightest, especially with a community this size
I need to play this on my violin - butthurt everywhere!
Andy Roddick just won his round at Wimbledon (if anypony else here actually watches tennis...lol)
Meanwhile: (\
User0: Do it! :D
RaveBrony: not here at work...
im surprised no one rage during that opening :o
Spade-Magnes[R]: it mightve been during the time when it only consisted of the first brave ones to liek it though
User0: Where ever! :D
I still hate what one guy told me when I said I liked Other M
OtakuTom: you watch tennis?
and im still waiting for hasbro to make this
Say what
:O
Sometimes. There's other sports I watch more often, though.
RaveBrony: actually, I lied - I might bring in my violin one day to show off my homemade piezo-electric system...
OtakuTom: cuz i do, and i thought nobody here follows tennis :D
User0: Lolwut :D
OtakuTom: but yeah, Andy used to be an excellent player. if it werent for King Fed, hed have like 8 slams
The jerk said if I didnt hate Metroid Other M like everyone else I'm not a true Metroid fan
The guy was a ass...
RaveBrony: my accoustic violin has an electic output - kinda backhacked some stuff and made some circuits (I'm going to look into making a distortion pedal sooner or later)
What makes him say that? :S
User0: Oh wow! :o
fly with out wings is possible
That guy is an idiot for addressing something like that. If you don't like, it's fine
^
Hint: Internet ponies + HDMI cable + TV = win!
Spade-Magnes[R] THAT really is some of the most douchiest thing i've ever heard :O
mlp the movie
If I like a game everyone else hates how does that not make me a fan?
just need to make airodynamic cloths that allow flight
I don't follow it a whole lot...I kinda know the names of some of the higher-ranking players, but beyond that, I don't see a whole lot of it. I'm able to catch more of the tournaments when they're outside the US since I work overnights, so across the pond are live while I'm awake...lol.
300 ponies
Tervicz must be glorius
Spade-Magnes[R]: If you ask me, I don't think HE is a true fan
RaveBrony: I'll show you it today or sometime (taking this to pm...)
The colour is much better
Plus, you shouldn't care what he says if he makes a comment like that. You'll still be a Metriod fan even if you don't like one game
poor arthur
COmpared to laptop screen that is
Spade-Magnes[R]: I liked Other M, I just don't really like what Team Ninja did to Samus...
My brain /is/ melting
User0: Alright :P
I thought the gameplay was great, though.
Ridley was beefy in that game
wtf
wha? live action?
THE HELL IS THIS?
poor srthur. he got exposed to G1 ponies
:o
Backstreet Boys. I think.
The Ridley fight was awesome.
THE FUCKING HELL IS THIS!?
backstreet mice
Another target for ponification?
Spade-Magnes[R] I like how everyone hates on the game because Samus is portraied as a mentally broken character.. but Other M wasn't the only time when she was portraied like this
haven't heard them in awhile
otakon: It's the Backstreet Boys episode of Arthur
Trying. Not. To. Pay. Attention. To the stream lol
WHAT the FUCK
Everyone hates on the break down in Other M
backstreet mice, aka dumpster rats
I find it understandable
well this is got creepy fast
I like the Ebay song better.
/me "Oh, look what time it is...I've had enough life for today...EEEYP!" and then jumps onto the ground and EXPLODES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was this actually in the show
/me explodes
Meanwhile: Yes!! (\
I like the Weird Al version of this song
/me sweeps otakon up.
RaveBrony: /)
bought it on ebay!
ohai otakon
/me is now in a neat pile fo exploded bits
This can't be in the catual show
who's streaming?
Tigertonic_The_Cat: yfw it is
/me takes otakon from Meanwhile andplaces him on a table
how are they allowed to show that vid on the interent
Dat way
oh god
They can see into the real world?!
I fully understand the breakdown she has in Other M...she JUST KILLED RIDLEY and was leaving where she killed him when she got the Baby's Cry.
I still find it disturbing Ridley came from a small fluffy creature
I bought on ebay!
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
music is sacred
I mean at the point of the time line
O_______o THIS CANNOT BE REAL
Samus has fought ridley at least 5 times
new name for MLP music is sacred
what are they anyway
and ridley fucking blew up on Zebes
lol, arthur insulted brittney spears, how low
did she just call Backstreetboys "rock?" aw hell no!
otakon: You never seen Arthur?
I thought Other M was real early in the timeline...
are they monkies
it just....it just...IT.....JUST....CANNOT.....
How can they show this on the kid's show??? The guy in the band had a gangster bling with a cross on it
/me explodes again
oh man...
crusifex
otakon: The primes happen before Return of samus and super
String_Shredder: Oh HELLS NO!! :O
ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
/me is covered with otakon
dont worry nig
Spade-Magnes[R]: wrong ping
Any game with actual metroids in it is before return
im surprised shes not insane
/me hoses AttackWithHugs
/me piles ice on otakon
WHAT AN INSULT.
MLP FiM : the movie friendship is canon
also, did anyone else get their newletter yet?

Yea...that's happening more frequently, otakon...

Nope.
Fusion is the final in the time line

The whole misping, I mean.
I FOUND THE BEST B MOVIE EVER!
But yea...I just got an email that makes me incredibly excited...

Thanks for that,Meanwhile.
otakon: I've mentioned the mailserver failure everyday since like, monday, y u no listen.
taht is why I was asking
Hmmm... Maybe there are Pony voice actors in this thing?
arthur your a dumb ass some times
whyarewewatchingthis
now I start to feel funny
/me blow dries AttackWithHugs.
August 28...GUILD WARS 2 LAUNCHES!!!!!
Np.
stop saying thier name
Fuck Neo Ridly
I heard people hated other M because of no linearity
Spade-Magnes[R] The Metraid Mange portraied her like this, and the whole "Suite of a Space Warrior" in Symphonic Legends was dark and grim to portraid Samus inner feelings, and both came out before other M
Meanwhile: bc I WASN'T HERE FOR IT
otakon i didn't get mine either
/me glomps Meanwhile ontop of otakon
I mean too linear
Bronysith: I'm a PILE OF DUST
otakon: wat is dis movie called?(the b movie you mentioned)
otakon: You were here for it when I said it yesterday.
You just don't listen.
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not telling :)

FUCK YOU ARTHUR GOD DAMNIT YOU UGLY SHITFACE BITCH!!!!
Meanwhile: well Iw asn't HERE

otakon: aw. but best b-movie is hot shots part deux for me
I THOUGHT YOU HAD INTERGRITY!
twilight_sprinkle: enope I found one better
Eww we saw her nipples.
I can't remember the last time I watched Arthur...I kinda want to see the episode that has Neil Gaiman in it...
anyway, brb need a drink
and who the fuck is this?
mohamd in a kids show?
Good god. How is this a kid's show.
I mean I dont understand why people mock her break down when her long time rival who died on a planet that exploded and it came back somehow and the fact it murdered both her parents doesnt help
man this sshow is risky
I couldnt endure without sleeping, I had to lie down for 2 hours and now my head hurts.
Alchemist how long have you been up?

Lil_B: obviously, but I want to wait at least until 8 pm, because I cant sleep more than 8 hours (I usually sleep for 5-6), and if I went to bed now, I would wake up at 2 in the morning and screw up my biological clock :D

Nope
OtakuTom: I still find it disturbing that cute little thing was Ridley
SONG?
Awwwww :S
Just got a bit of sauce on my finger sorting out dinner, no big deal I'll just eat it. Turns out it's hot sauce.
I sugest you check out Chubby... Chuppy Checker that is!
did that cute furry thing had a name?
I kept claiming that I wanted to keep it as a pet...then when it was revealed to be Ridley, I kinda had a "...nevermind" moment.
principal says groovy, best principal ever
Dken2021: It was nicknamed "Little Birdy"

dude i was watching tv! Meanwhile my friend was sitting in a tank in the Rain !
Also Super missles just utterly destroy Ridley
Lil_B|LMMS: TIMING!
so much hammer
MysteryPony: huh?
Sweetie is best singer
too much hammertime
Priest is getting it on :P
Phantoon was a Holy shit moment for mwe
*me
He came out of nowhere
I wonder how much "Hammer" the chat can take
/me mutes stream, goes back to LMMS :)
Meanwhile: Cake or a spring loaded bearcanon! you deside!
Phantoon was great.
you're a bit of beat witht he hammer Scoot-Scootaloo
MysteryPony: hammer.
otakon: Lets get hammered
otakon: all the hammer!
otakon mybe his clock just said "Hammertime"
How about...crap...I can't remember his name...he originally appeared in Fusion as the holder of the Gravity Suit...
Knees between your legs?
:S
OtakuTom: Nightmare
Yea
I laughed when it got flung around
Meanwhile: ohh that explains the naked man in my frifge!
MysteryPony: Yes. Yes it does.
I wish the Gravity suit add on was actually purple
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN
Holla everypony! :)

/me hugs GilDash
Hi GilDash :)
/me glomps GilDash
/me hugs GilDash !

Holla GilDash
/me hugs all of you. :)
I had trouble fighting the Mystery Creature...I think I had to try a good 8 times to beat him.
Apperently they were going to make it purple but they didnt for some reason
The tail gets super fast when its health gets low
curse you LMMS! Why can't I strech a sample while keeping it in the sdame note :(
I could totally ignore the stream to get my work done but Scoot-Scootaloo is destroying my focus...
It got easy for me when I tracked the tail and then fired a missle at it
User0 work to do? why note "shortly visit" Bronystate?
ok sellouing out is needed to make money and continue your band moronic kids
Fransin is best pony
it's been a hard day's night....
^
I'm trying to remember if I had any problems with the other bosses...
/me glomps <3
^^^
Chimewww
Late sorry
:D
Apperently if you dont dodge the fire creature when it leaps out of the lava when you first enter the sector it instant kills you
I am helping people
I think I died a few times to the Metroid Queen.
Lil_B|LMMS: I never "'shortly visit' Bronystate"
I never bothered to not dodge to find out
Y library so busy
Hey everypony
Same here, Spade. I never knew that...lol
hai Very_Silly_Filly
Hey Very_Silly_Filly
User0 One does not simply "just visit" Bronysate XD
So, which Metroid game is your favorite?
hi Very_Silly_Filly :) how are you?
Omg omg omg omg i cant find my snus! srly cant find it OMG! ahhhhhhh
Fine ta
just saying sound board mod when she said cute you should have inserted the CMC
Bit hot, but hah
I still find it retarded he enabled the varia after we trekked through half the sector and nearly got engulfed by lava
true. You log in and get trapped here for hours :D
Lil_B|LMMS: One does not just simply get work done...
I've played all of them and beaten all of them except for Prime 2 and 3
WHat dumb kids
my god these kids are dumb
QuickThinker: you dont say?
those are some nice trading cards
if you buy a card i always make sure they are high quality
X3
Dken2021: it would be a shame if anything were to happen to them
sound bites all over the place
You work at liberry? :o
Spade-Magnes[R] stay back, I got a kitty!
No shit
wow im awake before shizu...what is this black magic

news flash KID KILLS DAD MOM SAID ONE DAY SHE WOULD BE FAMIOUS
I still question the logic in making metroids immune to cold
Once they go berserk your pretty much fucked
Yea, I still don't really undesrtand the whole immunity to cold when they've been hurt by it in the past
Spade-Magnes[R] is metroid Prime 2 or 3 better?
Spade-Magnes[R]: you're*
NICOLAS CAGE losing his shit. its too damn good
OH GOD
the memories
Bronysith because nicolas cage is best actor :)
OH GOD
Bronysith: All Nicolas Cage can do, is make retarded faces that turn into memes
well they will miss the band manager so much she did nothing but hold them back XD
Now that I think about it. I wonder if MB willinly sent Samus to her death and knew the metroids were immune to cold
Very_Silly_Filly: and make a shitzillion dollars every year
fake and gay!
MysteryPony: raywilliamjohnson?
how about that? replaced by a drum machine
Bronysith: That's a couple more quid than what the queen makes
hacksaw
fuck yeah, drum machiene (sarcasm)
Bronysith: balls to you sir! balls to you!
Personally, I like Prime 1 the best, 'cause it really raised the bar for the franchise (which I thik Team Ninja dropped, but still made a decent game)
screwdriver
i agree apple bloom
OGOD NOT THE BEES!
I still find it stupid the game never tells you till after the fight that you can use power bombs
BEES, NOT THE BEES
ANd then suddenly: furries <====
I liked prime 1 too, 2 was ok besides the backtracking
You're still on the fight with the metroid queen? :P
'sup, guys? I'd love to talk about some show-related stuff via Skype, no bronies to talk to anywhere near 100km² from where I live and just chatting via text is boring. If you have some spare time please add me on Skype, name is Draewa.
Im starting to question if the Galactic federation is actually good
HOWD IT GET BURNED?!
sold out by a sound board
I used the power bomb the first time I got to that phase of the fight, it went off when I had some 5 life left...lol
freeman??
it was aLL DREAM BULLSHIT
Man I love mint icecream.

Troopers have taken bribes from Space pirates, They've made cyborg zebesians,A Mother Brain AI, cold immune metroids after they said they wanted all the metroids destroyed...

User0: Oh thank god.

Meanwhile: there were two full containers of it last time I checked
Yes

Spade-Magnes[R]: Do not question the word!
It would make for an interesting storyline, Samus being called to a federation space station to be put on trial, when another copy of the SA-X appears (they did say there were a number of them on the BSL station by the end) and starts to take over the place.
Also celebiiii :3

Who's streaming?
True, but Other M was arguably the most story-heavy game out of all of them so far, though the argument could be made for Fusion.

I think Mitt Romney has plans on making the government more efficient rather than out of our way. It's going to take a lot more than just changing the president. We have to get better people in Congress too.
Kandarihu: But what are the plans?
More Hammers!!

Thus why their factories exist in places where wages suck, or used to suck. Pretty soon China's gonna stop being the go-to place because their workers are starting to demand higher wages, so it'll go to Taiwan and whatnot

Hello everypony!
Scoot-Scootaloo: TELL.ME.THIS.EMULATOR.THAT.YOU'RE.USING.
You know what I dont get about this?
otakon: i can name a few other emulators
Processor Oak.
hi ThunderCloud
hello ThunderCloud
This is the first game to use animated sprites right?
I should have dinner... but... I really don't want to eat.
twilight_sprinkle: well I have a couple good ones but this one i like for the skin
Hi Wooper
Why do you keep talking like Shatner?
Who's going to NYC?
wqw stream broke again
the text is going to slow us why he is talking like that
~sighs
FairysHuff: DINNER
You're going to Bronycon then?
Ohai ThunderCloud :P
Why did they drop the animated sprites from Ruby Saphire Fire red and leaf green but brought back for emerald?
Wait how are you playing that if the power light is not even on?
Woohoo!
/me Has skipped breakfest and lunch
I'll see you there!
does any of yall live tennessee :S
/me enjoys his "converted into fingerless gloves" gloves, Lyra would be jealous
Can anyone explain that to me?
So who's streaming exactly anyways
It's not a real Game Boy. It's a web emulator.
Hey everypony :(
How old is Oak?
I'm guessing Scoot-Scootaloo
hello TimtheBrony
hi TimtheBrony
hey TimtheBrony
Spade-Magner[R], the graphics were much more detailed in RSE, and animating them at first would've delayed the game longer.
ThunderCloud: you mean a mitten?
Who's streaming
With Emerald they had the time to make the additional sprites.
Never heard of him
Dermathil: Scoot-Scootaloo
scoot -scootaloo is Dermathil
...
ah
The numbers, Mason!
Also Gamefreak why y u make pokemon for 3ds
John Madden!
What si this?
*is
herp derp
Needs more John Madden!
what's this? scoots playing gold/silver?
NO I DIDNT
Spade-Magnes[R]: they may have done it so peopel would buy both gold and crystal, and then both ruby and emerald
CallofLukey: Pokemon Crystal
Make one allready for the 3ds game freak
Um, okay.
Your name is Nooch!
I'm still quite baffled about how he's not using VBA for emulation
Snooky?
Stop putting them on the regular ds
Get a chiken and call it Scootlo!
SCOOTS
User0 dunno, I'm not english, I have no idea to categorice gloves :P
Scoot-Scootaloo: WHAT EMULATOR ARE YOU USING?
Scootalol

You should turn on the power of that GBC

Magic: refresh again

Scoot-Scootaloo: could you type it please? you said it too fast.
Dermathil: I heard him but it was too fast

Lol
Spade-Magnes[R] maybe for backwards compatability
hey Cypresswolf!
OPEN YOUR EARS
No, stay out of his shed!
I think I will start to play Albion again. Its been a while and its one of my favorite rpgs :)
Since when did Shatner play pokemon Scoot-Scootaloo ^_^
I don't understand why we're watching this but.
;)
Black and white 2 was probably already in production and late at that when 3ds came out
Scookie?
that's why you should use a vba
Dermathil: THEY ARE OPEN I CAN'T TYPE THAT FAST
Pokemon...Yellow?
Wait wat you don't have the FRAMEBOOSTER?
agh
Scoot-Scootaloo: you can speed up the text in options
Ohai Cypresswolf :P
LOL
Change the speed of your text.
His reading.
yes Scoot why aren't you using VBA?
god
may be LOL
it works then stops
Get Cheatengien and Speedhack it!
Oh my gosh, cna I save on the emulator?
my keybord is crappy:'(
Would you stop reading stuff like that dude just hush
CrimsonPhoenix: it's a site
Pokemon Silver/Gold/Crystal? :S
mitamaking: yes you can
That thing allowed me to beat Emerald in like 7 hours with my emulator
a MAC?!
Change the text speed.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Is turning into william shatner. O_o
I believe there are VBA for mac
SHUSH OTAKON

Professor oa ELM

Scoot-Scootaloo: Speedhack it!

Alchemist: hello
noooo dont hurt Twilight
Pokemon Crystal lol

SENTRY APPEREAD
Invi: quote "He was staring at his ass" I figured you were refering to the stream.

Pokemon makes me silly in the brainthingy!
yes yes it does
:D
where u at??
Happy feet!
Braviary: :D
GET DAT HOE
wat r some crazy cool jobs that have to do with communities
LETS WORK
that was only a few steps though
i was thinking maybe i could try animation
It might be in the top bercentage
i hate ratata
LightNight can you animate?
whats this guy name on the left
What I always hated about Pokemon (and thank goodness they put in that berry in Platinum) is that if you want to EV train your Pokemon, you'll have to start over >.<
not communism XD
Rattata and Zubat.
why dousent it let you put them in the pokeball while uncontious
Use the force...
ha i could learn
Meanwhile: yeah, two porst pokemen
Is your chat on lag?
Nazism, then. Heil Hitler!
*worst
pony_373 you could always try raise eggs
LightNight try some work in a bar
catch that hoe
/me takes a break here at bronystate
he ain't got no balls yet?
You know what annoys me about the pokemon you can get from the mystery gifts?
tisk tisk
Braviary: and thus you proved the law true
You cant nickname them
he whips his tail back and forth
hey flutter_spin hows your day been
Dken2021: No, as in beating the game, then doing all that raising again :S
*she
i Like who the adds almost fit perfect on screen!
alexxm: i don't drink :P
really really good. I'm writing a little story of the mane 6 at a picnic
Catch it and beat the elite 4 with it
but there is a twist at the end
Why the hell does it not let you nickname the pokemon you download via mysterygift?
He gotta use his whole body for a tail whip? O.O
i wish my dad was will smith!
LightNight you don't need to drink to work at a bar
how can we turn this into a drinking game?
User0: Drink everytime there's a zubat
lol Meanwhile
User0: Drink whenever something obvious is revealed.
Meanwhile: and Ratata
Meanwhile: Or a rattata.
The pokemon you download is tecnically yours so you should be able to
Take a sip on every tall grass encounter.
alexxm: i might get more depressed seeing unhappy drunk ppl XD I get enough of that from my parents :P
harhar
who is this sunshine and why are you walking over him?
Is johto on the moon?
Meanwhile: White out? finish your drink.
User0: everytime a pokemon dies take a sip! everytime a pokemon is chapterd take a shot! and when a gym leader dies drink the rest of the bottel your are holding!
but ya i have never tried animating
sorry i didn't know LightNight
Hello ;)
hi :)
Is it ever explained why most of the kanto stuff is missing in this game?
Hey
drink every time he takes a step
Hi
MysteryPony: Anything happen, take a drink
hoi TimtheBrony
Drink everytime his pokemon lvls x.x
Drink when you're not allowed to ride your bike.
Hey twi :D
I haven't been on in like years.
I was dead
Scoot-Scootaloo: no, STOP, YOU HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW!
Spade-Magnes[R] limitations of the gameboy, they had too much stuff to fill so they cut some stuff out
LightNight: sociology/sociologist?
pink roofs!
Finish your drink if you kill a legendary.
hey TimtheBrony hows you rday been
May I ask how the fuck Oak knows when you are trying to ride your bike?
Scoot-Scootaloo: talk to him he gives you run boots iirc
too annoying
Its been ok how bout yours?
i have actually taken sociology

Allo Chell/.
Of course you realise, this means war!
http://www.goodearthliveherbs.com/sweet-banana-pepper-live-vegetable-plants/vegetable_sweet_banana_pepper_plants.jpg

Scoot-Scootaloo: NO MLG!
Meanwhile:...........
NO MLG GODDAMMIT!
Chell: :I
Chell: oh yeah...you don't talk
this is my first time on here
I caught Kuyrem with a regular pokeball when it was in the green zone
Chell: you're more silent then Shizuschlafen
sunshine celery stalks
Level 6!!!
and it was not a critical capture
otakon:..........
Lets worrrkkkkkkkkk

h
flutter_spin: oh I see. Thats basically regular paprika.
/me jumps!
is that a good move
Try and beat that capture
alexxm: it's Pokemon Crystal I think so
I never gave a crap about those numbers at all.
k
otakon i meant to say move
YOU BREAK THE RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL What a dick move! Generation IV and up has one thing: If Gravity is in play, you can't even use it lol
CAPTURE IT!
I just ignored them and bought a thousand healing pots.
WELCOME TO THE HERD
Oh, and spam hyper bea,
beam*
Can you think of a more rediculace capture than mine?
Brony: ............
That explains it.. there's only one thing we can do then! SCIENCE!
Meanwhile: ah, Hyper Beam I love that move
OH GOD!
Are there any pega-sisters in this chat room?
i love that song
Or its all broneh
with lots of lasers, pew pew
TimtheBrony: Brony is gender neutral
I caught a kyurem with a regular pokeball when it was in the green zone and it had no statuses and it was a regular capture
Shiz is a pega-sister
TimtheBrony: but we've got a few girls that come here
:)
Hyper beam was broken in gen 1, kill and get another free shot
13Chell: Enough spamming periods.
Can i be a pegasister?
Shizuka: your'e awake, hello dear
can a thing the size off a big really hurt you by tackling you
Allo Shizu.
SHI ZU KAA
I knew that brony is gender neutral
ohai Shizuka
your chat is laged
O:
DO I have to pronounce it for you AGAIN Scoot-Scootaloo?
Thats why the site is called "BronyState"
So have any of you captured a pokemon in a ridiculace way?
/me facepalms
/)_-)
:(
someone up the speed on this rom
:D
Spade-Magnes[R]: No, but I killed Lugia like 12 times before I caught it.
flutter_spin: it's a site
Rock music for life!
Scoot-Scootaloo: dude, just STREAM THE EMULATOR
a site? oh well, ok
On the pokemon world fainting is knocking it out right?
Spade-Magnes[R]: yeah
@Shizuka: What's a period? is it a ','?
well thiunk about this
So how the hell do the legendaries escape?
or a '.'?
Scoot-Scootaloo: you should then!
wat happens to all the little pokemon u make faint in the wild
.
me no no
they die
Let me tell you, x4 speed makes the battle much more interesting
Scoot-Scootaloo: it only take a few seconds!
they die
hokey
;(
due to no medical attention :3
13i have no hope for this generation...
TOMORROW IS MOVIE NIGHT!
Shizuka: what's wrong this time?
If you knock the legendaries how do they escape?
How does movie night work?
Sorry i'm new :3
Scoot-Scootaloo: I have a good site for you
Shizuka: I thought it was called a comma?
Shizuka: I hope it didn't take that to lose your hope because I haven't had any for it since it came into being.
i wish my stream would stop breaking down
http://www.coolrom.com/ Scoot-Scootaloo GO HERE!
I forget the name of the Leader of team aqua
13people that don't know what a period is, people that don't know how to click the large friendly button that says "FAQ" right above the stream and chat boxes
Uhm... hello?
I don't mind. I'm eating. I just figured it was annoying you to death to play at that speed
Shizuka: What period?
Shizuka: I see ...
I thought he said that was a period. I thought that '.' was a full stop?
Vordox: from Chell RPing earlier
Hey Ace :)
Shizuka: well not everyone speaks english well.
Oh. okay;)
otakon: I just got back. ><
Is it safe to say Team Aqua and Magma are idiots?
what counts as trolling?
LUNA
ON THE MOOOOOONNNNNAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
Shizuka isnt this a period ~
twilight_sprinkle: That's punctuation, I don't think it has much to do with language.
since when
lulz
I thought this nick was banned! Wtf? I guess it's not. Well, I'm happy to be here. :D
They nearly doomed the world because they used the wrong orbs
Chrysalis: Correct, s'a tilde.
trolling counts as fun brony
OMG Rarity is best pony!
brony: anything done to aggravate the chat on whole. plus posting NSFW stuff
Fuck everything.
How the fuck would you think the red orb would controll The water pokemon...
sure is!
Fluttershy all day!
Meanwhile: she said people dont know what a period is, thats word meaning, not punctuation
Omg fluttershy is best pony!
got to go to the dentist for braces :'( wish me luck
init blud
FUCK EVERYBODY ALL DAY LONG
hey :[
Rainfall_Night: lucki
I tend to do the period thing. I have to refrain myself sometimes
twilight_sprinkle: Ok, fair point.
*pony* is BEST pony!
TimtheBrony: yes?
Rainfall_Night good luck
Bye.
And yeah i didnt try to do anything against rulez so go easy on me :)

S.o. .. do.. i. .
Tigertonic_The_Cat: dude, he gonna kick ya
as in the verb?
oh
periods are evil things
and he's gone
Have there been ANY competent pokemon bad guys?
No.
Spade-Magnes[R]: Giovanni and Mewtwo
Mewtwo?
MelaPonie: that is actually is the same word in many languages :D
everybidi ^^
Why can't I be like Pinkie Pie :)
Plasma was sort of competent
Because Pinkie Pie is an anthropomorhpic cartoon horse.
Spade-Magnes[R] from what i've heard team plasma is pretty competant
I liked the movie :)
"Low budget or poorly reviewed films take this slot " <--- Dat FF: Spirits Within
:D
oh ya :)
anthropomorphic*
argh the movie
Spade-Magnes[R] I guess Ghetis, he tried killing the MC with a kyurem in bw2
twilight_sprinkle, which is the same in many languages?
I told my m8 i broke my laptop. I wont go on skype so i can mess with his mind. you know, for science
hai everypony
MelaPonie: the bodily function period
hey michael

Was just thinking of the future of Bronies.. It wasn't nice
twilight_sprinkle, lol i know in english, i was wondering which was used in other languages...
Meanwhile seems like it
03I only need a few for myself but for $1-ish a piece I told him to get a bunch so I can give some to people
:)
alexxm: perfect :D
Dken2021: Well you didnt really reveal much of the plot so its ok... I guess
/me tryes to hold cry of being so happy to be here
MelaPonie: well in russian both are used
you have to get Sudowoodo and call it Fluttershy!!!!!!
/me in Galaxy far far away...
what does smokescreen do
today is a day full of win for me :D
creates smoke
oh someone said they were new here?! Earlier I have something for them!
lower accuraty
MelaPonie: menstruation is a biological term so i think tis the same in most langueages
alexxm lowers accuracy
/me waves at Shamroc
MelaPonie: period is probably used in several
thanks Ace and Dken2021

MelaPonie: ukr
Pokemon White, Black, Blue, Red?
i love this song
:/
Da future of bronies... Hasbro loses profits on mlp so they delete the episodes off yt. Still don't gain enough money, delete brony stuff off yt. Bronies protest. Hasbro remove websites like EQD. Bronies die. Universe explodes. Oranges turn purple and combust.
I didn't play any pokemon
Vordox that crystal there is just 3 years after red/blue
didnt they turn this song into a choir song?
xD
sunsine
xD
Invi: Dang.. :P
got this song on my ipod xD
Ace: dont listen to it for 1-2 weeks and you'll enjoy it again
Vordox :D
I'm going to sit in the corner now.
yeh
What I want to know is how Gheitis got the orb for Giratina
thats another way
no i mean that i dont really like 2 things in cartoons Cheesy song and too mushy love scenes :D
even if you delete MLP FIM is magic this song will still exist in our hearts
But screw life, life never did anything useful for me.
So when does Black and White take place?
dont like*
Erm I mean Black and white 2
Internet derp back :P
imagine they decided to make a new mlp. and its like one of those shows were the characters are teenagers! the horror
Spade-Magnes[R] I think 2 years iirc
twilight_sprinkle, cool
:) I <3 this fandom - never ceases to amaze me - somehow always manages to make me smile in moments even on my worst days like today :)
I wonder what Ghetis is up to
Cypresswolf: Been there :).
yh but u know wat i mean
like rugrats teenagers edition
I wonder if N will be in Black and White 2
i remember the day when a black guy stole my pokedex when i was a kid
that kinda style
I always read the names in these like they shout them
or they go cgi
I mean really.
I need to get to GOLDENROD for my radio show.
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mOntI17z10g/T-qHRifo5wI/AAAAAAAADoU/55-R1hhT6So/s1600/kihyt.png - this made me laugh
Is it ever explained why Silver is such a jerk?
Oh yh that reminds me
i got to go on my local radio station
twilight_sprinkle: so u never got it back?
they got pony'd
is it my screen only or anyone does have some bugs? (whit this stream)
Spade-Magnes[R] there was some side story in heartgold that kinda explained it
Ace, I think it's your screen.
Cypresswolf: nardwhals + MLP?
hehe i'm lucky :D
twilight_sprinkle, pokedex? black guy? wtf?
Isnt Silver Giovani's son or something?
MahBoi777: nope, i waited too long to talk driver cuz i was shy, and when i told him the black guy said he didnt take anything and that was that
does the guy on the left play pokemon/games every day?
Ace nah. my lizard eats alll the bugs
:D it's just so random
MelaPonie: irl i mean
:D

brony: Nah.
twilight_sprinkle, yeah i thought so
bunch of letters and numbers
Brony this his first time playing here
buy an snake it eats rats :D
And can I point out Clair is a total bitch?
twilight_sprinkle: that sucks
brony all of the mods has their own things they stream
Scoot-Scootaloo: you are.
Spade-Magnes[R]: his cahracter is explained better in hg/ss
I feel depressed all of a sudden.. damn emotion cores! y u no work properly
Clair: Loses fair and square, doesnt do her job and give you the badge
i would like to recommend pokemonremixstudios music :P they are rlly good
MahBoi777: yeah he also stole soem cards of mine. he also stole another thing from me later
I hate clair so much
Capture it.

Bacon in general is overrated.

:D
It took me forever to figure out the gym is shaped like a clefairy
and i had saphire
Bacon Berry
MahBoi777: what i missed the most was my promo mew cards from the 2nd movie. i had SIX of them, and i lost them all, same gave away, some that black guy knocked out of my hand and i lost all of them
also something that makes no sense, why is ghost considered a physical type?
yum
MahBoi777: *some i gave away
I require one berry
Cya guys!
You require more pylons
/me eats rare candy
cherio
Bye Mysterypony
cya
seeya Mysterypony
bye Mysterypony
If pokemon can only use a move a certain number of times and have to be healed to use those moves again, how do pokemon in the wild survive O_o
bye Mysterypony
One of the elite 4 in Black and white was in Diamond and Pearl And Platinum
Bye
le gasp
my face.. y?
twilight_sprinkle: I would have told someone, I mean that just doesn't seem right to me
Cypresswolf: Leppa berries.
dey have berries
Cypresswolf perhaps the move limit is a pokemon league rule not a natural thing?
Mickey Mouse
Ok i'm going now. i have important things to attend to!
wtf
in da club house
:P But what about Red & Blue?
<3
alexxm: Which explains why it still applies when you fight wild pokemon?
MahBoi777: yeah, i dont remember if i did or not. i remember some redneck kid stole my bike, that my parents did try to deal with
MahBoi777: redneck stole mah bike :D
League Rules suck :|
yeah
My stream keeps crashing, I think management might have busted me....
Cypresswolf: i hate the rule where you have to give a card away
oh no, it's ???
I'm going bye everypony :3

twilight_sprinkle: wow, seems like you had it pretty rough back then.

O_O I never heard of that rule - but I've never played the card game in official tournaments
MahBoi777: yeah, although id gladly trade my current problems for those
pokemon league is full of retards what heals whit berries and then potions OH COMEON :'(
Scoot-Scootaloo: What are you going to name your rival?
how long is that animation
lool
twilight_sprinkle: well I wish u the best
MahBoi777: thanks :)
The frontier brain of the Battle castle is the same blond haired girl you fight in the black and white elite 4
:)
:/
:)
would anyone suggest I try animation or would it maybe be too hard???
I have no experience
Is every pokemon region based off of a real world region?
besides Stick Figure Animator XD
it's worth a shot LightNight
lol :D
Pokemon
I still have all my cards from jr high + several decks given to me by people who didn't want them anymore - and I can't find anyone who wants them :|
Spade-Magnes[R] i think so
this is why i say totodile is best starter, his ice fang is super-effective against grass, ergo rival grass pokemon
u use Pivot LightNight?
Spade-Magnes[R] yea, kanto-sinnoh is based in japan
ya
i used to
twilight_sprinkle does ice fang already exsist back then?
Spade-Magnes[R] iirc, yes
There needs to be a pokemon game where you can visit all the regions
Enemy Totodile used hax
Invi: yeah i think ice type moves began in gen 2
What is IIRC?
lol :D
LightNight: u shud try Flash, it's easy to use once u get used to it
Spade-Magnes[R] if i remember correctly
do u have an potion?
Spade-Magnes[R]: if i recall/remember correctly
dat song
flutterwonder
Garborador disgustsme
twilight_sprinkle idk. I guess that ice fang and the fang moves exsist since D/P
tackle into ass nice
lol scoot is actually losing :D
:D
:O
LOL
Deep wide bell wonder.
You know what annoys me when you transfer pokemon?
rival is hax
Scoot-Scootaloo: tackling doesn't work quick as well on the moon...
LOL
He mad
Spade-Magnes[R]: a lot of things annoy me about it
Every pokemon is in caps lock
u need to spam smokescreen 5 times to lower that acuraty then it works
BERRY
Why the fuck is it in caps lock....
Scoot-Scootaloo UMAD?
Spade-Magnes[R] it's fixed in black and white
Scoot-Scootaloo, I spent 20 minutes making this for you. I hope you like it. http://i48.tinypic.com/121bdrm.png
lol scoot would rage like Nova it were a crit :D
Dken2021: not with the pokemon I transfer

Spade-Magnes[R] if that is the only problem you have with that, be glad :D

RAWRity: how ironic
to begin with my english barely holds itself together
God damn it firefox fucking froze
and I was like "HOLY FUCK THIS IS BRILLIANT I MUST USE IT."
Spade-Magnes: it's been acting up for me too
wb Michael, how was DINNER?
RAWRity: well, in your case it was HILARIOUS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wowy-EdU4Eg Oh Arnold You so funny

MahBoi777: nice :D
RAWRity: Why jelly doughnut?
i wan't toys of MLP :[
Well I just heard the weilm scream on the show my mom was watching
Chrysalis: bc we're idgits
'nother funfact: I had originally planned to make the Meanwhile x Trixie fic much saucier, but then, whiel Wrek was drawing that Trixie night-club picture, he placed censor bars over it to make it seem dirtier than it was. This inspried me to do what you ended up reading.
Bronysith: apparently, I have the swag? lolwut.
^
well eveypony i am going to bed bye bye
Is the wheilm scream a running gag in the film industry or something?
Spade-Magnes: it's a popular sound effect
see ya
MEET THE PYRO IS OUT!!!
rainbowjack
WIIIIIIII
RAWRity: Humbug to you.
RAWRity: once again, inspired
legacyofvrak: dude, you're late on that
Meanwhile: you're the one who used it, you tell ME why you decideed to bring in a jelly donut.
FOR ONCE IT WASN'T ME!
RAWRity you also posted ALOT of taster segments in chat in the beginning
really ? my birthday is talk like a pirate day.. not sure if irony to this conversation
RAWRity: Har har har.
which didnt make it inot the final fic
Yeah... it was launched yesterday
Chrysalis: that was actually me making those up as I went along, in order to fluster Meanwhile
Aaaaawesome.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idr3A7E8xN0&feature=related
it worked oh so well
¬¬
I'm sure he has the saucy version saved in a private folder for his own personal use.
and thus Meanwhile remained flustered
but I was too busy to watch it.... I've been kicked-ass in my school :(
and the future refused to change
otakon: Implying I am capable of flusteredness.
/me changes the future
why can't it be pie day.. i like pie and i can't pull of a pirate voice
Meanwhile: you are, you just don't show it
Meh.
Morning guize :l
Meanwhile: nah. I'm actually kind of uncomfortable about writing romance or sex scenes in anything, let alone ones involving fictional representations of my friends.
Uhhuh, I totally believe you.
This is Meanwhile 24/7: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/69113e83-53e2-49cf-b19c-ead2c0a779ce.jpg

They grounded me because I was drinking in class... I didn't notice the break ring and they f***ed me up
Pfft.

nobody streaming
nothing is streaming
LegoBrony it is with the spoon
Meanwhile is Rarity?... Not sure.. what to think...
LegoBrony: it's off atm
Chrysalis: of course. I only troll my friends. If I didn't consider him a friend I'd have told him to fuck off and ignored him a long time ago.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvm8zW0toE&feature=related
Ninjazz: Don't think too hard about it darling.
ERROR 404.... STREAM NOT FOUND
Ninjazz: it fits but it's missing something

Word to the wise, if a troll shows up, the /ignore command is there for just such an occasion
Hdy
maybe he just acting out and is rlly denying who he rlly is
he was weak
Hey
ban hammer is very effective
Yeah true fact, treating a troll like a big deal or indeed, anything other than a blank space means you're feeding. And no one likes people who feed trolls.
Of coarse he was a troll his username was ihateponies. He was a troll A anti-brony a hater!
Or right... his mass spam of lowercase h's really rustled my jimmies.
LightNight: well then he can figure it out on his own.
Ponies47: Who cares.
maybe he is trying to reach out
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
00,03What's going on here...
how is spaming h even trolling
Ponies47: and that is why we ignored him
Scoot-Scootaloo: Shuffling.
Scoot-Scootaloo: horrible hater came and went
XAX well that is only good
Scoot-Scootaloo: u miss a troll
13The matter is dealt with.
Scoot-Scootaloo: also this http://postimage.org/image/ls0ia6w5b/
nobody asked him nicely to stop
Shizuka: thank you dear
Scoot-Scootaloo: random spam-troll showed up for a moment, then things returned to their usual bullshit.
Shizuka set him on fire already anyway.
What do you what to watch?:)
00,03I miss all the fun :(
:(
It was an easy kill, anyway.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Meh. You just missed a troll
wats fun?
otakon: BRILLIANT
13not sure if should stream or go back to bed
You know trolls actually helped us, because when one is made fun of by a trol, other bronies help to stop the troll. :)
Go back to bed Shizuka.
RAWRity: lol
Shizuka: What time is it?
Shizuka: if you're tired go to bed
133:16pm
00,03Nap time~

Same time zone... I'm not used to being in the States.

LightNight: she doesn't over sleep though
MDT for me.
pffft. Naps :|
LegoBrony no you did not, you just kept feeding that troll and that was mistake
otakon english time
alexxm: dammit man that's MILITARY time
otakon: that's a 24 hour clock nimrod.
LegoBrony: trick to dealing with trolls is to A: Ignore them or B: be nice to them and calm.
otakon you mean zulu time?
Meanwhile: I KNOW THAT, it's also MILITARY TIME
Scoot-Scootaloo: yay, we can be Romeos together!
otakon: How very redundant.
i.e. THE MILITARY USES IT
otakon: it has a colon in it. Military time generally omits the colon
Oh yeah... Right, this chat is making me learn more
otakon: That's even more redundant.
Meanwhile: okay, how is Military and Time redundant?
:(
yes militarry time, also known as zulu time
Meanwhile: EXPLAIN YOURSELF!
otakon: The military uses military time.
Dat Duckface: https://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/218432386503946241/photo/1
kempa: never heard it be called Zulu Time
any1 watchhing footbal?
otakon: That's redundant.
Meanwhile: and thus Military Time
now IF I said the MIlitary uses Military time
it would be redundant
but I said

Meanwhile: I KNOW THAT, it's also MILITARY TIME
i.e. THE MILITARY USES IT

Scoot-Scootaloo: if you get a chance, ask her what she thinks of the show
otakon: Are you implying that they might be unaware?
Meanwhile: no, but it's a damn rude thing to ask
00,03I SHOULd ask her to be in my MLG Clan!
otakon: Fine, ask her weight instead.
Meanwhile: you being British I would think you would know of manners...and I am mistaken -_-
Ask her if she's been tested.
does someone have a Steam Account?
otakon well basicaly, you have for any given time zone name of NATO alphabet
10hi
Scoot-Scootaloo: ask her if she'd be interested in watching a BMN on here.
otakon so GMT+1 is alpha GMT+2 is Bravo etc etc and GMT+0 (English time) is Zulu time
Brits learn snark humor THEN their famous manners.
Meanwhile: ._.
otakon and millitary time is ALLWAYS zulu time
okay wait hold on
Ask her if she waxes.
00,03Maybe...
when the hell did furries NOT be a fetish?

RAWRity: youtube comment I saw

Bronysith: furries.

Ask her if she knows the reverse nacho hoof pound.
otakon you can't complain about the convo because you bruoght it up
Ask her what the scouted says about his power level
ask her to come to BS
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yeah, but I don't want to rustle jimmies. that said I got nothing against furries
or in better words What makes her like MLP?

xles theres something on your face
I missed the season finale of the aquabats so I don't know if this is fake or not http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXc5BfWNQmw
Ask her if the price is right.

Ask her where the numbers station is
Ask her what the numbers mean.
Ask her if she wants to play a game.
ask her if she likes bananas?
00,03lol :D

00,03I'm monitering this chat~
Ask her if she is a god, then proceed to destroy her if she says no
Scoot-Scootaloo: Okie doki loki :)
Ask her if she ooh eee ooh ah ah ting tang walla walla bing bang
you know what would be fun to stream here....?
Whose Line Is It Anyway
Ask her whose line is it anyway
ask her who wants to be a millonaire
Scoot-Scootaloo: write down all of these questions and just give her the paper...
Or just keep going "Hi Tara..." in a slightly creepy voice
Ask her if she knows the muffin man.
ask her if she'll wrestle the undertaker at wrestlemania 29 Scoot-Scootaloo
http://mlfw.info/f/4989/ This is what I think when a parasprite see's a brony

Instead, we'll be announcing the people who will be featured in the ad, along with pictures. Sunday, 4PM, Studying the Herd panel on the tail stage.

goodninght kempa
Bye kempa

bye kempa
Gah this keyboard is so weird!
LightNight what qualifications do you have
bye kempa
I'm at a cousin's house...her husband has a gaming keyboard.
I wish someone would stream allready....
hai WindWhistler !
The keys are farther apart. It's hard to get used to. >_<
Allo WindWhistler.
'sup
hey WindWhistler hows your day ben
It's been busy.
WindWhistler is it the one where the middle of the board is split?
WindWhistler: don't die.
hai WindWhistler
Why is it the stream is always down when I'm here and up when I'm AFK? D:
Dken2021: Nope.
http://theadmin.co.uk/images/stories/1340916474-c8iFQ6.jpg
But it has these "G" keys...they're like F1 and stuff, only it's G1
:S
It goes up to 18
WindWhistler: Sounds helpful.
pony_9996 weekday streams aren't scheduled
And hi, btw.
This computer has TWO screens! It's awesome
Yawn.....
Finally got a good Pokemon White 2 english patch.
hey Ninjazz hows your day been
Time to stay up all night.
It's epic for multitasking
alexxm: i got a specialty high skills major in broadcasting and a scholarship for 80%+ overall grades
WindWhistler: my work computer has 2 screens, and there be pony...
DashWithRainbows care to tell me? I like to know too
Play a game on the big screen, do other stuff on the other screen.
I gotta find out how to do this.
WindWhistler aren't multi-screens great?
alexxm: Good. I only woke up a couple of hours ago.
13hey ponies, come help me take over Goon Haven's new TF2 server :3
Dken2021: I totally have to get one when I get home.
Shizuka: the what server?
hmmm, anyone know how to make the ding on hit sound quieter?
Would love to. If I had my damn computer. -__-
Shizuka: stuck at work...
LightNight what jobs should those quallifications give you access to
So bored.....
Oh crap, that's right! I gotta get Pyrovision on TF2 even though I never play it!
Dken2021 I can link you to a vid with the correct files needed and how to execute the process to do so. The patch goes by projectpokemon. They're doing amazing work for it and have got a lot done. Also, I had to extract the files using winrar
Do you want the link to the vid?
DWR_PokemonWhite2: Not a patient person huh
DWR_PokemonWhite2: dont worry you have till June 6th if you want vintage :P
sure, just pm me the link
Chrysalis: Lower the volume.
If I were at home, I'd totally ask for that link.
then i can't hear weapons
alexxm: i could do broadcasting and film but I would feel like a tool
Irish_Pony: Vintage?
Also, how come the Pokemon games are still coming out for the regular DS and not the 3DS?
Only one Pokemon game is on the 3DS.
WindWhistler: Ask gamefreak
Spade-Magnes[R] it comes out in October. Screw that. I want to be able to see what the story is. I'll buy the DS version since I can use it for wireless and transfer my other pokemon onto it.
Not including DS-ware
WindWhistler black and white 2 been in production before the 3ds came out
Well.... I'm going to play Team Fortress 2.... Goodbye everyone :P
seeya legacyofvrak
have fun :P
I want Genesect allready
Spade-Magnes[R]: thru now and until June 6th the goggles you were talking about, you will recieve Vintage goggles :P
bye legacyofvrak
WindWhistler: because 3DS adds nothing to the series, and they know it will sell better with DS carts (cuz DS carts still work on 3DS)
Dken2021: Wow, so they've basically been working on the first set of games at the same time as well?!
NullRadix: Except the quality for ds games on the 3ds is blurry
NullRadix: DS cards have poor quality on 3DS.
honestly i would like a job with fellow bronies ppl who could understand me but there is nobody around that is the same as me :(
and the change aspect feature sucks ass
The screen quality is terrible.
Good thing I still have my DSi
regardless, they have 3DS sales figures, in comparison to the number of DS machines out there
I have a Ds but its ready to die
and what's with the camera click noise whenever you take a picture?
Even with the volume off, I still hear it!
It is cracked beyond hell
It's especially annoying when I'm playing Rayman.
14Hi :D
I'm sure there's a solid money reason behind it
14I'm so sorry I've been missing :(
14how is everyone?
I have basically no use for a 3DS, seeing as the only thing I give a crap about is Pokemon B/W2, and those are both coming out on the DS.
isn't there a feaure in black white 2 that adjusts the screen for the 3ds?
And I'm back :P
The L button has issues, the top screen is scratched, the thing that holds the top screen has a massive hole in it
I have to cover the spots where the sound comes out so that I don't bother anyone.
I'm surprised My ds still works
Dken2021: I haven't heard anything about that
Spade-Magnes[R]: Huh, my R button has issues on my DSi
It really sucks since I play the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games
WindWhistler: You would be surprised how my ds still runs when it looks like crap
┐(￣ー￣)┌
The R button is crucial for that game
brb
NDS was a good investment.
allows you to move diagonal without wasting any turns
WindWhistler: You know the plastic part that moves with the top screen?
14o.o
Spade-Magnes[R]: Uhhh...?
Spade-Magnes[R] your hinge broke?
Near the power light
The ability to hold in place is gone
That reminds me...the top part of my DS is starting to be able to move slightly...
theres a chunk missing and I can see the white plastic inside
Which concerns me
And it still fucking works
It's only VERY slightly, but it's still worrysome
Geez, I love this computer!
Spade-Magnes[R]: I have that problem! I can dislodge the upper half of the DS from the lower half on one side :)
Just don't cut the wires.
Should I be concerned if one side of my 3ds moves when the other side doesnt?
Spade-Magnes[R] is your screen's video messed up?
i just watch the new .mov it was really disturbing:O
Dken2021: no its just one side feels loose... I may just be paranoid
should I be concerned when no matter how hard I try, there's still air bubbles on my screen protector?
14people won't stop making noises outside :(
the right side doesnt move but I can move the left side a little bit
yes
Spade-Magnes[R]: It's the opposite side for my DSi
Also is it normal for the 3ds screen to wobble a bit?
It still locks into place
why am i so depressed
The parts that hold the bottom screen in aren't airtight...
just go away!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wwj0tuvoi0
I can see light coming in from the outer border of the screen.
I mean light coming out from
Not in
can u find the light in the night?
LightNight: Who the heck are you anyways?
So is it normal for the 3ds screen to wobble a bit?
I dont see any cracks on the 3ds frame so the integretiy seems intact
30 minutes of work remaining...
WindWhistler: wat do u mean?
LightNight: pardon me, I'm only half here. Your condition was recently graduated and having trouble finding employment?
!silence
ill do this in my hands
Am I just being paranoid?
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!!"
Oh hi Phase4
oh look
Phase4: ?
Oh. More Kerbal Genocide.
Kerbals
must be Sumica
Yaaaaaay
Oh.
Woot!
Sumica or Phase4.
oops
otakon: Phase4 streams them more then sumica
Kerbal time! :)
WOOPWOOPWOOPWOOPWOOP
Phase4 also has this game
I'm sure they'll point out which one.
it's Sumica
what is even the point of this game?
Dayum
Meanwhile: yay
xmasskills: to have fun
I thought Shizuka said she was gonna stream?
The Kerbal people will rise up and cast off their oppressive space hungry leaders!
ya!
WindWhistler: Do you think I'm being overly paranoid with my 3ds?
User0: so there is no point
xmasskills: get to the moon, and blow up shit
Spade-Magnes[R]: Eh, I'm equally as paranoid about anything else in life.
otakon: oh i see
make expensive fireworks, screw around, kill stuff...
Kill your volunteer pilots...
NullRadix: i don't know wat to do i want to work with fellow bronies to be honest since i can't find fun in any job
WindWhistler: The frame is perfectly intact so its not hull damage....
14o.o
for some dumb reason i can't explain i am unhappy
LightNight: Watch ponies.
Spade-Magnes[R]: I'm not an expert on technology.
sweet, I have 14 errors in my code!
I have a half hour before I'm out of here...
WindWhistler: All I know is the left side seems a little loose
User0: What do you do for work?
More jets, wooooo!
Spade-Magnes[R]: I said I'm not an expert on technology.
WindWhistler: I can't say... but I write code
I would like to hear you
We can barely hear you
Inb4 this thing goes up like a firework.
Sumica: I can hear ya
yes we get to watch small creatures scream in terror
LightNight: to throw a possibility, you finished a "life goal" without a clear idea of "what next". You have no idea where you're going, nothing you're working towards... perhaps?
User0: I'm calling it right now. You work for some top secret organization.
Sometimes I think I'm going insane
Or for one of the big three companies.
Meanwhile: goes up? nah, it will slide across the runway and explode
User0: Close enough.jpg
WindWhistler: not at all, it is just a small company...
Did somepony say INSANE?!? *Eye twitchs*
Build a arwing
Sumica: I can hear ya fine
Build life.
Dig a moat!
I can hear you just fine Sumica
My Ds seems to have a audio glitch
NullRadix: that pretty much sums it up I joined the briony community because I seen something in mlp that Ienjoyed
it makes an odd sound when sone sharp or loud noises play
more fuel, more firework!
You can NEVER have enought fuel!
Build the Maltese Falcon.
NEVAR! :[
Build Rosebud.
just slap random crap on it for better explosions!
SPOILER: Rosebud was his sled.
/me pokes Angel_Umbreon
Why is the 3ds ds quality so shit?
what is this game about?
Hi
brony: Blowing shit up :D
brony: It's about killing your astronauts
LightNight: really, the best I can suggest is a) Keep looking for a job. You're unemployed, finding employment *is your job*, and you don't get much for breaks. But you need to sustain yourself
brony have fun
yay
brony making small creatures in terror as you launch deathtraps into space
00,03A streamer talking to his viewers? DA FUX?!? :O
Does anyone here actually know about the change aspect ratio on the 3ds?
Scoot-Scootaloo: I know, right?
thanks
Scoot-Scootaloo: ikr?
Scoot-Scootaloo: That's as unheard of as internet celebreties talking to their fans.
hi viri
14hi :3
i kind of want to go to that bronycon i have been hearing about
Who wants to bet this will go up in a ball of fire?
Sumica paint it orange
Paint it all black
me to
00,03Sumica is a Rocket Man!
Spade-Magnes[R]: will it make it off the ground, who knows?
I see a red door and I want to paint it black...
00,03Rocket Man! Burning up the sky!
Sumica shall now be nicknamed Fruitloop.
00,03And I forget the rest...
Scoot-Scootaloo: *'sploding up in the sky
So how many of you guys know about the change aspect ratio trick on the 3ds?
/me 's head a splodes
LightNight: b) perhaps step back and reevaluate. Why did you go to school, what did you want to do, and do you still want to do it? If so, how do you get there? Getting a related job can be nice, but keeping hobbies separate from work is a good way to make sure you continue to enjoy them, instead of having them become only work
Spade-Magnes[R]: Look it up on Google or something.
I know about it I was asking if anyone else did
It's much easier just to look it up on Google.
When I think aspect ratio I expected better quality not a tiny ass screen
Sumi can you make a Propeller rocket? :D
Nintendo what the fuck were you thinking
FOR SCIENCE!
lol
Okay, now I'm getting annoyed.
This'll end well
:|
Launch it anyway!
this will be goof
Keep your seatbelts on and get ready for awesome!
it looks like a fish
It looks like spilt milk.
00,03The middle is one is all like "AH EMM GEE"
Not enough thrust.
Boom
Oh dear
Lift derp
kill them all
sea ponies
NullRadix: I can't think of anything to do that I can define as fun
I told you that it wasn't going to make it off the ground before the 'splosion!
KA BOOM
MY WINGS!
Drowned
so...they died by touching water?
they're so happy about this
WindWhistler: they're soluble.
its still there
water is the new lava
Meanwhile: Why do they live on a planet with water then?
Have you guys ever tried to mess with water?
NullRadix: My hobby (the thing i spend all my time doing) is playing games and I could barely say it is funny since i only do it to pass time :(
Meanwhile: didn't I totally call that?
WindWhistler: Rainbows.
DON'T mess with water. EVER!
I wish I could buy a new 3ds
User0: You totally called that.
Or it will kill you!
But my mom wont let me
Huh, there's a screen on this keyboard...it says [AFK:1]
It solves everything
/me messes with water
I am too confused to define why I am depressed but I am *shrugs*
/me shanks WindWhistler.
/me is getting tired of these people complaining.
:D
WindWhistler: Doesnt that mean you're complaining too?
Welp
Complainception
Spade-Magnes[R] ignore her
Spade-Magnes[R]: Yo dawg...
what.....
Boom
Splode!
Wtf :O
Meanwhile: do we want to make another bet?
WindWhistler: i will stop if its bugging you :/
These peoples try to phase me.
User0: Naw.
LightNight: if nothing else, do you exercise? I find stepping away from the computer, putting on some music, and just running can be highly therapeutic. "Better shape" is a good goal in itself. Music and exercise tends to block out just about everything else for the duration. Oh, and sometimes the best way to solve a problem is by stepping away from it entirely
Well, my head a splode.
COFFEE
did they all die
I cant wait for the new paper mario
alexxm: they lived
Spade-Magnes[R]: I don't think anyone can.

And then the engins die

How is it holding on?! :O

frontflip and say "backflip" in a pewdiepie voice
Apply thrust, achieve liftoff.
Lol the middle passenger is not giving a single fuck
Giggity.
why are the other 2 so scared
alexxm: They're cowards
lol i was just playing this
We need to make a arwing
alexxm: Pussies
By the way, has anyone seen Brave yet?
"These are the principles of flight. We ignore all of those and just put enough power behind everything that it flies anyway"
NullRadix: i usually exercise at night since I don't want to feel like a person seeking attention
Fly into the sun!
Hi celestia
I did =D
WindWhistler: and die like a boss
i haven't WindWhistler is it good
go to the moon :(
Fly around the planet really fast to turnback time
Sumica: I would buy it but very old laptop
I bought it the second time i saw it here
Hi everypony

alexxm: It's REALLY good.
The flock shall ascend to the great beyond!
I have no money!
So I cant buy shit...

Where is Fox when you need him?
;p;
Far worse things in the world, but I'm still bummed :(
LightNight: well at the end of the day, all I can do is throw suggestions. Its up to you to find something to apply yourself to. If you can figure out something you'd like to work on, there's probably someone that could point you to a brony team doing something
The middle one has abandoned sanity.
WindWhistler the middle one has always fun :D
dat music
Spy Fox to Global Command Center.
Oh man, I loved Spy Fox.

Other than blow shit up
IT WILL FLOAT
Michael make small creatures scream in terror as you shot death traps into space
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
LightNight: well there are several summer animation projects, and most projects need some form of music. I doubt you can find a "paying" job in the brony community, so you still have that to work on...
apple: Welcome welcome welcome! A fine welcome to you!
Noooo stream lost.

WindWhistler that is the best sacriface
Sumica: not enought ducttape
Add duct tape to the front sections
Sumica: don't forget the wings
Moar duct tape
Needs moar ponys
Spade-Magnes[R] that one not
5 minutes of work left, 14 errors remain... darn...
need moar fuel
Sumica needs to make a TIE fighter
User0: You're gonna get a GAME OVER
Most likely the weight of the rockets without proper support caused them to rip off.
Duct all the tape
needs more duck tape
yay~
QUAK
User0: move the code to a coworker's machine and commit it so they're forced to fix it
Duct tape solves everything
Fail
Wtf
Welp
It's a plane?
lol
They lived!
KA-BOOOOOOOOOM
BTW, pony at work "pics or it didn't happen" picture: http://imgur.com/GMXAI
It fell apart even faster
I thought it was a shuttle xD
Can it even move like that?
how did that even happen
i guess duct tape doesn't work
alexxm: Science thats how
try removing all the support?
An Arwing needs to be made
Add tape to the bottom of the sections too
Do wheel of deth!!!
^
that sounds sexy!
14 errors, 5 minutes... one option - finish my mac and cheese!
Oh wow :O
Sumica can you do a Tie-Fighter? :D
Try removing EVERYTHING
Make it just have thrusters
THat allways works
Try sticking a jet to the cockpit and see what happens
GOOGOGOGO
make a giant pegasus rocket
inb4 it isnt
Meanwhile: Can you even do that?
Uh oh
WindWhistler: Idk.
oh lord...
Inb4 exploision
So how come one goes off the runway and one doesn't?
bombing run?
KA BOOM
That thing is so boned.
TURN IT ON TURN IT ON!
:D
Splode.

Epic magical rocket ride to DEATH!
DERP
R.I.P creatures
Nice music xD
Michael they died for a good cause

How hard would it be to create a Arwing?
Play O Fortuna
or Requiem for a Dream

o.o
Dat thrust

Waggle waggle thrust!

00,03I whip my tail back and forth~
orbit the sun
TO THE SUN
You should do a moon landing
whos streaming? i dont recognise the voice?
Fly into it and die like a boss
/me does something so awesome it distracts everyone from what they're doing.
Chrysalis sumica
Visit Celestia
do a moon landing =D
*cues a spaces odyssey theme*
To the MOON!
Luna > Celestia
^
But it failed!
/me kept going and crashed!
Chrysalis is best pony
CANNONBALL!
Howdy, you wonderful people. Gerbil space program I see. :P
overcompensating much there
chrysalis isn't a pony
<.<
AgentKalim: Kerbal*
Chrysalis isn't technically a pony
Chrysalis is a pony... sometimes...
this song is sad :(
AgentKalim: I see no gerbils here :|
MegaMoonShine: That was on purpose :P
chrysalis is a changelling
Play mind hiest
damnit
Lolwut...
She can be any pony therefore she is best pony
So why does Chrysalis still use "everypony" if she and her Changelings aren't ponies?
hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
What song is this?
What does Chrysalis use when she's talking to her changelings?
14 errors, time's up, and I didn't finish my mac and cheese, I really failed, didn't I
But she's not genetically a pony.
Everychangeling?
Can anypony tell me what this is?
to the moooonnnnn NAO
everyling?
WindWhistler: Why the hell do they use it anyway? Everyone and everybody would still work
dinky: Sure I can. It's half past BAAAAAAAAAAAH
dinky its Kerbal Space PRogram
I mean the song
=P
Changelings don't speak english as their native language. They hiss.
dinky: Super ponybeat version of You gotta ahsre, you gotta care
Oh, I thought you asked what time it was.
share*
well yea, but htere is a thousand remixes
/me dies
I dont see why you cant use everyone and everybody i mean it would still work
/me revives WindWhistler
yay orbit
/me brushes WindWhistler into a skip.
Over nine thousand remixes.
Spade-Magnes[R]: One and Body aren't in their vocabulary.
Oh my...
It may be due to Changelings being so similar to ponies in structure that the word "everypony" has become common use for Changelings over the course of time.
Dat irregular orbit
:D
I'm out of here, I'm going home
I think she used everypony because she was talking about how other ponys would react to her, not other changlings
Kammerjunk: That doesn't explain Iron Will though. He's a minotaur!
=o
User0: drive safe
WindWhistler: What does Iron Will say?
Morning all :D
User0: see ya
Bye User0 :)
Kammerjunk: He still uses anypony, somepony, or everypony
What are you even trying to do?
hai APS
o.o
WindWhistler: When he's talking about the ponies, yes.
Hello, APS
Hi APS
Don't worry guys, I won't let Sumica fly me back home - I'll be just fine
Uh...
Again like it was pointed out in Magic.mov Everybody anybody and everyone would still work
lol
yay
O.o
can-can fluttershy
omg
gotta love can can remixes
Yyyyyyyyyyyep
Interesting... o.o
see, this is what kerbils listen to when they go to space
Is that the Death Star in the background?
Twilight even says everyone a few times when Spike's in the equation.
theyre not screaming in fear
Michael: Cancanshy
...yeah
they are shouting in appreciation
there is a rlly cool zelda one i saw
How many cans would can-can can, if can-can could can cans?
Meanwhile: Quick! Run away before it dances on your head!
Kammerjunk: So yea...

AgentKalim: wHAT?
Sumica can you attemt a moon landing?
FOrmah
yay
AgentKalim: What are you talking about?
dat orbit
I used to like Celestia but I lost all respect for her after the Wedding Episode. Luna is now my favorite princess, aside from Chrysalis
should i tell my sister im a brony :/
LightNight: Yes.
Are you referring to that dumb question, or me listing the songs inserted into that can-can?
derp chat
Hell yea light
You will probably not regret it.
How old is she?
oh god
u guys jinxed it
now i cant tell her :P
Hey, I said 'probably'.
my sister became a brony with me
Well.. shes not really a brony
okay, so everyone was said 19 times and everypony was said 170 times in total by transcripts
But SHe watched it with me the first time and enjoyed it
my sister is 19 im 18
Fuck yea tell her
WAIT
how hte hell do you land without wheels
Everynyan was said 0 times
She's family, she has to accept you.
o.o
i tried to show her the show once and she kind of teased me so i came up with a back story
Oh
Pixar's gonna be busy...
Nopony was said 15 times, noone said by nopony
They
Meals on wheels
They're working on two new movies
Why do you still have the fuell tank on though?
saying i just showed her it so she could see the creepypasta associated with it
someone 26 somepony 81
Oh wow this commenton youtube makes me so mad
Monsters Inc. prequel, and Mash-it-up Ralph
*comment
HOW in the world did Pixar get Bowser to appear in that movie?!
Confound my computer with it's derps! :[
WindWhistler: I'm exceited for the latter.
WindWhistler: They did it with dosh.
post it, i am a exelent countertroll
THey got familiar video game villains. BUT HOW?!
nope
Wait, there's gonna be Boozah in that movie?
not yet
I wonder if Bowser talks at all...
If you would land on the moon!
Clyde does...
Unless your a dad and watch it with your son or daughter i see no reason whatsoever to watch all episodes and to even call yourself a brony. Is part of this infuriating comment
WindWhistler: he doesn't
otakon: I thought so.
WindWhistler: however, Zangief has a speaking role
Spade-Magnes[R]: Some people... :|
Spade-Magnes[R]: Dat ignoramus.
DROP THE PIANIO
heres the convo that i am having :P
Sumica: hows ur bakery job going?
Ignoramuses gonna ignoramus.
Gnight everypony i'll go bed
otakon: Who's Zangief?
If you like my little pony and you are a grown man it's simple you're pathetic. He also says this
nighty Michael
Night Michael
Goodnight, Michael
Clyde from Pac-Man has a speaking role too.
WindWhistler: -___- Zangief... THE RED CYCLONE!
Sumica: 0_o dats good? i think?
if your a dad and you watch it with your daughter your not a brony
otakon: Uhh...I'm not familiar with that guy.
Zangief, you know, from Street Fighter
Wait you decided ot do a moon landing right in the middle?
Fail
xD
/me doesn't play Street Fighter
omg dinky is here
Oh no not out of fuel
WindWhistler: ....-___- STREET FIGHTER GODDAMMIT!
[5:36:14 PM] Z J C: :)[5:39:13 PM] Z J C: so i heard u gunna watch all of mlp[5:39:43 PM] S C: What's mop[5:39:50 PM] S C: Ought[5:39:50 PM] Z J C: my little pony XD[5:40:00 PM] S C: Lol oh ya
CRASH INTO THE TANK
I don't play Street Fighter.
And yes i am =D
Crash into the mooooooon
Fly me to the moon~
):
He also says MLP is like internet memes, they arent funny, arent clever, and you see them everywhere
But still, I'm curious as to how they got such famous video game characters...
And let me play among the stars
drop the pianio
who cares if that giant fueltank is goint to crush into a town
Sadface
Spade-Magnes[R]: >MLP
>they
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
o.o
In other words
please be truuuuuuuuuuuuu
Sumica: besides brony music what music do u listen to?
lol it looked better faced that way
HAHHAHAHA
Dat Frank Sinatra.
Save the gerbils
have fun with that
Wubstep
Sumica: DUbstep?
Twostep
Oh wow.... ignorant much? Because MLP is aimed at 5 year﻿ old girls. There is a difference between liking something aimed at another demographic and being a grown man liking something aimed at infant females.
Gnn>
I am rlly tempted to link my sister this website :P
Just like, you know, any other musical genre.
who are you talking to spade?
Spade-Magnes[R]: And G4 isn't even specifically aimed at little girls, according to Lauren Faust.
It shows.
A freaking yotube argument on a total biscuit video
Give me a link
i love MLP because it shows the true meaning of friendship which is something dat is really lacking in todays society
Spade-Magnes[R]: Arguing? On TB? I am not surprised.
Who's arguing about MLP on a Totalbiscuit video? :P
The true meaning of frendship
is
"LOOK OUT, HERE COMES TOM!"
One guy says this I seriously don't understand bronies... Watching Pink ponies called﻿ "rainbow" or whatever the fuck talk about friendship is probably the most retarded thing I've ever heard of. I haven't exactly come in from branding cattle, but I can say that that's sickeningly feminine.
AgentKalim: You know what they say. If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose if it's jug band music or rhythm and blues.
Hue hue hue
GIVE A LINK t.t
And yet no one gives a shit when girls watch stuff for boys
That's equal rights in a nutshell.
I don't need to see a link to know that person's obviously a tard. :P
Yar
is that good
let's hope there are not much mountains or hills
You want a link to the video so you can see the argument?
Honestly i agree with most brony arguments, because i felt the same way beforehand
Kammerjunk: That's not equal rights that's so-called "positive discrimination". Except it's bullshit.
I love countertrolling
k guys I am going to try and cheer up and play some LEague of Legends with some of my school buddies if you want to add me on skype or lol I am SirVown :)
so much
so glad i told my sister
AgentKalim: That's my point.
Yyyyyyyyyyyep
Girls watch stuff for boys, no one cares
she wants to watch some episdoes with em :P
Men watch My little ponies, Oh god its so wrong
Noone gives a flying feather
might have a new sis poony
Spade-Magnes[R]: I know, right?
this reminds me of a fairly oddparents episode where Timmy becomes a girl
well i don't think a girl watching a show made for young boys would be good... But it's still true
Into the gala, with Magneto
bye :P
kidzrul434: I remember that episode.
bye LightNight
dinky: Why not?
lol kidz i saw that
Operative word being "try"
AgentKalim: Oh god i remember that :D
I know. :P
Honestly i'm just viewing it from there perspective
inb4 the shuttle crashes and gerbils die
^
^^
and before i was a brony i found it odd... Yet awesome
dinky: are you new? :o
I'm just messing wit ya
Like i had nothing wrong with it, i just found it odd
AgentKalim: At the gala, all the royals, they will meet fair Rarity! And we'll all go and be a bad guy called Magneto1
!*
SOunds like something from Star Fox
goddammitshiftkey
suddenly an Everlasting_Joy.
:D
lol
Kinda rave, I joined the herd EXACTLY a week before the fanilie
One guy says he wants to start a flame war with smelly bronies... the fuck?
Parachutes in space!
Sumica: HOW do you keep doing this?
i never really felt anything about bronies before i became i just thought whatever makes them happy
Or however you spell it
dinky: Oh very nice! :) Glad to have you here!
an Everlasting_Joy? :) DWR_PokemonWhite2, oh you :).
Spade-Magnes[R]: what? the hell?
however i've seen a lot of a bunch of stuff =p
Sumica: CHANGE YOUR SETTINS THEN!
Yayayayya
why the hell not
otakon: A guy named NarutoDipshit said this You're right i am a retard that wants to start a flame war with smelly bronies but then again﻿ you are a retard too for trying to start shit with me. But now i know you dislike MLP too which makes me feel good for some reason.
X-Men! Welcome to DIE!
well... duh
Spade-Magnes[R]: ....god that just makes me sad
Wait, literally called NarutoDipshit? :P
okay, I'll be back
gonna shower
AgentKalim: Yea
Im not kidding
I mean i understand ther POV
Spade-Magnes[R] why
Wow that's kowai (not kawaii)
AgentKalim: nobody knows that means scary
AgentKalim: Scary?
Spade-Magnes[R]: Smart name... :$
LOL
oops
Kammerjunk: yes
Wait can you stall if you have a paischute?
I don't caaaaaaare
I just felt like saying it
I don't even speak japanese
DeenChooch says this when someone over﻿ the age of 18 still enjoys cartoons made for little children, and also takes them seriously, well then I think he or she is a bit of a sad person.
...then you are pointing downwards?
Japanese has three different alphabets - True or false?
True
true?
Alrighty then.
Spade-Magnes[R]: That's just silly thinking.
True
hiragana, katakana, kanji
^
ah
^^^
Spade-Magnes[R] where are you getting these quotes
I see.
I have two real japanophiles in mah class, so I know a LITTLE about it.
If you want me to stop posting stuff from this argument just tell me
And arn't you supposed to land it like a plane and then deploy the chute? At least wasn't it like it IRL
oh right, it's for foreign words
alexxm: a retarded youtube argument on a total biscuit video
Who is this? Super pony Beat? Didn't he release another album recently?
thanks Spade-Magnes[R]
Ohman jewtube arguments, that'sprettygreat
Its on the video called WTF is Snuggletruck

Whoa

Yay
TB made ONE comment and people got pissed off
Your head gonna explod
Lol use the thursters
BOOM
IT WILL BURN THE PARICHUTE!!
Spade-Magnes[R]: Damnant quod non intellegunt.
ouch
to late
xD
:D
I told you bro
XD
Spade-Magnes[R] how did ponies get involved?
The only time Winter Wrap Up was good was when Neil sang it on stream.
I warned you about gerbils exploding.
Spade-Magnes[R]: What'd TB say, anyway?
I TOLD YOU MAN. I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE MOON
aeiou?
Exactly
Big aeiou, lots of uuuuuuuuuuu
Wet water. Pft. Such a fad.

Something along the lines

Check it out, it's a space choppa
Well isn't hat just the cutest ship ever.

LETS GO AGAIN. LETS GO AGAIN.
Good plan
Chat derp back
Kammerjunk: then he mentioned carebears

Personally i found his quip about my little pony hilarious
Spade-Magnes[R]: They judge that which they do not understand.
Stabilize the stabilizers, stabilizers stabilized
03not that I'd mind living in Florida half the year, I think my mom's more nervous than I am XD
Oh gog wwhat

WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!
Kammerjunk: Do you think Tb actually ment what he said?
The pilots were so happy before they died.
Give ALL the thrust
Sumica: ALL of the thrust is required or you explode into a shitzillion pieces
i dont have the full version though
hey Bronysith hows your day been
Spade-Magnes[R]: Not really. TB seems like mostly reasonable guy. The problem is that when he has an opinion, he takes it to the extreme.
ALL THE THRUST
)=
alexxm: good. you?
This looks like something out of starfox
The name is a lie
So many g's
Bronysith good saw a friend of mine whos a brony today

Celestia as my witness, I will never miss BronyCon AGAIN!
uh oh
Barbetos: they arent?! WHAAAAAAAAAAT
seriously though. Why did Sumica make a Dreidel rocket? are the astronauts jewish?
It slices, it dices, it's a space ship!
Alsmitthy of the Haat crew is a pyromaniac
I always forget what they're called, but the little men there are strangely OK with this.
Sixteen bajillion thursters
thrusters
Okay, never mind.
AgentKalim: ....needs more thrusters
F = Mα/r^2
FASTERRRR
Needs ALL the thrusters

I dare you to make thatland on the moon...
Does anyone watch Brainscratch?
IF you do that, you wn.
This is the drill which will hover in the heavens
You know what you needed here?
More fire.
It needs to be about 20% cooler
You want to be the drill that pierces the Moon? Add moar thrusters. And fuel.
Get more fuel hax
Rocket rule nr1: it needs more thrusters. no exception.
add lasers
So anyone here watch Brainscratch Comms?

AgentKalim no. i thought of things like filling a pool with bacon

03apparently the bezels are universal size
03so you can just pop one off and put one on'
Sumica maybe you could add a second propeller for the 1st stage thrusters?
Rainfall_Night there is a free version of this game
Just add more thrusters.

Add ALL the thrusters, in fact. Trust me, I'm an expert. :P

Add MORE wings
wow
so i heard you like wings
no kerbals were hurt in the playing of this game - however, many were just outright killed...
BroKnee: Ah thats pretty simple
So he makes it worse...
lol...
So about dem wings.
User0: lol
Sumica snapped
killerpony7733: No cutie mark tho :3
Oh my god...

Pretty good, but could be better
03that little Pikachu charm
Yeah told you, about dem wings.
yay
03he's getting me like 15 of them :P
More wings!
engine in the back
reduce the number of wings and engines by half
Sumica: your doing it wrong, you need to add a rocket on the frony of the ship
Sumica, needs longer wings
Starfox would be dissapoint
connect the wings
Sumica to see what happens
Sumica: Needs more cowbell.
BroKnee: I got a cutiemark but many get confused about it since it's NOT my special talent
starfox is facepalming right now
Sumica just needs more duct tape - triangles are the strongest!
8,6all the speed
okay wtf
put one of those solid rocket things on the underside of the middle bit
WIPE OUT
Reduce the number of wings and engines by double
:I
XD
killerpony7733: How dat make sence?
Nice.

kirzstryfe: how are you ?
You lost ANOTHER LIFE
8,6he's dead Jim
^
poor poor kerbels
It's worse than that he's dead Kirz.
Make a proper Arwing!
BroKnee: It's more of a symbol of myself who i am actually
kirzstryfe: Do you agree with me when I say, "Needs more cowbell"?
YES!
cause ductape solves ALL PROBLEMS!
DUCK TTAPPE
killed in action? they never got off ground
Duct tape is probably not the answer here.
killerpony7733: Ohhhh
THIS IS SURE TO WORK
8,6GW2 comes out August 28, so happy ^_^
Sumica you FINALLY listen!
It's a cluster of wibbly wobbly dingy wingy stuff.
killerpony7733: Dat makes more sence ^-^
8,6everything needs more cowbell
ductape the anser to all problems
if you cant fix it with duct tape .. you aint usin enough duct tape
Btw, I found ou ti'm going to canterlot gardens everypony
Inb4 mid wing break
derpy: sorry for snapping, just had a long day, very happy i have tomorrow off though
BroKnee: Well once you know what it symbols and what not yes :P
nailed it!
if you try to use ductape your gonna have a bad time
they live
Captian Falcon is dissapoint
and it promptly disintegrates
derpy i love you
Engineering 101: if it moves and it shouldn't use duct tape. If it doesn't move and it should use WD-40
Remove 4 engines and wings
killerpony7733: :p I'm to spazy to "understand"
derpy: Lucky bastard :(
If it moves and it isn't supposed to, duct tape... If it doesn't move and it is supposed to, WD40... If it just blatently fails, C4 (or Sumica apparently...)
The game was programmed by Discord. It doesn't like symmetry and predictable physics simulations.
derpy_hooves It's fine, i would haev hoped you would have understood that i was kidding
killerpony7733: Understanding is for the weak
did anyone come up with a cure to ADHD yet?
BroKnee: Hah you got a name for your OC?
Or at least i am 99% sure i am
8,6Sumica, your challenge: get to orbit with duct tape as the main thing holding it together
STOP YAYING he;s failing!
strut the undersides of the first set of wings
User0 when in doubt, C4
facepalm
XD
killerpony7733: Nah, never named im
...
hahah!
IMissOsamaBrony: yes ponys
Boom!
So Fluttershy yays at spaceship explaosions?
and it disintegrated
lakingsfans ok thats true
Lunar_Brony: When in doubt, when not in doubt, or in doubt whether to be in doubt or not, C4
Anyone hear of a game called Quantum Conundrum?
Clearly
Remove 4 wings and engines and use a normal plane like design
User0 seems legit
strip the wheels!
i need help errypony
Boom
:O
:D
Didnt even move
pfft.
They live!
BroKnee: Hehehe my OC's name is Facade a nicely related placed name for the cutiemark
Now it just blew up :P
It just fell over
HAHAha
lunac1 but that's so BOOORING!
It;s succesful
killerpony7733: Whats the mark?
8,6you need a single cone with an engine attached, the longer the fuselage the more powerful
more duct tape!
Sumi: SUCCESS!
can you guys come up with color scemes for my OC pony named Sly Tag
brb
HE REALIZED DRINKS ALL AROUND!!
BroKnee: Blank mask splintered several places
Lunar_Brony so is seeing it continously explode
WOAH
killerpony7733: Spooky O.o
I made a OC but I doubt it looks interesting
IMissOsamaBrony: Dark colours with streaks of a whier color
You need to stick a rocket to the cockpit and fix a wheel on.
I don't see any crossbracing, I don't see triangle EVERYWHERE? what did you learn when building balsa bridges, gosh....
Now if I could only draw....
HE REALIZED DRINKS ALL AROUND!!
BroKnee: Less spooky more tragic ish
this seems more fitting than "Lunar_Brony" at the moment
oh uh
"This'll work" Famous last words.
killerpony7733: Seems spooky the way I imagine it
XD
Vordox can you take a look ponysquare.com/SlyTag
See?

They lived. That's the worst failure of all sumica
lol...
THIS'LL WORK

BroKnee: Honestly it isn't even meant to be spooky
ʸᵃʸ﻿

Ooky spooky
Look, if they dont live, they cant testify. Nuf said.
MOR PONIES
IMissOsamaBrony: A male pony with the "fake" cheery persona?
Totally.
Yeah
boom
Looks stable to me!
^
Totally stable indeed...
"Totally stable" my flank
killerpony7733: Idk if I'm the only one to say it seems spooky or if thats just my imagination being overactive again since I read Cheerlie's Garden
xD
you got farther that time sumica
Yep, totally stable.
IMissOsamaBrony: Simple design as well, perhaps add something that makes him or her, special.
add wheels at the end of the wings
It WAS totally stable, it's just the earth moved at the wrong moment.
Sumica, that center of gravity was TOO DAMN HIGH
XD
ʸᵃʸ﻿ ﻿
Vordox dafaq you talkin bout? its a female pony
IMissOsamaBrony: As for colours, not sure. :P

Vordox: Seems like my OC

Is that supposed to be a shuttle, or a stealth bomber?
IMissOsamaBrony: I've seen females that looks male and males look like female. :P
Does anyone want to see robot master sprite work I did?
Who hasn't
IMissOsamaBrony: But even if it's still a her, you kinda need something...special.
Vordox: But have you ever seen a what to where who has?
Not just the cutie mark
Yay
oh Celestia of Equestria save this poor man's soul
Spade-Magnes[R]: sure
Spade-Magnes[R]: Sure

Vordox sorry i added a bandana over her face soo that kinda sets her apart and her cutie mark is a spraypaint can

ʸᵃʸ﻿
Oh my god JC a bomb
^This
. . . it's working . . ?
TO MUCH WINGS
IMissOsamaBrony: Simple accessory can be big change or small change, a bandana makes her look rather suspicious, or sly. :P

15 POINTS!
Do a Barrel Roll!
IMissOsamaBrony: She has simple design, try to expand it with colours. ^^ And then see how it looks.

IMissOsamaBrony: If you're going for sly, perhaps use associating colours

Vordox such as....

IMissOsamaBrony: As mentioened before, either use your favourite colours or your favourite colours, and then use Darker mostly and with some whiter colours
how in the unholy name of *yay* did that happen
IMissOsamaBrony: What's your favourite colours?

Canadian_Brony: I have NO idea!

03wow, it seems like my parents are more against me taking a job down in Florida than I am
Symetry isn't on sumica
Vordox dark blue but i dont want her associated with the video game charicture
Do I hear EVE music?
03I'm kinda excited about it, but they keep trying to convince me to call Beaumont back and ask why they no longer want to hire me >_>
Interresting music :I what is it?
dat yaya
IMissOsamaBrony: Ah true, Sly 1-2-3.
ʸᵃʸ﻿
...Man, that is one big Motherbuckin spaceship
IMissOsamaBrony: But...You can use light blue for streaks or as smaller details.
IMissOsamaBrony: What's your other favourite colour?
6could that possibly have anything to do with expenses
03nope

Deadlypon3 wait, what DVDs did you get?
Heheh Pewdiepie bronies :)
Sumica: Is that just the program that ignores them after 20km?
Well I guess no one is interested in the sprites I was posting
I love how the little kerbals are just screaming their little heads off
That is some terrible yaw problems...
I'm not big on megaman anymore
now pitch and yaw
Needs more horror movies on movie night.
I lost interest after Mega Man 4
Animatriz wasent that good
Deadlypon3 you have the Matrix trilogy. I'm jealous
Jelly for my matrix :P
Shoo be Doo anypony?
your falling sumica just warning
Sumica, use gyro stabalizers
Prepare for explosions, everypony!
I tend to get sad when I make stuff and post stuff I never get any feed back
HAI, WAI TO THE. DANGERZONE!
Fun fact Phase did this before and landed
This game needs cities to crash into to.
Deadlypon3 lol
I guess there's no physic for rockets burning up in the atmosphere if they come in at a steep angle, is there?
Art of the dress :) yay!
Needs more Evil Dead on movie night
Its not that. Just that Megaman isn't part of my interest here.
when in doubt scream for dear life
YAYA
I'm now watching Seven :P
Its like making a sprite for some obscure anime series I know nothing about
When in doubt, you're probably boned.
Gonna watch them all :O
AgentKalim they did show it once. I came in at the tree rape scene . . . eeeesh . . .
lakingsfans: would you not be screaming for your life? How many of your friends have already died at the hooves of Sumica...
I mean people said yes when I asked if anyone wanted to see the sprites I made and then no one says anything
everyone pm me some kool backgrounds for my desktop
mlp style :P
User0: 61 and a half :P
is he going up?
. . . noe[
*nope
/me Insert RD sayin 20% cooler
Mass murdering monster that you are Sumica.
Canadian_Brony: I meant specifically Evil Dead: Army of Darkness, but the other movies would be cool too.
3 of the exact same name and face kerbals so yeah just killling clones
Sumica: Let be check....Oh right kill count is over 9000 i think
AgentKalim there are more than 1 Evil Dead movies?
Sumica: me*
There's three
why do you kill so many sumica?
He's gonna destroy us all!!! GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!
yeah evil dead 2 and army of darkness
Eh.....
Good thing Kerbals breed like rabbits
So, where's the land?
I just coughed while sipping Coca-Cola. It wasn't a pleasant experience
that plane has a lot of fuel
good luck
I know that feel
Godspeed Sumica
Canadian_Brony: I hate it when that happens.
Yeah, good luck with that.
when you get back to base sumica call me
How /much/ fuel?
Not enough fuel
A lot of fuel

LAND HO
I have a feeling that tail might fall off soon
Land ho!
Will he make it?

Hi everypony
Fun Fact the Piggy dance was supposed to be in The Best Night Ever

Hi, DavidCortez

hi DavidCortez
This game needs cities to crash into to.
Hello DavidCortez
Consider nothing! Land like a boss!

ITS WORKING!
aw man. What was that funfact I learned on EQD just the other day?
/me bashes his face into his keyboard
Place your bets! Will sumica make it?
Nope
Trivia: Trixie was origonaly going to be a boy
land that sh*yay*t!
Ninjazz|Fics: Burn little people burn!
ZappyTheUnicorn: Nope
ZappyTheUnicorn I bet my empty Coca-Cola can that he will crash and burn
and we start our decent
Om: It would so be epic!
Throttle those engins!
That it would
35 km is not far....
I bet 400000 dollars that he will fail landing
Oh right. AJ was also part of the ponies that ate the cake
Inb4 Sumica crash the poor guys and kill them
FULL POWER!
You probably explode on the runway Sumica
do you even have that money to bet, lakingsfans?
yes
there is a song called "Crash and Burn". I'm considering playing it right now
What he lacks is the ability to slowly decend and land in a not deadly manner
i do
Especially with Sumi's improvised ICBMs flying all over the place. :D
"hit"
How far away is the ruunway?
shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits, though it doesnt meam we should :)
why would you hit a runway?
hit the hanger
sagas a couple dozen clicks
uncalled for
Oh Rainbow my dear...
rather, we can say that here, though we shouldnt :)
At least they will die on land and not drown slowly....
Huh says here Lauren wanted to make a Seaponies Episode
/me sings along
OH MY GOD I am just so angry right now
lol
Ninjazz|Fics: I cant wait to get started

Will he make it?
Do I see the Space Center there?
Ninjazz|Fics: I have so many to chose from
lakingsfans: indeed
http://www.fimfiction.net/user/flutterspin
They canned the idea of a Big Mac Episode
I've been reworking the first one :P
for obvious reasons
And then it faceplants.
sumica if you land it i will eat my hat!
inb4 crash and burn
Om: meet your new pet squirely!
I feel his landing will be less than stellar
ITS JUST A SQUIRREL
needs more 'splosion!
Ninjazz|Fics: Nice to meet you new pet ;)
dat yay
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5432/ <- Welp we're doomed O_O
I hate this song
IMissOsamaBrony: You still here? Chat derped
NEED to approach from a lower altitude and a less steep angle
nose up
Om: Hai. :3
Vardox ya
missed the runway :)
explosions?
you should aim towards the runway
My mom's watching this and concerned that you're too far to the right.
...I think you should approach on the, yah know, RUNWAY
nose up
You should aim for not dying.
YES!
score!
^
Kandarihu Well, Your mom's a better pilot than sumi :p
Nice.
I think hes kinda missing the runway
/me eats hat

And then the world ends
Zomg it landed
Sumica is a HERO
/me eats hat in depression
Imagine if it just blew up now.

/me applauds
According to Amy Keating Rogers, Applejack was originally meant to be a fourth culprit in MMMystery on the Friendship Express, who managed to avoid incriminating herself but confesses to the deed in the end anyway.
Just for no reason.
Sumica is a hero, but he put them there in the first place...
Meanwhile: DON'T JINX IT
/me applaudes for Sumica
AttackWithHugs: But I'm trying to jinx it D:
suddenly the plane explodes
Meanwhile: But whyy?
Well, he brought them back alive.
Why isn't it slowing down?
unless he presses the self destruct biutton. >.>
AttackWithHugs: for funsies. ^^
for no other reason
huston we've landed 2 kilos from the runway
Hint hint.
According to Lauren, she initially wanted Tara Strong to voice Pinkie Pie, and Tara wanted to voice her with a Bubbles-esque voice.
YAY

That is a beatiful assent.

He will soon leave the atmosphere.

Sumica: Go in a straight line as fast as possible and then pull the nose straight up. If the physics are correct, it should be fun
Buy health care or you get a fine...Gee thanks Obama...you suck
You should be aiming for a orbital entry, Sumica :P

Um, Shamroc
"I cant allow you to do that, Starmica"
good call Phase4 :D
Phase4: Sumica likes to kill them go figures he makes very verrrrry faulty designs :D
/me 00,02pesters kirzstryfe
Sumica, do you get a self-satisfying feeling from blowing up rockets?
Shouldent it be illigal to fine someone for not buying something?
What if I dont want healthcare?!
My mother says 'its just like car insurance'
all state
switch to all state
00,02it doesnt shift randomly, it is dererministic, but the rules are bizare and broken
Nationwide is on your side~
How the hell did this bill even get passed?
Car insurance laws are state-based as I recall. Not national
/me is in good hands
I don't know. I was going to look it up
WE ARE FARMERS!
Yup
States have that power. Whether the feds have that power is up for debate
The fact that they can fine you for not buying health care should be against the law
Shamroc: y u no play the stop startin game.
13Meanwhile: you stop startin
saving you 15% or more

Sumi, what did the Kerbals ever do to you??
Meanwhile: EVERYTHING
/me calls upon the sea ponies
Ninjazz|Fics: Is your OC a gun slinger? Just curious. Or was Vi just doodling and your talent involves something with gems?
Shoo bee doo
HECK even foreigners saw he was not qualified
How the hell did he even win?
Vordox: But look at who we had to choose from.
00,02i like how jet fuel and rocket fuel are interchangable in this game, cause that makes sense
Let's see how much of the news media is still singing his praises over this.
dont you love the feeling when a hater gets banned
uh huh. And the next president is surely going to be better?
I know
CK|Basara: THen move away from the two parter system, do like the rest of the smart world, full voting
there is a significant other problem with the bill as well... when you have 8-10% unemployment, and 25% who cant really afford health care on top of that... well it's a mess
derpy for president
Iron_Edge: She was just practising. I'm more or less just an average pony WITH alot of hidden abilities. And the CM was mostly inspired by Rarity's CM. :$
derp 2012
Vordox: Yes, it's totally just that easy.
wtf, why did I get kicked? O.o
And it still got passed... the fuck
Broke!

Negative Ghostrider, pattern is full
Kandarihu: wasnt Romney the one who originally came up with that idea?
Ninjazz|Fics: Good thing I caught you when I did then. :3
if sumica were president imagine how many rockets being sent by nasa would explode
yay bomb the tower
Everypony, RUN!
So if 25% of the country cant afford health insurance, why the fuck did this bill still pass?
Phase4: Ah, so it doesnt work.
Kandarihu: And if you believe Romney's going to fix things, then good news, I have some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you.
Iron_Edge: I didn't say that I wasn't one. ;3

Om what did you do to Ninjazz|Fics?! xD
Iron_Edge: What is ninny blushing bout?
RyunosukeKnT: Shhhh. The Republican party doesn't want it well known that Romney's bill is extremely similar to the one Obama made.
