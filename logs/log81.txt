6at least you didnt MISS THE LIFE
13LOL
or shall i say...
ponys?

Your rhyming I despise
6on the run I beat remilia, I actually completely missed the life block on 5th stage
it brings tears to mine eyes
6and basically cried when I saw it vanish off screen
I have to go, and don't say no.
what's that?
13LOL wow
13of all the things you had to miss
Dai-Guard?
hey, can everypony who's not listening tune in to Celestia Radio?

6yeah

9e'yup
WOOO
how?
For I'll be back! Just don't follow my track.
6if I had that life, I wuoldn't have had to bomb so many times in remilia's fight
6I feel like technically I didn't beat her, since I bombed like crazy on her last spell
i chose to say: doorbell
why?
6I probably could have done it, but I wanted to 1cc so badly I just went LOLXXXXXXXXX
9YOU UNDASTAN
13By the way, do you have a replay of the run where you beat Remilia?
13I wanna see it :D
I'm listening!
6yeah I'll show you sometime
i cant ryhme
What is Celestia Radio? I must confess I do not know. If you could just provide a link, I'll have a look and see, I think.
so i wont even try
6I'll be back with my computer on saturday or sunday
6and I'll show you
And all in the same scheme aswell
03sigh
13and I'll get to see how you play it as well, which I'm always interested in~
13Awesome :D
Why not try a different pattern for kicks
The voices just sounded annoying and didn't seem to fit as well.
03I have this png that somehow got corrupted
http://ponify.me/
I just tuned in!
Variety is sure to sell
MY BRAAIIN YOUR MELTING MY BRAIN
03anyone have any idea how to open what's left of it?
9some dubs ARE good
I prefered the Japanese.
6I'm downloading MoF right now since as easy as it is....it's one of the most difficult for me
Hmm.
9it's just that many are pretty bad
yeah, unfortunately it's REALLY hard to be a good anime VA
Meh.
6not really
example: TTGL dub is awesome.
03:/
6I've never seen a png be successfully recovered
is the melted fluid going down the drain?
IS GODZIRRA
03frick
If your brain is melting you better head over to thhe freezer
Ok everypony TUNE. IN!
9yeah. It's mainly because of the nature of the Japanese Language
9it's difficult to dub
03why does my phone's memory card have to randomly corrupt thigns x.x
6how corrupted is it
yeah
RUBBAH DUCK ZIRRA
yeah.
03bad enough that it says
03"Windows Photo Viewer can't open this picture because the file appears to be damaged, corrupted, or too large"
which is why I think people should go away from trying to lip synch it
But TTGL's dub is top-notch though
03and nothing I tried will work
03Adobe Fireworks fails
03etc
6I'm assuming the "too large" isnt the problem?
I mean, just get a stronger translation, don't worry about the animation, you know?
9TTGL's dub is okay
03nopr
03*nmope
03*NOPE
9I've seen much better
6lol
03Windows Photo Gallery says corrupted
if worse comes to worse, you can always edit the existing animation
6can you send me the file maybe?
I've never seen a thing like this. He speaks of queries... What'd I kiss?
http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loupw3YWGF1qjql2lo1_500.jpg
lol
miss*
Celestia Radio?
9many people HATE the GL's dub and frankly it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets
if more people tune in, the DJ will apparently do something
are you serious???
03yeah maybe
03let me try something first
9Dai-Guard's summary: Alternate Universe Apollo Justice pilots a mech.
they think Kamina's voice lost part of its crazy in the dub.

Oh Hay! Why would you!?
Yes! This sounds so random!
i thought Celestia Radio should do some music

wierd thing is ive been using the same 4 passwords for the past 5 years and not one of them has been hacked/guessed
Same!
my Unreal Tournament 3 account once got hacked

9the one that really knows VAC I believe is Sprinkles
03hm
Et tu, Bruti? (You too, Brutus? from Julius Caesar by Shakespeare)
mhpf
03Aurora, does this look like the same Art Institute you said is good?
03http://i.imgur.com/0g3MB.png
Considering the sparse material they have presented, the lack of a website and the fact that they have no budget!
03I'm seeing "AiPrograms.info" and it looks incredibly sketchy
6thats it
03wtf
What did he say he'd do when he gets 200 listeners?
03they don't have a .edu?
Also, you'd better not hurry a fighting game
Nope!
6I recognize the locations and the logo
GO DAI-GUARD
03well they keep saying how they opened one near me
03if you see the dot in Michigan XD
6they do
6@having an edu
but the little I have heard and seen, they seem to putting A LOT of dedication and thought in to this!
03then why the frick is that commercial so sketchy looking
6each individual school treats itaself as such
6there's no ai.edu
03ah
/me Somehow poked his eye when doing up his zipper/fly
hehe, the server url for celestia radio is molestia.ponify.me
6you need to specifically find the school
03but "Art Institute of Troy" is still a legit school?
you´d better no hurry any game
<3
03it looks like such a trap LOL
…lolwut?!

6Yeah...

6But I have to head out.
Now THIS song was wesome!
6Like, now.

I dont understand the title of this track
9can you teach Sathi? (And Myself later)

its a remake of the theme song
03yeah, hence why everyone makes fun of art school :P
6And you if you're online...
6=/
and winter wrap up
The_Crowing: more like a remix
It's a sledghammering of the theme song
6yep
Gay R-D?
yeah, nice remix
but what does it have to do with rainbow dash being gay?
6It's really incredibly easy, but I have to leave for work NOW.
03then again, music is the same way
6I honestly hate it, considering there ARE normal people there
nothing
Please stp that communit..
gah.
03some people make it big, but most end up living in a garage somewhere LOL
how can rainbowdash be gay?
6but that's also half the reason I'm not going to a true art school
6I'm going to a university with a pro art program
if you gotta leave now, then hurry.
by having pony intercourse with other mares
well I have a few questions.. when will you be back?
...really? Have you watched the show?
03University of Michigan has one :O
/me hides
ah tomorrow
fine
isnt he a girl.. ?
6avoid the crap and the mob of weird people

6go to university and pass them all up

6Yeah, I should be on early my time tomorrow and won't have to leave until this time tomorrow.

Ah right
That'swhat makes FiM so awesome!
03I love how youa ctually tell people to whois stalk you

6LOL
6can I call you something now?
whois is there for a reason.
all this "Oh Dash is so dudeish, she must be gay!"
yeah, i hate that, too
Manearion: Zecora is reeeaaally stereotypical
03^
Is truly so stupid and shortsighted...
03but then people complain about me looking up their idle times
Yes!
03I'm like
03if you don't like functions that are built into IRC, don't use it.
12!seens Lakorv
Zecora and Applejack, I give you that!
!seen Lakorv
Lakorv is on the channel right now!
All of them are more or less stereotypical, but I don't think it's so bad
/me coughs
silly nilly
you forgot to identify!
......
with me at the the grand galaaaa
oh ponys
Has Sathi got VAC yet?
Oh god, the zebra episode
But I think it'd be more interesting if Rarity found out she was gay!
Ponys are RACIST!
03OK so
9don't know if she got the correct one
12guess it's not the same thing
lol
03I just heard this song on the radio
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2iQ_7AoJns
[1,0You0,4Tube]: AB Logic - The Hitman | by butteslmao | Length: | Views: 85 745
9she probably got the TRIAL TRIAL TRIAL one
03this sounds like a ripoff of Get Ready for This
…
guys really need to get down to the ground with all of the stupid stereotype and racist shi*
Yes but they learn....
i know
i mean
srsly?
yer i'm sure someone can help me on another version?
Zecora or whatever shes called isnt a stereotypew
I have the urge to troll some of those radio stations with a trololo rendition of Duel of the Fates
wasnt that the whole point of the entire episode?!
to accept whats different?
I don't know why I have this urge.
SIEG ZEON!
9BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
>mfw my keyboard don't even type the same things whether I type in in mibbit or in Steam
BA BA BABABABABA
You need to make a VAC in the control panel
ok what the hell is this
i mean
9Best fucking song
darkside: hmm?
Pinkies Cocaine Party?
....what is this?
…what is this I don't even
everything can be a stereotype
Peculiar.
but thats not what counts
NewDCD, it is, after Sorairo Days and ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
uhh no
very peculiar
this isnt even a song
what counts if it is portrayed as something bad
i'm not that excited about this track
only stereotypes can be stereotypes
Zecora is stereotypical yes! I hope they develop her more in season 2!
I SAW SPEAR-ARM
I really do!
O_o
o_O
Does this radio ever play normal music?
mhpf
Hi!:D
FallSilently: i doubt it
Wait..
Or is it all crazy stuff like the last four songs?
haha
he plays everything
I unmuted the music and all I hear is a random bumble of noise.
normal music?
Brony music IS crazy!
lol
YES
Back to 8-bit!
today, everything seems to be racist and whatnot
More 8-Bit :) Must be tonnes of it.
trololol
Fall: It's always oatmeal, 25/8
I <3 the 8 bit theme song
…maybe a bit TOO much eight bit
Hi!
less 8 bit, more ponybeat
^
03someone hasn't heard of /nick >_>

i admit, i do like the renard mix of this track
03http://i.imgur.com/XNdXt.png <- yay movies that don't attempt to hide commercial operatying systems? XD
what kind of stereotype is Zacora?!
9LOL
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH

AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Evil laugh at work

AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
This is not a good version of Giggle.
She's african steretype
http://lapfox.bandcamp.com/track/got-my-pony-spam-for-you
says who?
The Zecora incident is about not being racist, so it's not racist, but it's still EXTREMELLY stereotypical...
stereotype
At the Winter Gala?
Sathi, open up the VAC control panel
aand?
shes still a zebra
okay hold on
and whats wrong about beeing stereotypical
i mean
…
O_o
o_O
seriously
Yes, and zebras are from wheeeeere..?
6when you want to change your name
i know
AFRICAAAA
but shes still a zebra
6just type /nick yournamehere
9dat mood whiplash
:/
an anthropomorphic zebra
okay
6obviously filling yournamehere with the name you want
hrmm, not the biggest fan of this mix
used as a hamfisted metaphor for an african
6it makes it way more convenient
that collects masks
and lives in a hut
the show never told you that
and brews potions
thanks!:)
dem idiots blocking the roads with cars
…well…
that was your interpretation
/me listens to some pony spam
Well, since most of the mane six are breaking their stereotype, it's sad they would make her so very stereotype
just like black people
6your welcome
6..
Except... I love zecora!
6you're
6GOD
…
/me sighs
6I HATE THAT TYPO LOL
StephenCawking: now YOU'RE being stereotypical
HYPOCRITE
WRONG
And Iprobably wouldn't as much if she wasn't all mystical and talked in rimes!
8 bit giggle at the ghostys...
I'm stereotyping
6I'm one of those people who hates the you're/your and the there/they're/their typos
it's a verb too you know
Hope you don't think I'm a drunken bastard who doesn't talk!
03^
http://lapfox.bandcamp.com/track/got-my-pony-spam-for-you <-- still an awesome mix :P
same thing
6and yet I tend to perform said typo more than most people LOL
all of this "waaaah stereotypes and racist and whatnot" interpreted in everything is really getting on my nerves

Random video of the day: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mjcOZf1BfU&list=FLtF17ymRGgUs&index=34
Manearion: I love Zecora too. I think maybe the message of the episode is that being a stereotype isn't a bad thing?
6m
zeeb?
9UNDASTAND
6hold on, mibbit ate that link
03LOL
even if she is, so what? she is simply different, there is nothing about being "better" or "worse" than ponies
Sathi?
6tastes like chocolate or somethin
12o-o

Why in the name of pony does Mr. Bean have pinkie hair

I am unsure as to why Mr. Bean has Pinkie Pie's hair, MrPoniator
it hit 200
so, back to our topic: is it ok for RBD to be gay? shouldn't she be breaking the gay stereotype?
12do you have to do online training as a part of your job?
HOW CAN A GIRL BE GAY?!?!?!?
ITS A BLANKET TERM
I do not want RBD gay
JEEZ
Really.
She likes penis
Duh
03oh hm
You don't know how a girl can be gay?
I think it would kill what makes her awesome
So she's gay

03THIS Art Institute commercial looks legit
chocolates, this is a PG chat
9AOYAMA, DAT SMOOTHNESS
Want or otherwise, it's absolutely never going to come up on the show so all speculation is irrelevant.
03the link they show is artinstitutes.edu/stories
I dont think they'll do sexuality in the show
6LL
6no
that type of talk must go to #EquestriaAfterDark
03but wtf @ having a .info link for a college, that just made me think it was some poser place LOL
she's so disappointed...
too many parents will rge
swag off?
12good
that stereotyping
what does this mean?
they just said gay and sexuality
6the only training outside of on the job was an alcohol training
._.
Sexuality is already in the show
6which was a 26 question test
6that was it xD
12ah
Rarity is straight
03LOL WTF Alcohol training?
12well
12I bring it up
THREE OF THE SAME ONES
I have a lot of tomboyish friend, and thaéy are all fed up with this whole "gay" and "manly" thing
wait
heterosexuality is as much sexuality as homosexuality
12because we have online training
maybe there are people with same firstnames?
6drf, laws are really strict about alcohol
Ok
?
12and this one lesson
only because RBD acts alittle manly, all of the pony community is like : "waaaah lesbian"
6and target's policies are just as strict
It's not like all tomboys are Gildas
03well
03isn't it just
there is more sexuality in your speculations that in the show actually ;)
03don't sell to anyone under 21
03LOL
12KEPT mispelling "their" as "thier"
12I cringed
a point was made a few moments ago
12each time I saw it
9Remember Japanese write the surname first
stop discussing this topic
oh
NOW
members of same family?
6don't sell to anyone under 21, you are required to swipe their ID regardless of appearance (even 92 year olds get carded), you can't be under 18 to sell it
6etc etc etc
or move to #EquestriaAfterDark with it
it's not strictly PG appropirate
03OK
9yeah, but it's easier finding mistakes like that
6I could go on forever lol
03wtf iTunes
12these are adult people in the company
ah
6there's a lot more to the 21 rule
12who can't spell
03it just said I inserted a blank CD when there are no such thing o_O
03*is
so make a new topic or go there
12or use spellcheck
Has nothing to sex just relationships
^

Barck Zecora..?
12i fail to see the humor
*Barack
03but i mean, surely there has a to be a reason people are "pillaging" etc?
12^
03well

I disunderstand what's happening on Celestia Radio's chat screen right now and I'm afraid to interrupt to ask. Can anyone here explain?
13Someone guy got shot by the police and people used it as an excuse to start riots =w=
03and?
03people get shot by police all the time
6and nothing

12and it turned violent
12detroit parking wars
oh snap they're the ones being attacked
6drf that's the point, this is all stupid
ban in 3... 2.... 1...
Something like that
03yeah
12i can't believe that's a show
more correctly, police shot a man dead. Then there were peaceful protests, then this.
There goes
awww, ZekeS
12Yep, its dumb
03I think the whole police not being allowed to have guns in the UK is incredibly stupid too
I was gonna get 'im
:(
6did you see the copypaste I posted eaerlier about who was arrested
12I agree
ah well
03because bad guys don't follow loaws and will have guns anyway
:P
You can kick Zekes
03so why put the cops at risk?
fatality
Police shouldn't need guns.
12^
03orly?
no, that's no fun Fall
6most of the kinds of people causing these riots are our generation
6aka stupid people
03what do you do if someone starts shooting at you
too much swag ain't good for you
lets not turn this into an op war
DRILL-ARM INCOMING
03just take the bullet and die?
6also, I'm fully against that
You forget I'm Norwegian, drf
12shouldn't need, but DO need
CogWeaver: I may or may not have remembered to unset the default autounban time, so you may get your shot :D
6police need guns
our police is unarmed
03there are people who do shoot at cops
12they should be at least armed with high quality tranqs
6but then again, this is the US
You guy's fighting over who gets to ban
6I dunno about the UK
12so they don't harm anyone but can knock them out at a distance
03well
03tasers only go so far
my goodness, all the noobs in the celestia radio channel
Kick the next guy who goddamn mails me
Johnsey that's impossible
9DAT CUTE DESIGNER
well he wasn't spamming on purpose
that sound is annoying
dat designer
so I'll unban him
03I've seen lots of high speed car chases that end with police shooting the tires out LOL
03good like tasing a tier
FAIL COZ
03*tire
FAIL
XD
12tier
12lol
our police officers usually wear bats, nothing more.
Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
lol
That's really good intentions
6lakorv
they do make it look bulky and heavy. That be his charm...
6that can't happen around here
03Lakorv, so what happens if someone starts shooting?
12is that an agreement, Roara?
03do they just die?
12some people's houses were destroyed, thats how out of hand they're getting .w.
nice one....
ohai Ziltoid
CureZen: you just saw why
12Danny
how can you spam on accident?
6not when this country is built upon drug cartels and guns
6yes, LL
like on cops, when they say it's been a good night when they catcha lot of criminalls...
12he said SHOULDN'T need
also
So Guys I have an idea
people don't 'start shooting'
This song
12but they do
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz8n2hzQ0t0&feature=BFp&list=FLqmFzBdeJRCk&index=14
Plus pinkie pie
Isn't a good night if there aren't any crimes going on..?
03yeah but what if you're dead before you have time to call in special forces
No, it just means awesome crimes are happening.
6it's all regional
StephenCawking: i dunno, it's relatively impossible!
welcome to Norway, where everything isn't centered around economy, guns and drugs.
6yep
That song doesnt fit pinkie CureZen
we have the strictest gun laws in the world.
6welcome to the US, the exact opposite
03it doesn't need to be CENTERED around them
03see
03laws
03mean nothing
03if you're a CRIMINAL
I'd liek to see appleack, rarity, rainbow, or Luna sing it though
12until you get caught
03yes
03but that's not the point
Dai-guard may have the body of a real robot, but he's got the soul of a super.
Pikie's always wearing costumes
if you're criminal you don't get guns, and getting them illegally is actually not that easy.
9yeah, pretty much
the Utøya terrorist tried and failed.
03it's incredibly easy here
or you could switch suit with parties
Either or
9it's also realer than most reals
6it's horribly easy around here
03yeah
eeyup
that's the charm
03then there's also things like in Terminator
03walk into a gun shop
03take the gun
03point it at owner
03bam
/me runs
12a gun store opened up a few months ago here
CureZen try putting this to a pony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGaOQKJik-s
6heck, you see how our border situation is right now
no one in equestria after dark wants to debate the morality of RBD's orientation
@dari i'm on skype if you need me
/me ><;'d
lame
guns are silly.
03you'l be covered
03:)
12Danny
03*pse
i dont even want to know what they debate about...
dat glancing hit
03Lakorv, I can see where guns would come in handy for hunting, but that's it really
12there's plenty of blunt objects that serve the same purpose :B
figures you would be underage
Now, Steins;Gate
you can't provide your population with legal weapons like that and expect them not to use them.
orientation?
Stock prices and the stability of the market ofc
you know
whether she likes colts or not
03I gave a speech in my class about why handguns should be illegal to own
03which they aren't >)_>
The only show that distracts me from ponies
DON't TURN THE BOOSTERS ON
03you can't hunt with a handgun
it's clearly skywards
OHH SNAP LAZORS
03so it's basically just designed for killing people >_>
6^
there's no morality to it?
6see
6drf
12they're "for protection"
is too
12tho
03rifles and shotguns actually serve a legit purpose
6thats actually half right
6handguns are legal
since morality is likely an abstract concept forged by man?
12you shouldnt keep them on you
6for house protection
03well
6but people lie about that
03why do you need a handgun
6so that's the problem
03youc an protect yourself just as well with a shotgun
03etc
12because then you NEED protection from those who have them
and ponies have likely forged the same concept?
03LOL
10It's a hobby
12hai Sky
9USING FOOT TO PILOT ROBOT
03You don't need to own a gun to shoot targets
nice one with the spin reversal.
9LIKE A BAWS
ban all handguns, then no one can attack with them, so you don't need them for protection.
03just go to the range and borrow one :P
I wouldn't have thought of that one
Ô.o
12Lakorv
03Lakorv
6lakorv it's too late
03you don't get the point
12ban+eliminate
6ban wont do squat
03CRIMINALS
03DO NOT
03FOLLOW
03LAWS
6there are millions of guns in this country
Lawl
sheesh, drf
03I'm all for making them illegal
12^
ORDER THE TAKEOFF!
Blums I don't know about ponies but thats going in my favorites
no reason to yell
12i like watching world's dumbest o3o
XD
What the party MEANS.
6and the ban wouldnt help, unless you find a way to spontaneously combust every gun in the country at once
03but that doesn't mean you wouldn't need them
12unless they're all destroyed
They should prepare all the papers in advance
6in which case, HERE COMES THE BLACK MARKET LOL
I'm perfectly competent of reading your words on one line, all lowercased.
12then nothing'll change
03Lakorv, when I've said it like 20 times, it kinda proves you aren't paying attention.
12what?
"Hey you, give me a thousand dollars" "A thousand dollars? wow! why?*moustache flys off*"
12except the innocent will feel more inclined to break the law
03you used that face D:
you know, you make a template where you scan and copy the paper multiple times.
12and keep one on them for protection
03well
hey Fella
just 1 signature needed
03I think they should just not let you buy a gun that can't be used for huntinmg
03you can easily protect your house with a shotgun
03or a rifle
03you don't need to MURDER someone who gets on your property
10lolrifle
/me needs to cook something.
Brb
03rifles are awesome
6drf
/me actually enjoys shooting rifles
10Indeed
6yuo can actually
03at targets, obviously.
6*you
9BAA BA BA BAA BA BA
0322-caliber rifles, that is
9SHIP IN THE BIG CITY SINGAN
StephenCawking: <twilight>prove it</twilight> ;)
6you don't know what someone has planned when they break into your house
9*SHEEP
badabumbee
12^
6in which case, the law protects you against killing them
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
6it's self defense
BABABBABABBABABBABABABBA<
drf, when you've said it 20 times, it kinda proves you've said it 20 times. I heard you and I /know/ criminals don't. That's why they're criminals.
prove what?
ponies have made it into HTML5? awesome
03no but I mean
10The thing with being able to use rifles to protect yourself, yes, but they're very noticeable
it
6for all you know, it could be some mentally deranged kidnapper
03you can also just shoot them in the foot
03you don't need to KILL Them
6drf
Ziltoid, get in #P&D early, alright?
12Sky
10Hand guns can be hidden
21:53:07 < StephenCawking> and ponies have likely forged the same concept?
6I'm aiming at their chest if they break into my house
6end of story
ok
6I'm not thinking WHERE to shoot
6I'm shooting
10and your enemny/whoever won't know you have one on you
03well we don't own a gu./
03*gun
12only more dangerous people need to keep something like that hidden
6if they die, then so be it
Blums: nah, XML :P
BA BA BA
what the hell is this?
9it is
well, they seem to have some pretty solid concepts about right and wrong
9I just put them on
if people break in here, they're pretty low to start with
but if so were
alright
10Light, whut
6^
03it's like the discussion I had yesterday about how security systems only keep the honest out
there's not even a topic about shooting
no one keeps guns here.
what are you guys talking about O_....
12you shouldn't need to have a concealed weapon
luckily.
03if you have a giant sticker on your house saying you have ADT, then criminals will just find someone who knows how to crack ADT alarm systems and you'll be robbed anyway.
Everything and Nothing
6lol
10So DRF
12because
10What happens when police forces won't be able to protect you?
a fort? It is a PIER
Lovely assumptions.
12lets say your neighbor feels uncomfortable
03Skylands, protect me against what?
10There's not enough of them
Yes, No, Both, Superposition, and Entaglement
6intruder, potential murderer
12that they feel you have a concealed weapon because you feel the same about them
6whatever
dat drill arm
10I don't know, say economy collapse and everyone goes berserk
eeyup
03...
12you both buy handguns and conceal them
03police != citizens
"came out of the stable"
6like right now in UK, riots
Really now?
03police already have handguns LOL
6lol
03LOL ragequit
6he left
/me facepalms
Okay, bye!
6I actually enjoy these debates
12'it'll end up with one or both of you shooting
6they're quite interesting
10Citizens will be attacking EACH OTHER
03but yeah Skylands I don't get your point
10To fight for survival of food etc
03I never said I didn't want police to have guns
03so o_O
6what dont you get?
12what Sky said
03I just said security systems are pointless
6actually hold on
dat ignored
6I lost mysefl here
Hi!
12where people in that area
12did just about anything
i feel like killing somepony.
That's no good.
9I wish my job involved piloting a giant robot
"Pony stomping day"
10^
dem hair-horns
12attacking each other, looting, etc
12they were scared
12confused
03where are we going with this
10Not enough police force to keep everyone in their shoes
03LOL
12and a cornered animal WILL attack
03there are around here
10My point: hand guns should not be banned
12same goes with people
03...
03why does a gun need to be concealed to protect you
remember, its the music that we choose
When's that? jk
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone

he's gonna be so disappointed
9Celestia comissions a Giant Robot
9wat do
12maybe weight is a factor
GURREN LAGANN
MIXED WITH DAI-GUARD
IN PONY FORM
12as aren't shotguns and rifles heavier?
mehehehe
03yes
03but unless you're a 3 year old
03you should be able to hold it
03anyway
10If someone sees you have a rifle on you, either A) they'll attack you for it (yes, some people are very brave and go after anything they can get) or B) they'll run away scared
Hey.
10So
Hello
1050/50
6ok I've actually lost everyone's views on this topic
03whereas if you have your gun hidden you'll just be shot before you get a chance to shoot back
03:P
6we went ona tangeant here LOL
9I was more thinking of developing a mass production Real Robot line under the line of "Mount Blades"
03yeah, why are we talking about complete chaos situations anyway
10Also
12Roara, we've gone on multiple at this point
lololol
03I'm talking about actual LIKELY scenarios
What did I just read?!
10"It's not guns that kill people, but the people with the guns"
12Danny
Stuff
probly
12because they happen
10Or however that went
What DID you just read?
03Skylands
10We have too many irresponsible people out there
6^
03it's legal to own assault rifles
03now
03what good reason is tehre for that

like a ninja
10I dunno
Zero Tolerance
03he's a collector, but still... why would anyone need to have a gun like that
12some people collect them
If you ask me,the writer of cupcakes should be dragged out into the street and shot.
12strange hobby tbh
10So guns aren't really the problem, it's the people
03you can't conceal it, and hunting with an assault rifle is stupid, it's basically just aimed at serial killers LOL
well
why do you read that?
yes he do, Justice.
or they fire him.
i mean
give him the pink slip.
i´ve never red it
9ACE ATTORNEY: GIANT ROBOT EDITIONS
12then lets aim them at serial killers?
hehehe
/me shot
10:P
03still
why did it became so famous in the first place?
6I honestly think the current gun laws are way to lax, and way to scattered
12^
Yeah I haven't read Cupcakes either and don't plan to.
03^
what became famous?
6drf has a good point that the kind of guns allowed are ridiculous
Well.
cupcakes
Because it was early, I think.
oh, that fic
>_>
6but at the same time, I'm with skylands on this
12although
Early and particularly graphic.
6that handguns should be legal as self defense
03well as I said, my family doesn't own a gun
12they can't be changed really

03plus
I won't sleep for days now.
6then that's just personal preference
12if
sorry! i was just at another chat
well
because no one expected it will be something like that
03you have to register your gun to legally own it
12they know others won't
9I UNDERSTAND, YOSHIKO
DAT ACTING MILF
03so if they made them illegal
wow
6we don't own one, but it's been family discussion if we should get one
It's on the blog, it should be easy to find.
is it greatly written???
03the people your egistered it with
12My family don’t own a gun either lol
03could just come get it
10They've wanted to limit the gun laws
03XD
Ok! will do fall
10But if they go too far
12Danny

/me sits in his corner, recovers from a hard days work

12and what Roara
12said
PsychicKid: Yes, I have, actually
btw
hard enough to get me interested in fics in general, and the last one I'd probably read is that one lol..
6it doesnt matter what you own, there are people who will just pick a random house and that's their prey
03I've left my GPS and mp3 player in plain sight
03inside my car
03never had anyone break in
12then you got lucky
I suggest putting the guy that knows his stuff in the robot.
03I've left the door unlocked back when it was broken and wouldn't lock
03still nobody broke in
You know, the technician.

/me looks up the Darkwing duck theme off youtube now lol
03LL
6that was really cold hearted and I cant believe you just said that

03XD
I'm skinnniiiiiiiing you aliiiiiiive
Dont be too hasty!
03the odd thing is they actually paid me $20 a week to cut their grass

Same old boring as fuck topic.

12and more-or-less "infected" the area with city behavior
03LL, fine, you want to move to a private island with me?
PsychicKid
well
i guess
its
Now you add a little something sweet not sour, a bit of salt just a pinch

6HURR MISSION TO MARSD
6-d
10Topic kinda changed, but regarding rifles @ DRF
12Marvin will not approve
/me shot
Okay,I'll ask again:When is the next Past Sins update coming out?
10You can't openly carry those around when you are out
10Out meaning, not your house
is the word fuck allowed in this chat?
03why would you travel with a gun
nopony knoooows *ooooooOOOOoooo*
12Danny
03it's no longer your property
12people do
10Huh
12@handguns
03I know, people do all sorts of stupid things
but it's Fireant
10Yeah it is o.o
inb4 kick
€rny: aieeyup
03but if you to say the mall with a gun
Nurse! I spy gypsies, run!
03that's just stupid
and he's in one of his moods atm
damn
so...yeah
Damn it,I hit refresh.
thats sad
and fireant is the & guy
12people do it
DEAD ON TARGET
it's allowed actually
^
03I know, hence why Texas sucks
/me runs
/me turns Skylands into a Puella Magi
...
9>ROKKETO PAWNCH
12Now you have all the guns you want :3
It is, just not to overuse.
LOL
exactly
/me uses a musket
well, uh... I hope you feel better then fire...
9DAT SOUND FX
Away I go
bah, I'd prefer to keep swearing to a bare minimum on here
DAT SOUND FX
hilarious
03LOL muskets
12Those too
12ew, Sky's OLD D:
Wasn't Past Sins just updated?
10Light, no
/me hides
03those things were as much dangerous to the user as the person being shot at
9DERP
6ok well
5th of August,yeah.
10It's a weapon wielded by one of the characters in that anime
12oh
6my views on guns to restrict them to personal territory only, unless hunting
in the stadium that was used to group up the evacueees
03agreed
Can we use it in the context of "Fornification Under Consent of King" or "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"?
w/e
6in which case, hunting is a whole different story
Even minors know the word fuck, so don't try to be victorian prudes here ;)
03and even then
6because that requires separate permits, certain locations, etc
03only if you registered as private property and you have a sign up saying it's such
But,*in AppleBloom style* I WANT THE NEXT ONE NOWWW!
03because legally
03you can't shoot someone on your property unless it's private property that you own
03even now
Knowing a word doesn't mean we want to see it used.
9Dat military cover-up
12if someone breaks in
Just my two bits.
03LL
12it's self-defense
03if someone breaks in
fuck yeah, thats true
03they can sue you if they break their leg
don't worry about it, Sketchy
Ok so extended forms then
I dunno why but I actually like the MiB
03what makes you think you'd win that case
he looks like a nice fella
6um
6breaking and entering
10Protection of your property and not outside of your property, disagreed
6usually wins in court
6er
/me activates her i-field
6defense does
i- field?
10-d
i was just about to type that
6suing is our pasttime, I know
6sueing
12^
yes, an I-Field stops beam attacks
at first I thought abirkin was using an at field
03I've heard all sorts of cases about people suing about breaking into someone's house and injuring themselves
03so if you SHOOT THem, LOL
But... nopony is using beam attacks..
know your Gundam
12then it's direct
yet
Sketchy_Sounds, no one hold you here. :)
03and they could sue you :P
12if they lkive :P
/me whacks abirkin2 with a load-bearing steel beam
12-k
03LOL
03if they die
If you find something offending here, well...
03their relatives can sue you
12dead cannot sue
This is one of my favorite songs
03yeah but
Please don't make me ask again.:(
12so
03very rarely does someone not have a single relative alive
...I'll mention it =P
03that can sue for them
03:P
/me stops Blums using Bits
12I let serial killer A break in
12ki8ll me
user 9089 we dont know
12and steal everything
Yay for Age of Empires 2
12-8
Bits? sorry i'm not versed in gundam
yay
Thank you.That's all I needed.
03well
9man
03if they have a gun
12only THEN can *I* sue?
03and it looks like they're going to use it
03then you could say it was self defense
03but
12then I'm already dead
Blums: Bits are psychically controlled flying beam guns, allowing the so-called "All Range Attack"
03if someone sets a foot on your yard and you shoot them on sight
03that wouldn't win
03as self defense
9I should try hosting "Giant Robot Saturday Night" or something
12yes
12but your HOUSE
OH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
03again, only if it's private property
wow
03same thing
thats...
12door/window broken
interesting
the difference between a Bit and a Funnel is that a Bit has an onboard reactor and a Funnel runs off of a battery
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
Second that
03self defense means they have to do something that puts your life at risk first
12I'll defend myself
fascinating
9>Child of the Sun
12yes
03says the one whos dad walks around with a gun
12Robbery don’t always equal murder
Not really.
9DAT KAMEN RIDER BLACK RX REFERENCE
12they're in my house uninvited
12and
Season 2 is coming out in December right?
What we could try to make could be like a tv channel?
12since I'm not a mind reader
10DRF
that's when it finishes
12I can't tell their purpose
10What do you mean?
no
they never said when season 2 would start
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2womniRmq0 funnels in action
6ok
6here's a situation
02herro :3
imagine Bronystate turning in the equivalent of a tv channel with ponies but other stuff too
and that's probably an estimated guess at best
03your dad seems like the type that WOULD shoot someone just for stepping on your grass LOL
at latest the HUB will put it out in december
Hmm
10No
Would be cool.
12...
10>_>
We need to download 100s of different programs. XD
Beginning of December.
03so then why carry it with you
12that was RUDE Danny
they'll be done with animation and such around mid to late september
that could be interesting
hehehe
9The problem would be...yeah.
10He is responsible with his
So,anywhere between now and December?
About the only thing we know for certain about season 2 is it has more Luna, more Derpy, and all the animatic stuff has been done.
I've got series 1-5 Doctor Who
10and what Light just said
9not to mention the electric bill and the difficulty of setting stuff in auto-pilot
And series 1-2 Torchwood
/me just joined the convo
10I took MUCH offense to that
And return of Snails.
you forgot someone
Yay.
My computer is on 100% of the time anyway.
and dont want more derpy...
House MD!
12hai Sunny
the guy who makes the music also mentioned a Twilight solo song as well was in the works
10You don't know my dad
I'm currently watching The Doctor
moar Derpy!
They didn't replace any voice actors did they?
6You've gone to bed for the night, someone decides to break into your house. You hear the noise, pull out your gun not knowing who it is. You walk out and find a man in the halway, someone you don't know, and he is only a few feet from the door that leads to your child's room. He seems to be looking around for things to steal, but you don't know for sure.
I mean stuff like Sci-fi monday, Mecha Wednesday, PONY Thursday, etc
02hi LL :D
I don't believe they did
Yes User_2164 they did.
Sathi, yeah I'll have that too when it's downloaded.
Derpy needs to not be a background character
daniel... I forget his last name
^
9I could only stream late Saturdays with my current schedule though
Twilight is now voiced by Morgan Freeman.
12He carries around a musket like a boss
03what if you shoot him, miss, and hit your kid instead :P
/me runs
6you have the gun, you dont know if this man is simply a burglar, or if he's going to enter your child's room, and if he's armed or not
Daniel Ingram does the songs
is that a negative?
And Rarity by Jim Carrey.
6you have the gun in your hand-
6drf
ty
6what the hecll
6hell
9that's why I'm not streaming Movie Nights when the semester starts, remember?
I'm not sure if that would make it better or worse.
also, the european viewings of the movies could impact with the shows
6did you REALLY just say that?
names were never my strong point =/
yeah
Applejack is now voiced by taylor swift
03yes
03I did
12Danny
lol hecll
o_o
9And thus I could host Mecha Nights on Saturdays at 9:30 PM EST or something
basically, the key advantage of Bits and Funnels is that they can allow a pilot to attack from many different angles of attack, making combatting them that much harder
03also so much for not swearing @ Aurora
03o.o
12in the HALLWAY Danny
and trixie by justin bieber
6to humor you
That sounds terrible.
And Charlie Sheen voices Celestia.
12LRN 2 READ
6the door is shut
stuff like that
O_o
oh gosh, Blums
Correction. Morgan Freemane.
03OK fine
03:P
6as in your shot will not hit the kid
Bonbon gets a new voice actor every word this time instead of every appearance
no
Well. i just finished reading cupcakes. can i get a kleenex
10It's called going to a shooting range and practicing
:)
Celestia is going to be voiced by Morgan Freeman
03if you're asleep
lol @ Xiagu
O_O
Peter_K, you fapped to it?
Depends on who you plan to kill with the kleenex
we shoose three or four different mecha shows, 1 episode of each every Saturday, for example
03I doubt you could fire with that insane accuracy if you're woken up
Oh, sorry... clopped?
12adrenaline
you…you read Cupcakes?
*choose
6I swore because that was even colder than the last thing you said about too bad if you live in ghettos
NO
10^
Wish I could help
03not always LOL
12is the key
EW
Xiagu how about every syllable?
Peter_K, I would suggest a paper bag for the vomit instead of a tissue
As soon as they hear Justin Bieber there,MLP will be gone for good.
/me cackles
6ok drf
6what would you do
03it's like how in L4D2 if you take adrenaline, you can still die :P
Heh.
6would you really just stand there and watch?
I READ IT NOW IN GOING TO CRY IN A CORNER
User_9089: ?!?
I've fapped to Cupcakes.
12wtf
NOTHING will revive it.
O_O
Was hot.
12is the point
03I wouldn't stand ther no, but I'd run up going WTF are you doing
6let the guy possibly murder you, the kid, kidnap, etc
12of bringing up a GAME
Blums, that would be too hard to pull off. Don't be silly :)
12This conversation keeps getting better |D
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Gross.jpg
We don't need to know this
6and if he has a gun of his own?
you guys are unbelievable
^
you really are
Watch, somepony is going to make that quote of the day.
But I'm used to it.
6then you're dead
User_9089 - now that wasn't funny :/
12Danny
6so bye
02how did that convo got started anyway?
03then pull some epic Batman move and slap the gun away before he has a chance to use it
12your natural adrenaline
12wakes you up
6>.>
what they need to do is fire up the production lines
and make MOAR DAI-GUARDS
02specially fear
Because it's the truth.
6that line right there made me not pay attention to this conversation anymore lool
03it takes time to pull a gun out of your pocket
So... Rebecca black guest voicing in a musical instead?
12just seeing someone suspicious in your house near your child
6drf
for military and civillian uses
e_o
03if they're already holding it, fine
12and under adrenaline
12you move faster than normal
And you say I'm bad!
6actually no
NOT FUNNY
6I don't feel like responding lol
To quote Spike
OH
03but if not, you can run up and just tackle them before they even get a chance to get it
Look!
6it's not going to go anywhere
What's Rebecca Black doing these days, anyone know?
Its muted now :p
orly?
Yes, magic.
03LL, moving faster != being accurate with a gun in the middle of the night
NOWAI
How about them ponies, Rite?
>facepalm
12it means you can get it aimed faster
inorite?
12etc
6my point being if I have a gun in my hands, and this person could potentially have one, I'd either use the gun on the spot or hold it up as a threat
10Better than not having a chance at all to defend yourself
12^
6and the first aggressive response from the stranger, I shoot
6in better chances, the stranger would run
Sweet and cute, IMMA RIGHT?
I know left.
12.-.
03yeah, holding the gun up is fine
Ohoho BitZero
so...um
03but you don't need a handgun to scare someone :LOP
03*:P
6skylands, I think he was talking about the intruder pulling a gun out of his pocket
You are such a game!
12Danny
not that this isn't fun or anything, but...
10k
6since I had stated you'd pulled the gun from your drawer already
12it's an added bonus
??
Because friendship, Is magic.
*gasp*
6so it's assumed to be in your hand lol
o_O what in the bloody hell did i return too O_o
CUTE PUPPY
12XD SS
6gun debate
DAAAAAWWWWWWWW
03oh woah
03our power just went out
Oh yay we can talk again
/me look at CogWeaver with evil eye.
You need voice (+v) (#EquestriaDaily) what does this mean?
03I heard a loud thunderclap and boom went the power
12brb
/me has no issues with silence, laughs a little
"Don't you dare to play with my console!"
quick! use the counter evil eye!
I always feel like I'm being force-choked when that happens.
6I think a gun would be more helpful in scaring a man from my house than just fists
03GOD DANG IT STOP BEEPING BATTERY BACKUP I KNOW THE POWER IS OUT
who needs voice?
03there we go, generator kicked on
6especialyl if the intruder decides he could take me ina fight
/me shrinks back from his Overlord's gaze* I'm sorry! dun kill meh! DX
?
It's an IRC thing, Peter_K
02sad...
there fixed!
DUN KILL MEH!
03LOL well, that part I guess depends on how tough you look
03someone like my dad could easily scare someone off with fists
ANOTHER SHELL
12Same
it happens when he sets +m . It mutes the channel
…
/me glowers at CogWeaver
what for you do that?!
okay, enough of this
Basically it means anyone who hasn't been +v'd by the admins can't be heard.
Peter_K, 	TL;DR When somepony sets the channel mode +m (mute), only hops/ops and people with voice (+v) can talk
lol
really?
03I've seen way too many movies to justify keeping a gun in the house LOL, that almost never ends well for the people in the movies
oh okay... i think i understand xD
this chat has sound ?...
12Danny
Really.
6and then there are the idiots who dont care and will fight anyways
10Movies =/= reality
hehe, good old irc times :P
I HATE TL;DR
...
12movies are dramatized
03like, you think soemone's broken in so you get ready to shoot them and then realize it's just your husband coming home from work at 3am
03etc
/me bangs head against desk
Vanned? Who's getting vanned?
i guess you could keep changing your nickname to communicate through the mute
I swear I didn't know their flanks were blank
12fists vs gun
12gun wins
but they'd probably ban you for that
Blums, eeeenope.
03not if you punch them first
12gun vs gun
6ok well
iu
O.o
6think about it lol
It wouldn't work ;(
;)
12guns have a longer reach
6turna light on, see if you know the person LOL
12derp
9but yeah
9got to think about which series to stream
03well
9Gundam X is obligatory
...
03given your scenario
03did you turn the light on? :P
6I think a husband would even let you know its them
9might insert some Z Gundam there too
6"who's there?"
9some SRW, some Dai Guard
Name changes don't get around +m though
9some Eureka 7
03what if he was just checking on the kid
12^
03etc
6intruder- no answer
Gurren Lagann, Dai-Guard, Gundam X, what about Evangelion?
6husband- me
lol
How about MEGAS XLR
They seemed to.
12^^^^^
12@Roara's
03that's what I mean, I'd at least see wtf is going on before I just shoot someone
Megas ain't japanese
9Will stream the Gurren-Lagann movie eventually. Everyone's watched GL already so yeah
yeah, it SAYS you shouldn't be able to change your nicks while it's +m'd....but yet it still happens... >_>
12Danny
actually
03just seeing someone in my house is not reason enough to shoot
damn it
12we're not saying shoot at a moments notice
9it's GIANT ROBOT NIGHTS, not Japanese Giant Robot nights
I heard a few in chat haven't
needed to relog
oh
6I'm not going to shoot on instinct, I'm going to find out who it is
yeah
What i mean by that is, it still wouldn't let you be heard lol
9I used to stream Megas before
you didnt miss nuthin
6unless it's very clearly aggressive
9I'd be willing to
then Megas is good too
... That wouldn't make sense, CogWeaver. +m is channel-wide while chaning your nickname is network-wide.
<Sketchy_Sounds> What i mean by that is, it still wouldn't let you be heard lol
03-9
no problem then
9okay, Megas
12but it's better to have and not need then need and not hsve
12*a
Well that's great, but I gave my FallSilently nick such a long and awkward password that it'd be too much hassle to abuse.
*changing
12Danny
Exacta
Lol
that's odd
12if it's for a mother's child
And well, also, banhammers, rite? xD
6in which case, that's either not my husband or he's clearly not a good person lol
thanks Blums
9I'll research more series
DAT BASEBALL
12the mother would do anything
03well I'm just saying, given the scenario you gave, if you see someone walking towards your child's room, it could easily be your husband checking on the kid LOL
10During rough times, of course LL would be for it
what about Evangelion^
12to keep the child safe
I heard it was good
Hi
Banvils to make the collection complete
ohai Barry
9Evangelion's good but WAY overrated
03plus
9and too manestream
Am I actually "audible" so to speak currently?
6I did mention it was an intruder
12then you tell them to self-identify
6not the husband
...best pony battle!?
(speaking of banhammers, mine's bigger than Fireant's! XP)
alright
I've always imagined banhammers having a little adjustable dial on them
03there are drawbacks to every situation
03how would you KNOW it's an intruder
/me runs away*
Yes, Sketchy, we can hear you
03they aren't going to have a sign on their backs aying I BROKE IN
12they don't respond?
OK cool.
what about the Nadesico show that I once heard about?
6if it was the husband...I'd think I'd look in YOUR OWN BED to see if he was there
It is good?
mhpf
6er
Or horrible
6my
6djksdrg
6KJRG
6RTH
03LOL
12better yet
9I want to give more exposure to giant robot series that don't get enough
03OK still
03as I was saying
``Set banhammers to kick.''
12BOTH parents
I just momentarily wondered why Fireant was quoting me.
03there is no perfect solution
12side-by-side
03for example
9Nadesico TV is hilarous, but the movie is pretty contrived
03you ask who's there and he shoots you before you even get a chance
Well you are pretty amazing
"Set banhammers to KILL"
because he can
03but does that mean you should just shoot anyone you see?
Well there is that @ Fall
not to ban?
6no theres not, I don't like the concept of killing someone
alright then. Maybe we could Stream Nadesico TV.
6I will though if I have to
9also Nadesico was made by the same people as Dai-Guard, only it's older
12^
no
hehehe
we don't ban here
we KILL
Whats higher than kill? Crash server?
also, real robot show.
03I'd try doing anything that avoids killing them if at all possible
03like just downing them
03injuring etc
9Gravion or Aquarion
03so that the police can arrest them for life
03etc XD
no, crashing the server is still lower than killing
a banhammer can crash a server?
could be cool too
9Gundam X is Real Robot
The setting above kill is the one that closes the internet
03as to most people, spending your life in jail is worse than death
K:Line every single one of you.
12then you're paying to keep them alive
12:B
/me imagines that on CogWeaver's banhammer, past ``FOREVER'', there is the word KILL written in crayon with one of the Ls backwards
Man, having this Celestia Radio on in the background is damned trippy.
03LL we're already paying for prisons
(I meant that Nadesico was Real robot too)
LOL Xiagu
XD
03adding one more person isn't going to change that
12shoot them there
Dudes.
/me lol'd
Topic change.
Ponies.
12you paid for a couple bullets
It's the same dozen or so songs endlessly remixed.
GO!
12but knowing
Frying the 13 DNS routers that service the internet?
Ponies.
03what are you, cheap now?
Ponies?
12that you're helping keep that person alive
6they wouldnt get life in jail lol
Has everybody heard my cat theory?
PONIES! the reason why everybody should be here!
PONIES
03well yeah not life
6intruding is a minimal jail time usually
12for ANY amount of time
03but they could easily get several years
03well
Rarity is best pony. No exceptions
I would like to propegate it.
03just breaking in by itself yes
OH CRAP
6if my family's life is threatened in any way
Applejack....
6I don't care
getting bigger than the robot
03but if they were making an indication of harming someone
6I will end theirs
03that's another crime
I should properly get round to actually drawing Salad.
fallsilently: is it pro-cat or anti-cat?
03which is why armed robbery is worse than just normal robbery
03etc
The ponies aren't ponies. They're cats.
12I agree with Roara
I created her first and yet I drew Sketchy first
Look at them. Clearly cats.
03you should see the movie Taken, then
So who are the cats then? ponies?
How about Macross/Robotech?
...
Ponies
12I have
they have hooves
Well OK technically no i drew Salad first but my drawing of her is rubbish.
03oh
I can't decide between Twilight and Fluttershy, myself.
and horns
03OK
and manes
03good movie, no?
12think of this
They have squarish paws.
basically, any good robot show we can take.
12Danny
12OUR child
and Pinkie Pie
Some fan characters rank above some mane 6 for me =D
12we both arise after hearing a noise
9gonna stream Do You Remember Love in the first Mech Night
03make sure it's not Santa on the roof first
/me hides
12XD
Look at their heads, and smooth curves, and snouts.
03JK
by fan i mean background
their legs and postures are not feline at all
Very feline.
12we see the above tall dark stranger near her/his door
9as the opening show to it
So that basically eliminates Transformers. and I'm REALLY glad we don't stream that.
no problem
03run up with a baseball bat and hit them
12would you let them go in there?
03before they get a chance to do anything
9but no plans of doing Macross TV
it is 3:33 over here! DANCE O' CLOCK!!
12which can kill them
12:B
/me dances*
9maybe Macross Plus
03it's VERY unlikely
~~EVERYPONY DANCE NOW!~~
03that it would kill them on first impact
/me dances
03unless you continually beat themn with it
03-n
cool
12still happens
The males look more like foxes.
03still
<Sweetie Belle> No. </Sweetie Belle>
03I'd try to be like Batman about things
12...
12Danny
03try to solve the problem without killing anyone
What kind of crazy-ass foxes have YOU been watching? o-o
12leave the comic book crap
03no but
10Living in a fantasy world, lulz
/me dances and just falls over, decides to stay put
12out of a serious debate
Rita ofc
It just sunshowered outside
agreed dermathil
03if you hit someone with a bat or shoot them in the foot etc
confirmation of no Transformers, right NewDCD?
03and police come
Ones that have been told by an evil horse queen that they're ponies!
12I actually agree with drf there
Sunshowers are pretty
03and find a gun on the person
6"Hey, intruder? Do you have a knife? A gun? Are you just going to walk into my kid's room?
03then you can tell :P
9not really
once the entire sky glowed orange
03well
oh snap
9I might stream GOOD Transformers eventually
03you can't tell beforehand no
9like Beast Wars
yeah
6I'm not giving them the chance
good transformers ia okay
12^
What?
but bad is HORRIBLE
03but given how the legal system works if you just shoot them without even finding out if they have a weapon there's a good chance you'll get sued for everything you own in court
03by their relatives
03etc
I didn't write "A".
10Why does it matter if they have a weapon or not anyway? They're still intruding
12but
6by the time I find out, it could be because they've actually SHOT me, my husband, or my kid
yay
12safe than sorry
they're like the G1-3.5 Ponies.
If season two has a main antagonist it should be Bad Horse
You can't do spaces in your user name
12always go hand in hand with chilkdren
03Skylands, it doesn't, i'm just saying armed robbery is a worse crime
If you put in a space after the A, IRC doesn't care.
12-k
03and will give more jailtime XD
03anyway
03LL
Bad Horse/
10Well
03comic books aside
hey fluttershy! show me your best cheer!
Bad Horse!
03just because someone has a gun
03does not mean shooting them is the only solution
Ah,thanks for clarifying.
He rides across the nation, a throughbred of sin!
Oh hey. o.o
He got the application that you just sent in!
03if you're fast enough you can smack the gun out of their hand before they get a chance to use it
someone did a pmv of that letter-song
Question. What is considered bad Transformers?
12it's the best if they're an unwanted gues at 2am near your child's room
03then point their own gun at them :P
6ok
12Also, you don't have to kill them with your gun
That's better.:D
6I'm not fast enough
...
12fast enough
If you want a space, use an underscore instead.
Link it nao
6and I'm not strong
12if they're armed
6I have the gun
6I shoot
ok ill find it
12^
This might seem odd, but I went looking for a MLP music video using the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers theme song
03in that case I would too, but I'd shoot them somewhere that wouldn't kill them
12going by your rules, Danny
11.•10«11WB10 (Pattyrick10) 11WB10»11•. 10- [11:31] <Pattyrick> Yup, but since ArcaninOMGPONIESPOOOONNNIIIIEESS
6I'm not aiming
spaaaace!?
9Dashite: Stuff like Transformers: Cybertron
03then good luck hitting them
6if I kill or dont, I don't care
12it's like in Indiana Jones 4
6I'm shooting
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP3CwPLl9Mo
I consider Transformers: Energon bad
6well
6I'd aim enough to hit them
9yeah
9that
12"looks like you brought a knife to a gunfight"
03OK well then aim enough to not kill them :P
yeah, the Cybertron and Energons were bad.
6you do know it's easier to hit the chest than the foot right?
I think there are PMVs for most of Dr. Horrible's songs
Okay, just checking.
And they were basically among the only transformers I've ever watched.
03yes, but say you shoot them in the stomach
03that's just as easy to hit
actual song starts at :40
03that'll knock them over but not kill them
03usually
12can easily kill them tho
03well
howdy gents
03depends on how much blood they lose LOL
12stomach acid
Ohai Val
12is HIGHLY acidic
12You shoot someone in there foot or somewhere like that, they're going act like you killed them, so in reality, there’s no need to kill them :p
03I'm aware
9sup Val
6hey
howdy derma
12<redundant>
6if I shoot them in the stomach
6then ok
ohai NewDcd
Why'd he kill it?
you going back to #P&D right?
6they survive, I dont have to kill them
03OK
03well
9yeah I was wondering the same thing dari LOL
Yo Val
03are you telling me
03that once we have a kid
6but that will perfectly imobilize them
03you're going to keep a gun in our house?
12That would kill you, Roara |D
dari, too big to recover.
hello crono_flash
6how?
12maybe
03:|
12Think about it lol
6how would shooting them in the stomach kill them?
6er
6kill me
03and then that awkward moment when our 3 year old finds the gun and kills himself with it
12safety lock
03LOL
12:B
6I'd keep mine safet-
03LL
03you know childproof medicine?
03that's really adult-proof? :P
03Children are smarter than you think
03it's like
happy justice is happy
10Lock combination
12I'd rather aim for the leg or arm to play it safe
03having a button that says do not press, everyone's going to press it, right?
12then we can go the honest route
10Like they could figure that out
9oh right
03well
03they could guess
12which is YOUR preferred method
10I don't think they would
6safety lock isn't a button lol
6GUESS LOL
03no
03but I mean
10and if you kept the safe somewhere unnoticeable
03Skylands
6 4 number lock, the kid guesses and gets it
03if you keep it somewhere unnoticeable
currently cooking pasta
03then good luck pulling it out at a moment's notice
well, heating water
12Roara
I got the adapter today, drf
12if thats the case
I'm starting to get hungry
6nightstand drawer, under a couple papers
9Also guys
Just out of curiosity, what episode were the original zords destroyed in?
12that child's a genius
10That's why you keep one-
6 5 seconds to open it and take the gun out
10That
9I'm going to try to stream all of Dai-Guard during the week
Question: if the heterodyne made the South pole melt, HOW DID JAPAN NOT GET FLOODED
12^
6I've done it
alright, NewDCD.
magic
10There are drawers that can be locked BTW
6not with a gun, but I've done a similar task
Thanks for sending it to me! =D
03yes I know
"Brand new day" "everyones a hero" "slipping" "my eyes" "so they say" and the end song havent been done I think
03Pattyrick, no problem
12Sky
9I'll start it on the Mech Nights much later
03did it work?
6locked drawers tend to be a problem
no problem
6but yeh
12making it hard for the owner to access is
9as in, when we finish another, unwatched show
10I know
12counterproductive
10But for when the kid is around
Let me try it out now
Gurren, for example?
12well, yah
nvm sliping is done
or something else like Gundam X?
12Kids think guns taste good :p
10Anyway
O_o do you take requests for shows to stream?
10If your kid is going through your guys' stuff
03still
03I'd just say
9something like that
03no guns in the house
9well I take suggestions
03end of discussion
12Danny
10You guys aren't looking after your child very well
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
12locks
12and discipline
12work wonders
03well
12the latter especially
03fine, maybe they won't find it when they're 3
03but
iiiiiiinteresting
By the way was it you I was talking to about GunZ Dermathil?
03say they're an angry teenager
yeah
03they know you have a gun somewhere
03we leave the house for 10 minutes
03etc
it was me
Thought so.
6by the time the child is able to get into that drawer and potentially open the lock, it should be an age that it should learn not to
12Creepy .-.
12tangent, Danny
10So you don't trust your child?
is there a problem?
03if I had a gun in my house? I wouldn't even trust my best friend
12besides
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
12Sometimes you can't lol
It does seem to work
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
6if it's an angry teenager, then well, that's probably a time to remove the gun lol
03Told you XD
12if we discipline the child right
ok
im gonna watch some MLP now
03that's the big if
12violence shouldn't even be a concern
what Episode shall i watch?
Not sure if you can stream fullscreen games.
03I mean
12same @u
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-7SCxdWgg&feature=related.
03kids like the ones who shot up Columbine
every. single. one
eh
03do you think their parents knew they were going to steal their guns?
9you can on Livestream
03prolly not
I did make it windowed, but it crashes when you do.
9but not really on Veemi
12I have a counter
03they just acted like typical shy teenagers
only one for today
Yup, it does
12did the parents bring them up right?
12prolly not
03maybe, maybe not
03I mean
03this is one of those things
12just as you said
03if you try to teach a kid
03that guns are bad
03then they'll go
03"Then why do you have one"
03what are you going to say to that LOL
bitch just got legally pwned
Ponychan 502-ing on any of you?
6um
You could run a stream on Veemi of the stream on Livestream. XD
UST
12Ii's not a risk you should take no matter how good your kids are
Oh. Show stoppers =D
6probably the same thing we just had an hour discussion talking about LOL
12it's*
12^
Does livestream have a viewer limit or something?
6guns for defense, not offense
yeah
50
03well
Wow.
03that sounds good on paper
9unless you pay or somehow
That's poor.
12teach your child self-discipline
12and defense
that's for free accounts
03but teenagers are easily stupid
9get approved by Livestream
6the people who go out there offensively shooting, god have mercy on their soul because they should die themselves
03and could think they're doing the right thing
03like
12karate helps ironically enough
though to be fair
9but out of all the people that have applied for verification have failed
9myself included
then there's the small pay account I think with limit 150
D=
03"Oh, someone bullied me, I'm just giving them what they deserve"
That's not the sound a bear makes!
the non-main bmn streams usually don't have more than 20-30 people
9it was fair back in the day, but now for me it's a lot
03some would see that as defensive LOL
12again
12no
I hate my generation, tbh
9it's too little, I mean
12that's extreme
9I derped
12which
03it would be extreme if it only happened once
12we would teach them not to do
12Because sometimes your kids might not be in there right mind
03but you know how many school shootings there have been?
03my mom taught me not to lie
03you know how much I have to
03>_>
Well, I know that what you can do is a streamception to get more viewers.
So many weird things wrong with us it seems
12so did mine
03yeah, LL, and yet you lie to them
03:P
12yes
03so
How do you get verification then? O_o
03we can teach our kids all we want
03does that mean they're going to follow it?
03Absolutely not
12no
12but
9it's an application
9and then Livestream reviews it
TheOtakuAscended did that with BronyComms when they had more than 50 viewers for their Back to the Future stream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJINiK9azc o.O DO WANT!!!
03so let's just make this easy on ourselves and not have a gun LOL
12it's not for our lack of trying
12just your genes
/me HIDES
03wtf?
(they had 49 normal viewers and 50th was Bronycomms who was streaming their stream
with 20 people in there
9and then you get a notification whether it's
9approved or fail
But how do they decide whether to approve it or not?
12I was joking lol
Wassup
03OK
03still
03I'm getting tired of this debate LOL
9nobody knows
O_o
Hello.
10Let's end it now?
03I'd figure you would agree with me that having a gun in our house would be bad :P
03@ LL
12it IS bad
Not sure what's up.
03so why do it
HAHAHAHA
12I'm not disagreeing
how is everypony?
03there are other ways to defend yourself
03heck
T'was busy a moment ago.
03get some pepper spray
/me runs
oh
03that works from a distance
12for the safety of our family
came at the wrong time :D
03or even a taser
Then I looked away for a bit, and it seems everybody else did, too.
$350 per month
6so I can go onto actually playing my game
03I've seen sites selling tasers for $10
10Pepper spray
O_____________________________________________________o
6I'm giong to sum up my points
EEYUP
10Pfft
horry sheeeet
12old skool
Who actually PAYS for livestream?
Nah, I just have a lot of influence around here.
What the hell.
that's why I prefer justin.tv NO fee
03what's old school, pepper spray?
10While it's a handy thing to carry around
9approvals will give you unlimited viewer limit without having to pay anything though
I just went to switch my fryer on.
/me uses Pepper spray on everyone in chat
03but yeah, actually, tasers are probably a lot more ideal for home defense
10I wouldn't rely on pepper spray these days
People didn't want to say anything if there wasn't any chance that I'd notice them.
(hell, there are streams with 10K+ viewers)
9Justin.tv's streaming applications suck dick
12:3
hehehe
03useless for lots of people
10Someone could knock you out before you can spray them
9that's why I use Veemi
WHAT ARE YOU FRYING!!!!
03but if it's just one person
03it'll work
03XD
9best quality, no viewer limit, and the chat can be transferred to IRC
yeah, but I think Jtv is the most used
I imagine the approvals are based on a) how likely you are to purchase if the application fails and b) how likely this stream will be used for marketting exploits
I'm gonna fry chips.
:D
can i have some?
Or fries, for the anglicaly challenged.
12I’d just use a high power pellet gun lol
So. Rarity is best cat.
9AOYAMA WISHES TO FORNICATE
03eh
nah I be from good old blighty
03I hate airsoft guns
EEYUP
/me yawns
6-I don't have a problem with owning a gun in the house. I don't like the concept, but I'd rather not have my family harmed. I just as easily use the baseball bat I ALREADY HAVE, but if my husband wants one in the house for defense, Im ok with it
03one of my IRL friends almost lost his eye to one of those
Oh awesome
03because he and a friend were goofing around and he got shot in the eye
wrong. Twilight is best cat
be you too?
HAHAHA
why is it that the main character in these shows is always a complete bafoon?
I'm a little tired, I need to make sure this pony hits the hay early tonight lol
Which part? Scots Brony here.
Then you may continue to call them chips.
12lol
9>Akagi
It needs to have a comical component.
South west
9>Buffoon
9he's pretty badass
gn8
12That seems to happen a LOT
See yah
12that goes back to bad parenting
yeah, but he's also oblivious
03LL
9also because people like those got more heart than normal
03bad parenting on his FRIEND'S parents
03not HIS
10That goes back to irresponsible people owning guns, rather
I'm not doubting his "skills" or anything
03heck
12and his
03it wasn't even his gun
03he went over to a friend
they don't use brains.
03*Friend's house
03and friend goes "hey, check this out"
it's just what I observe to be the "Goku" effect
they just want to do the right hting
12You can't blame the parents for everything there kid does :p
03and next thing you know
9and heart is everything you need for piloting a super
pommes frites
03he gets shot in the eye
12then it's BAD PARENTING
03LL
>incredibly talented, so intelligence is used as a hamper
yeah
03Not on my friend's parents though
9I mean, he isn't a Real, y'know
12I didn't say whose
03how should he have known that his friend had an airsoft gun?
03OK
03then sure
03but
03my point being
03that I hate airsoft guns
12o...k?
03because I know someone who almost lost their vision due to one
03is that not a valid reason?
12no
I would say its valid
too much german
12because if they had been taught right
Convo with my friend
Yeah.
03it was in response to that
Dai-Guard has the body of a real, but the soul of a super.
idiot+gun=disaster
9also Akagi isn't stupid, like Goku
03well
03LL
03The thing about airsoft guns
03is that they're marketed as being toys
9he's just sort of naive
Koennen wir jetzt Deutsch sprechen!!
9and straight-forward
Me: I think I've not gotten this stuck into a fanbase since the time of my originally getting stuck into Sonic stuff. Friend: Hah, you'll never escape now Me: imokwiththis.jpg
03so parents who might not be the most educated
9but he's actually pretty smart
03might buy one for their kids thinking it's like a nerf gun
9OH SHIT IT'S THAT ONE ANGEL FROM EVA
well I would say goku is portrayed the same way
12BAD
12PARENTING
Wuh?
hehehe
12must I repeat it 50 times?
03are you going to research every single thing you ever buy for anyone?
there's an angel in evangelion that's that shape?
9SORTA
10How many times does LL have to repeat hersel- yeah
10Hiveminds, I should shut up now
12if it's something like that'
12then yes
it's the ditzyness =/= stupid debate basically
9dat tech
03if anything it's sketchy marketing at the people who make the guns who make it look like it's a children's toy >_>
I've never been this stuck in a fanbase.
DEM 3 EYES
03well
Does anyone know any mods I could use to Ponify Fallout NV?
03you'd buy a Nerf gun, right?
03if someone asked for one?
12there's prolly safety tags?
03well
03it says something like
9I'D WRECK THAT
tbh I don't think I was this stuck into Sonic as I am MLP.
9WITH A DAI-GUARD ROCKET PUNCH
0313 and up
hahaha
yeah
03the kid was 15
03etc
also, SPEARFISTO
i used to be an avid hoosiers fan
12things like those
12have caution signs
still like em tbh
03not all the time
I also followed Sonic, on a site called Green Hill Zone.
SHIELDED
03depends on who makes it LOL
but im more ponies now
12ones that can cause damage like that
Sonic just isnt relateable or likeable
03if it's some random Chinese company
Though I could be wrong, I was pretty stuck in when I was younger.
03they can get away with crap
03you'd be surprised
12thats when you either test it
12or warn your child
03OK well
And likewise here.
03all I'm saying is
/me reads
12I read Nerf gun as durf
03my friend almost lost an eye to that
12Hyper
03end of discussion
I think GHZ is still around but I haven't visited in years.
12you'll be there for a while XD
It is
12yes
I have a similar story
I just finished catching up :P
03I've seen Judge Judy cases too
Did you ever visit Sonic HQ and its Mobius Forum, by the way?
ooohh, who was your first crush/
03someone was trying to sue a friend for breaking their TV with an airsoft gun
my black lab nearly lost his eye due to a BB gun
mine was pingu
/me yawns
03and she was like, you're stupid if it's YOUR gun and in YOUR house
again the idiot+gun thing
I may have but I probably didn't sign up.
what's wrong with sonic? =/
10Now we're just arguing to argue
Skylands is just boring :P
03OK

Hey J
90 ponies with just the ones you mentioned XD
I once set it to give me the maximum number of ponies it could, and told it to make them all Pinkie Pie.
03I got a fastpass type thing at Universal Studios because I got stuck on the Jurassic Park ride
03the thing broke down
heya!
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX!
03what really pissed me off though
DAT GIRL
I LUV HER.
Is this about Desktop Ponies?
03is that I was like 10 feet from the designated ride exit
yes
SHE KNOWS HER SCIENCES
Yes
03and it's a water ride
03I was like
03I can just get up and step right there and get off...
Challenge: 200-500 parasprites.
03and they were all no, you can't do that, we'd be liable
02Looool I found Diamonts
I nearly crashed my PC.
03my parents were like, what if we take full responsibility then? and the park was still lik enope
03but
GO SCIENCE GO SCIENCE GO.
loool
03after being stuck on the ride for half an hour, they gave me a pass to get on any ride without waiting
Must say though
6dude I loved when Splash Mountain broke down on us
03and none of the rides actually took the pass from me like they were supposed to
03so it was really fun
6my friends and I had to be led through the ride on foot
03I got to go on like 5 roller coasters in half an hour XD
I melt every time I see Luna's sleeping animation.
03see, Universal Studios sissied out and made us sit there waiting for someone to help us get off >_>
6so we stopped and took a picture with the robotic hare and tortoise
Did you get that joke Dermathil?
6and got yelled at but still
03LOL

You gotta stop hitting Enter in between words, dude, it makes you very difficult to follow.

I get this: * #P&D :You must be a channel half-operator
*you

Dunno then

12._.
6chose a fairly normal stage for you to watch
somebody needs to
why?
nomnom
6since it's way to easy for me to link to some godawfully hard level
The cake is a lie
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43231 <-- thats probably going to end up on today's drawfriend
he was already n the moon
Stream's up.
Or better yet, the writers for the second and third movie
ah lol
yeah
If I explain why the fish was flung it will defeat the purpose of flinging the flung fish.
he was already on the moon
Woooo!!!
Ok.
Let's see how much this lags me. XD
kitty
KITTIES
for an action movie, the script for the third one was actually really good
I did ated the fish already
was it for something important, im sorry
fish?
FISH??
Ohai GunZ.
FEEESH!!
so I'd guess stage 2 is pretty easy?
Now that I finally have you two where I want you... *maniac face*
*normal face* I'd like to buy all your fish
6well to state the obvious: you play on one of 4 difficulties, and there are 6 stages in each (5 for the easiest difficulty)
6and each stage gets more difficult
ok
Just to check
6but yeah, general rule of thumb:
IM SORRY I DID EAT IT!!!
Can you guys actually see the game?
XD
I wish for a fish on a dish that's delish with relish in a quiche that goes squish!
hey Lati
My goldfish can neither be bought nor sold. Mostly because it gave up being solid matter long ago.
But for a Transformers movie, only the first one really felt like something
*trollface* nope
yes we could
:P
how's things?
(im sorry failsilintly, i also failed)
WB Lati
what size is your monitor dari?
/me 's name is FALL
yeh i know, its just funny, hehe
6stage 1- ridiculously easy, stage 2- easy with an annoying boss, stage 3- picking up difficulty, a somewhat challenging boss, stage 4- SO MANY BULLETS, stage 5- usually the hardest boss in the game, stage 6- still a very hard to beat boss
1920x1240 or something is my current resolution.
so technically
/me forgets what happens after that bit in the Matrix, but does it anyway
Can't remember exactly
6and it follows that pattern through the games
Oh yeah.
you wont be able to read the chatlog while playing
>: D
Nope.
:P

Wow.

D:
This is pretty good.
hmmm
*malicious snicker*
6with the exception of the 10th game, where the 6th boss EASILY outranks the 5th....but a god amount (literally)
<.<

I put all the graphics options on the game to lowest BTW.
9dari
6but that goes onto the 7th stage, known as extra mode
9you should
So if it looks bad, that's why.
6which...we'll explain later :>

It's nice that people mostly know how to spell "aperture" now.
It is GunZ

CogWeaver he has an account
You could still do what BicMac did before NiskServ kills you

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyrAkwJ6WsY&t=1m11s Pause it almost immediately.
Ok, I'll put the game back up now, tell me how much you can see.
And yes, when it pans away from rarity

12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 6Illumise.
6I hate that card
Internationally, it's Lazy Day, but in the US, it's National S'mores Day.
12=o
6but honest man death gave me SO MUCH TROUBLE
6!pokemon
13Honest Man's Death isn't that bad once you get used to it xD
6ok
6yeah
13I used to hate it, now it's kinda fun xD
theres an international lazy day?
6but it's still annoying lol
Apparently
6it's like Cirno's non spells
6easy
maybe closing skype?
6BUT FFS THEY'RE ANNOYING
How many bullets can you be hit by without dieing?
YES!YES!
6once you get hit
sounds good Rra
6you lose a life
6you have 4 lives
I was going to tell you, but meh, couldn't be bothered.
Sounds relaxing
12Hi Lati :3
my god we can see whats going on
6but can gain lives through points and picking up lives from the 3rd and 5th midbosses
hehe, i see what you did thar
it's a miracle!
13Deathbombing always makes you feel like a pro
Nothing would get done.
6^
Ever.
dat sneak attack
02^
This is impossible.
6deathbombing makes you feel like a pro
!pokemon
So it'd be like how things are anyway
Dari, close Skype.
Pattyrick, you are a 5Croconaw.
6but you know what's better?
sounds guud
6NINJAING THE BULLETS AND LASERS
Also sounds relaxing
The 18th might not be a good one for Equestria Daily. August 18 is Bad Poetry Day.
02^
13LOL YES
You don't really need it now do you?
Yeah but at least people pretend
6"OH GOD I'M GONNA DIE NOOOOOOO- I went right though that crap without knowing what i was doing"
13I swear I got hit in Mokou's last spellcard like 3 times
13but I apparently survived them all
13It was great |D
6lol yeah
HEY, lets make a poem NOAW!!
02I got hitted at least 5, lol\
Hmm.
6her hitboxes are weird
6speaking of weird hitboxes
This'd be so much easier if the game had a windowed mode.

6YUYUKO AND MARISA ANYONE? LOLOLOL
Naawww
/me 6runs
02and the extra spell of mokuo. :<
13LOL

04Play any monster Hunter before MH3 and wonder what the hell the designers were thinking with hitboxes.
6oh god last words
Dat stream
02got to the half of it
04Or just hunt a Plesioth with Dual Swords. Pain incarnate.
13I remember panicking and charging straight through a bunch of bullets

6are
13and survived
13|D
6amazingly horrible
That's a day I refuse to accept

02so true, lol
6ike, some magic gap in the bullets as they go other directiong

6"uh...I KNEW THAT GAP WOULD BE THERE"
13I hate when bullets SPAWN INSIDE YOUR HITBOX
13.w.
6oh fuuuuuu those
shakespearian one
he uses all the same
6or even worse, the ones that spawn so close that yuo HAVE the chance to get away
Apparently August is meant to make people happy, since this week is National Smile Week and next week is Friendship Week

02Angel RE-DOWNLOAD TH9
6I still glorify the person who beat EoSD's extra with no deaths
once i woke up in the middle of the night and there was a spider on my face
6LOL PoFV
13I kinda feel like a cheat though, for some reason my copy of PCB and IN already had extra mode/phantasm/last words unlocked
6that game is so fun
funky I thought you lived in Britain
13I'm playing fairly of course, only trying the extra modes after I 1cc'd normal mode myself
We don't have spiders big enoug to have health meters in this country
the can can
EXPLOSION
it was so big it was scraping along my posteEEEEWW NO blums i gonna have nightmares!
DOCTOR WHO
FallSilently: First day of Oktoberfest
13but seeing as every last word has been unlocked and completed
02I haven\t unlocked PCB's extra ._.

Oh right.

i do live it britain!
sup
MUTHER FUCKIN SOCK PUPPETS
XD when i woke up I just waited untill it crawed off and went bac to sleep
It was a house spider!!
I'm not german and don't drink.
FallSilently: It's also Constitution Day and Citizenship Day here in the US.
i vote for sock puppets
02I knooooow
You didnt do anything!!!
02Buuuut I suuuck at deathbombing

YOu went back to sleeep!!!

OSHITSON

He was gone before I mentioned them
whore
But yeah the 23rd is my favourite day of September.
Lies
woah
02Got way to used to TH8's 19384942358732465923847563 seconds to react
13Adapt so you bomb a split second before the bullet actually hits you xD
:3
13I had to adapt to it when I started playing MoF
Well what was i supposed to do? squish it on my face?
Eat it.
you're hard core
13since deathbombing is practically impossible in that game LOL
6MoF has like.... .000000000001 seconds to react
02LOL
6add a few more 0s to that
Just flick your tongue out, and pop, no more spider.
14sorry D:
overruled
D:
Yummy.
HOLD IT!
mee toooo
6deathbombing is fairly hard in EoSD too
btw, Justice is now a MECHA PILOT
cough SOCK PUPPETS cough
6I actually didn't know about deathbombing until like 2 weeks later
02EoS-- ninja'd
how big was the spider??
I have nothing against spiders when they're in plain sight.
I think spiders are kinda cool
6because it's so hard in that game
omygoshomygoshomygosh
Spiders are grand. Cute little things.
It's when they turn up in unexpected locations I go a bit nuts.
Im baaaaaaaack
it's bugs I don't like, so spiders prevent the things I don't like from being around
Dun dun dun
except turantulas
02so true lol
13Have you ever played Touhou and clearly seen a bullet heading towards you
13and you know you should bomb
those are just freakish
13and you want to bomb
13but for whatever reason
For example the time I found one on the underside of my towel right after getting out of the shower.
how do you do that thing where you're like, bleeeeep, to other people?
amusing enough for a brony, I'm actually somewhat afraid of real horses. (not really ponies mind you)
13you don't press X
13and you die
I'll try and play a quest page with this lag. :P
13._.
It might be possible.
Tarantulas are awesome. I wish I had one.
02Yes.
Hahaha!
02It's painfull, lol
6yep
I bet the budgie would love him.
6thats like
6the definition of touhou
6thinking you can make it
6and then you dont
tarantualas are indeed kinda cool
Real horses are evil...
13I kick myself so hard whenever it happens LOL
6yep
13My brain is telling me to bomb, but my finger doesn't react
13D:
I know F-Frost. Have you seen bad horse?
Real horses are bonkers.
I tend to agree F-Frost, even if, by only irrational thinking
<3 horses
6there are somethings you just cant avoid
6for everything else, there's master spaerk
6-e
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43242

real horses are huuuuuge
13LOL
hooray for irrational thoughts!
hah
oooooooh
02LOL, I'm like" HI HIGHLY DEATHLY BULLET, MAY I RUN INTO YOU?!
ok, check this out...
I've learned my lesson
ponies are pretty big too..
I'm not clicking links again
(bad joke aside)
Blums blumson
13I do that on stage 1 sometimes when I get a bit too cocky, LOL
Dinged!
YAY!!
Although that said I've noticed it seems to depend on the breed and the raising of said horse as to how bonkers it will be.
Dari you should
13Flying all over the screen around the bullets, collecting points and powerups like a pro
My arms are covered with scars from horse injuries...
02But for me.. it's like ALL THE TIME.
and indeed, hooray irrational thoughts
stream some SRWJ for us
13and I run right into a stray bullet I didn't notice
ohhell yes!
6yep
6same
at least most ponies aren't taller than I am
6you feel so legit
6getting everything
GET IT WHORE
yeah, ponies are kinda small, and seem docile enough
WHOOOOOOOOORE
6and then you run into that one bullet going .05 mph
I KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD PLAY
horses though...
I've never seen a real pony.
6OR WORSE
I KNOW I KNOW
02y do that in almost everystage .-.
6THE FAIRY WHO DOESNT SHOOT ANYTHING
02I*
02OH
02Nuuu
I just love one of the police horses I saw, it killed a rabbit and ate it, true story.
Go to Kongregrate.com, look up Mardek Chapter 1
13LOL
O.O
I made up my username then looked it up.. turns out Blums is the name of a swimwear and intimate apparel store...
02I ragequit when that happens
Play the Mardek series for us!
At least, I don't remember seeing any.
02it's like... NO...
lol Blums
13I'm laughing so hard knowing I'm not the only one who's done that
hehe
Just my luck =D
F*** being a herbivore, I do what I want!
i hav eno iea what is happening on screen
lol.
oh well, cloppy time
/me is a herbivore.. mostly
The_Si,what IS the image you posted?
he's shooting at what can only be described as clayface monsters
nite all!
6xD
6OH YAY IT WORKS
good night
See yah

6 3 HOURS LATER
Oh no wait
I share name with some russian weirdo...
6I HAVE A WORKING SA
02WHAT WORKS?
don't come back silently and make derpy evil now
guten nacht
6bring it
It was a Shire horse, not a Clydesdale.
13I remember running backwards into a boss character after going up to collect points once ._.
It was way too big to be a Clydesdale.
Shire horses, TANK!!
6I do that a lot
I wouldn't know the difference.
900kg of DOOM
02^
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Solar Flare (Update Story 2!) (http://tinyurl.com/6d7rbfz)
Basically the difference is in how much bigger than you it is.
le sigh. I'm reading like 5 stories, none of which have updated any time recently
If it's only just looming over you at the shoulder, it's a Clydesdale.
It's safe ValtheJean.You can click it.
I´ve had one running towards me, I shat bricks
13LOL
aw :(
02nah.
I got books
If its shoulder is way over your head, it's a Shire horse.
Wonderful
you have fraps dari?
she isnt that sad! her colors are still vibrant
02It's more like: GO REIMU USE TAKLE!
oh, by the by, I said hi on your page there Cogweaver
dari
dari
dari
hello
13In CtC, I swear Ran did it on purpose to me
I saw, Sketch
dari
dari
and thank ye
yup yup
6ran tolls
02TACKLE(?)*
I think so.
awww, i wonder what happened to pinkie
13you know how Chen and Ran appear with Yukari in the fight soon after it begins
6angel, have you gotten the last word spells on CtC?
wasn't me <.< >.>
maybe she did the pie joke, and no one laughed
02I need to play more Th's :< I only have TH6-9
She's sad that all the pie's gone
It's just a frame from the "Socks" comic on EqD.It's Rarity with a wierd face looking at Fluttershy.
13I went up to collect powerups and as I was coming down she appeared right in front of me
13;w;
6I've beaten meiling's, remilia's, and patchouli's
that too
6I didnt survive yukari;s
i once drew a scary pinky :D
Maybe if I knew how to draw....
02which is the name of TH10?
Basically
I havent used mine since I joined two years ago
13I've beaten those same ones too :P
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/ShireDraftHorse.jpg If it's massive, it's a Shire horse.
My main acc have been on standby for quite some time now -.-
dant... thats huge
all right, cleared a lot of space on my D: Drive
13I came so close to capturing Yukari's then got hit when I had just a little bit more to go
how are the hobbits gonna get on that¬!!
13Mountain of Faith, Ray :P
I didnt think it looked that big till i saw the lady
UNSHORN
FETLOCKS!
I really need to finish some artwork
-.-
02Oh, this will be fun
lag and lots of it
To make a long story short
it appears to have a scar too
There´s a reason we called those horses tanks...
RUNNAN ON WALLSAN nad SHOOTAN ON HEADAN
02(brb, learing how to deathbomb?)
good lord that's a big horse
lol
13I've survived nearly all of Reimu's last word spells in CtC too
13apart from the last one, I think
look at that horse, that horse is amazing..
DCD shows us exploding robots :P
and promises sock puppet
02Angel, to support my lazyness
Its just about as wide as it´s tall too...
02do you have the download link for it? :P
http://fav.me/d45xzbj <- wow. Color pencil traditional art... nice
Dari, did you lower everything to the lowest?
DCD!Y U NO ACCEPT MY STEAM FRIEND REQUEST?
13http://www.mediafire.com/?mmdnqud2rzx
/me yawns
man i could never get that smooth color with pencil crayons
Ghah, Nyx!
13I'll be honest, I just googled for that one LOL
Nyx everywhere!
Since the url begs you to fav
6I still havent beaten that game
02lol.
13I don't remember where I got my copy from, but google usually gives you plenty to choose from :3
6I don't try much anymore
what the hell is a nix
6but youmu DESTROYS ME
6EVERY TIME
Dat air tbag.
That Mario stomp wasn't very effective.
wait nyx?
wot?
oooh, whats gringing MrPoniator??
reverse tbag
eh, in name, but at least the url is short
and it lacks ponybooru's epic slowness
Yay, my new sequel is posted.
Nyx is an OC pony from the Past Sins fanfic.
...she's sitting on Celestia's head. aargh that's adorable :D
Nyx*
Good luck.
I know
13Youmu doesn't bother me much anymore o-o
OH SNAP
Also in Creeping Darkness, iirc
STAIRWAY LEVEL
02tha
13then again, I've played stage 4, 5 and 6 so many times now
I remember it
13|D
Just that the short-form links with their "fav.me/something" gringes me
dari's lying
02asdhd\d
She's spread!?
he just sucks ass :P
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: League of Extraodrinary Gamers Charity Event (http://tinyurl.com/3pfvksj)
6true lol
aaaaaaaaaah
no, Creeping Darkness was first
OBJECTION
file not found
6I can run through the first 3 stages with NOOOOOOOOO problem
aaaaah
I wont read those, I think what I am doing is too similar...
6no bombs, bo lives
What is Nyx supposed to be
We need Season 2, quick, before she gets any more accepted.
6and I can get clear to yukari's like, 2nd spell
6before I use a bomb
6then youmu walks in
13I hate nearly all the stage 3s apart from Patchouli's :<
6I picture her with a troll face these days
This game.'Nuff said.
From Past Sins
Nyx is the Nightmare Moon extracted from Luna and turned into a baby.
i havent read that yet
spoiler alert...!
You should, it's a good fic.
thats not a spoiler..
They're spoilers of like the first chapter
ok maybe not...
People can deal with it.
13On my very first 1cc of CtC, I was doing brilliantly up until Yukari
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN SHORTY!
he's just setting our expectations low
02lmao
Anything that happens in chapter 2 really shouldn't be called a spoiler.
i knew that and ihavent read it
so that way we're impressed when he wins :P
That's basic info. I haven't read it and even I know that.
13where I ran into Ran by accident
its like the blurb
brb,gotta eat
13then she took like 2 more lives off me
13then I thought "screw this"
...yeah actually I think it is in the blurb, lol
"filly NMM" is pretty much what the fic is all about.
13and somehow got to stage 6 without losing any other lives
ehehe
13which I've never done before |D
6...wow
6lol
hmmm... first bananas refrence on ponybooru came up
of course I'm probably only fanfic'ed out until something I normally read actually updates.
Sketch, do you want a hug?
13I remember saying out loud to Youmu "get out the way, I'm not in the mood for you right now"
yes
yes I do
heh
02lol.
13Well, that's not exactly what I said, but I'd be kicked if I typed it word for word :P
/me hugs Sketch ^^
13It worked though~
/me feels loved
brb
The bananas are inevitable.
well this is a pony board of friendship and magic so
On feathered wings did the same to me...
YOU GOWNA DIE DARI
YU GOWNA DIIIIIE
/me pulls everyone in the entire chatroom into one big hug
i have to go to bed
/me pokes Angel
ive got work in the mornin
13x.o
02Eeeehh.. is the patch included? .-.
yay hugs
thaaaaankyoup :D
/me enjoys grouphug. Ponypile!
hugs for everypony!
13Patch?
13English patch, you mean?
02Yep
/me readies crossbow
13I wouldn't know, like I said I just googled and found that link for you xD
Back! Baaack!
13gensokyo.org will have the patch for you though
Oh no.. we're reaching critical mass! Shoot we're gonna make a blackhole!
02to lazy to type English
*Readies crossbow* was one of the first things I saw in here -.-
XD
FallSilently is resisting! Quick, activate SADPANDA EYES
Listen up everypony! I know alot of holes they possibly could fill up in season 2!
/me chuckles
Like luna dissapearing for one?
Good heavens, Blums
13Speaking of MoF I still need to beat Suwako
1. How Luna became nightmare moon
13I haven't really tried lately =w=
already explained
Yes Blums thats a good point too
6I watched someone beat suwako at fanime
6he was pretty insane LOL
Blud, I mean
How?
6it was the opening to his panel
I do tend to ready the crossbow at the slightest provocation.
2. Why most of the population of Equestria is seemingly female?
heh
6he was like "ok, my name is so and so, and what is touhou? let me show you" *whips out laptop)
6*
she was all sad and resentful that everyone shunned her night, so she became her sorrow manifest
*Snerk*
13LOL
That was never explained in the series
ep1?
well.. its a girls show =P
Most male ponies kill themselves when they see the happy pastel hell they've been born into.
I think it's kinda like China
yeah nightmare moon was covered in the beginning of ep 1
they must have a colt policy
yeah Boss
6now then
see? told you he was just lowering our expectations :P
02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
keep the population of colts down per capita
6I have a working game
02Angel ANGEL
ohai moria pillars
3. Its possible Pixie would return to take revenge on Twilight Sparkle
02you are awesome, lol.
Yes,
6Imma play to see if I can actually learn the other teams
Trixie
Trixie
02The link. has the OST\
6I want to see whch would be best before going up to utsuho
02not the game, lol xD
Trixie I mean :(
*trixie fanfare*
6the game itself doesnt bother me actually, I find it and EoSD the easiest
13wait what
13|D
6WHCH IS WEIRD I KNOW
Celestia is a harsh matriarch. The colt population is kept under strict control. Rarity keeps hers in a pen beside her house.
13LOL
Tell em about the goblin army
13Roara is different
6wait
13:D
indeed. Tis a sad world for colts in equestria
6that link had the ost too?
6oh
Pull a carriage, work in the guard, work on a farm. Or gtfo
6just the ost
6nvm
They're occasionally allowed out to drag snowploughs.
Were there any colts in earlier gens...?
but hey, plenty of fillies
Chop down a tree.
6I was gonna say, SMALL GAME FILE WTF
Yeah, there must be some explonation why there are so few colts
There were, yes.
Oh god the horror of being an early gen colt...
Early gen colts had it good
you know, I've tried to watch some of the old gens on Youtube. just for the flanks and saddles. But yeah. it's bad. really pretty bad
6you know
Spike was in the earlier gens, and the cracks in his sanity were very visible.
I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
6NO ONE uses aya as a partner in SA
wb
/me 6does so
they seemed normal albeit maybe being segregated from the fillies for long periods
Thanks Winter-puff
Yes, the swe dubed spike is... o.o!!
Blums: Word of God said some external force was ALSO corrupting Luna. Also that Trixie won't be back.
Yeah right dari
13There must be a reason why :P
They've released a Swedish version now?
External forc? where did you hear that?
Anyone have a youtube link?
13I personally don't like her ability
http://img.ponibooru.org/images/31/31a5932978b2f8090d4f4dbff4e4a778
What do you mean"Trixie wont be back"?
You know, fanfic seems to paint trixie as eventually having a change of heart or a goodness inside her. But I kinda doubt it.
6being super fast?
SOCKS!!!!!!!!!!
GREAT WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT DARI
Lauren Faust herself said that was the idea @ external force.
I just think, if she came back, she would still be a jerk
No, the earlier gens is dubed
er..sure
dari sucks donkey balls
13since you don't really need all that speed when you're spending most of the game being surrounded by bullets |D
We say that you're gonna die.
6yeah
uh oh
6I prefer speed tbh
6whch is why I refuse to be reimu in EoSD
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
02I prefer being slooow
Ah. Would have surprised me if it was this quick.
HYES
^
13I have better control over slower characters, hence Reimu xD
lol
And probably cause the fans like Lyra, Ditzy, Vinyl I am pretty sure there will be episodes about them as well
13Also homing amulets
13<3
maybe they should hit her with the elements of harmony
but you know, gotta look at the nicer side. I did recently read a Gilda fanfic that did actually get me on her side. Amazing what fanfic can do
02which is why I use Youmu in TH9/Reimu on every other TH
Hi RainDancer
6LETS BE A TENGU, SEE IF WE CAN CHEAT THE SYSTEM
6simply because
Heya
6I'M A TENGU
6ok
6when Ten Desires is released this weekend
6I'm being youmu

6that's been decided for a long time

Sketch, ``Starting on the 7th, I'm going to be going on vacation. This either means I will have a lot of relaxation time to work on TNTNE, or I will have no time between family stuff. I'll be gone till the 11th, so we'll see then.''

Yeah. It's a saddle used in battle.
lol

Or worn outside of battle but is still battle saddle.
So nothing's streaming?
/me is now suddenly reminded that he's of the "older generation" of bronies >.<
OH WHAT THE FUCK DARI
TOO FAR
Or just not worn, like left on the ground somewhere, but is still battle saddle.
why are we talking about pony weaponry?
Valthejean wat do u mean 'older G' of bronies?
Xiagu: Well, those are one option, especially with stainless steel-and-leather mouth-guards for handles.

Because we can

I like the idea of buck-knives. like the knives that pop out of the back of shoes? except for the back hooves of ponies

Except the ones who are dead

battle saddles?
But sharp wires strung between the hindhooves could work for pegasi, or saddle-bags filled with javelins (just to a roll over the enemy, beyond reach).
Dari - 2 chrome themes. not much

indeed, I am implying that :P
How many people have read "Beyond the Fourth Wall"?
the trick is knowing when it goes off ;)
I'd like to dualboot linux, I don't know how, or even if I can though
And what
Don't do it
Bad idea

Dari, it will go off when the stream stops.

My mistake, it's actually called "The Breaking of the Wall".
Do you think ponies are big enough to ride?
buy a twilight plush and read with that Fish609?
Actually, Lightning gave me the idea
Mmm delicious stats

Don't listen to him
or are they big like, a pony.

Oh
/me drinks sweet tea
I always thought the ponies the size of horses....and now that I think about it, they're really big. ._.
Confusing names
boi, don't you go questioning my methods
And I'll listen to "him" as you refer to it, as much as I want
ponies are smaller than horses, but still pretty big
google it up
I need your body intact in order to ra-...I mean bury you
13Oh my God I did it again, what is wrong with me ._.
03anyway yeah
What'd you do?
03dualbooting Linux is actually really easy
not too big though, only come up to about my chest
Val, check P&D. DId I say something?
03as long as your hard drive is big enough to hold both operating systems
Stream's back up
well I know how big a pony is but that still is a ton larger than I imagine them. If you compare fluttershy to angel bunny she is not that big.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bRca8BsNKM&NR=1
How big does it need to be?
Considering the overall size of the ponies in relation to the objects they interact with, I think it's safe to assume the ponies in the show are about the size of iRL ponies, height wise at least.

Why not use LiveCDs to save space :P
Sathi - it loaded.
OMAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Over 30 GB?
ah
03a couple GB
03no
7pfew
BEST. IMAGE. EVEEEEEEEEEEER.
7was worried a moment
03probably 2-3GB at the minmum, I recommend 10 or 15
/me is zoomed in on luna, and has been for like 1 min.
13Closed a tab that was uploading a large file to MegaUpload
Oh, then I have lots then
I think they're small. I assume Angel Bunny is about the size of a normal rabbit.
This isn'
03OK
SOOO GOOOOOD and not even on other yet
13I'm not even reliable with uploading files anymore :<
03basically, the Linux CD should come with GParted, you use that to shrink your Windows partition down by a few GB
Aw AE, that sucks
But does Luna have enough internets to download it
03then install Linux to that empty space
It is called "My LITTLE Pony"
I think the apple scale was more reliable - an entire apple can easily be munched up by a pony.
Jackrabbits arent that short when they sit up
For example
(Luna, try Chrome OS/Chromium OS for Linux :P)
so which doctor series is this? the good one or the one I pretend is good to troll dari? :P
BLINK AND YOULL MISS is what I'm looking forward
13If I accidentally close this tab again I'm gonna shoot someone and blame it on them .w.
Val, this is the Ecclestone one
First series.
Unfortunately, where I bought my laptop, they would only give me the CDs unless I paid them to set up the computer for $100
Eccleston is good.
(though I prefer Tennant)
Oh yeah. Fluttershy is my favorite.
Luna you talked for once in the chat.
owo
There's just some cartoonish deformation of proportions is the thing.
Why are you always so quiet?
well can you imagine it if angel was properly sclared to fluttershy? she'd squish him by accident
Yeah
Tennant is best doctor
03LOL what
same
I wonder why
I guess I don't have anything to say o.o
:p
03do you have a CD burner though?
I want to make sweet freinship with Fluttershy.
can't. stop. listening. to. verses. of. pony. swag
Yes
03you can just download the image file and burn it
uh oh
Alright
If that makes sense.
Actually
Anyone else listening to Equestria Radio?>
03As for what version of Linux, that's entirely up to you
03I USED to suggest Ubuntu, but I hate the new ones
UH OH
One minute drf, just a random question
03OK
Hey DRF, what terrible Linux distro do you think she should use :P
WRONG DAY OR YEAR
03LOL
Ponify.me?
you know, I haven't yet listened to equestria radio
Welp, just read another grimdark fic
xubuntu?
you mean celestia radio?
I think all the main ones are horrible, IMO
03I dunno, Fedora seems alright
must rememdy that here eventually
:p
Guess I could finally dig into Past Sins tonight
yeah thats what i meant
Partedmagic as a desktop OS= Profit
Read "Of Mares and Magic"
"Sweet music, Oooosweet music. I like the sound when you're around. Sweet music, oooo sweet music!"
my favorite so far
what about Everypony radio?
blarg, didn't end up likeing Of Mares and Magic too much. but it was good
03LOL
But it's also fun as nobody supports it
Of Mares and Magic?
Of Mares and Magic was decent. But not more than that.
I was PO'd until the epilogue came out lol
BAD WOLF
I prefer the ballad of twilight sparkle, its funnier
I was thinking ubuntu, isn't it free?
holding off on Past Sins for some reason. It's like that movie you -know- is good. You've heard is good. everyone is talking about it. But your waiting till it's on video?
So yay finding 'packages' for updates
Ohgod ubuntu
Yeah, Ballade is better
03All Linux versions are free except Red Hat
And I have a 4.7GB DVD-R, is that big enough?
Aah
Doens't anybody talk about ano other Distro
And yes
Big
Way too big
I think I just can't get behind twixie
twiluna ftw
I'M BACK!

>>that
/me notices typoes, puts on glasses x.x
aside from rarispike

lol which one is flutertrix?
03LOL
03yeah, you only need a 700MB CD
wut
Will dig it up
Well then
Maybe I don't want to waste it on that then
03you can also use a flash drive
03do you have a spare flash drive?
that works
ugh gotta finish this book then read more fanfic
Oh, that fic is [Normal] and [Shipping], but has [Sad] in it?
Thanks
03there's a program called UNetBootIn
03look it up
[Fic][Shipping][Safe] http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/story-kindnesss-reward.html
03that actually does all the work for you XD
DAT SHIP
And why the heck does every fan fic have lesbian ponies in it>
omg I would so put that on my ceiling @ Dash
Eh, guess I could give that a shot sometime, but I'll read Past Sins now
03you just put the flash drive in, tell it which drive and what version of Linux you want
03wait a few minutes
03and profit
7So, LL, how's your computer?
If your computer supports it
:}
Wut is this?
what exavtly is the [Normal] tag for anyways
Because the cast is almost all female.
Fish, no males in equestria
because 98% of the pony population is female
03:P
03and got rid of the virus

03instead of renaming it
03I just DELETED it LMAO
DAT ALTERNATE TIMELINE

03I just killed the process, then deleted it
I mean what SHOW is this?
DOCTOR WHO

Big mac gets shipped the most out of everypony
Skillz

Ok.
I read a Caramel + Big Mac shipping once ><

03so I did right click, properties
We'll watch every episode, yeah.
Silvermane - I'm ridiculously open about being a Brony - all my friends know.
03found it was in C:/Users/[LL]/AppData something or other
03then just deleted the 9exe file
03-9
03that let me use it long enough to install malwarebytes which fixed the rest of the problems./
Holy cow

EqD is over halfway to 26mil hits.
Silvermane - showing
03this is how I made my money back in high school

I though EqD had 25 million a couple days ago?
06And i though it was selling your body for 1cent/pop
i cant tell if it just always counts up at a set pace

there was this one seagull who stole some Doritos out of a store in... England, I think

That ever present reminder. The dark thoughts slowly ebbing away at the light.
Creepy...
poor little beast
Bacon time.

ValtheJean,can you explain this?"can you hear me stroking that picture of you?",you said earlier.
Dashite You are entirely correct
12it casually walked into the store, the chips were right next to the door, it snatched the bag and ran out

"A lunatic may be 'soothed,' as it is called, for a time. But in the end, he is apt to become obstreperous. His cunning too is proverbial and great. If he has a project in view, he conceals his design with a marvelous wisdom; and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study
of the mind. When a madman appears to be thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high time to put him in a straightjacket."

Anything interesting.

I personally love the style of the game, the characters, and the story, but I dint get to say it often because a certain someone always laughs about that >.>
13I have a friend
13erm, "friend"
13who is so narrow-minded
13and says that Touhou just looks plain unfair
13and refuses to try it LOL
Lol
burn your computer
Problem solved
UNIT!
Il upload the PDF files for you
13I wouldn't mind so much if he at least tried it

13but meh, he's missing out~
Nah, already got it open again

I don't care if my friends dont want to try

I just enjoy it myself

So that's all I care about
welp
OH SHIT SON
13True LOL
Well, I've tried it, but my sister said I suck
13I was pretty desperate a couple years back though
13I seriously lacked people to talk about it with
Welp, it is now official
I don't mind the music, though it comes out of my sister's room so often that I'm sick of it
13so i tried getting people into it
Dari has the hots for Pegacorn
13I succeeded with a couple of people, but that's about it
/me pokes Angel, "has the upload finished? .-."
Luna, when i tried, I failed miserably
dari's fetish is angry pegacorn?

Why are you uploading it angel?

13then you and Aero and everyone found Touhou, and I was eternally happy |D
Have him just download it lol

Well bromigo.. when it does get hectic its hard to follow anything
no problem
13First Touhou-related thing I ever saw was a video of scans from one of the doujins or something
13then I had a friend who linked me to Marisa Stole the Precious Thing
So is anypony else riled up by this Verizon restricting tethering thing?
13and yeah |D
^^^^
yeah that's a load of BS
I hardly ever tether mind you, but the fact that they are doing it is really pissing me off
I guess if I had actually listened to aero, I would played touhou like a year before
tether?
But I was too lazy lol
what be that?
suddenly forehead zipper
It's where you use your mobile phone as a modem.
Tethering is a term used when you set up your smartphone to be a wifi hotspot
Basically.
oh
Dari,I NEED ANWSERS!
yeah, that sucks
you use your phone as a modem for your computer
basically
so you can connect your laptop/whatever to your cell and use 3g for your internet
My understanding is that some providers have taken a disliking to it.
13The first time I ever saw Touhou gameplay, I remember thinking it looked boring and I wondered why it was so popular
yes
I'm just messing around for the lulz.
brb, switching to iPod
As I said. :P
OHSHEET
now Verizon, being stupid, is saying that they want to charge you extra for tethering
Oh, a couple of my buddies do that
especially companies that provide both phone and internet
all the providers in canada and the us are tyring to put in caps for internet usage
7what the...
7dat laugh
13of course, the reason I downloaded it in the first place was to see if it was as boring as it looked to me
13then I was hooked |D
SHIT JUST GOT REAL SON.
The first game play I saw was mokou, I was scared
We already have them here in the UK.
Your on ugly motherfucker
which is rediculous. If you are paying for the data, what right do they have to say how you distribute it on -your- hardware
Ah, so the fuzz is about paying exta for that?
:O
verizon realizes that some hacker will figure out how to bypass whater security they put in place

they are double charging you for the same data because of functionality that they did not invent
no, not expendable extra!
That sucks
7suddenly LRAD
Dat seizure
Technically the data is not the same.
they make the argument that tethered users use a lot more data. Fine. but if you are using a capped plan their argument is irrelevant
FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
it's capped, who cares how I use it
Dat titledrop
it is and it isn't, depends on what you are doing

In the UK, turning your router into a wireless hotspot for BT gets you money back from BT
but so does my phone when I use AndChat
TO THE NEXT PART
mmm time-dilated doctor who
lol
ALSO, STOP THE SKIPPING SHIT
it's because tech savvy super nerds
like myself
would buy unlimited cell phone plans
and then just tether
thus avoiding paying for additional internet access
LOOOL.

I'm pretty sure it's more then "Messing around" dari.
but I basically chat and read the news on my phone, and occassionally pandora. I really don't do much to "screw" verizon
they're a corporation
oh wow, I didn't realise how easy Twilight's cuttie mark was to draw on her... I thought it was going to actually give me trouble lol

you "screw" them, just by existing and not being their slave

What you try'na say Pegacorn?
lol, you are probably right bromigo
they are making you pay for something they cant even provide service for
exactly
dari,don't lie.Lying is bad.
dat PREVIOUSLY ON
it's unethical to charge for something you did not create or have a hand in
ummm
verizon provides internet
outside of cellphones
so does AT&t
12how oges
12goes
true, but they did not make tethering apps
or the phone's ability to tether

and we are already paying for 'net access
OOO new episode?
Dman PART TWO
It's basically poor planning on their part at the end of the day.
Fuck, my stream is being a dick
They didn't expect people to use their phones that way
hey DCD, are you there?
I think i know what you're REALLY thinking dari.
7wut..?
Hence they didn't plan for the extra network traffic
WHY WONT YOU PLAY DAMMIT!?
SMEXY PICKLE
prince-trolli
So now they have to find a way to deal with it.
Trololo
Well if they find some disticnt reason to give you another bill...
THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER
THEY ARE ALL LINKED
GGgala oh snap!
I dunno. Like I said, people on their phone already Hulu, youtube and pandora all day long
it's auwn
well, maybe dari will know
how much more data are you really using when you tether?
so dari
exactly blums
Yeah?
Perhaps, but they're doing that on connections optimised for a phone.
DAT PIC
remember earlier today when DCD mentioned...*shudder* a certain person who recently announced being a brony?
lawl Mickey
heya bronies
And they're getting heavily compressed data.
02So good

Simple
it is possible this is him
What are you talking about ValtheJean?
pegacorn, you don't want to know
When you browse the internet on a PC, you're using a user agent that requests the PC version of everything you go for.
additionally bronies: sorry for the rant topic :/
Gonna go at sa again
rants are fun
?
Parseeeeee y u so annoying
ah, fair enough there, I did not think of that

02All right
And pages for PCs are bigger due to larger stylesheets and images and lack of compression.

AHAHAHA
DOHOHOHOHO
12hmm
Oh God.

Not him.
but...it could be
and I'm concerned
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
concerned that he found ponychan
and has thus tainted it
/me is showing a nonbrony CMC talent show =D
>tainted
that baby alien...thingie...is terrifying
Implying it was good in the first place.
:P
I DO want to know ValtheJean.
There is an absolute crapton of optimisation going on in the background when you're browsing the net on your phone or using a mobile app.
not really sketchy
Why does my stream REFUSE TO WORK!?
quick question
FINALLY
S.O.S
SHOOT ON SIGHT
Am I the only one who sees Scootaloo as an ophan?
there's...a particular sonic fan who...let's just say is bad....who is potentially on ponychan
again, I'm not outright acusing him
Bye guys,seeya tommorow.
because it's possible it's someone else
fair enough there Sketchy
Sonic fan?

i've never seen this Dr who and I'm terrified to know about wtf is going on here
Dammit, I missed how Dr. Who made it out of the conference room...
yay drawfriend
It depends on how lazy the designer of a site or whatever is, bro
sadly, like about 99% of Granada, Spain, he doesn't really use the web
about damn time
Back
Some designers will just be very lazy and only make a mobile stylesheet
;o
aka knows no memes / pop culture / anything
Just facebook and youtube
That only works though if your site is well coded.
I hate my computer
but hey! show's coming to spain soon, so glad he's liking it :D
Why does the stream keep stopping!?
GRAAAAAAHHHH
Maybe I'm streaming at too high kbps for you.
heh, I guess my argument is more about capped data plans. Sure, my tethered pc will get more data. but my data is still capped, why do you care how I use what's under that cap?
I could lower it, see if that'll help.
except to be money-grubby
The more thoughtful designers will also look into making sure the thumbnails are set to compress to a nice small size so that using their site doesn't consume all your data.
Also, can anyone enlighten me as to how the Doc made it out of the conference room?
^^^^
that
yes
Denied, you mean the electric trouble or the guys with guns trouble in the conference room?
loool
hmm
nice job at improvising
try it dari
And yeah, that's an excellent point Sketch.
time to change ISP i think
Ok.
no wait
was about to say then thumbnails and embeded files and programs are compressed
13Ray, you there? :3
The Electric part
Stream's back up.
I have no ISP
your talking about mobile internets arnt you?
I think the ISPs work together on their plans... at least they seem to adopt the same policies near the same time
He pulled off the ID card.
And put it on one of the slitheen.
Yep @ DesertRose

And the others?
or something

They're all linked.

So they all got shocked when he put it on one.

Ok Denied_Existence.
See if this is better.
but yeah, mebbe is time to change to Sprint
play it colt
qualitee noticably lower : /
but I'm afraid they will do the same thing soon
but hey! it's fine!
But yeah. Certainly charging you for the ability to tether makes no sense if your monthly data usage is already capped.

gentlestallions?
13And good luck~
It only makes sense when your usage is unlimited, because then as you pointed out you will use a crapton, and if a lot of people do it the network won't handle it too well.
thanks x.x
I forgot that even in easy

You ain't seen nothin yet.

Ah, yeah...forgot about getting out.
who here likes fluttershy besides me?
eeyup
I think you mean Pinkie Pie
/me is a FLuttershy fan
I dont like fluttershy =D
I'm ok with Fluttershy. She's middle packish for me
DeniedExistence, is it better now?
Yeah
Fluttershy? Thats a weird way to spell Rainbow Dash
13Ok, PM time
But to be honest I like pretty much all of the cast.
j/k, though she is last on my mane 6 list
Polarfire
Sometimes high quality kills the stream for some people.
I like quiet people
We gotta talk to ya Polarfire
Too much bandwidth required.
: /
Fluttershy has masses of moe factor
Polrafire
the animal loving/hippie side of her is meh thogh
though*
Rainbow Dash? Is that a nickname for Applebloom?
Also, I warred for almost all my territory gain
In order. Rainbow Dash> Rainbow Dash> Rainbow Dash> Twilight> Apple Jack>Pinkie Pie>Fluttershy>Rarity
lol
The Fire of Polra
ugh, how does he decide what goes on the drawfriend
applebloom? wow, there's even pedoponies.
“Rainbow Dash> Rainbow Dash> Rainbow Dash>” ?
Psyentific - are those shots from the game that you needed names for ships for?
“Rainbow Dash> Rainbow Dash> Rainbow Dash” ? *
Wb LL
Yes
Yep
northern flame
Ahahaha
Also, I have like 50 Ironclads
arctic ember!
how can the same pony be better than herself?
RainbowDash? Oh you silly pony, thats not how you spell Luna
Flame of the North star
it makes no sense
So that's the game that has the good ships Salad Sandwich and Sketchy Sounds among your fleet then XD
Yep
Rainbow Dash is so awesome that she automatically gets the first three places
antarctic inferno
Though they may or may not be resting in the Chesepekedue to a botched naval blockade
having one of the cmcs be one of your favourite ponies doesnt make you a pedo
winter heat
so is one instance of her actually Rainbow Dash (20% cooler) or something?
Chesapeke Bay*
:<
Anyway getting off of ponies for a sec, anyone here a Coheed and Cambria fan like me?
Yeah
Sorry.
sometimes
depends
Don't worry. We can rebuild them. Faster. Stronger. Better.

Technologic <3
that friggin doll haunts my dreams
lol
I heard that song sampled in a kanye song and it just made me mad
12tys and hai
its very uncanny valley
I like the Peaches No Logic remix of Technologic.
I was mad at first.. but then. You know what. If Daft Punk is ok with it. I am too
well
Trash it, change it, mail - upgrade it,Charge it, point it, zoom it, press it,Snap it, work it, quick - erase it,
actually
dat phone pic
Write it, cut it, paste it, save it,Load it, check it, quick - rewrite it,Plug it, play it, burn it, rip it,Drag and drop it, zip - unzip it,
(i heard the kanye song before the DP song)
I quite liked RObot Rock as well.
:(
ok thats enough of that
I love Robot Rock
the live version is -amazing-
1200 MEGAPIXELS of blurriness

Aerodynamic is good as well.

INTERESTING STRATEGY
lol ownd
Comp Sci major here
That would be awesome.
Comp sci is too complicated for me man
jesus
hard sciences sort of suck for jobs though
Eh. It's satisfying as all get out though.
Yeah theres about 3 job vacancies for my course
and they are all with nasa so thats one hell of a journey for a job
i see you like ending sentences in though too though
comp science is too theoretical imo
Wrestling with a computer for a week straight, then FINALLY getting it working is the best feeling.
doesn't teach practical programming, what you really do
you could always try reformatting
I'd agree.
if its windows
Cloudgazer, why would you sign on with Nasa?
That ship is sinking.
although the data structures class I took was useful, but not much else
Go private, or go with the Europeans or something.
02lmao
any one wanna talk about bg ponys
They are sinking apart from the 9 proposals that they have for new reusable deep space craft?
"Then what should I do"
Best background pony is applejack
03?
(dont hit me)
^^lol
They axed the shuttle without having a replacement in service. That seems like a bad move
Plus, I just don't have a good feeling about them.
background pony
NASA!
DAT LINE
since when wa applejack demoted?
Starlancer: satalites don't require maintenance, right? lulz
They had it up for being axed for a year
FTW!
it was meant to be closed down last year
CHILLING
and I LOVE it.
Applejack is one of the Mane Six!
They had to finish the ISS first
satellites*
XD
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that all they have is proposals.
what's the point of the ISS if we can't get to it?
Satellites need to be boosted every now and then due to trace atmosphere
whats demoted mean
Yep
hehe g'day all..
thats how they are getting up there right now
Okay, this is confusing and I want my name back
YEs
pinkie: some authority was revoked
ok
uhhh.. to have their standing changed to a lower rank
in this context, it means a character became less important
And NASA isnt just spaceflight
9sup Stripes
yeah
I want to work with the telescopes
Cloudgazer: well yeah, but that's russia, and not the US -.-
can we talk bg ponys alredy
someponies are apparently saying Applejack was demoted from a Mane character to a background pony
(apparently) *
Colgate is best background pony
9O SHIT
Berry punch is best bg pony
You gon' die.
EXTERMINATE!
Roseluck is the prettiest bg pony
EXTERMINATE!
derpy is the best bg pony
what dis?
9ROSE
not alot, enjoying the dr
hugs?
9PUNCH THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
Cloudgazer: hmm, apparently I missed that, I guess canceling the space shuttle program isn't so bad then
they're all good ponies
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.gif
Princess Luna is the best BG pony
…WTF
Lyra, Berry, Bonbon, Cherilee
Luna should be a minor character!
And proposals in space flight have a habit of clearing up quickly
Shh no spoilers.
Agreed, but right now she's BG
I mean you got from the wright brothers to the space shuttle in like 60 years
oh, so I called it right?
>:(
(never saw the episode)
I'm just saying, no spoilers.

Put it in "Public" and then right-click and "Copy Public URL"
At least we know it was a pony, not a rock or squid or eldrich abomination
Just name a folder Public and take off from there?
No, your DropBox account should have a "Public" folder already
Did someone say eldritch abomination!?
No.
Oh. Awww.
no, nopony said tht

SillyNilly in your Dropbox folder there should be a Public folder with a special icon. If not, I suggest creating it.

It wasn't there when I looked for it, but from a forum I managed to create a public folder. Hopefully it works.

There we are...Hello everypony.
Greetins fellow pony
good evening, everypony.
02Omg
Hello
Hi guys.
9like such
/me sips some wine and says "Octavia... play us a song won't you dear"
hihello
I don't actually have wine
I do!
holy shit a giant hookah
Well lucky you
Hello Octavia
I have some boxed wine...
I have some chardonnay, it's awful.
All I got is water.
Oh yes, I have some boxed wine too... somewhere
Chardonnay is disgusting.
I keep up a modest spreadsheet of links
https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq4Tk5XdBHBIdDZ1eGdkU3NteEk0dktqSHl3b1VDcXc&hl=en_US#gid=0
that is true
well...and some soda....
I need mroe pony cancer though
Boxed wine? Truely, is that even good?
enver enough
vintage yesterday mountain blue voltage.
02Such a cute Braviary picture
I don't drink wine so I'll say.... YES
I think it's about getting drunk.
good night everypony, sweet dreams!
Octavia: no, not really, but it is dirt cheap for the alcohol content -.-
I'm more of a spirits / premix type of drinker
link
Like, wine has an alcohol content of 10%+, usually.
Beer is like, 4.5-6.

So, if you want to get drunk faster, wine!
Vodka is like 40%+
same Jazza, I mostly drink liquers
02Maybe just cute in my eyes though XD
Beep :3
Or Jäger.
03that's not cute at al
OH GOD
03*all
Jesus no
03that looks creepy
it's marahute <3
/me makes a face.
02IKR? <3
vodka is what I drink when I want to get drunk fast
03marwhat
from rescuers down under
Yeah
I go for Jäger and cheap wine, but whatever, I'm not an alcohol snob.
02The golden eagle
I'm in it to get drunk.
I turned up at a party 3 hours late and binged vodka just to get drunk
Jesus what

Mmm, cinnamon.

When sober

You are face down in the dirt?

OE weaponry?
My friend has a habit of going to taco bell when drunk.
I have an older brother/sister, so it was drilled into my head constantly -.-
Forgot the purrple?
9Applied Plebtonium in this universe I guess
My sister let me learn the hard way.
03LOL
I had to drive him once. he knows he's gonna regret it, but you can't talk him ot of it.
03I know right
03though according to wikipedia
03they intentionally made it have lots of double entendres
it's anime science, they ain't gotta explain shit
9well
03it was intended to be just for their own laughs
03and someone leaked it XD
03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_%28TV_series%29#The_.22adult.22_version
LOL
9that was the last episode for tonight
03now I just want to find that clip in better quality
9Please Remember we'll start a new Event on Saturday Nights
New event?
orly?
I like new events
9Brony Giant Robot Saturday Nights
OHSHI- perfect timing panda arrives
every time I look at the mlp drink sheet, I always say I'm going to make one of those sometime
and then I never do, because I never have the stuff to make the drinks
that was great
Hey Paul.
9and that's it for tonight
what's with recycling hot springs footage in the next-time?
coo', coo'
and then I forget later, and never buy the stuff
Hey
oh after the movie night?
cool
9Saturdays, 9:30 PM EST
9it's the only way I can keep streaming in BronyState
9as that time window is the only one I have available
9Saturdays, I mean
Tis understandablee
9do you guys want to hear the line-up?
spelling fial.
Sure
yesplz
lol
Transformers will be in there in some fashion, calling it
lol
9Well, we're starting with Gundam X
Hi
Same with Gurren Laggan
9followed by Eureka 7
Hooked on Drugs worked for me! 1-800-ABCD-LSD
9followed by Gravion
02FEATHER <3
9followed by Big O
9followed by Megas XLR
HI PYROH
HELL YES
9two episodes of each show
And now DRF leaves
...hey Pyroh
:P
HI!
03LOL
:3
03no
Liking the schedule so far...
03I'm here :P
big tOmatOes! aw yeah
9additionally, several mech movies will be streamed during these nights
For once when
Ohai HML2
I need to study my Megas
Megas XLR >>>>>>>> Whatever the crap I previously said
9for the inauguration show
Die
9we'll have Macross: Do You Remember Love?
/me shoots HML
9for you nostalgia Junkies that grew up on Robotech
what about that new cartoon... bio-something?
9sym-bionic titan?
9not a bad idea
9not a bad idea at all
yeah that
Question: Are there any live-action mech movies outside of Transformers around?
I know there's Real Steel coming out the weekend of my Birthday
so... am I the only one who uses empty liquor bottles as decorations?
9remember that these series will eventually be over
we can see the latest and the oldest all together
9so the lineup will go changing every once in a while
02The HML clone was really a secret agent holding Espeon hostage!
Tis understandable
9what I don't know
Hell, I got all three seasons of Megas on my HDD already, plus soudntrack
...
9is something I still got to decide
9okay
9there are shows like Gravion
but it's only anime and no tokusatsu?
I fill mine with Melted tree's
Does that count?
9it's only Giant Robots
02Anywho gotta restart the comp
I know, but I dealt with him :>
9Tokusatsu is for my preshows yo
I guess that makes sense
9plus I'll eventually host Toku Events
9just got to find the time for it
uh, what's a melted tree? o.O
the best use for AOL discs I've heard of.
9anyways
9shows like Gravion
paper
Duh
AOL discs made for good coasters
9it has a 13-episode first season
9then there's season 2, Gravion Zwei
although my current coaster is a hdd platter
9I'm wondering whether to just have S2 take these show's timeslots
Same with Big-O?
Hey
9or take the timeslot for something else, and later on stream said S2
Just be careful if it's made of glass
What are Moltov's made of?
9basically doing seasonal play here as well
Blums: the hdd platter???
Apparently I didn't go to bed at all
9not waiting a whole season for a continuation, mind you
yeah
some of them are made of glass
9but something around the same lenght
9*length
9air it in the time slot
Or, I tried, but couldn't get any sleep even after a hour of waiting
9and later on replace it with S2 of the original show
9which do you guys prefer?
9back-to-back, or season play?
I don't think I've ever seen that.
uh, it is very much metal, and I have never heard of a glass hdd
Hmm...
well.. it acts like glass when it breaks
Well, that sounds like a serious design flaw
I'm partial towards back-to-back, but I know all to well what it means to have too much of a good thing
So
can glass even be magnetic?
9the first option allowsus to enjoy a full run of a show directly
hi Flareon
I'm not sure how many times I'll be able to be here for it, so
its nto actually glass but breaks like glass
9the second option allows us to have a bigger variety of shows
how are you?
good
you?
You know, I think more variety might be a good thing
well, as long as I don't slam things on it, I think it'll be fine
why wold they make an HDD that breaks like glass?
...
We're a fickle bunch, us bronies. Not everything is always to our tastes, aha
Bye
!lullaby
HDD aren't supposed to be treated like that anyway
/me carries Pyroh off to bed
/me tucks Pyroh in and hums a lullaby
feeling ok. Just got through reading more on the riots in UK and came on here
Who has quit?
Well, we're screwed.
?
It's just a side effect, Hdds arent made to be broken...
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps Paintsplash
Blums: true that, but it was giving me the click of death, so decided to make something uesful out of it :D
9I'm also thinking of adding Beast Wrs o the lineup eventually
yeah, switching up between seasons i like
9that, as well as Getter and Shin Mazinger
Beast Wars, yesssss...
9Gurren Lagann and EVA will only make appearances with their movies
9they're too manestream to air the full shows xD
Huh.
03xD
you mean the Rebuild movie right?
My tumblr post about the use of 'brony' has actually started a discussion http://doctormowinckel.tumblr.com/post/8703583063/the-term-brony

The two ponies in the balloon are clearly visible now
Yeah I wasn't here all day after the image was posted so I missed all the rampant speculation
Not sure if giant

I thought they were just OCs

but they vectorized it themselves

It was done by Nayuki and another layout artist

SillyNilly, do you mean for the strokes?
He goes forward in time, so it's not creepy anymore
I meant on a journey through time and space
Yes.
There is just far too many people hooking up with those two...
dammit doctor, you 900 year old creep
I meant bow chicka wow wow
Why does everyone assume he's hooking up with his companions?
Oh, I convert all of my strokes into paths and then mess with the thickness to match the show style better
Rose and Martha had crushes on him, yes.
It was only like 4 people including me though
Why wouldn't he?
And I posted logs anyway
I haven't drawn oc stuff in a while...I miss it.
There's probably going to be somewhat constant ones now
And Handsy ended up with Rose, but the Doctor wasn't into Donna or Amy
It's not as noticeable on this picture as some other ones I've done though
so I'm sure you can make one of them :p

I initially used GIMP, but I found that Inkscape is a much better program. I've yet to make a full vector though.
Paypal is owned by eBay, so I don't exactly blame them but
Ash is still ten, and Misty is still on that bus
Inkscape ftw, SillyNilly! :D

Yeah maybe on Share.
nothing will replace the real thing
But good luck getting connected to Share in the US
I can't read books on my comp, anything longer than 5 pages, it just isn't happening
get yourself a kindle or something
Also the book's like 2-3 weeks old
I've read a whole book on the computer actually.
A pdf likely doesn't exist

Well, nothing beats cracking open a full reference book...
Man I want to like punch a goat or something
I just complain to Altair about most things
Now that I think of it it's not that much different from fanfic aaaand oh wait you're the person who reads fanfic on their ebook.

02I complain to you who complains to Altair
I read fanfics on my nintendo DS
since he set it up and I didn't and I have no fucking idea where he puts everything
02MANLY
The worst part is is it's effing amazon

Amazon has 1 copy
if that counts as en ebook :P

I now have two fanfics in the making.
alright, now I'm feeling up to it
time to drink this tilt stuff, probably is going to be disgusting, but hey, why not!
Lol that game
cya
I like it a lot, I think the light behind her head looks really nice, the framing's off, and the streak is mreeegh, but I like the rest of it
that isn't a pony!
It's not, I'm sorry.
Hang on
Lalalalalalala
i'm high.
but yeah, it is a good pic
Here http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/AND_THEY_NEVER_WILL.png
That's a pony.
Well it's three ponies.
Well, fillies, really.
lol
But, I mean.
cool cool
Well anyway
I'm going home
will be back in a few hours

Altair, we'll need to figure out a way to do VNC
classic
can you reinstall tightvnc?
freeman is alive
it's being a cockfuck
anyway, bbl
John Freeman?
There could be plans for the CMC to get their own series
Full Life Consequences!
and then John was a zombie
I heard that was shot down.
Ravenholdm
U sudnt come here!
Not shot down per say, just possibly postponed
No John, you are the demons!
Hasbro wanted the CMC to be integrated into the Mane Cast first
And then he fired bullets out of his gun.. REALY FAST!
and the pants were dead
I have to kill fast and bullets too slow
Happy dog likes to play in the park! Everyone you know will someday be dead.
Mane Series*
/me almost typed everypony there
yeah.
Almost? Why not? xP
/me has "everyone" set to auto replace with everypony
I think I like it better with all the ponies in just 1 series
Call of the Cutie was intended to be the Poorly Disguised Pilot for that new series
xiagu made an exception for himself, of course
I never type everypony in conversations with bronies unless I try... but I have to stop myself when conversing with non bronies
lol
Prominence:
I have to prevent myself from using everypony in skype chats
u there?
Well, the quote was just everyone
And the series would have been aimed at an even younger demographic.
so... it would have been inaccurate...
inaccuracy... schmaccuracy
which makes no sense at all
that explains the "suddenly two new characters we've never met before" ending
i have text-replace set, so i just type everypony and my client changes it (every-one)
why is it when you're drunk, half of your thoughts are about how drunk you are? I don't get it
It's the neurotoxin. it's taunting you
dawg
Hm?
Actually, those two other characters were given early bird cameos in episode 1
Just wonderin' how you're doin'
neurotoxin? don't use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue
And how "work" is going
yeah, but not really... established
Been better on both counts.
I'll leave it at that.
True
You're not applejack
Gotcha
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Endless Gifts (http://tinyurl.com/3e3b824)
their introduction in CotC would make sense in a pilot... but was absurdly awkward in an ongoing series
Neurotoxin? Don't use your fancy organic chemistry to muddy the issue.
where they aren't going to be in the next episode
Only time will tell if they'll adapt the planned series, or change it into a series about the Mane 6 as fillies
dont let your fancy issues muddle the math. i am doing this wrong, are i not?
hi
Close enough.
...not sure if want
That's something Twilight would say, probably to Rarity.
Don't use your fancy muddles to issue the mathematics.
/me laugh
Oh shit son.
I mean, poop.
oh poop song.
ohai Drake o3o
OH GOD I SWORE
SON
04hey SS
NOT SONG!
There's a low-tolerance level for it.
Desu.
Poop.......
You ever smell your armpits a few hours after you showered just to go 'ew'?
>,>
If they adapt the former, we can expect to see much more of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, as well
yeah. let's hope they get season 2 over and done with before they break off with another series.
Horseapples
Horseapples, that's a good one.
>mane 6 as filles
That's what Rainbow Dash uses in "Fall Weather Friends"
how would that even work? they have established first meetings already
seems more like an applejack euphamism
And it's connotation is EXACTLY what you interpret it to be.
True
it's not like The Muppet Show
"OH SHI--"
Dash is a jerk. Like, Dash is just a jerk, that's why she hangs out with Gilda.
lol
'cause they're both jerks.
Dash is sometimes not a jerk!
Haha.
Ones slightly less jerky
Applejack's is "What the hay"
Yeah like once a week.
There's a lot more potential for something like a spin off series later on vs. right now.
She's pretty jerky in FWF though...
I mean not spin off.
you know what I mean XD
also jerky at the end of ticketmaster
she's also a big dick in Dragonshy...
Yeah and in like 25 other episodes.
yeah
The only time Dash wasn't a dick was with the Shadowbolts.
Blums, that's amusingly jerky though.
"But the rainbow one kicked me" *rainbow nods contently*
And she was like 'Later, bros!'
i like bad girls, so they are good with me.
Pfft, bad girl? Like, what does she do that's so bad?
I just can't shake this feeling that Season 2 could end up being Darker and Edgier than Season 1, since Hasbro knows about all the older fans
I was thinking more the intolerance of Fluttershy
Spits apples in peoples faces then grins?
'cause she did that.
I know that feel bro
``but the rainbow one kicked me'' *nod* is one of my favorite parts actually :D
but I think its all good.
for season 2 atleast.
Lookit! http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/dash_is_kind_of_a_dick.gif
because most jerks are.. bad?
She just spits apples at people.
Who even does that?
beyond that.... who knows.
spits apples? wut?
12 Hello, GGgala_ and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
Dash comes through when she has to though
AJ doesn't seem to mind, she was like 'Wtf you son of-ooooooh apple!'
/me wonders if using that face was really necessary
Well I'll be going now, its late soo..... bye
crap. internet derped
I doubt it will change that much though.
l8r Blu--
/me missed.
BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
/me /QQs
Laterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Yeah, I guess. I mean they wouldn't go from sunshine and rainbows to violence and blood
whoops

He didn't waste much time.
I wanna meet this AJ in the rl so we can buy apples and whatever like ponies or whatever AJ's into http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/this_AJ.png

There will probably be a few shoutouts and stuff for us (like derpy) but for the most part..... it should be the same.
well as lomng as the animation and the look of the characters stay the same
That's guranteed :)
I'm sure they will
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS MIND READERS! YAAAAAAY!!
/me is so proud of himself
when another company trying to do the same thing...ya never know what changes could happen
The question is, if they do a Season 3, will they stay the same?
BlacklightShining: that would have been so funny, but yet so wrong
The characters?
yes
probab;y.
the kick I described?
They won't sell toys if they go changing crap up.
right
Though they managed just fine with the gen 4 toys compared to gen 1
kick kick kick!
ban ban ban!
you only have to look at the pound puppies , in the 1980's 2 seasons and yet such different looking characters
puch punch punch!
Maybe new characters.... but changing what they've got going right now is a terrible marketing decision.
kick punch it's all in the mind
wrong…how?
(ignore the drunkard please)
And they won;t ignore money :P
New characters in a new season, co9uld happen
kz
/me is now ignoring Colgate
They might even bring back the Sea Serpent and Manticore
(not really…)
Punch Kick Block BAN
Mustache.
true, but any originals must look identical..
WHAT WORLD.
stripes, the 80's was a.... down time for cartoons.
hehe
04How are you?
Maybe another episode with the Poison Joke
but with different characters being affected
its like comparing shit to rainbows :P
i grew up on astro, starblazers and kimba..they were great times
lol
lol
I feel dumb right now
and I don't know how to unignore people
:(
That ain't even a proper comparison
romana.
/ignore help didn't help
back in the 80's anything went. 90's to pretty much now, there are standards.
which you don't break, especially if the show is for a toy line.
Not that big in the 90s. One look at Animaniacs will tell you that
12you made drf mad
Lol
What client?
help ignore
i use that face periodicly ;p
Or /help ignore
well standards as far as success.
Though that would explain The Legend of Zelda's failure
well i hope your right Polarfire
The Super Mario Brothers Super Show, however, was a success and went on to have two sequels
I enjoyed the innuendo's of 90's cartoons, they make them just as fun to watch now as back then.
yupers
*smooch* Good night everybody
night barry
Not really going to bed
