6and basically cried when I saw it vanish off screen
I have to go, and don't say no.

right now?
6yeah

13Awesome :D
Why not try a different pattern for kicks
The voices just sounded annoying and didn't seem to fit as well.
03I have this png that somehow got corrupted
http://ponify.me/
I just tuned in!
Variety is sure to sell
03anyone have any idea how to open what's left of it?
9some dubs ARE good
I prefered the Japanese.
6I'm downloading MoF right now since as easy as it is....it's one of the most difficult for me
Hmm.
9it's just that many are pretty bad
yeah, unfortunately it's REALLY hard to be a good anime VA
Meh.
6not really
03:/
6I've never seen a png be successfully recovered
is the melted fluid going down the drain?
IS GODZIRRA
03frick
Ok everypony TUNE. IN!
9yeah. It's mainly because of the nature of the Japanese Language
6how corrupted is it
yeah
yeah.
03bad enough that it says
03"Windows Photo Viewer can't open this picture because the file appears to be damaged, corrupted, or too large"
which is why I think people should go away from trying to lip synch it
03Adobe Fireworks fails
03etc
6I'm assuming the "too large" isnt the problem?
I mean, just get a stronger translation, don't worry about the animation, you know?
03nopr
03*nmope
03*NOPE
6lol
03Windows Photo Gallery says corrupted
if worse comes to worse, you can always edit the existing animation
6can you send me the file maybe?
I've never seen a thing like this. He speaks of queries... What'd I kiss?

8 bit giggle at the ghostys...
I'm stereotyping

03^
http://lapfox.bandcamp.com/track/got-my-pony-spam-for-you <-- still an awesome mix :P

03oh hm
You don't know how a girl can be gay?
i doesnt matter
9AOYAMA, DAT SMOOTHNESS
03the link they show is artinstitutes.edu/stories
I dont think they'll do sexuality in the show
6LL
6no
that type of talk must go to #EquestriaAfterDark
03but wtf @ having a .info link for a college, that just made me think it was some poser place LOL
12good
that stereotyping
they just said gay and sexuality
6the only training outside of on the job was an alcohol training
._.
Sexuality is already in the show
6that was it xD
12ah
Rarity is straight
03LOL WTF Alcohol training?
12well
12I bring it up
THREE OF THE SAME ONES
I have a lot of tomboyish friend, and thaéy are all fed up with this whole "gay" and "manly" thing
wait
heterosexuality is as much sexuality as homosexuality
12because we have online training
maybe there are people with same firstnames?
6drf, laws are really strict about alcohol
Ok
?
12and this one lesson
6and target's policies are just as strict
It's not like all tomboys are Gildas
03well
03isn't it just
03don't sell to anyone under 21
03LOL
12KEPT mispelling "their" as "thier"
12I cringed
a point was made a few moments ago
12each time I saw it
9Remember Japanese write the surname first
stop discussing this topic
oh
NOW
members of same family?
6don't sell to anyone under 21, you are required to swipe their ID regardless of appearance (even 92 year olds get carded), you can't be under 18 to sell it
6etc etc etc
or move to #EquestriaAfterDark with it
it's not strictly PG appropirate
03OK
9yeah, but it's easier finding mistakes like that
03wtf iTunes
12these are adult people in the company
6there's a lot more to the 21 rule
03*is
12or use spellcheck

6and nothing
^
03if you commit a crime
03and police point a gun at you
03don't think they aren't going to shoot you
03>_>
12there were also peaceful protests
Spam?
12and it turned violent
12detroit parking wars
oh snap they're the ones being attacked
6drf that's the point, this is all stupid
Something like that
03yeah
12i can't believe that's a show
There goes
awww, ZekeS
12Yep, its dumb
03I think the whole police not being allowed to have guns in the UK is incredibly stupid too
I was gonna get 'im
:(
12I agree
:P
You can kick Zekes
03so why put the cops at risk?
fatality
Police shouldn't need guns.
12^
03orly?
no, that's no fun Fall
6aka stupid people
DRILL-ARM INCOMING
03just take the bullet and die?
6also, I'm fully against that
You forget I'm Norwegian, drf
12shouldn't need, but DO need
6police need guns
our police is unarmed
12they should be at least armed with high quality tranqs
6but then again, this is the US
6I dunno about the UK
12so they don't harm anyone but can knock them out at a distance
03well
my goodness, all the noobs in the celestia radio channel
Johnsey that's impossible
9DAT CUTE DESIGNER
well he wasn't spamming on purpose
that sound is annoying
dat designer
6<Light_Latias>	shouldn't need, but DO need
03good like tasing a tier

03*tire
FAIL
XD
12tier
12lol
our police officers usually wear bats, nothing more.
Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
lol
That's really good intentions
6lakorv
6that can't happen around here
03do they just die?
12some people's houses were destroyed, thats how out of hand they're getting .w.
nice one....
12Danny
how can you spam on accident?
6not when this country is built upon drug cartels and guns
like on cops, when they say it's been a good night when they catcha lot of criminalls...
12he said SHOULDN'T need
also
people don't 'start shooting'
This song

Plus pinkie pie
Isn't a good night if there aren't any crimes going on..?
No, it just means awesome crimes are happening.
6it's all regional
StephenCawking: i dunno, it's relatively impossible!
welcome to Norway, where everything isn't centered around economy, guns and drugs.
6yep
we have the strictest gun laws in the world.
6welcome to the US, the exact opposite
03it doesn't need to be CENTERED around them
03see
03laws
03mean nothing
03if you're a CRIMINAL
12until you get caught
03yes
03but that's not the point
Pikie's always wearing costumes
if you're criminal you don't get guns, and getting them illegally is actually not that easy.
9yeah, pretty much
the Utøya terrorist tried and failed.
03it's incredibly easy here
or you could switch suit with parties
Either or
9it's also realer than most reals
6it's horribly easy around here
03yeah
that's the charm
03then there's also things like in Terminator
03walk into a gun shop
03take the gun
03point it at owner
03bam
/me runs
12a gun store opened up a few months ago here
6heck, you see how our border situation is right now
@dari i'm on skype if you need me
/me ><;'d

03Light_Latias
guns are silly.
03you'l be covered
03:)
12Danny
03*pse
dat glancing hit
03Lakorv, I can see where guns would come in handy for hunting, but that's it really
figures you would be underage
Now, Steins;Gate
orientation?
Stock prices and the stability of the market ofc
you know
whether she likes colts or not
03which they aren't >)_>
The only show that distracts me from ponies
DON't TURN THE BOOSTERS ON
03you can't hunt with a handgun
it's clearly skywards
OHH SNAP LAZORS
03so it's basically just designed for killing people >_>
6^
there's no morality to it?
6see
6drf
12they're "for protection"
is too
12tho
03rifles and shotguns actually serve a legit purpose
6thats actually half right
6handguns are legal
since morality is likely an abstract concept forged by man?
12you shouldnt keep them on you
6for house protection
03well
6but people lie about that
03why do you need a handgun
6so that's the problem
03etc
and ponies have likely forged the same concept?
03LOL
10It's a hobby
12hai Sky
and thus is likely wholly subjective?
03You don't need to own a gun to shoot targets
nice one with the spin reversal.
9LIKE A BAWS
03just go to the range and borrow one :P
I wouldn't have thought of that one
Ô.o
12Lakorv
03Lakorv
03you don't get the point
12ban+eliminate
6ban wont do squat
03CRIMINALS
03DO NOT
03FOLLOW
03LAWS
6there are millions of guns in this country
Lawl
sheesh, drf
03I'm all for making them illegal
and people like to debate about their subjective values?
12^
ORDER THE TAKEOFF!
Blums I don't know about ponies but thats going in my favorites
no reason to yell
XD
03but that doesn't mean you wouldn't need them
10banning guns in America would just result in more crimes
12unless they're all destroyed
12then nothing'll change
03Lakorv, when I've said it like 20 times, it kinda proves you aren't paying attention.
12what?
"Hey you, give me a thousand dollars" "A thousand dollars? wow! why?*moustache flys off*"
03you used that face D:
you know, you make a template where you scan and copy the paper multiple times.
12and keep one on them for protection
03well
hey Fella
just 1 signature needed
03I think they should just not let you buy a gun that can't be used for huntinmg
03or a rifle
10lolrifle
/me needs to cook something.
Brb
03rifles are awesome
6drf
10Indeed
6yuo can actually
6*you
9BAA BA BA BAA BA BA
0322-caliber rifles, that is
StephenCawking: <twilight>prove it</twilight> ;)
03sniper scopes make them more fun XD
9*SHEEP
badabumbee
12^
6in which case, the law protects you against killing them
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
6it's self defense
BABABBABABBABABBABABABBA<
drf, when you've said it 20 times, it kinda proves you've said it 20 times. I heard you and I /know/ criminals don't. That's why they're criminals.
ponies have made it into HTML5? awesome
03no but I mean
10The thing with being able to use rifles to protect yourself, yes, but they're very noticeable
it
6for all you know, it could be some mentally deranged kidnapper
03you can also just shoot them in the foot
03you don't need to KILL Them
6drf
12Sky
10Hand guns can be hidden
21:53:07 < StephenCawking> and ponies have likely forged the same concept?
6I'm aiming at their chest if they break into my house
6end of story
ok
6I'm not thinking WHERE to shoot
03well we don't own a gu./
03*gun
12only more dangerous people need to keep something like that hidden
Blums: nah, XML :P
BA BA BA
9it is
well, they seem to have some pretty solid concepts about right and wrong
9I just put them on
if people break in here, they're pretty low to start with
alright
10Light, whut
6^
03it's like the discussion I had yesterday about how security systems only keep the honest out
no one keeps guns here.
12you shouldn't need to have a concealed weapon
luckily.
03<Light_Latias> you shouldn't need to have a concealed weapon <- agreed
Everything and Nothing
6lol
10So DRF
12because
10What happens when police forces won't be able to protect you?
10There's not enough of them
Yes, No, Both, Superposition, and Entaglement
6intruder, potential murderer
12that they feel you have a concealed weapon because you feel the same about them
6whatever
dat drill arm
10I don't know, say economy collapse and everyone goes berserk
03...
12you both buy handguns and conceal them
03police != citizens
"came out of the stable"
6like right now in UK, riots
Really now?
03police already have handguns LOL
6lol
03LOL ragequit
6he left
/me facepalms
Okay, bye!
6I actually enjoy these debates
6they're quite interesting
10To fight for survival of food etc
03I never said I didn't want police to have guns
03so o_O
6what dont you get?
12what Sky said
03I just said security systems are pointless
6actually hold on
dat ignored
6I lost mysefl here
Hi!
12where people in that area
12did just about anything
That's no good.
"Pony stomping day"
10^
dem hair-horns
12attacking each other, looting, etc
12they were scared
12confused
03where are we going with this
10Not enough police force to keep everyone in their shoes
03LOL
03there are around here
10My point: hand guns should not be banned
12same goes with people
03...
03why does a gun need to be concealed to protect you
remember, its the music that we choose
9AMERICANU DORIIM
When's that? jk
03shotguns easily do more damage anyway :P
10Think of it this way too:
hihi everypony
DAT AMERICAN DREAM
03just tear a hole in their chest LOL
Hello!
And no it isn't like that at all.
inb4 Fireant
9So guys
9wat do
12maybe weight is a factor
GURREN LAGANN
MIXED WITH DAI-GUARD
IN PONY FORM
12as aren't shotguns and rifles heavier?
mehehehe
03yes
03but unless you're a 3 year old
03you should be able to hold it
03anyway
Hey.
10So
Hello
1050/50
6ok I've actually lost everyone's views on this topic
03:P
6we went ona tangeant here LOL
10Also
12Roara, we've gone on multiple at this point
03I'm talking about actual LIKELY scenarios
10"It's not guns that kill people, but the people with the guns"
12Danny
probly
12because they happen
10Or however that went
03Skylands
10We have too many irresponsible people out there
6^
03it's legal to own assault rifles
03now
03what good reason is tehre for that
03I mean like AK-47 type assault rifles
10I dunno
Zero Tolerance
03he's a collector, but still... why would anyone need to have a gun like that
12some people collect them
12strange hobby tbh
10So guns aren't really the problem, it's the people
03you can't conceal it, and hunting with an assault rifle is stupid, it's basically just aimed at serial killers LOL
well
why do you read that?
yes he do, Justice.
i mean
12then lets aim them at serial killers?
hehehe
/me shot
10:P
03still
6I honestly think the current gun laws are way to lax, and way to scattered
12^
03^
6drf has a good point that the kind of guns allowed are ridiculous
Well.
Because it was early, I think.
oh, that fic
>_>
12although
Early and particularly graphic.
6that handguns should be legal as self defense
03well as I said, my family doesn't own a gun
12they can't be changed really
12as
6lol
9OH LAWL
12who in their right mind would give up their gun(s)
03plus
6then that's just personal preference
03Light_Latias
12if
well
12they know others won't
9I UNDERSTAND, YOSHIKO
DAT ACTING MILF
03so if they made them illegal
wow
6we don't own one, but it's been family discussion if we should get one
It's on the blog, it should be easy to find.
is it greatly written???
12My family don’t own a gun either lol
03could just come get it
10They've wanted to limit the gun laws
03XD
10But if they go too far
12Danny
6that's fine
10It could cause a civil war
nopony expects the spanish inquisition!
6yes I have a bat with me
Nopony.
6always
03exactly LOL
03well
03I don't

DAT SOUND FX
hilarious
03LOL muskets
12Those too
12ew, Sky's OLD D:
Wasn't Past Sins just updated?
10Light, no
/me hides
03those things were as much dangerous to the user as the person being shot at
9DERP
6ok well
5th of August,yeah.
10It's a weapon wielded by one of the characters in that anime
CogWeaver, seriously, we are not American PG :p
12oh
6my views on guns to restrict them to personal territory only, unless hunting
in the stadium that was used to group up the evacueees
03agreed
Can we use it in the context of "Fornification Under Consent of King" or "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"?
w/e
6in which case, hunting is a whole different story
American, LOL
03and even then
6because that requires separate permits, certain locations, etc
But,*in AppleBloom style* I WANT THE NEXT ONE NOWWW!
03because legally
03even now
Knowing a word doesn't mean we want to see it used.
9Dat military cover-up
12if someone breaks in
Just my two bits.
03LL
12it's self-defense
03if someone breaks in
03they can sue you if they break their leg
I dunno why but I actually like the MiB
03what makes you think you'd win that case
he looks like a nice fella
6um
6breaking and entering
6usually wins in court
6er
/me activates her i-field
6defense does
i- field?
03this is America
10-d
i was just about to type that
6suing is our pasttime, I know
6sueing
12^
yes, an I-Field stops beam attacks
at first I thought abirkin was using an at field
03I've heard all sorts of cases about people suing about breaking into someone's house and injuring themselves
03so if you SHOOT THem, LOL
But... nopony is using beam attacks..
12then it's direct
yet
Sketchy_Sounds, no one hold you here. :)
03and they could sue you :P
12if they lkive :P
/me whacks abirkin2 with a load-bearing steel beam
12-k
03LOL
03if they die
If you find something offending here, well...
03their relatives can sue you
12dead cannot sue
This is one of my favorite songs
03yeah but
Please don't make me ask again.:(
12so
03very rarely does someone not have a single relative alive
...I'll mention it =P
03that can sue for them
03:P
/me stops Blums using Bits
12ki8ll me

12and steal everything
12-8
Bits? sorry i'm not versed in gundam
Thank you.That's all I needed.
03well
9man
03if they have a gun
12only THEN can *I* sue?
03and it looks like they're going to use it
03then you could say it was self defense
03but
03that wouldn't win
03as self defense
12yes
OH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
wow
03same thing
thats...
interesting

Blums, that would be too hard to pull off. Don't be silly :)
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Gross.jpg
We don't need to know this
6and if he has a gun of his own?
you guys are unbelievable
^
you really are
But I'm used to it.
12Danny
6so bye
12your natural adrenaline
12wakes you up
6>.>
and make MOAR DAI-GUARDS
02specially fear
Because it's the truth.
6that line right there made me not pay attention to this conversation anymore lool
6drf
for military and civillian uses
e_o
03if they're already holding it, fine
12and under adrenaline
12you move faster than normal
And you say I'm bad!
6actually no
6I don't feel like responding lol
To quote Spike
OH
Look!
6it's not going to go anywhere
Its muted now :p
orly?
Yes, magic.
03LL, moving faster != being accurate with a gun in the middle of the night
NOWAI
How about them ponies, Rite?
>facepalm
12it means you can get it aimed faster
inorite?
12etc
6my point being if I have a gun in my hands, and this person could potentially have one, I'd either use the gun on the spot or hold it up as a threat
12^
I know left.
12.-.
03yeah, holding the gun up is fine
Ohoho BitZero
so...um
03but you don't need a handgun to scare someone :LOP
03*:P
6skylands, I think he was talking about the intruder pulling a gun out of his pocket
12Danny
not that this isn't fun or anything, but...
10k
12it's an added bonus
??
*gasp*
CUTE PUPPY
6gun debate
DAAAAAWWWWWWWW
03oh woah
03our power just went out
12brb
/me has no issues with silence, laughs a little
"Don't you dare to play with my console!"
I always feel like I'm being force-choked when that happens.
6I think a gun would be more helpful in scaring a man from my house than just fists
03GOD DANG IT STOP BEEPING BATTERY BACKUP I KNOW THE POWER IS OUT
03there we go, generator kicked on
6especialyl if the intruder decides he could take me ina fight
/me shrinks back from his Overlord's gaze* I'm sorry! dun kill meh! DX
?
It's an IRC thing, Peter_K
02sad...
there fixed!
DUN KILL MEH!
03LOL well, that part I guess depends on how tough you look
ANOTHER SHELL
12Same
it happens when he sets +m . It mutes the channel
…
/me glowers at CogWeaver
okay, enough of this
lol
really?
oh okay... i think i understand xD
12Danny
Really.
10Movies =/= reality
hehe, good old irc times :P
I HATE TL;DR
...
12movies are dramatized
03etc
/me bangs head against desk
Vanned? Who's getting vanned?
12gun wins
Blums, eeeenope.
03not if you punch them first
6ok well
iu
O.o
6think about it lol
It wouldn't work ;(
;)
12guns have a longer reach
6turna light on, see if you know the person LOL
12derp
9but yeah
9got to think about which series to stream
Really fireant? I've seen namechanges when +m was set
03well
...
03did you turn the light on? :P
6I think a husband would even let you know its them
6"who's there?"
9some SRW, some Dai Guard
Name changes don't get around +m though
9some Eureka 7
03what if he was just checking on the kid
12^
03etc
6intruder- no answer
6husband- me
lol
/me carries solistlugia out while coveringl his ears ... too young for this xD
How about MEGAS XLR
They seemed to.
12^^^^^
12@Roara's
Megas ain't japanese
12Danny
actually
03just seeing someone in my house is not reason enough to shoot
damn it
needed to relog
oh
yeah
9I used to stream Megas before
6unless it's very clearly aggressive
9I'd be willing to
then Megas is good too
03-9
no problem then
9okay, Megas
12*a
Well that's great, but I gave my FallSilently nick such a long and awkward password that it'd be too much hassle to abuse.
*changing
12Danny
Exacta
Lol
that's odd
12if it's for a mother's child
And well, also, banhammers, rite? xD
6in which case, that's either not my husband or he's clearly not a good person lol
thanks Blums
9I'll research more series
DAT BASEBALL
12to keep the child safe
I heard it was good
Hi
Banvils to make the collection complete
9Evangelion's good but WAY overrated
03plus
6I did mention it was an intruder
12then you tell them to self-identify
6not the husband
...best pony battle!?
(speaking of banhammers, mine's bigger than Fireant's! XP)
alright
I've always imagined banhammers having a little adjustable dial on them
03there are drawbacks to every situation
03how would you KNOW it's an intruder
/me runs away*
03they aren't going to have a sign on their backs aying I BROKE IN
12they don't respond?
OK cool.
It is good?
mhpf
6er
Or horrible
6my
6djksdrg
6KJRG
6RTH
03LOL
12better yet
03OK still
03as I was saying
``Set banhammers to kick.''
12BOTH parents
I just momentarily wondered why Fireant was quoting me.
12side-by-side
03for example
9Nadesico TV is hilarous, but the movie is pretty contrived
Well you are pretty amazing
"Set banhammers to KILL"
because he can
03but does that mean you should just shoot anyone you see?
Well there is that @ Fall
6no theres not, I don't like the concept of killing someone
alright then. Maybe we could Stream Nadesico TV.
9also Nadesico was made by the same people as Dai-Guard, only it's older
12^
no
hehehe
we KILL
03I'd try doing anything that avoids killing them if at all possible
03like just downing them
03injuring etc
9Gravion or Aquarion
03etc XD
no, crashing the server is still lower than killing
could be cool too
K:Line every single one of you.
12then you're paying to keep them alive
12:B
Man, having this Celestia Radio on in the background is damned trippy.
03LL we're already paying for prisons
LOL Xiagu
XD
03adding one more person isn't going to change that
12shoot them there
Dudes.
/me lol'd
Topic change.
Ponies.
12you paid for a couple bullets
GO!
12but knowing
Ponies.
03what are you, cheap now?
Ponies?
12that you're helping keep that person alive
Has everybody heard my cat theory?
PONIES! the reason why everybody should be here!
PONIES
6intruding is a minimal jail time usually
12for ANY amount of time
03but they could easily get several years
03well
Rarity is best pony. No exceptions
I would like to propegate it.
03just breaking in by itself yes
OH CRAP
Applejack....
6I don't care
03but if they were making an indication of harming someone
03that's another crime
I should properly get round to actually drawing Salad.
fallsilently: is it pro-cat or anti-cat?
03which is why armed robbery is worse than just normal robbery
03etc
The ponies aren't ponies. They're cats.
03Light_Latias
Look at them. Clearly cats.
03you should see the movie Taken, then
How about Macross/Robotech?
...
Ponies
12I have
Well OK technically no i drew Salad first but my drawing of her is rubbish.
03oh
I can't decide between Twilight and Fluttershy, myself.
and horns
03OK
and manes
03good movie, no?
12think of this
They have squarish paws.
12Danny
12OUR child
and Pinkie Pie
12we both arise after hearing a noise
/me hides
12XD
Look at their heads, and smooth curves, and snouts.
03JK
their legs and postures are not feline at all
Very feline.
9as the opening show to it
no problem
03run up with a baseball bat and hit them
12would you let them go in there?
9but no plans of doing Macross TV
12which can kill them
12:B
/me dances*
9maybe Macross Plus
03it's VERY unlikely
/me dances
03unless you continually beat themn with it
03-n
cool
12still happens
The males look more like foxes.
03still
<Sweetie Belle> No. </Sweetie Belle>
12...
12Danny
03try to solve the problem without killing anyone
12leave the comic book crap
03no but
/me dances and just falls over, decides to stay put
6drfsupercenter	which is why armed robbery is worse than just normal robbery <-HOW CAN YOU TELL LOL
Rita ofc
03Roara|Touhou
It just sunshowered outside
03if you hit someone with a bat or shoot them in the foot etc
03and police come
Ones that have been told by an evil horse queen that they're ponies!
12I actually agree with drf there
Sunshowers are pretty
03and find a gun on the person
03then you can tell :P
9not really
03well
oh snap
9I might stream GOOD Transformers eventually
03you can't tell beforehand no
yeah
good transformers ia okay
12^
but bad is HORRIBLE
03by their relatives
03etc
I didn't write "A".
10Why does it matter if they have a weapon or not anyway? They're still intruding
12but
6by the time I find out, it could be because they've actually SHOT me, my husband, or my kid
12safe than sorry
they're like the G1-3.5 Ponies.
If season two has a main antagonist it should be Bad Horse
12always go hand in hand with chilkdren
03Skylands, it doesn't, i'm just saying armed robbery is a worse crime
12-k
03anyway
03LL
Bad Horse/
10Well
03comic books aside
according to my research, ~7 species of animals just got married
Bad Horse!
03just because someone has a gun
Ah,thanks for clarifying.
Oh hey. o.o
He got the application that you just sent in!
03then point their own gun at them :P
6ok
That's better.:D
6I'm not fast enough
...
12fast enough
Link it nao
6and I'm not strong
12if they're armed
6I have the gun
6I shoot
ok ill find it
12^
03in that case I would too, but I'd shoot them somewhere that wouldn't kill them
11.•10«11WB10 (Pattyrick10) 11WB10»11•. 10- [11:31] <Pattyrick> Yup, but since ArcaninOMGPONIESPOOOONNNIIIIEESS
6I'm not aiming
spaaaace!?
03then good luck hitting them
6if I kill or dont, I don't care
12it's like in Indiana Jones 4
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP3CwPLl9Mo
I consider Transformers: Energon bad
6well
6I'd aim enough to hit them
9yeah
9that
03OK well then aim enough to not kill them :P
yeah, the Cybertron and Energons were bad.
6you do know it's easier to hit the chest than the foot right?
I think there are PMVs for most of Dr. Horrible's songs
Okay, just checking.
And they were basically among the only transformers I've ever watched.
03yes, but say you shoot them in the stomach
03that's just as easy to hit
actual song starts at :40
03that'll knock them over but not kill them
03usually
12can easily kill them tho
03well
03depends on how much blood they lose LOL
12stomach acid
12is HIGHLY acidic
03I'm aware
9sup Val

Why'd he kill it?
you going back to #P&D right?
6they survive, I dont have to kill them
03OK
03well
03Light_Latias
9yeah I was wondering the same thing dari LOL
Yo Val
03are you telling me
03that once we have a kid
03you're going to keep a gun in our house?
hello crono_flash
6how?
12maybe
03:|
12Think about it lol
6er
6kill me
03LOL
12:B
6I'd keep mine safet-
03LL
03that's really adult-proof? :P
03Children are smarter than you think
03it's like
10Lock combination
12I'd rather aim for the leg or arm to play it safe
03having a button that says do not press, everyone's going to press it, right?
12then we can go the honest route
10Like they could figure that out
9oh right
03well
03they could guess
10I don't think they would
6GUESS LOL
03no
03but I mean
10and if you kept the safe somewhere unnoticeable
03Skylands
03if you keep it somewhere unnoticeable
currently cooking pasta
12Roara
I got the adapter today, drf
12if thats the case
I'm starting to get hungry
9Also guys
12that child's a genius
10That's why you keep one-
6 5 seconds to open it and take the gun out
10That
9I'm going to try to stream all of Dai-Guard during the week
12^
6I've done it
magic
6not with a gun, but I've done a similar task
Thanks for sending it to me! =D
03yes I know
03Pattyrick, no problem
12Sky
9I'll start it on the Mech Nights much later
03did it work?
6locked drawers tend to be a problem
no problem
6but yeh
12making it hard for the owner to access is
9as in, when we finish another, unwatched show
10I know
12counterproductive
10But for when the kid is around
Let me try it out now
Gurren, for example?
12well, yah
nvm sliping is done
12Kids think guns taste good :p
10Anyway
O_o do you take requests for shows to stream?
03still
03I'd just say
9something like that
03no guns in the house
9well I take suggestions
03end of discussion
12Danny
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
12locks
12and discipline
12work wonders
03well
12the latter especially
03fine, maybe they won't find it when they're 3
03but
iiiiiiinteresting
03say they're an angry teenager
yeah
03they know you have a gun somewhere
03we leave the house for 10 minutes
03etc
it was me
12Creepy .-.
is there a problem?
03if I had a gun in my house? I wouldn't even trust my best friend
12besides
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
12Sometimes you can't lol
It does seem to work
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
6if it's an angry teenager, then well, that's probably a time to remove the gun lol
03Told you XD
12if we discipline the child right
ok
I like how it has subtitles for "bararara"
12violence shouldn't even be a concern
Not sure if you can stream fullscreen games.
03I mean
12same @u
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-7SCxdWgg&feature=related.
every. single. one
eh
03do you think their parents knew they were going to steal their guns?
9you can on Livestream
03prolly not
I did make it windowed, but it crashes when you do.
9but not really on Veemi
12I have a counter
03they just acted like typical shy teenagers
only one for today
Yup, it does
12did the parents bring them up right?
12prolly not
03maybe, maybe not
03I mean
03this is one of those things
12just as you said
03if you try to teach a kid
03that guns are bad
03then they'll go
03"Then why do you have one"
03what are you going to say to that LOL
bitch just got legally pwned
Ponychan 502-ing on any of you?
6um
You could run a stream on Veemi of the stream on Livestream. XD
UST
Oh. Show stoppers =D
6probably the same thing we just had an hour discussion talking about LOL
12it's*
12^
Does livestream have a viewer limit or something?
6guns for defense, not offense
03Nightseas, agreed
yeah
50
03well
Wow.
9unless you pay or somehow
That's poor.
12and defense
that's for free accounts
03but teenagers are easily stupid
9get approved by Livestream
03and could think they're doing the right thing
03like
12karate helps ironically enough
though to be fair
9but out of all the people that have applied for verification have failed
9myself included
D=
the non-main bmn streams usually don't have more than 20-30 people
9it was fair back in the day, but now for me it's a lot
03some would see that as defensive LOL
12again
12no
9it's too little, I mean
12that's extreme
12which
03it would be extreme if it only happened once
12we would teach them not to do
03but you know how many school shootings there have been?
03Light_Latias
03you know how much I have to
03>_>
12so did mine
03:P
12yes
03so
How do you get verification then? O_o
03we can teach our kids all we want
03does that mean they're going to follow it?
03Absolutely not
12no
12but
9it's an application
9and then Livestream reviews it
TheOtakuAscended did that with BronyComms when they had more than 50 viewers for their Back to the Future stream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJINiK9azc o.O DO WANT!!!
03so let's just make this easy on ourselves and not have a gun LOL
12it's not for our lack of trying
/me HIDES
03wtf?
with 20 people in there
9and then you get a notification whether it's
9approved or fail
But how do they decide whether to approve it or not?
12I was joking lol
Wassup
03OK
03still
9nobody knows
O_o
Hello.
10Let's end it now?
03I'd figure you would agree with me that having a gun in our house would be bad :P
12it IS bad
Not sure what's up.
03so why do it
HAHAHAHA
12I'm not disagreeing
how is everypony?
03there are other ways to defend yourself
03heck
T'was busy a moment ago.
03get some pepper spray
/me runs
oh
03that works from a distance
12for the safety of our family
came at the wrong time :D
03or even a taser
Then I looked away for a bit, and it seems everybody else did, too.
$350 per month
03I've seen sites selling tasers for $10
10Pepper spray
O_____________________________________________________o
6I'm giong to sum up my points
10Pfft
horry sheeeet
12old skool
Nah, I just have a lot of influence around here.
that's why I prefer justin.tv NO fee
03what's old school, pepper spray?
10While it's a handy thing to carry around
I just went to switch my fryer on.
03but yeah, actually, tasers are probably a lot more ideal for home defense
(hell, there are streams with 10K+ viewers)
12:3
hehehe
03useless for lots of people
10Someone could knock you out before you can spray them
9that's why I use Veemi
03but if it's just one person
03it'll work
03XD
yeah, but I think Jtv is the most used
:D
can i have some?
Or fries, for the anglicaly challenged.
12I’d just use a high power pellet gun lol
03eh
nah I be from good old blighty
03I hate airsoft guns
/me yawns

It needs to have a comical component.

12That seems to happen a LOT
See yah
12that goes back to bad parenting
yeah, but he's also oblivious
03LL
9also because people like those got more heart than normal
03bad parenting on his FRIEND'S parents
03not HIS
10That goes back to irresponsible people owning guns, rather
I'm not doubting his "skills" or anything
03heck
12and his
03it wasn't even his gun
03he went over to a friend
they don't use brains.
03*Friend's house
03and friend goes "hey, check this out"
they just want to do the right hting
12You can't blame the parents for everything there kid does :p
03and next thing you know
pommes frites

03Not on my friend's parents though
9I mean, he isn't a Real, y'know
12I didn't say whose
03how should he have known that his friend had an airsoft gun?
03OK
03then sure
03but
03my point being
03that I hate airsoft guns
12o...k?
12no
12because if they had been taught right
Convo with my friend
Yeah.
03<Nightseas> I’d just use a high power pellet gun lol
03it was in response to that
idiot+gun=disaster
03well
03LL
03The thing about airsoft guns
03is that they're marketed as being toys
9he's just sort of naive
Koennen wir jetzt Deutsch sprechen!!
9and straight-forward
03might buy one for their kids thinking it's like a nerf gun
9OH SHIT IT'S THAT ONE ANGEL FROM EVA
12BAD
12PARENTING
03Light_Latias

SHIELDED
12ones that can cause damage like that
03if it's some random Chinese company
Though I could be wrong, I was pretty stuck in when I was younger.
03they can get away with crap
03you'd be surprised
03OK well
And likewise here.

I have nothing against spiders when they're in plain sight.
I think spiders are kinda cool
omygoshomygoshomygosh
Spiders are grand. Cute little things.
It's when they turn up in unexpected locations I go a bit nuts.
Dun dun dun
except turantulas
13Have you ever played Touhou and clearly seen a bullet heading towards you
13and you know you should bomb
those are just freakish
13and you want to bomb
13but for whatever reason
For example the time I found one on the underside of my towel right after getting out of the shower.
how do you do that thing where you're like, bleeeeep, to other people?
13and you die
13._.
It might be possible.
Tarantulas are awesome. I wish I had one.
02Yes.
Hahaha!
02It's painfull, lol
6yep
6thats like
6the definition of touhou
6thinking you can make it
6and then you dont
Real horses are evil...
6yep
13My brain is telling me to bomb, but my finger doesn't react
13D:
I know F-Frost. Have you seen bad horse?
Real horses are bonkers.
I tend to agree F-Frost, even if, by only irrational thinking
<3 horses

It's just a frame from the "Socks" comic on EqD.It's Rarity with a wierd face looking at Fluttershy.

6then youmu walks in
13I hate nearly all the stage 3s apart from Patchouli's :<
This game.'Nuff said.
From Past Sins
i havent read that yet
You should, it's a good fic.
They're spoilers of like the first chapter
ok maybe not...
People can deal with it.
he's just setting our expectations low
02lmao
i knew that and ihavent read it
That's basic info. I haven't read it and even I know that.
its like the blurb
brb,gotta eat
13then she took like 2 more lives off me
13then I thought "screw this"
...yeah actually I think it is in the blurb, lol
13and somehow got to stage 6 without losing any other lives
ehehe
13which I've never done before |D
6...wow
6lol
hmmm... first bananas refrence on ponybooru came up
of course I'm probably only fanfic'ed out until something I normally read actually updates.
13I remember saying out loud to Youmu "get out the way, I'm not in the mood for you right now"
yes
yes I do
heh
02lol.
13It worked though~
/me feels loved

The bananas are inevitable.
On feathered wings did the same to me...

Back! Baaack!
Oh no.. we're reaching critical mass! Shoot we're gonna make a blackhole!
02to lazy to type English
*Readies crossbow* was one of the first things I saw in here -.-
XD
Listen up everypony! I know alot of holes they possibly could fill up in season 2!
/me chuckles
Like luna dissapearing for one?
Good heavens, Blums
13Speaking of MoF I still need to beat Suwako
13I haven't really tried lately =w=
already explained
Yes Blums thats a good point too
6I watched someone beat suwako at fanime
Blud, I mean
How?
6it was the opening to his panel
I do tend to ready the crossbow at the slightest provocation.
2. Why most of the population of Equestria is seemingly female?
heh
6*
*Snerk*
13LOL
That was never explained in the series
ep1?
well.. its a girls show =P
I think it's kinda like China
yeah Boss
6now then
see? told you he was just lowering our expectations :P
02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here

02Angel ANGEL

Yes,
6Imma play to see if I can actually learn the other teams
Trixie
Trixie
02The link. has the OST\

Trixie I mean :(
*trixie fanfare*

Pull a carriage, work in the guard, work on a farm. Or gtfo
6just the ost
6nvm
They're occasionally allowed out to drag snowploughs.
Were there any colts in earlier gens...?
but hey, plenty of fillies
There were, yes.
Early gen colts had it good
6you know
Spike was in the earlier gens, and the cracks in his sanity were very visible.
I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
6NO ONE uses aya as a partner in SA
wb
they seemed normal albeit maybe being segregated from the fillies for long periods
Thanks Winter-puff
Yes, the swe dubed spike is... o.o!!
Yeah right dari
13There must be a reason why :P
They've released a Swedish version now?
External forc? where did you hear that?
13I personally don't like her ability
http://img.ponibooru.org/images/31/31a5932978b2f8090d4f4dbff4e4a778
You know, fanfic seems to paint trixie as eventually having a change of heart or a goodness inside her. But I kinda doubt it.
SOCKS!!!!!!!!!!
GREAT WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT DARI
I just think, if she came back, she would still be a jerk
No, the earlier gens is dubed
er..sure
dari sucks donkey balls
We say that you're gonna die.

Yeah. It's a saddle used in battle.

Or worn outside of battle but is still battle saddle.
TOO FAR
Or just not worn, like left on the ground somewhere, but is still battle saddle.

Considering the overall size of the ponies in relation to the objects they interact with, I think it's safe to assume the ponies in the show are about the size of iRL ponies, height wise at least.

03OK
SOOO GOOOOOD and not even on other yet
13I'm not even reliable with uploading files anymore :<
Aw AE, that sucks
But does Luna have enough internets to download it
It is called "My LITTLE Pony"
I think the apple scale was more reliable - an entire apple can easily be munched up by a pony.
For example

Val, this is the Ecclestone one
First series.
Unfortunately, where I bought my laptop, they would only give me the CDs unless I paid them to set up the computer for $100
Eccleston is good.
(though I prefer Tennant)
Oh yeah. Fluttershy is my favorite.
owo
There's just some cartoonish deformation of proportions is the thing.
well can you imagine it if angel was properly sclared to fluttershy? she'd squish him by accident
Yeah
same
I guess I don't have anything to say o.o
:p
03do you have a CD burner though?
Yes
03you can just download the image file and burn it
uh oh
Alright
If that makes sense.

Anyone else listening to Equestria Radio?>

03OK

Of Mares and Magic?
Of Mares and Magic was decent. But not more than that.

Well bromigo.. when it does get hectic its hard to follow anything
no problem
13and yeah |D
^^^^
yeah that's a load of BS
I hardly ever tether mind you, but the fact that they are doing it is really pissing me off
I guess if I had actually listened to aero, I would played touhou like a year before
tether?
But I was too lazy lol
suddenly forehead zipper
Basically.
oh
Dari,I NEED ANWSERS!
yeah, that sucks
basically
My understanding is that some providers have taken a disliking to it.
yes
brb, switching to iPod
As I said. :P
OHSHEET
now Verizon, being stupid, is saying that they want to charge you extra for tethering
Oh, a couple of my buddies do that
7what the...
7dat laugh
13of course, the reason I downloaded it in the first place was to see if it was as boring as it looked to me
13then I was hooked |D

02Hey Espy

Over here in the UK you can pay for being able to tether, I think.
hacker or cracker?

dat PREVIOUSLY ON
it's unethical to charge for something you did not create or have a hand in
ummm
outside of cellphones
12how oges
12goes
or the phone's ability to tether
02Recovering
and we are already paying for 'net access
Dman PART TWO
It's basically poor planning on their part at the end of the day.
They didn't expect people to use their phones that way
7wut..?
Hence they didn't plan for the extra network traffic
WHY WONT YOU PLAY DAMMIT!?
prince-trolli
Well if they find some disticnt reason to give you another bill...
THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER
THEY ARE ALL LINKED
GGgala oh snap!
it's auwn
how much more data are you really using when you tether?
exactly blums
Yeah?
Perhaps, but they're doing that on connections optimised for a phone.
DAT PIC
lawl Mickey
And they're getting heavily compressed data.
02So good
Val YES
now let us never speak of it again

03because an exodus is a lot of people leaving?

XD
03when there was a ping timeout
INTERESTING STRATEGY
lol ownd
9>yfw you're imagining Daleks in SRW
That would be awesome.
Comp sci is too complicated for me man
the Daleks INVENTED magicka.
hard sciences sort of suck for jobs though
Eh. It's satisfying as all get out though.
the Daleks are Scandinavian! OF COURSE
Yeah theres about 3 job vacancies for my course
Wrestling with a computer for a week straight, then FINALLY getting it working is the best feeling.
you could always try reformatting
I'd agree.
Cloudgazer, why would you sign on with Nasa?
That ship is sinking.
02lmao
Best background pony is applejack
03?
(dont hit me)
^^lol
"The daleks must survive"
They axed the shuttle without having a replacement in service. That seems like a bad move
Plus, I just don't have a good feeling about them.
"You would make a good dalek"
background pony
NASA!
DAT LINE
since when wa applejack demoted?
They had it up for being axed for a year
FTW!
it was meant to be closed down last year
CHILLING
Applejack is one of the Mane Six!
They had to finish the ISS first
great!..prince-dari, THE INTERPRITER lol
satellites*
XD
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that all they have is proposals.
what's the point of the ISS if we can't get to it?
Satellites need to be boosted every now and then due to trace atmosphere
whats demoted mean
Yep
hehe g'day all..
thats how they are getting up there right now
Okay, this is confusing and I want my name back
YEs
pinkie: some authority was revoked
ok
in this context, it means a character became less important
And NASA isnt just spaceflight
yeah
I want to work with the telescopes
Cloudgazer: well yeah, but that's russia, and not the US -.-
someponies are apparently saying Applejack was demoted from a Mane character to a background pony
(apparently) *

Hi
Same with Gurren Laggan
9followed by Eureka 7
Hooked on Drugs worked for me! 1-800-ABCD-LSD
9followed by Gravion
02FEATHER <3
9followed by Megas XLR
9two episodes of each show
And now DRF leaves
:P
HI!
03LOL
:3
03no
03I'm here :P
For once when
I need to study my Megas
Megas XLR >>>>>>>> Whatever the crap I previously said
9for the inauguration show
Die
9not a bad idea
9not a bad idea at all
yeah that
I know there's Real Steel coming out the weekend of my Birthday
we can see the latest and the oldest all together
Tis understandable
9what I don't know
...
9is something I still got to decide
9okay
9there are shows like Gravion
but it's only anime and no tokusatsu?
I fill mine with Melted tree's
Does that count?
02Anywho gotta restart the comp
I know, but I dealt with him :>
9Tokusatsu is for my preshows yo
I guess that makes sense
9plus I'll eventually host Toku Events
9just got to find the time for it
the best use for AOL discs I've heard of.
9anyways
9shows like Gravion
paper
AOL discs made for good coasters
9it has a 13-episode first season
9then there's season 2, Gravion Zwei
although my current coaster is a hdd platter
9I'm wondering whether to just have S2 take these show's timeslots
Same with Big-O?
Hey
9or take the timeslot for something else, and later on stream said S2
Just be careful if it's made of glass
9basically doing seasonal play here as well
Blums: the hdd platter???
9not waiting a whole season for a continuation, mind you
yeah
some of them are made of glass
9but something around the same lenght
9*length
9air it in the time slot
Or, I tried, but couldn't get any sleep even after a hour of waiting
9which do you guys prefer?
9back-to-back, or season play?
I don't think I've ever seen that.
uh, it is very much metal, and I have never heard of a glass hdd
Hmm...
well.. it acts like glass when it breaks
can glass even be magnetic?
9the first option allowsus to enjoy a full run of a show directly
its nto actually glass but breaks like glass
9the second option allows us to have a bigger variety of shows
how are you?
good
you?
You know, I think more variety might be a good thing
well, as long as I don't slam things on it, I think it'll be fine
why wold they make an HDD that breaks like glass?
...
Bye
!lullaby
HDD aren't supposed to be treated like that anyway
feeling ok. Just got through reading more on the riots in UK and came on here
Well, we're screwed.
?
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps Paintsplash

Mine just makes a really loud high pitched whine from time to time
9yeah
End of Evangelion in isolation would just be weird
That doesn't even make sense.
As did I
I was pleasently surprised.
although it was through seagate, not WD
i have a working 40mb MFM Seagate drive. brutal thing.
I can get behind that
Haha.
I still have a 128MB thumb drive, that's as low as I go.
I actually use it.
I have some ancient comp hardware sitting around
If I need to print something out, I'll throw it on there.
like a 512 KB stick of ram
wow
>mfw you stream Roujin Z
anything less and I think you'll be using a floppy disk
can not find a phone to fit it though, ha.
things massive.
the first comp my family got was a 386
That would be fairly trollface.jpg of you, even if it's a pretty good movie.

Yes.
There is just far too many people hooking up with those two...
I meant bow chicka wow wow
Why does everyone assume he's hooking up with his companions?
Rose and Martha had crushes on him, yes.
It was only like 4 people including me though
Why wouldn't he?
And I posted logs anyway
There's probably going to be somewhat constant ones now
It's not as noticeable on this picture as some other ones I've done though
You're suggesting he's a 900+ year old virgin?
Well it did say "the next pony to get it on with"
Pen sketches I have pages full of Pony.
he and Romana were totally doing it though.
It's not wrong that you d'aaawed. Mitta needs more hugs.

You could always add ponies paintsplash
D'aaaaawwwwww.

killerrabbit, whose IRC client has more features now lol?
I don't feel right arbitrarily steering the conversation...
This is depressing
/me has never used the cbox
;o
02Oh yes
hey now, that's like, 1 minor thing
and since it is open source, I could change it!
02Exactly
which... I just might
02<3
most I can do is crap and a half websites.
All I want for my birthday is a damn book and it costs $40 to ship
actually
http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E9%A6%AC%E8%B6%8A%E5%98%89%E5%BD%A6-%E6%9D%B1%E6%98%A0%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%A1%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A2%E7%B7%A8%E9%9B%86%E9%83%A8/dp/4758012210/ This one
it's more surprising to see me do things
other than nothing
and...thats a link.
It seriously blows my effing mind that it costs $40 to ship a book
its a mess
02Nah
02NS you do things, we just don't see it.
40$ for shipping? wow
02So it's surprising to actually hear you accomplished something
Perhaps you could dig up a PDF version?
Hah.
I mean, nothing beats cracking open a book.
Yeah maybe on Share.
But good luck getting connected to Share in the US
I can't read books on my comp, anything longer than 5 pages, it just isn't happening
get yourself a kindle or something
Also the book's like 2-3 weeks old
I've read a whole book on the computer actually.
A pdf likely doesn't exist
orly
Well, nothing beats cracking open a full reference book...
Man I want to like punch a goat or something
especially regarding the forum
but I had to get several in PDF for the time being...
since he set it up and I didn't and I have no fucking idea where he puts everything
02MANLY
....right! that
if that counts as en ebook :P
02~squee
"LOL CANNOT SHIP TO THIS ADDRESS"
15*WB11(drfsupercenter11)15WB* - yays~ <3 you

02Bye
I now have two fanfics in the making.
alright, now I'm feeling up to it
cya
I like it a lot, I think the light behind her head looks really nice, the framing's off, and the streak is mreeegh, but I like the rest of it
that isn't a pony!
It's not, I'm sorry.
Hang on
Lalalalalalala
i'm high.
but yeah, it is a good pic
Here http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/AND_THEY_NEVER_WILL.png
That's a pony.
Well it's three ponies.
Well, fillies, really.
lol
But, I mean.
cool cool
Well anyway
I'm going home
cya
:(
probably around 6-7
seeya >:
"all my friends are dead" storybook comes to mind...
when do you start uni?
Once there was an ugly barnacle
i think
My favorite story
nini all

go on
He was Soooooo ugly
that everybody died
the end
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
04hey NS
lol
can you reinstall tightvnc?
it's being a cockfuck
anyway, bbl
There could be plans for the CMC to get their own series
I heard that was shot down.
Ravenholdm
U sudnt come here!
Not shot down per say, just possibly postponed
And then he fired bullets out of his gun.. REALY FAST!
I have to kill fast and bullets too slow
Mane Series*
yeah.
/me has "everyone" set to auto replace with everypony
lol
Prominence:
I have to prevent myself from using everypony in skype chats
u there?
Well, the quote was just everyone
And the series would have been aimed at an even younger demographic.
inaccuracy... schmaccuracy
which makes no sense at all
dawg
Hm?
Just wonderin' how you're doin'
And how "work" is going
yeah, but not really... established
I'll leave it at that.
You're not applejack
Gotcha
their introduction in CotC would make sense in a pilot... but was absurdly awkward in an ongoing series
where they aren't going to be in the next episode
hi
Close enough.
...not sure if want
That's something Twilight would say, probably to Rarity.
/me laugh
Oh shit son.
SON
NOT SONG!
There's a low-tolerance level for it.
>,>
yeah. let's hope they get season 2 over and done with before they break off with another series.
Horseapples
Horseapples, that's a good one.
>mane 6 as filles
how would that even work? they have established first meetings already
seems more like an applejack euphamism
"OH SHI--"
lol
'cause they're both jerks.
Dash is sometimes not a jerk!
Haha.
Ones slightly less jerky
Applejack's is "What the hay"
Yeah like once a week.
She's pretty jerky in FWF though...
I mean not spin off.
also jerky at the end of ticketmaster
Yeah and in like 25 other episodes.
yeah
Blums, that's amusingly jerky though.
"But the rainbow one kicked me" *rainbow nods contently*
And she was like 'Later, bros!'
I was thinking more the intolerance of Fluttershy
'cause she did that.
``but the rainbow one kicked me'' *nod* is one of my favorite parts actually :D
but I think its all good.
for season 2 atleast.
Lookit! http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/dash_is_kind_of_a_dick.gif
because most jerks are.. bad?
Dash comes through when she has to though
/me wonders if using that face was really necessary
l8r Blu--
/me missed.
BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
/me /QQs
Laterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
whoops

He didn't waste much time.

well as lomng as the animation and the look of the characters stay the same
That's guranteed :)
The characters?
yes
probab;y.
the kick I described?
They won't sell toys if they go changing crap up.
right
Though they managed just fine with the gen 4 toys compared to gen 1
kick kick kick!
you only have to look at the pound puppies , in the 1980's 2 seasons and yet such different looking characters
puch punch punch!
kick punch it's all in the mind
wrong…how?
(ignore the drunkard please)
And they won;t ignore money :P
kz
They might even bring back the Sea Serpent and Manticore
(not really…)
Mustache.
hehe
04How are you?
Maybe another episode with the Poison Joke
but with different characters being affected
lol
lol
I feel dumb right now
and I don't know how to unignore people
:(
That ain't even a proper comparison
romana.
/ignore help didn't help
back in the 80's anything went. 90's to pretty much now, there are standards.
which you don't break, especially if the show is for a toy line.
12you made drf mad
Lol
help ignore
i use that face periodicly ;p
Or /help ignore
well standards as far as success.
Though that would explain The Legend of Zelda's failure
I enjoyed the innuendo's of 90's cartoons, they make them just as fun to watch now as back then.
yupers
*smooch* Good night everybody
night barry
same
sleep good
night night barry.sweet pony dreams!
oh
