Aircrafter: But it wouldn't be Flutterbitch
imagine if apple jack did that to them
Owned
I thought the same thing, just fly over XD
Act like a cock(head)
lol u show em
Because everypony knows Point and Click game heroes are either Jerks, wimps, or a combination of the two
That's still not how it works, Fluttershy
So basically this episode is discorded Fluttershy extended version
Dken2021: what's what I said
the pink and yellow one is a stand up, i now love her
and they could be talking and walking
Six, I think.
emangamer: Jersery Shore is worse
God I love Flutterbitch.
wasn't she crazy???
lol blue pony
I thought that was trixie at first.
AttackWithHugs: ...True.
mostly wimps

Dear Celestia. I have learned that being a bitch also helps me get everything I want. I think this will lead to ultimate friendship. -Fluttershy

Rarity was obviously visiting pinkie pie

/me believes that she will get the Friendship Express soon

D:

what about flying the frogs to the bog is season 1?
Frankly all these ponies scare me, I would not want to know how Rarity would react to my lack of cleanliness
theres taxis?
why are you expecting a shipping label from activision?
o.o
The only thing I don't like about this ep. is that there's no RD, TS or AJ
she snapped D:
ooo hes gonna get it good
Lol, got swarmed last season, now they're all afraid of her.
O.o
it was bound to happen
Minno Taur
rarity is obviously doing some clothing in the house

RAWRity: I suggest flutterbondage, Angel is already on it!
LOL

Pinkie Pie Scares me and I hate Hard work, so AJ's out
RAWRity: I would help you, but she feels regret. So you need to put it away
mentortor
Cypresswolf: there are windows
11,01No BDSM talk.
I'm not saying it as a joke, as a Fluttershy fan, I was honestly devastated by this. It's a great episode, but it still hurts.
Iron Will smells like peanut butter beef jerky
The Door....
Boarded up everything then climbed down the chimney
And here's the point where everyone was making "Shed" jokes when the episode first aired
they still have to appeal to the original intended demographic
bdsm talk D:?
anyone else see SHED.MOV
now you have cookiee confidence
Me
Oh leave Iron Will alone, it's not his fault you went overboard on his seminar.
lmao
man, the way they did the animation in that scene is pretty great
Me
dat animation
dovahkin fluttershy
yea
Yup
SHIT BLUE MINOTAUR
me

The Game
Shed.mov is an abomination
dat punchline
peanut Butter beef jerky actually sounds pretty awesome...
Monstershy
BILLY MAYS HERE
emangamer: Sorry. It's a rule that if you make Rarity cry, you have to die. Same thing happened to Sweetie Belle after Sisterhooves Social
Fourth wall

RAWRity: But Sweetie Belle doesn't have feelings. She's a bot.
HAY HAY HAY!!
oky doky
thats a nimon from doctor who
I love it when they accent Rarity with a harpsichord like that.
4s much as I love Iron WIlls VA, I really wish Macho Man Randy Savage was still alive to voice Iron Will.
RAWRity: umm...idk to what you are reffering
:D even the bird houses are boarded up
okie dokie lokie
look at that tie, guys. It makes his entire character imo
AttackWithHugs: You leave Sweetie Belle alone.

/me wonders what greek creature they'll have next on the show
Executive producer: Barack Obama

No and no, just never really looked into it
Have nothing against it
recently ive been hearing that the ending sucks and its got a lot of fans pissed
I heard that the fact that a big part of the storyline in a dlc is only available if you pay more for the game
That hae some people mad
Have*
oh is that it? well i need to look into it more cause i really dont want to do any downloading unless i really have to

Duh, what you think i play mw3 cause of its "amazing" story line? :P

Probably
36 bucks for 1 year
yeah that sounds good
Hehe
I don't play online enough to try it though
Oh, thats too bad
I love me some co op

:/
I sowwy
ill have to play this later
Alrighty
I still have to do more things until I can get to the mainland
Yea
Freaki lame
<Ken> [04:26:03] Though it might be in the gline list
I glined the entire range
hmm
k
Ban evader eh?
hm
:::: (  ) ( Seen ) j0rd4n ( jordan@hooh-A602196.dslgb.com ) was last seen when ( Quitting from: #true-flame ) ( Stating: Connection reset by peer ) [ 6hrs 28mins 57secs ] ago
Ken
no we know
the entire isp is glined infact
might try gzlining him too
jordan@*.dslgb.com is what is banned
ya
he's not comming back
flimsy ban.
he's a dumbass
You might try something like *@*
no
then the isp
he's a dumbass
is he?
he wouldn't know how to change his ident
Java nub then?
no
just a dumbass
8D
Umm I'm confused, I haven't done it in a while, how do you add a gline?
If you say so
anyways i kinda want him to evade
/gline +0 <hostname wildmask>
so i can abuse the fuck out of his client
k
that's a perma I think
XD
Dawnfire: The longer the better
muwhahahahaha
What?
the + is the time.
Isn't it /gline hostname time reason?
hmm
/me sighs and googles
You're right Iago
XD
XD
***** Gline *****
[07:50:22] -
[07:50:22] This command provides timed G:Lines. If you match a G:Line you cannot
[07:50:22] connect to ANY server on the IRC network
[07:50:22] A time of 0 in the GLINE makes it permanent (Never Expires).
[07:50:22] You may also specify the time in the format 1d10h15m30s.
[07:50:22] IRC Operator only command.
[07:50:22] -
[07:50:22] Syntax: GLINE <user@host mask or nick> [time] <reason>
yeah
:x
heh
Fun
XD
wb
I forgot what I put for his ban reason
been a while since I oper'd
pff who needs a reason.
XD
oh
"Go the fuck away"
HAHAHA
said guy is a fuckface though
so that's appropriate
so /gline jordan@*.dslgb.com 0 You are not wanted on any network ?
Indeed
Works
yeah Ken
k
don't forget the +0
or you can gline *@*.dslgb.com
no need for =
er +*
The line Iago said would be good
tis' just 0
up to you
So host reason?
probably akill would be better
yeh
if you have anope
I think they do
I might akill, we were playing with it earlier
-> /os akill add 0 *@*.dslgb You are not welcome here.
or something
Yup Anope 1.8.7
WIN
I'm running 1.8.7 or somewhat
Dawnfire: You don't know what net I'm talking about
Maybe I do
maybe I don't
I assume this one
Dun discount me because I switch reason and time fields. 'tis that way on older versions of unreal, pre 3.x
and a few other ircds
Ken's not talking about this one
and fuck, forgot that akill added the oper's nick
I hate that
Eh
Doesn't matter.
Not like he can bitch much
well one moment
he's banned TROLOL
nicve
what the fuck was my pass
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
atcha
shesh
I use an alias
and /ns group
you'd have to group the nick anyway to use OS
it won't answer to unreg'd nicks
Iago I don't give a fuck if my nick is there, he can kiss my fanny
;p
and OS would use your Display nick
/ns set display <nick> would be required
>:D
Win
workarounds, go!
Ken, I don't either
yah
but having my nick there is just dodgy
probably will mod anope one day
just not now
J0rd4n you did this yourself, don't believe me *paste*
But nobody wants to be biched at while on anothr net
yah
LOOOOOOOOOOL
lmfao
ogod
I 13♥ your style
XD
"How the fuck did I add my self to the akill list? o.O"
lmfao
"Douchery"
"Must be part of services, haven't figured it fully out"
"Anope hates it"
well I have gb and obsidian added to spamfilter for warning
LOL
for ease of use
Iago: Even if opers say it does it echo?
who the fuck wants to look through a fuckton of longs
huh, Ken?
say what?
Ie the spamfilter
uhm
nope
only uses
btw
users
k
also, !pants
/raw help snomasks
yeah I know Dawnfire
you could learn some snomasks and set those
xD
I have all the snomasks mainly for tracking purposes
/me can't have snomasks ._.
Ken, type !pants
or Dawnfire
>:D
XD
trolol
evulz Iago
You did that for the evulz
XD
XD
wb
*** Ken [Iota@hooh-F8FEFE6C.elitebnc.net] has quit [brb putting on pants]
>:D
bwhahahahaha
you -could- set up BNC accounts and give each a snomask and load the watch module.
ass
>.>
and have each one print to diff oper only channels
XD
Dawnfire, fuxing lazy
I'm on a BNC anyway
I know
but not hard.
yeah
well, I'd rather write a script
tis' far easier
That works too
and better
might just stick it on ESG
anyway
I actually have a server notice monitor script myself
Ah
I'm on xchat
/me forgets where the code is tho
oh
well atm I'm on CGI:IRC
yah mIRC much better.
mIRC's better for scripting
almost essential for opers
xchat's better for actual use though
who want to script anything
well, xchat is better
Vanilla vs Vanilla
yes
I actually have an oper panel
mIRC will crash under most stress tests
Xchat wins
oper panels suck cocks
Shut it, it works
lrn2oper
commands <3
and alias
alises
but mIRC can do pretty well under stress
aliases
depends
Presea completely fucked all the mIRC oper clients on here yesterday
hehehehehe
howso?
Iago: KeiichiNetRadio on Rizon
spammage?
with the amount of snomasks and notices that were printing
trolol
sajoin spam
This is why
a ban evader was asking for it
timer 0 0 and everything
you build scripts to detect that
and set snomasks off
and + there was services log chan going on as well
he kept joining under new nicks and ips
so
if the snotices get crazay
it derped the clients
and flooddetach would mitigate that via ZNC
my xchat was fine though
eh
they're not on ZNC
or script to detect and autopart
and it was snotices
I'm too lazy to do that
lol
pff
and that's the first time it's happened anyway
it's maybe 10 lines of code
so
true
and it never hurts to be prepared
probably
I'll make do when I get home
If one makes scripts to avoid mIRC's weaker usecases
it's rock solid
and it's only heel is flud
so
flood mitigation scripts go a long way
well
I kinda want to see things sometimes honestly
True
xchat's better for opers
This is why I suggested bouncing oper'd mIRC operbots
on larger networks
heh
well as long as things work it's fine
ZNC's flood detach module alone works wonders and it updates the client on re-attach with a piece of the action
if you config it right
though with Presea's sajoin spam we had about I dnno
lol
yeah
heh i lagged the bnc
if i recall
50 lines a second?
I dunno
you accept that danger with Presea
lmfao yeah
He's pretty awesome but scary
XD
I can flood shit too but lol I'm not oper'd so I flood myself out usually
XD
Then you had Moot_AI last night and the night before... da fuck
lol
oh fuck

hi
07It has been a long time.
07I can't even remember what name I used here.
07XD
orly
07Yeah.
what about forum names
07Ah, I see.
07Can't expect everyone to keep the same name for so long :P
07Ah, yes, now I remember.
07Fuck, can't remember the password though.
one sec
>_>
Yeah, definitely forgot the password.
i force id'ed you
Ah, I see.
07So, how are you?
i'm alright
07I assume that's a very (or at least relatively) complex bot?
ya
extremely complex
07What does it do?
been working on it since 2006
07Ah, shit son.
07That's a long time.
04What's NS' bot again? The really annoying one?
04derpbit that's it
04bot*
derpbot
07So uh... Anyone here read homestuck?
oddly i've randomly read it
07All of it? It took me like, six days of morning to night reading to get through it. And there's been a lot of updates since then XD
na not all of it
i just randomly read it
07Ah.
i blame raichukitten for linking me to it though
07Pfft
07Did you get to the fucked up troll romance part? Holy shit that was confusing DX
lol it's been awhile though
seen like 400 anime series or so since i last read any of that web comic
been keeping up with grim tales and ppgd and randomly looking for group
although i should catch up on this i guess
04Homestuck is too large for me
07It's like, thousands of pages long.
won't stop me
07Either 3000 or 6000, I can't remember.
04hey Presea
04I assume you've seen PMMM?
madoka?

04And you're lucky I just got back XD
XD
/me hugs Drake
about to piano though
04aww
/me hugs back
penis
:3
04I do indeed have one.
04The scary thing is one of my friends has a whole archive of penises from pictures guys who wanted to get in her pants sent her.
04It's creepy, and I felt like vomiting when I accidentally saw several ;_;
orly
04yarly
heh you don't have the mind of a doctor
a body part is a body part
04No I do not
then again i might be like that because i'm asexual
04probably
04Lack of sexual attraction probably contributes to a lack of a sense of privacy with body parts usually associated with sex and sexual attraction
no idea why im' like this btw
ya
04Hey, if you're not turned on by /either/ boobs or dicks, that ain't my problem.
i might be attracted to non-gender humans
/me hide
[19:55:57] <Drake> The scary thing is one of my friends has a whole archive of penises from pictures guys who wanted to get in her pants sent her.
what
04That was my reaction
why would she archive them
anyways
free porn i guess
other then that i see no point
OH WAIT
black mail
04XD
04I'll admit, I can see why a lot of guys want her
04She's pretty attractive
heh
alot pigs then
sending her those photos
anyways it's better to like someone for who they are
ppl are so stupid at times :<
04I agree completely
04To both points
anyway bbl piano
o/
hmm
hi
hi
How are you?
i'm alright
cool
ugh, same old boring day.
yo
how are ya?
Fine thanks, you?
doing good
Are you seeing people post this Kony video everywhere too?
uh no?
what is it?
'Make Kony famous' is basically the idea, so everyone knows about this guy and his crimes, 30 years of forcing kidnapping and killing children, forcing them to be soldiers, kill their own parents and other people
are they doing that because he was recently captured?
Nah, he hasn't been captured.
They're trying to make it happen
Considering how everyone knows about Gadaffi, Mugabi, and loads of other dictators I'm surprised by how few people (including myself) have heard of this guy.
yeah
so...what have you been up to lately?
no plans yet on registering the channel? heh
I thought you were the only one who could do it since your at the top
or have ops if thats what its called
That's just because I'm always connected to the channel, if everyone leaves, the channel doesn't exist any more, so the first person to join gets op
Ive been wondering when it will come to a point that nobody else knows this channel is around
is it posted anywhere?
Well, on SF
And a few other places
spyroforums?
Yeah
"Join us on SpyroChat, the largest live Spyro chatroom!"
>two people
Lul
...
Is there another spyro chat room?
I dunno
Maybe not
If DS has one, it's probably active
Unlike here
:P
if there is one
I probably would want to join it
I really dont see this place turning around
Yeah, not likely.
Especially with SR AWOL most of the time, and not appointing any site admins.
do you go to any other irc channels?
Pretty much just the main channel of this network, though there isn't that much chat there.
This network's pretty dead as of a while ago.
ive been going to a yoshi fan channel for the past 6 years
not sure if your a big nintendo fan though
I'm not a huge Nintendo fanboy
I like them, but that's about as far as it goes
hm..
I guess I can check to see if theres an irc channel for DS
but its probably unlikely
it doesnt look like theres anything irc related on the other site
lol
it just links to here
when I searched for an irc channel
there are some discussions about this channel on the forums
they really need to change that description
smallest chatroom lol
you still there dari

show your heavy bias why dont you
What?
wat
what indeed
what are you talking about
who is Zealot anyways.
Acting ignorant does not save you.
Just saying.
none of us know what the fuck he was being biased about
who said i needed saving?
dunno what you were talking about you were being annoying so instead of banning you which came to mind first i set those modes
Zealot, one thing
but i guess next time i'll just kick ban ya
stop being a fucktard or I'll ban you off the network
Come at me.
I don't care.
Well sure
12Hive mind
/me runs
not nice to let your teenager angst speak for y
well shit
i suppose i was too nice
lol
I'm tired of him
nice mods are required i think. XD
it's a 24 hour ban
he's been being a dick recently, to be honest
I'm fucking tired
who is Zealot, does he go by another name?
12anyhow, I forgot to turn off that script before I went idle
.
oh that guy.
don't do it again
yeah
I know Drake is sick of him too
which he doesn't use
he's gotten much more annoying the past couple of weeks, idk
meh
well
anyway now that it's active here
WHAT'S UP EVERYONE ;O;
if you want him back
I can remove the ban
and just ban him from this chan
in school
nah i dont mind, he's been being a dick, let him wait
watching some lame video
Alright
it's only 24 hours
what's the lame video about
12I won't, I even made sure derpbot was off before I left. It was Zealot that turned it back on I guess :/
but hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
uh
I forgot
that's pretty dull
I think it's called "The gods must be crazy" or something
heh
is it B/W
nope
everytime my school made us watch stuff it was always from like the 1950s and in B/W
so...... boring...
XD

okie
hm
what is it anyways
anything usful?
star wars stuff
god, dropbox's servers are sloooooooow
oh star wars
only watched the movies once in my life
didn't watch all of the 2nd one
Ah
I like the 3rd episode
ya i liked that one
but i only randomly caught it on tv
haven't been watching tv for the past few years so heh
Ah
I say you need to watch some television.
how
i don't have cable
nor satilight and i live about 50 miles from any city in a small town
i do have one of those HD tuners but it picks up maybe 2-3 channels randomly
50 from any city?
and it's just covered with blocky garbage
50 miles*
i see.
that's why
oh before the switch to digital i got in like 10 channels
but nope they had to force everyone to switch
hmm well it's more like 60miles
damn
How long have you been in the town?
this town? about 9 months
the last town i was in was about 8miles closer to the city
but reception was still poor
so i never bothered to watch tv
i'm not the type to listen to radios either
Good thing the net there is quite fair.
oh it's kinda weird
why is that?
you have a choice between 256k dsl, or 12mbps or 20mbps broadband
sure i could get cable out here
but i have no income
i'm on someone else's connectoin
connection*
which just happens to be 256k dsl
oh.
too bad.
radio's been kinda
annoying as of late
lol
the state passed this tax law

well, it's hard to get a job in there isn't it?
since you're too far away from the city
hardly anything is around.. it's worse then normal
there's alot of empty buildings where stores used to be
heh one of them was converted into a house
it sat there for so long
i guess the town allowed it

ogod
i don't even know what mass effect is
/me is assuming it's like a halo game
D:
action roleplaying game
made by BioWare/EA...
oh
it's like fallout
i guess
yeah
heh i was addicted to fallout for awhile
after i nuked the town while laughing manically
i didn't really get anymore thrills out of it
i either like games where you can level cities
or if it's in classic rpg style
oh
or w/e the hell harvest moon and the sims fall into
/me hide
i've also gotten bad endings on some havest moon games
which is very amusing
harvest moon a wonderful life, if you fuck up enough after having a kid your wife and kid both leave you and the game ends
although honestly you have to be Trying to mess up in those games
to get an ending like that
heh well
you can get the first bad ending easy
by never talking to girls
never get married
you leave the farm and the game ends
the ps2 version of the game is pedo-ish
>_>
you can date a fucking 10 year old
._.
in the other games
lol
when you have a kid and he grows up
he can marry that girl
but in the ps2 version
you can marry her
it's just not right
o-o
game's so odd
oh and grapes
they grow on trees
in that game
Oh also if you watch tv all the time
a random talking alein plant will come to the farm
alien*
well it's just weird
uh what
i know right
you can also befriend a hippy
lolwtf
lmfao.
but in the game in another wonderful life you play as a girl dating guys in the same town
you can Marry the hippy
idk the game's addicting
been playing it since the snes version
although the n64/ps1 versions are more fun then that game
anyways
http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/15200000/Harvest-Moon-Another-Wonderful-Life-harvest-moon-15246757-800-600.jpg
._.
lol
i've been a fan of harvest moon longer then pokemon has been around i guess
speaking of pokemon
in the n64 game, there's a reference to pokemon in it
if you marry another girl besides karin she'll get married, and have a kid, and her kid wears pikachu baby clothing
kinda funny because the game cameout before the anime for pokemon
heh i'm probably the only harvest moon fan here
nope.
orly
I'm a fan of harvest moon since gba.
ah
those linked with a wonderful life and another wonderful life

/me slaps Xanbreon
;___;
NS, if you saw what i said on tst then you'll know why im crying now. ;-;
o-o?
o_O
sigh
What's happened with her this time? >:
/me hugs back ;-;
she's in that suicidal state of mind again ;__;
she thought she was annoying mne
me*
._.
i tried my best to save her ;-;
ow :/
but i think this time i failed.
Don't think that
but it might be true ;________;
Someone went suicidal?
dont worry abou tit
about it*
Nobody ever successfully commits sideways anymore
Rest easy
?
Suicide is a serious issue, if I can help in some way I will.
theres nothing to do really ;-;
its only up to me ;-;
to save her
There is always the step that is looked upon as cruel, but it works
Call the ploice.
*police
im multitasking
I like you already
text spamming her and talking on here
for advice
If you know her adress, direct the police there.
Now.
Police rarely works and only serves to destroy trust
^
thats why i refuse to call them
How would you feel if your girlfriend called the police on you because you were in a suicidal state of mind?
Would you ever trust them again?
i wouldnt really know.
That depends
That is an absolute lie.
Do I want to die, or do I want to be saved
If the former, I would be mad
If the latter, I would thank them
^
It does depend
but often at the moment it does happen it often will create a rift at the very least
I would not lose any trust at all. I would thank them.
Because they saved my life.
That's because you have something to live for
Better create a rift than let them go through with it
True dat
Often people want to suicide because they're depressed or have nothing to life for, in other words
And since the person in question is talking to someone about it, I'm going with wanting to be saved
If I wanted to die, I wouldn't tell anyone, I would just do it
Probably, but still
Unless it gets to a really bad stage
I've been down the road of major depression several times. All it takes is a good wake-up slap to get out of it.
It's not always that easy
I usually just get over it on my own
Being a guy, suffering in silence, etc.
You know how it is
Actually, it has worked twice before on people I don't even know IRL.
Overall I agree with the whole cop thing, because a) obviously doesn't actually want to die due to talking to people about it, and b) better to create a rift than let them go through with it
Unless you are confident you can pull them out yourself
welp
i think she really did do it this time ;___;
OMG SHE ANSWERED
THANK FUCK
brb
saving her
Good luck
IF it is needed, you can have a friend or someone enrage them. If they're mad, they'll be raging at said person instead of killing themselves. Giving you more time. I've seen this in use before.

hang on
Is that an e3 skylander?
Holding
New york toys fair. If that isnt the same thing
ah alright
I need that shit
Im seriously considering spending $170 on one
well expect to pay a lot for it :P
oh really?
No joke
Mhmmm
are you in college right now or did you graduate?
Silly boy
uhh yes?
Im still in high school
Im flattered though
I'm not use to high school kids spending that much on game stuff :P
Only spyro stuff
Other wise ill just take the disk and a few dlc thanks
heh impressive
What is?
that youd be willing to spend that much on spyro
Dont you mean stupid? Not inpressive? :P
I only know of one other person who spends a lot on spyro stuff
why stupid?
Im sure a lot of people would consider me that for spending so much. And selling a chunk of my soul to these things
I think my mom does
well
But its my money so...
youd think otherwise if youve seen some friends of mine
I know a few that are very serious collectors
Probably, i dont have hardley anyone that collects hardcore
well what do you consider hardcore collecting?
Spending $170 or more on a little toy
lol
thats nothing really
That is just barely different than the original
I know someone who spent more than that
I need to make more internet friends :P
for spyro stuff
Nu uh
Did I tell you about my friend who bought a spyro press reporter kit?
Idk what that is
And no
Its a pack of information/pictures sent from the company who made spyro to reporters to write about it
think he spent $700 to buy it
Oh fuck
I imagine it would be worth a lot
To the right people
yep
the best thing in the reporter kit was a glass globe that had the spyro logo inside it
Dammmmmmit
Im jealous now
why?
Want
I doubt youl find one
I know lol
He told me only two have shown up on the internet in the past 10-12 years
Wasnt planning on looking. And thats why
thats when he bought one of em
Oh
er the kit I mean
Ohh
Sooooo

One of my friends was bidding on this
He lost though :/
How much did he bid?
uhhh
I dont remember
Oh
maybe $325?
Well that went up
yep lots of spyro collectors
it wasnt like this a few years ago
back then you could find some rare spyro stuff cheap
now its so damn expensive
I know
Damn, 27 min left on this special sparkle cynder, $224 though
I could et i cheaper on amazon
Could i make a lower bid on it then it is? No one else has put a bid in
no you cant bid less than whats shown
you could watch it and see if it is relisted at a lower price
But the thing is when you buy these skylanders figures you use em right?
or do you not open them?
I use them. Im aware of what that'll do
Id like to buy two of each if possible
But i never plan on selling any of it, except the ds version when it comes in, gonna sell the game portal and stealth elf
but cant be spending that much cash on that stuff
Mhm
I still havent opened up that ds version of skylanders yet :P
Lol geeze. Oh shit, found one with 2 hours left, $165...
God im soooo tempted
Well if you get it I hope you wrap it in plastic lol
What mean?
do you have a spot where you put your rare figures?
Lol what rare
Thisll be my first "rare" i guess
oh
I dont have any gold or silver or anything
I ment like game stuff in general
Oh. Theyre pretty dang safe
Could be safer though, but yeah believe me id be very careful with her
Most of my collectables are in separate plastic bags
Oo
If you remember the spyro pics I had, they were all wraped in clear bags
I think i do
I think im gonna bid
how much time left?
Hit
Shit
?
Dont think im gonna bid
I was going to say dont bid until the last 5 seconds
Im to young to make an account...lol
it gives the current bidder time to outbid you
lol
I know
oh yeah, gotta be 18
Fucking lame
Its because you need a checking account/credit card
Yeah
I honestly think its too expensive
Oh well its probably better this way, more skylanders and other stuff
Oh it is
Im just an obsessive whore
:P

I'm bidding on this soon
Whats its importance?
Yoshis island for one
its not the players choice box
Yeaahhhhh im not that big on video games so...explain?
I like having all of my games in the original packaging
Oh i see now
Most of my game collection is in its original case/box
Well...arnt most peoples? Mine are
not really
Oh
most people throw em away
hence why they are collectable
Game boxes?
yep
same for game console boxes
Why......loo
Lol*
a N64 console box can be sold for $20-30 bucks
Oo
The real valuable ones are game consoles youve never heard of
Lol i bet
sorry if I'm boring you :P
I research this stuff because I sometimes sell it at my store
Your not lol im just not sure what your talking about
oh I see
Well i do...not all of it
Bleh
Lol
well
So hows mass effect?
basicly I try to collect whatever is rare/valuable
Hopefully that pays off
it has so far :)
Yay
I havent opened my mass effect copies yet
Oh for the love of
no time to play a whole new game yet :P
Lol
Ive got maybe 10 games I still need to beat
Dang
Vanquish, Ratchet & clank, spyro enter the dragonfly, halo 2
rayman 3d, marioland 3d
I usually beat mine pretty fast, not 100% but still, the story mode once
oh I ment 100%
Ohhh
Lol well i havnt beaten quite a bit 100%
It took me over 1 month to beat the first mass effect 100%
Ouch
and thats playing it daily
actually no I still have a couple things missing
Lol
theres like a ton of side quests
its pretty awesome
I figured
I wouldive gone into ME3 already but Ive heard the ending is real bad
I heard that too
which is a real shame, I thought it was going to be real good...thats why I bought two collector editions >.>
Lol
one to keep one to play just like skylanders :P
:p
but it cost so damn much
You must be in the money
why do you say that?
Do buy two of everything
You buy*
I guess you could say its on the business credit card :P
Lol
I planned on selling the other
I know but still
nah I dont have a lot of cash
Oh hehe
I preordered ME3 last year
I had lots of time to put money aside for it
Lol true
In about to preorder two sick looking games
I wasnt planning to buy a 2nd copy but I heard they stopped making em cause they capped it
Whyd tey do that
I dont think any game company makes collector editions for very long
Ph
Oh
except the Halo series
they make tons of extras so its not worth much
Like legos!
a brand new copy of the first Mass effect collector edition is worth $500+
Damn
Probably
its a win win :)
Smarty panta
Pantssss
But I dont know now cause the game ending is bad
every day when I check the game forums theres so much hate on the game
Oh...hehe
Oo i got a question. Unrelated of course
?
What do you think of this kony thing?
Ive been seeing it everywhere
I remember some talk about it being a scam
but if it really is its hard to believe
I heard somethin like that
That the organization was using 70% of the money for itself
thats sad..
Quite
God some people i just wanna...uuuhg
yeah that happens lol
Lol
Im probably more extreme though :P
are you planning on getting any new games soon?
Yesssss
like what?
Bioshock infinate and borderlands 2
cool
Infinite*
Do tou want them?
You
I dont have any plans thus far
nah
Aww how come?
I rarly buy games brand new
Ohs
Ever play the first ones of them?
no but I should
havent checked to see if they are at my local gamestop
I want to play rayman orgins
Bioshock is the bomb
I heard that was good
I was going to buy it a few weeks ago but apparently they have a limited edition online
and its not sold in stores
Oo
it comes with some art book
Nice
woah this is wierd
What?
I'm checking my gamestop points card and its showing some games it says I bought
but I didnt actually buy them
and it gave me the points anyway
Uh oh
what do you mean uh oh?
if they wanna give me points randomly I'm fine with that lol
Lol idk i thought it had a bad side
I guess
Idk
I think i better go to bed *yawns*

DRAKE
04hi NS
:D
oh yeah Drake
I was thinking
we could use Avatar as inspiration
since that's technically from the future
04yes, like 500 years into the future
04but the tech is modern enough, so sure
well
the reason it's 500 years into the future
is because of the psionics and shit
and weaponry isn't actaully that advanced
obviously we won't be using the robot fighter thingies
Was mostly talking about the vehicles, Drake
like the helicopter Trudy flies
also
04sure
would we be far enough into the future
04So you want a double-rotor aircraft?
to have large aircrafts/flying bases?
well
not exactly flying bases
but
you know what I mean
and well
idk
I was mostly just looking at concepts
04You mean like the Dragon?
!attack Iago
not paying attention to details
6Omastar uses 6Blast Burn on Iago! Iago has 17 HP left!
the Dragon?
no u Umbreon
hi u
ohai
04http://www.pandorapedia.com/human_operations/vehicles/dragon_gunship
04That thing
yes, now you notice me
04Because yes, I can imagine that
04And it would be cool
yeah
04Then yes that would be awesome
04Nothing too larger than that though
well
04Because it's kind of pointless to have a flying base
would it have enough fuel to last for a month or similar?
04Just punch it out of the sky with missiles
well
maybe not a month
but
a lightweight one that's possibly smaller
04Several weeks? Depends on fuel advances and fuel consumption
that Rhy, Nathan and Leo can use as a base for missions
it'd be cool for them to use one as a mobile mission base
and they could also use one after they go into hiding
04I can't imagine a conventional aircraft too much bigger than the Dragon Gunship. It's not practical otherwise
04And no
04Because there'd need to be a crew of at least 5 for a gunship like that
wouldn't specifically have to be a gunship
mostly aerial support platform
or at least a transport one
that wouldn't require more than 2-3
04Not to mention when they're on the run, flying around in a gunship that large would set of every radar and aircraft sensor on the continent
stealth
04And I'm not even joking
04NS how the hell do you think stealth works?
okay i know I know
but
04NS look at every stealth aircraft, and you'll see that they're streamlined. A ship that remains stationary, with rotors and blades for lift, just can't maintain stealth at all.
I know I know
04I suppose it could have a signal jammer
well it'd have to have one
04And with the war going on signals being messed up in a small area wouldn't be too noticable
assuming that it'd be suitable enough
04But nevertheless I don't think Rhy, Nathan and Leo would be using a mobile aerial platform by themselves. Maybe with Indie they do, but themselves? no.
I'd say that the aircraft(s) would also be used in invasion fleets
04I can see that
since they /are/ for dropping off troops and all that
04Command aircraft to coordinate other aircraft or simply the invasion force as a whole
and I imagine Rhy, Nathan and Leo and the 2 other teams are dropped off by one of those
04Indie would have several
when they invade the communications tower/center
the US one, where they leave behind russian materials
04Maybe Rhy, Nathan and Leo can join a special black-ops group for a country that relies on rule-breaking
so it's blamed on the russians
hah
well
I imagine they'd be used in large team missions
since it's not mobile
it'd have to have escort craft, unless it has heavy swivel weaponry
could have Rhy as one of the escorters for one mission
04Well look at AVATAR.
04The Dragon Gunship does have swivel weaponry
04Which makes sense seeing it's basically a helicopter
You wouldn't let Rhy have one on her fighter ):
04Because it's a fighter jet.
04Fighter jets don't work like that!
It can still have one
):
doesn't matter
anyway
04Helicopters nearly ALWAYS have some sort of swivel turret
probably
anyway
we've already decided on Rhy's
04No swivel guns.
04Rocket pods
I don't think the gunships would have too much weaponry
04Folding missile rack
because I don't think they'd be too advanced by that stage
yes I know
but yeah
not a whole shitload of weaponry
while it'd still be a heavy-weapon classed aircraft
it can't be something with over 9000 guns or something
because that's unrealistic
by 2077 or whatever we decided on, I"ll look it up later
it's only around 75 or so years from now
04yeah
04But two computer-controlled automatic gatling guns, several missile pods and guided missiles, and that should do it.
04Maybe with a side gunner or two
04limited long-range weaponry, but perfectly capable of defending itself against hostile ground forces while it deploys
probably bombs as well
04One or two
TNT etc.
well
it's still a weapons platform
and it'd be liable to do a LOT of air-ground attacks
since it'd probably be a half-bomber in a sort of way
and well
there'd be different classes
04true
could probably use a system similar to Star Wars'
theta-class, delta-class, alpha-class, etc.
Google is developing reality augmentation glasses.
lolwut
Yes.
o-o
Drake
http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Galactic_Empire_starship_classes
04Acclamater Assault Ship
04NS, any craft can just be named after anything, then slap some numbers and letters in front or behind it and it looks official
Well Drake
it'd be nice to create some classes
so the order of power is easier to read off
04Choose a theme
greek letters
04Alrighty
or
04That's not overused at all but ok
you could do something like
assault-class, defender-class, etc.
04Hold up
04Here are some of my examples I've made
and greek letters are simple
that's why they're used
or
we could use elements
0422B Incisor helicopter, colloquially known as "The Scissor"
or simple numbers but that's boring and hard to remember
0418T Heavyweight
What the hell are you two talking about
22B, 18T?
.
04RIN "Lovecraft" Archer
Drake
04NS, like I said, random number
thanks NS
your classes make no sense at all
Well Drake
04Just say, "Model 22, Class B"
by classes
I mean CLASSES
So Rhy's was
/me checks logs
77C Mod 49.
Drake
Rhy's was/is Theta-class Aetherwing Stealth Intercepter X9450
intercepter/interceptor
w/e
04Sure
04Let's go with that
that's what I have in my logs
Class, Model Type, [Stealth], Aircraft Type, Model Number
I randomly stuck the class bit in before, Drake, so that can be changed anytime
and uh, Model Name not Model Type
04Alright, that works
but yeah
I'm talking classes
not model numbers
[19:45:02] <~Iago> greek letters
[19:45:14] <~Iago> you could do something like
[19:45:23] <~Iago> assault-class, defender-class, etc.
so what should we use?
weapons is kinda redundant and confusing
and sounds lame
mountains...how would that work Drake?
and cities is just sad
04Trebuchet-Class Leviathan Heavy Command Gunship V397
04DAMN that sounds cool
actually Drake, we could use something like Fighter-class, Destroyer-class, Executor-class, etc.
haha yes
class is a bit weird though
we could remove that entirely
but
04Why would we need that for a command gunship?
it'd be easier to identify it though
04Not really.
04Maybe the manufacturer?
because the classes would be a certain specifications of things it has and can do
No...
04Or the actual name of the craft?
No
04Since nearly all aircraft are named by their pilots
Leviathan/Aetherwing are the craft names
model names
basically
04I thought we called it-
let me explained it
-ed
the aircraft is named Skyscraper but the model name is Aetherwing
ANYWAY
basically
something like a Gamma-class fighter would have bare minimum basic weaponry, moderate speeds, basic stealth capabilities, and so on
04If we have a model name why do we need a class?
something like a higher Delta-class fighter would have more weaponry with more missiles that can do damage etc.
because that's the name
04Because the model has it's own specs and uses
the class is for identifying what sort of grade it is
put it this way
the class is basically the aircraft's grade
how well it performs, etc.
so basically a Gamma-class aircraft would be expected to lose against a Delta-class aircraft
because the Delta-class aircraft is known to have better specs etc.
04Well that's stupid
assuming I got the greek letter order correct
Oh?
04Who tests the aircraft?
manufacturers?
04How can it be accurately tested that they will lose?
04Yes
it's not tested that they WILL lose
it's their stats that decide the class
04Because a Russian manufacturer will really get the oppurtunity to test it against a US craft
No
it doesn't need to be tested
it's graded via its specs
it's estimates
04And the manufacturers all agree on this.
04Highly unlikely.
it's international standard.
04More than likely they'd keep the specs quiet to all but the people they're selling them too.
besides
it's easier to class them
makes things easier to identify
and models can have different levels of classes
so you can have a Delta-class Aetherwing, Gamma-class Aetherwing, etc. etc.
besides
a lot of aircraft specs ARE made public you know
04You should also realise that that would be a single manufacturer making the same aircraft model over and over again for the entire greek alphabet
what?
no, I don't think you get it
pilots do make modifications
and so on
while originally something might be classed as a theta-class aircraft
it might be raised to a delta-class after it's been modified
although that's slightly dodgy
but whatever
still
it makes things easier to identify
04If a pilot makes modifications then it really can't be classified because it's so different from the norm, and there's not saying that they're similar to other "Delta-class" craft
are you seriously going to bother remembering the fucking specs of EVERY SINGLE AIRCRAFT we make?
okay that's true
but still
classes aren't extremely specific
they're just sort of like "Speed: 1500mph-2000mph" or whatever speed range is possible, and so on
for each category
04I can see that happening for each spec (Speed, Fireposer etc.) but for each craft as a whole? No.
what
04An Aetherwing might have "Delta-Class" speed, and another Aetherwing might have "Gamma-Class" speed, but I don't see them as entirely worthy of a complete title
if you're going to rate the speeds
you may as well just put the specific range
or do it and then average it out to make a class to actually grade the aircraft
in total
because it makes no sense to do it for each individual category
besides, as I said
this makes it easier on us
and the readers
04No, it actually makes it more confusing
are we going to fucking state the specs of EVERY single fucking aircraft every time it comes up?
04No, but adding "classes" when we already have a "model" is stupid
04You don't see various classes of F-22's do you?
by classes, the reader gains a general idea of the specs of the aircraft
there's a difference between model and class
models are far too specific
they're names
and require dealing out specs for each
04not really
04"X" model is a stealth aircraft used by the US. "Y" is an air-to-air craft used by the US. "Z" is an air-to-ground craft used by the Russians.
model names
what part of that
don't you understand?
they're not TYPES
they're NAMES
like Raptor, etc.?
04WHY THE FUCK WOULD A MODEL HAVE SEVERAL TYPES WHEN IT IS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR A CERTAIN GODDAMN ROLE?
lolwut?
as I said
Models
are specific
Classes give a general idea
they're not MEANT to be specific
04But why would a craft need classes
04Why
04Give a general idea of WHAT?
because it helps make it easier to recognise what something can do
04But each model of craft has a role. We explain that. Done and dusted. They know what it is meant to do.
Yes we do
But going into specs and speed? nope
we're not going that far
by using classes we can give readers a general idea of the craft and not go into detail every single time
04We don't have to by simply mentioning models.
04"This model is a stealth fighter."
04Done. No more needs to be said.
yeah, and obviously said stealth fighter is fast or slow?
or how much weaponry it has?
or what stealth capabilities it has? and so on?
04Now YOU'RE going too in-depth
That's what I mean by classes
04Unless the crew is using it, we really don't need to go to in-depth
It shows the BASICS of that
and gives a GENERAL idea
04Goddamnit NS you're making it far too complex
without us having to go into detail every time
you're not getting the point
lol we spent the last half an hour arguing about this
but seriously Drake
04You know what
04Do what you want
04I don't want to keep arguing over something like this.
you're an asshole Drake :)
04As are you
feeling's mutual then
/me hugs Drake
/me hugs back
we need to make some model names and such
04I'd rather not right now
04After Mass Effect 2, I need some violent, mindless killing.
04Mass Effect 3*
04And I need to work on DoI
/me stabs Drake
no u
04May hasn't responded to me in ages, which is pissing me off because she was meant to write the next chapter, which I now have to do.
04I want to keep writing, but I'm not sure if using her characters without her to oversee it is really right.
04Problem is, I've integrated them into the story far too much to change it now
04I also have a feeling she doesn't see the story as seriously as I do.
that's the problem with co-authoring
04If it's IRL it's not that bad.
04And online as long as you have a good way to stay in contact...
04But damn I'm pissed off
04I spent 3 years planning this, ironing out every kink and plothole
04I'm not giving up on it.
04Even if I can't do anything with it, I want it written.
.-.
well
write it then
you don't have to post it
04I am. Slowly.
well
good luck
I finished Reminiscence
after
I lost count of how long
04Heh, I'll probably show it to all my friends, but that's about it.
04XD
042 years?
042 and a half?
yeah
I didn't exactly plan it though
that's why it's so shit :{D
04I overplan things
04as evidenced by DoI
04BUT THE CONTINUITY IS WORTH IT
well
I was noobish when I first started Reminiscence
and it was my first proper fic
so
04As was I with the first DoI, thus why I re-made it
I want to remake Reminiscence
except I don't think I'll finish it
and I want to do Leader's Legacy
04XD
04Just write it on-and-off
04No need to put enormous amounts of time into it
that's the thing
you /do/ need to put a lot of time into writing fics
otherwise your ideas won't flow well
if you write it on and off
it's not as good
when you write fics
you get brainwaves and a lot of ideas
you need to write them all down
into the fic
not into dot points
you'll still lose your ideas if you do that
04I don't write dot points
good then
04I write a 30-page summary about a 30 chapters fanfic
summaries
don't
work
04I find that they do.
obviously plotting it will
but
04Especially since mine are stupidly detailed
the ideas of how to write them
is what counts
not what you write about
but how you write it
that's the important part
04I find the "What you write" more important to how much I enjoy writing
then just plot it
if that's what is important to you
if that's all you want to do
then there's no need to write out a fic
if you're going to do something
you may as well go all-out
or it'll be for nothing
04I write summaries to remember the plot so I dont' forget key points
well duh
but that's not the most important part
while it's essential you remove plotholes unlike what I did
it's still important to remember first and foremost that the writing ideas that you have are the more important factor(s)
04I know that
04But I'm a continuity nerd
As am I
but I'll usually only write if I have the inspiration to do so
because that's when you have the best ideas
and when the ideas flow the easiest
04I have so much inspiration during school time it's not funny
I don't anymore
04Best way to waste time while still looking like you're doing work
but I actually have to do work
and I spend time on IRC ;-;
04I still do work of course
04But the IT guys blocked that CGI:IRC link you gave me
oh really?
google CGI:IRC Login
and find one that works
mine hasn't been blocked for 4 years :D
04XD
04I don't think I'll bother
04no one's on
04And no one talks
highlight people
and they do talk
get on TST
and I want to talk to you
04heh
04I'm always on TST
I'm rarely on TST
I'm always here
oh, fuck my mum

Ken, what IRCD?
If its unreal, its piss easy
Xanbreon: Hybrid
Ah, never looked at that one
Iago says she has, but I'm a bit perplexed on how to get farther than ./configure
Isnt there a howto in the tarball?
Xanbreon: Working on the ./configure part right now, figuring what I should put in there
Ken, goodo
Now I'm up to the point of copying the corresponding ircd.conf example, just don't know how to/where to copy it

04does anyone here have the ME3 soundtrack?
nope Drake

04I wasn't asking for a torrent
04I just want to know if a certain track is on the soundtrack, but the problem is no one knows the name of it.
04I've checked through all the tracks on youtube but none of them contain it
/me shrugs
04bluh
04It's probably bad that I want to write a Mass Effect 3 fanfic
.-.
04I already have DoI, Wake, that story you and I still need to write, and CoE
04Although I haven't started on CoE yet. I'm conceptualising with Wake, writing down notes and stuff, and DoI seems like it's beginning to move into full swing.
Wake is the psychic guy one, Drake?
04No, Wake is my sci-fi one
04Dunno if I'll ever actually do my psychic one
04And I had another Hunger-Games-like dream last night that inspired storiez
04Except it somehow had Spore, Mass EFfect, and Yu-Gi-Oh in it.
04Dunno how that went together.
uh okay
04I blame my friends for the Yu-Gi-Oh part.
04Fucking nerds.
heh
Sazerac loves Yu-Gi-Oh too
I like the games
04Once of them spent over $200 on one card alone. One. Card.

04My friend runs a dragon deck, based on the "Dragon's Collide" structure deck or something.
04Seemed pretty cool, what with Red Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon
REDMD <3
04REDMD beats the regular REDD methinks
04Apparently Red Eyes Zombie is pretty good for a zombie deck, despite being a dragon
04anyway, shower afk

REDD is slightly useless

can't believe they killed her off though
04I have AVATAR on DVD
that was annoying
04So that's cool

04Yeah
04Shoulda killed Norman off instead
Yah
Norman is kinda lame
04Yeah

Trudy on the other hand

yah
04Trudy is fucking badass

yeah Drake
Her death could have actually been more epic though

hi Quilava
hi
how goes?
all right, you?
i'm fine
i'm a little amused
in terraria
er. yes
well
i'm making an ocean
or a lake, depending on how technical you wanna be
I didn't 'drain' the ocean, I made a hole from the ocean to hell, and flooded it :|
yeah i know
http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/world3.png
that was a couple hours ago
it's still going
you're doing it wrong
you need to put a replicator beneath it
replicator?
yes. it's a 'pyramid' of blocks that makes water increase its total volume as it passes over it
ahh
do you know how to make one?
a pyramid doesn't sound too hard to make
don't really care though XD
it's not exactly a pyramid
even if it would make it go by quicker
i should go to sleep later so adding onto it is a best left for another day
make replicator first
it will speed things up by a lot
thanks for the tip though Quilava
it's just that right now it's 12:30 and i should be asleep right now
no need to get bothered with a project
ah.
it doesn't take long at all :|
i'm trying to finish watching iron man then i probably will go to sleep
it only has to be as big as you want it to be
okay.
does it have to be above water?
below
you make it under the waterfall
i mean
yes
ok
build it very close to the output
HMM
but yeah Quilava
i intend to flood the entire world
all the way upto space
awesome

what
>pointless logging?
-?
It's for all reasons. :3
?
Mostly
what reasons?
that I don't pay attention to my client
or my bouncer
if I'm disconnected
:P
it's natural
that I tail logs
know anything about what's up with irc.*
?
idk
XD
Hmm
Interesting
Never the less the silence has not been broken by the voice that was given, no sound made its mark on this echo-less halls,
Only wondering eyes plays its set.

14Umbreon :D
hi
02!pokemon
Ran, you are a 7Regirock.
02No :'<
14lol Ran, it's the exact opposite for me. For a while I've been going to bed very early and wake up late x.x
14I need 5 hours of sleep and nothing more D:
14brain, y u troll me
02I wish I was sleeping for only five hours, I perform best that way
LOl really?
14yeah
14but in these days I've been sleeping way too much :/
14I went to sleep at 8.30pm yesterday
14and I woke up at 6.30am
14x.
14*x.x
02I have to try getting up earlier really...I'm just so bad at it
14I have the alarm clock set at 5.25am
02Hey, that's about when I go to sleep :D
14but recently I just wake up, look at it, turn it off and go back to sleep :(
14<- lazy flygon
gah
02And that's why I don't have an alarm clock lol
vista why are you doing this to me
>Vista
want a free Windows 7?
i still have your free windows 7 lol
so why are you still using Vista/
14I'd love to, but I can't format :(
because i don't want to waste gold on a trashy computer
why can't you format
14I have too much stuff and not enough space on my external HD
02Even though it's all Greek to me, which is the best Windows anyway
something funny is happening
ever since i upgraded
it bluescreens at startup
Viri, back them up to dropbox or somewhere? :P
14I'd upload all into Box, but I don't know if all the stuff will remain private x3
14I have 50gb free
i'll just run the startup repair and what
it sat there for 2 seconds and said "please restart computer to finish" XD
Viri, then delete it after
LOL
and still didn't fix the problem
14lol
14well drf, if you will help me when I'm done with moving everything then sure :3
sure
also Umbreon
14great :D
that's why you don't upgrae
*upgrade
you do fresh installs
i mean
update
windows updates
so drf
do you have a separate key for windows 7
I have that one :P
and if I sign up for TechNet I can get more
the one from before i see XD
i want to be funny here
how does microsoft see VMs?
as new computers.
okay XD
14http://i.qkme.me/3ofrjn.jpg
so i can't be sneaky and technically say "how many computers is this installed on"
and say "one" when it's installed on a computer and then i have a VM of it
drf
?
what was that site called again
dreamspark or something
yes
i have an account with it
so x-x
i don't think i can grab multiple copies of an OS though
make another account :P
but they only have the server OSes anyway
nah
i downloaded 7 from it before
wait
what
Dreamspark doesn't have 7
unless you mean MSDNAA
(DreamSpark Premium, same thing)
maybe that was it
MSDNAA is awesome
gah why did i delete that email
that's where my 7 key came from too
gah
no matter where i go
dreamspark doesn't think my account exists
why did i destroy that link XD
yeah, mine does that sometimes too x.x
well i held onto the email for the longest time
i should have just bookmarked them though
i know the link was like onthehub.blahblah
this is why i just like using the OEM of a computer, so i don't have to go through this trouble
i'd rather not use the same key as i did with my other computer
i am so confused, vista just started up normally, i didn't even do anything
hi Quilava

/me idles
okay D:

hmmhiii
vista is being trashy to me :D
funny enough linux isn't though
get 7.
Lol
how many times do i have to say this
i don't want to waste money on that crappy laptop
DRF has his free 7? LOL
Fine, install Win2k or Xp
:P
no, drf has a free 7 that involves giving me a product code he already gave me for the installation for my desktop computer
i can't look microsoft in the face and say it's only installed on 1 computer when it's actually installed on 2 :P
I have a spare pro key
I think
/me should look for laptops to steal Win7Pro keys from :D
besides i think i just fixed the problem
somehow installing service pack 1 fixed it XD
See
Vista Sp1 is amazing
I mean
}NOW SP2 TIME
yes
darnit having to work my way up
ever heard of XP Powertoys?
once
know what it is? XD
i dunno
stuff

lol

"your memeory card read is missing a driver.

so I found out, TechNet has a limit of 3 product keys per product, whereas MSDN is 10
neither is unlimited :/
but hm
it's $350 for TechNet Professional which includes MS Office, compared to $800 for MSDN Operating Systems which doesn't
Hih.
Huh.
plus other stuff.
K
14uhm
14drf
14I ran the Win 7 compatibility advisor
14it tells me that my RAM might be a problem
14I have 1.9gb of ram
14ò_ò
that is fine.
LOL
my laptop came with 2GB
Win7 works on even 1GB
14uhm ok then
you only need like 500-600MB really
;p
14I'm going to back up the most important stuff and send it onmy Box/Dropbox accounts
Win7 works on 256MB if you use certain hacks
yeah, I've used 7 on 1GB
you'll get a huge pagefile anyway
if you actually plan to use your computer
rawr, vista service pack 2 download faster
LOL pagefiles
EW VISTA
pff
EW NT 6 SERIES
-.- it's not bad when it's only being used as a linux backup
to be honest
this computer would be full linux
Windows can't read ext4 filesystems
if i could figure out a way to use action replay within linux
It can read Ext3/2
ctr it's a duel boot i mean
if i come across a compatibility issue with linux with certain applications
i just move over to vista
You'll have tons of those.
:v
correction
I'd use XP for such purposes
if i have a compatibility issue
i'd use my XP VM
and if i still can't get work done then i'll use vista
But Vista is not a good OS for compatibility stuff
it works for me
plus
i'm not wasting money on the laptop to put winodws 7 on it
i'd rather waste a 7 key on a laptop that actually works
and isn't on it's knees

Rukario, you are a 5Numel.
I'm gonna get 7 on it anyway
somehow
maybe if i upgraded the hardware on the laptop
gave it more memory, got a brand new harddrive for it
maybe a more linux friendly wireless nic
I can still reuse the key if i uninstall the OS on the laptop first
then i'd get 7 on it

04and worried all at once
04I kind of like Sayaka
10and good, that's how I want you to feel.
04But that girl (I can't remember her name) who attacked Kyubey is also pretty cool
10Homura
10You know my favourite character
07http://tacocopter.com/
10but I dislike Madoka and Sayaka
07one of these days
10Homura and Mami are my other two faves
04Yes I know your favourite character XD
04When does she appear?

04WATCH THIS
04I COMMAND YOU
10What's it about?
04It's about a city in Japan, called Academy City, which is compromised mostly of students.
04However, most students are "Espers", people with various psychic powers.
04The story is about the 3rd most powerful level 5 (the highest level) Esper, Misaka Mikoto, and her friends.
04The main series is To Aru Majutsu No Index, which Railgun is split from
04There also happens to be loads of characters
04"Railgun" happens to be one of Misaka's abilities using her power, "Electromaster"
10Espers
04XD
/me adds it to her To-Watch lsit
10list*
04Railgun deals with science, Index deals with magic
04and eventually, (at least in the light novels), the two begin to clash
o.o
04Personally I prefer Railgun
10Science rulez
10</Bill Nye the Science Guy>
04XD
04Granted
04it's mostly Techno Babble rather than actual science
04but the series is more enjoyable
12Did you know ice is frozen water?! Gasp

04We're almost over our limit for this month of downloads
10Okay

yep
i think i'm presea too
not 100$ sure though
100%
100$ would be nice too
04And if you got super kinky I'd be wondering what was up first.
10lolwhy Drake?
04Because honestly NS scares me when she gets all weird like that. Plus I could never see us two doing that.
scares you
12[16:02] <%Skylands> Girls are too
12;3
04XD
12Oh there’s no proof :D
04And honestly Skylands
04You're a nice girl and all I pretend to be sexually interested in you, but if it actually comes to you wanting to be kinky I'd turn you down.
pretend
13Oh wow it's Friday today
13I keep thinking it's Thursday
yep
I kept thinking yesterday was Friday
but it wasn't
>:|
!Espeon
04Well
10Pretend is more fun than actually trying
ANGEEEEEEEL
wouldn't know to be honest
/me floofflfoflfofooolffolf
10since that could go in two different directions
04In all honestly I think you're attractive, but no I would't pursue you.
as i do neither
13:DDD
04I walk in
/me pokes someone because he's bored
04And I see this
/me poked

04Paradox.
13Why did you have to break it? D:
04My own amusement.
but really drake why would NS scare you
/me pets Angel
04Dunno
/me loves NS :>
12NS scares everyone
doesn't scare me
heh
Personality and such
04She intimidates me all the goddamn time, and because of her...abrasive personality I don't think anything like that could happen between us
oo

!eonget

04There are other factors but I won't bother to mention them because I cbf

03what's that
10mew
Dude it was one of the best GG titles
03mewtwo
10:3
mew 2 :3
http://i42.tinypic.com/34do393.png
heh?
GG as in Game Gear
10mew
03I know what Game Gear is
03also wtf
l
k
03the Droid 4
10for a minute I thought mewtwo was a script there
03has an internal SD card
03so there's like
03two of them
03and it's screwing everything up
03since the *real* MicroSD
10...
03is called "sdcard-ext"
03so all these programs are just putting their backup files in /sdcard
10Why didn't I notice that before
03which isn't actually an SD card
03brilliant logic, right?
Know what else is brilliant logic?
10Best song
The 3DS doesn't cache its videos propperly
03inb4 something re...yeah k
so if you try to turn back
10Is it Huge Hallow mix/
10?*
in the video to let it buffer
NOPE
lack of RAM
no, don't have that one
03haven't we been over the fact that the 3DS is a failure of a console?
there's only 128mb
yup
what do you expect
03and whose fault is that ctr
03they could have easily put more
eh
maybe
03basically Nintendo's new creedo is like
if they didn't TRY to make it so small
nintendo prefers faster memory
03"Let's make the best software we can on the incredibly bad hardware... made for us"
instead of larger memory
03er
03*made by us
03or, get better faster memory?
03*cough* DDR3 1600MHz or whatnot *cough*
greediness
lol
03exactly
nintendo uses Toshiba FCRAM
03but it seems what Nintendo does lately
03is make the crappiest hardware possible and then try their hardest (usually failing) to make a good user experience for said crappy hardwrae
03*ware
12too bad Sato isn't here. lmao
03the Wii was really what started that
03since they essentially took the GameCube hardware and made it wireless
03and added widescreen
03but it's not any better quality LOl
slightly better because of higher clocked graphics
that's all
03but it's still not much better either way
03the original DS was good for its time but they just kept using the same crap for all of them, the DSi and DSi XL
good for its time?
Not really
when sony showed the PSP
03better graphics than the GBA
DS looked like stone age
03that's true, but the PSP doesn't have a touch screen :P
03they're each good for their own things
03and the PSP screen kinda sucks, it has motion blur
so did the gameboy line
03but yeah, I have both consoles, either way
03well
03the gameboys used TFTS, didn't they?
03*TFTs
03but by the time DS/PSP was around they easily could have uesd LCDs
03and I think the DS did
gameboy used dot matrix
something
drf yeah
03how is that different than TFT?
The DS' dual screen design is like
really cool
03exactly
but the hardware's old :/
03I remember going "LOL two screens, why?"
03but when it came out
03I was super excited
The 3DS has better hardware but
03but barely
it's not exactly that innovative
03well
the 2 screens aren't identical
03not only that
03wait
kinda ruins the dual screen thing of the DS
03on what
drf at least the 3DS supports specular mapping
XP
03they *were* identical
03on the DS
/me runs
03DS Lite screwed that up
ctr a littl
little
eh
?
3DS has nice hardcoded shaders
03the DS touchscreen is the same as the top screen with a little plastic thingy over it to make it touch sensitive
DS lite looks like it has similar screens...
that's pretty much all
03if anything
03the DS Lite looked like it had *bigger* screens
03just due to the ratio
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/120318.jpg
03of plastic to screen XD
12the 3DS does have widescreen though XD
heh don't think ME3 can be any good if i keep finding stuff like this
Not the touch screen
on the top screen
12which to me is a good thing
and that's a big flaw
anyway
03it's not 16:9
I have to go
:c
03I don't think anyway
03@calc 400/24o0
03er
= 16.666667
12it is
since the touch screen scratches the top screen
03@calc 400/240
yeah it's a weird ratio
= 1.666667
12almost
03yeah it's narrower
it's 5:3
ctr that happens to me alllll the time
anyway
LATER :V
12bye Chimew
bai
12The 3DS also has the analog circle pad
03the circle pad is kinda obnoxious
i lose my grip of that all the time
03Sonic Generations is literally the *only* game I've played that I like that uses it
03the rest of them IR'd prefer the D-pad
03*i'd
12it's better on MK7
pilotwings and mario kart forces you to use the circle pad
03no it's not
03MK DS was awesome
03pilotwings is stupid
03I rented that game
I play MKDS with dpad
03hated it
03exactly
03MKDS is awesome
12the D-pad on MK DS hurt my fingers :<
a year ago
MKDS was the worst game ever
now it's awesome
12MK DS was awesome, and is awesome
Too bad i can't play online on that anymore
WEP...
my network is WPA2
03that's why you just make another hotspot
03I've go ttwo set up
03one has WPA2
03the other has WEP and doesn't broadcast its SSID
XD
my laptop's wifi board doesn't support adhoc connections
03wait what?
03you use your laptop as a router?
no, i have a router
03so what does adhoc connections have to do with anything
but it's wireless
03so i smine
03The actual router itself supports up to 5 SSIDs LOL
03and if it can run dd-wrt, so can that
mine can't
cisco epc2425
03why not just switch it to WEP then?
Insecure
03dude, everything is insecure with aircrack
everything here relies on it
my computer's conneccted to it wirelessly
03the general idea is just to put *a* password on it, so that people would connect to an unesecure one instead

03I've got a few neighbors with unsecure routers, nobody in their right mind would try to hack ours
Supposed to be the roflmao thing
03unless they personally hated me or something XD
12XD
my SSID means "poop" in swedish so people try to hack it all the time
03well then try not doing that?
03I named mine "DON'T STEAL MY BANDWIDTH" and put WEP on it, never had any problems
i couldn't come up with anything better
03that was my router in college
03when I'm at home, the router here is just my last name
03anyway
03I wonder why windows 7 can't rename a removable drive using lowercase letters
03the actual partitions support them
03but it just allcaps them
03Windows XP can rename them, but that apparently only renames it on the local computer and not the disk iteslf
03since it turned back into caps on another machine
use linux to rename them
03I can't
03I used Linux to make the original one
03but the problem is
03for some reason
03gparted doesn't show it
flood their mailing list

03the Phone SD, that's an actual 32GB MicroSD card and I made the partition using GParted
03obviously the lowercase works fine
03but the other one is just my phone's internal memory that gets mounted as an SD card
Though voices could be louder
03and I can't figure out how to properly rename it
03the original name was "MOT" which is stupid
i don
't rename my drives
?
so my usb drives are all "Cruzer"
03I do :P

03I leave all my hard drives as "local disk"

my hard drives are "ELEMENTS" i think

oh sadface
07tennis
what do you mean "how tennis works"
07how do they work
03like
they?
XD
07MAGNETS HOW DO THEY WORK
03She was talking about being "third double"
03and I was like
03why are they ranking players
03and I didn't know how "team" tennis works
03given that it's an individual sport
03so I let her explain the whole
03some poeple play by themselves, others play with partners, etc
oh
13LOL playing with yourself
11.•10«11WB10 (Kosoveon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- since the aforementioned eggs aren't even fertilized
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosoveon> caution, the banana drops are poisonous
I'm not a big fan of singles
03well, the part tha tI really didn't get, was how the entire team wins or loses
I mean it's cool
03which kinda su\cks
03it happens to my dad a lot
but like
03he'll win his match
13yes, it's always better if you've got someone else to do the playing with
03but the team loses
13:3c
It's the same for most of the game
03my sister hates singles too
Doubles is a lot more spontaneous :'D
I don't hate singles
03she refuses to play singles XD
LOL
03she's like "I want a partner or I don't want to play"
lol her coaches let her do that
03well it also gives her a bit of an excuse to not practice
03"oh, my partner is busy, sorry"
ours are like, "go with what we choose unless you're dying"
03no
03they do that too
03they put her on doubles
03like technically she had no say
03but she hates singles regardless
oh XD
03so she was glad to be put on doubles XD
03but I'm like
03OK
03people take pride in being first, right?
Doubles depends on your partner
03but then
03you get stuck playing the best person
03I was like, i'd want to be the lowest one
/me runs
the thing is it's illegal to rearrange your ladder so you win
you usually have to order it according to your ranking on the team
03yeah but I mean
03when they rank you at first
or else you would just put the best player last and win all the time
03what if you just intentionally play crappy
03so they think you suck
03DX
13.w. I'll just stop taking things out of context here
03*XD
lol Angel
03but yeah
03I ordinarily don't care about sports
03but I kept hear her and my dad talking about tennis
03and was like WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
woooooooo
03since LOL team sports
LEAVE HIM OUT
03well
HE DOESN'T DESEEEEEEERVE TO KNOW.
03It makes sense if it'ds like
03-d
03actually playing as a team
03e.g. soccer or baseball or something
ew team sports D:
I feel too much pressure :'D
03hey, it's worse in tennis I think
03like
03if you lose, everybody else hates you XD
03assuming you're on a team, at least
well
03and she's on the school team
the thing is
our team loses 5/8 of our matches
03I guess if you just play for personal satisf
so
03action
if you lose
03then sure
IT'S NORMAL
03yeah, same with my dad's team
if you win you're loved XD
03like, HE's good at it
03and usually wins his matches
03but his teammates ;suck lLOl
03*LOL
your dad's on ateam?
03yep
03adult's tennis league thing
03they actually got into a tournament a couple years ago
03like a state tournament
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1ce0syN6e1qewacoo1_r1_500.jpg
03LOL
03like he'd watch that thing all day long XD
LOL
03I found it incredibly boring
I watch depending on who's playing
Singles is boring depending on who's playing
03but i hate sports in general
03singles can be hot depending if they're girls and how tight their clothing is
/me runs
lol
03but I'd rather watch beach volleball for that :P
inb4 bikinis are universal

03found a coupon to get 15% off, too
12nice
03ew they charge tax
12um, why would a online store charge tax? XD
07because it's slowly becoming law lol
03which is stupid
07not really
12orly
http://i.imgur.com/PeoNg.jpg
03it's stupid because I'm cheap and don't like tax
/me runs
101oh u
12^
12XD
10it didn't work
03but yeah
03Amazon FTW because like
10oh u
03they exploit this loophole
07it's not just because states want to charge tax, it's because a lot of illegal tax dodging happens with online stores
03so that they don't have to charge tax
03Yep
03*cough*
03Amazon charges tax if you live in New York because they have a distribution center there
03so you have to buy from a third party, and then you don't need to pay tax XD
07that loophole is gonna be closed soon enough lol
03I know, the world is slowly coming to an end anyway
03>Chasing after pirates when there are much worse things to worry about
03also wtf
03We're sorry, the following error(s) have occurred:
03Credit Card information is invalid.
03no it's not
03>_>
12Taxes will hurt the online market because then you have shipping + taxes
07oh right
07I forgot to tell you I stole it
/me runs
03XD
03Kyu
03someone actually *did* steal it
03hence why I had to get a new card

07you'll get the boat in 6-8 weeks
07happy birthday
03XD
03I can try it as an e-check
03well
07did they restrict online purchases with the new one?
03nope
07you could check
03I just deposited a check, it's possible that I can't actually use that money until tomorrow
03even though they emailed me saying the transaction went throug
03h
07that's how mine are set up
03and I didn't have enough in there before
03I'll just do it as an echeck
03it's odd though
03Xbox Live will take paypal but Microsoft themselves won't?
03they only do credit card/echeck
03wait what
07I don't see many transactions with microsoft themselves happening too often
03they want me to actually mail a check
03yeah but doesn't the money all go to the same place?
07they probably don't want paypal to take a percentage lol
03and I dunno if TechNet is "Microsoft themselves" :P
07paypal is more convenient, so they'd only accept in in applications that convenience is more important
03Yeah I know what you mean
03And I think PayPal charges a fee for people to be able to use them as a billing source
07yep
07also they're copying Square now lol
03hm?
07and they take a percentage
03ah
03oh, that's why
03the check I just deposited isn't "available balance"
07they don't let you use part of it right away?
03nope
03it's weird though'
03I used the Chase mobile app, where you can photograph the check and whatnot
03then they were like "we'll email you when it's approved"
03then they emailed me 20 mins later saying it's approved o.o
07oh lol
07approved and processed are different XP
03"I'll look her up in the phone book... I mean, how many Lopez's can there be in LA? ...Can you just give me her number?"
07George Lopez?
03yeah

03and the other guy just starts walking away

03and he's like "Go over the plan iwth your boyfriend"
03and she's like "What? He's not my boyfriend" to which that guy goes "Oh, so you'd rather go out with [the other guy]"? and HE walks away too
03and she's like "ugh, are all guys this stupid? I don't want to date either one of you"

03in this movie
03they attempt the code "Dinero"
03and the captions say "De nero"
inb4 De nial
03?
Dundunduh
03so Xanbreon
03I'm gonna sign up for Technet Professional
Oh yes?
Did you work out the stuff RE keys?
03Yeah
03they give you 3 of each
03MSDN gives you 10 of each
03so I figure
03it's not worth it
03@ MSDN
mew
03because like
03MDSN Operating Systems is $800, doesn't include MS Office etc etc
03Technet Professional is $300 with coupon code and you can get 3 of each Windows+Office
Aahh
03which is still *tons* cheaper than retail LOL
03I called them
03and asked
Why do you want all of that stuff? O-o
03so that I have it LOL
I mean, are you actually going to use it?
03since I build computers a lot
03that way I'll have a ton of Win7 keys
03the XP and 7 keys sure
03professional/ultimate at leats
Mmhm
03*least
03then I can get the crap ones for lulz
03like Windows 7 Starter
03Yes, that's on there
So usefull :P
03XD
03As for professional instead of standard
03standard only gives you 2 keys for each + no enterprise versions
Aaahh
03and I just got another bunch of money for my birthday
03so why not XD
Dunno what version is the tons of keys one
03MSDN
03MSDn gives you 10 of each
Aaah
03but it's craptons more
03I think like $1500?
03if not more
Isnt there supposed to be one that give you daily keys?
03the $800 one is *only* operating systems, not Office andw hatnot
03nope
03like
03the daily keys thing
03is stupid
03basically it's 44 keys per day, but still only 3 per product
03so essentially you could claim every single key in a few weeks LOL
Oh I see
03yeah
03I don't quite get it either
03MSDN works the same way
03probably just to avoid server rape
03since I'm sure Microsoft has a keygen for their own product, and when you hit generate keys it just uses that
Its just how MS work
03yeah
03imagine if someone got ahold of that keygen Xd
03*XD\
Probs if you need more than 44 keys per day
You should have a VLK
And an activation server
03yeah
People have writen keygens, its getting the keys to also be on MS's servers as valid
hey
Thats the harder part
how would you word the answer to this question
03we have a VLK for Office 2010
03at work
03or some sort of enterprise key
03we have the same serial on every computer
03and it activates fine
i know an interpreter is a language where it's implied what to do using language
03like 50 times
Compiler compile the code into ASM
like HTML
interpreter runs it
03so it's probably an activation server
ok
07lol
Interpreter is like java to the JVM
Compiler is like C to machine code
drf, office 2010 has the oldstyle VLKs I think
03well
03I'm not sure
XP style, where you dont need to run a server
03as I gave Umbreon my Office 2010 key
03and that stopped working
07"The SF City Hall is one foot taller than the US Capitol building because the west wanted to show off how much better they were than the east coast"
03like after about 3 activations
07so true
07|D
03now it's blacklitsed:P
07</random>
youderp
03well
03it's the joy of phone activation
03I've used the same Win7 key about 20 times
03you just call the automated number and say it's only been used once
03MS's own fault for not fixing that glitch :P
ok
thanks
03but Xanbreon, what do you mean?
About what?
03do you mean our key for Office 2010 is just approved for 50+ activations/
03?
03through MS?
03it's literally the exact same key
03I'm not sure why we don;'t use a VLK for 7
03we literally have store-bought OEM discs
03with the stickers
03for each computer
Cos you dont want to run a activation server
03why, is that expensive?
And you probs dont have enough machines to make it worth while
Dunno, never bothered to look into it
03heck, why couldn't someone just hack an activation server
03once it's activated, it stays activated
Cos its a pain
03so it's like, connect to hacked server, activate, then remove from server
You can just hack the OEM bios activation junk
People used todo that
03haven't sen it done for 7
03*seen
03and for XP I have a crack anyway
Seen what for 7?
Theres tons of BIOS emu junk for 7
03seen people hack the OEM activa4tion
03-4
03well
I just use MSDN or MSDNA keys
03I haven't actually seen any computers that came with preactivated 7
03since all of mine are either home-made or came with Vista+upgrade disc
Ah
03like my mom's
03had Visyta
03-t
03and we got the upgrade disc through MS
Store computers will be
03and I installed it using that key
03it was a store computer
03it had pre-activated Vista
If you buy it will 7, it will be pre activated
03but 7 came as an upgrade disc
03that's wha tI mean
03I haven't bought a computer since 7 came out
03or at least a store one
yay last question in my linux review questions
03my dad's... I think he still had to activate it
what is the purpose of a login script?
to execute during login?
Its the same junk as vista for the most part
Okay today at school, I lost the game. But I made another friend lose the game by writing in the air that I lost it. SHe got mad and knew what I was saying. LOL
login script set stuff up on login
that's what i implied
%path's anything really
a logon script that logs off ( ¬‿¬)
You could do that
But it would be kinda pointless
03Xanbreon I got a few Android questions for you
Sure
03the new phone I got has some sort of internal-mounted memory that shows up as /sdcard
03and then I put in an actual MicroSD
03so now there are two
03problem is
03my real one shows up as /sdcard-ext
03and all the backup programs use /sdcard
03some don't let me change it
03is there a way to switch the two, or make the internal something like /sdcard-int ?
Nope
03darn it
03you can't even swap them?
Hurrhm
You might be able to screw with the mount points
03also yay, the Google Play site acutally works now
03like
03if I click on my apps
03it actually shows every app (free and paid) that I've ever installed
03it's much easier to just click-click-download than trying to use the phone XD
is /sdcard-ext under /sdcard or are they both under the root dir?
03root
03they literally show up as two defices
Hurrhm
Maybe, you would have to check XDA tbh
If its doable, its probs been done
I know you cant do it on the SGS2, but eh
03er
03*OK
03so SGS2 has that same crap with two SD cards?
03I wish you could just disable the internal mount point if you have a real MicroSD
03I don't even fricking want to use it, since that requires me to use the USB cable instead of just pulling the cable uout
03er *card
heh
Wouldnt make much sence for lots of phones that now have 16gig or something of built in storage
03this one's 8
03but I have a 32GB MicroSD
03which is more pro :P
03there are some rumors that it can actually use the 64GB Micro SDXC cards
Internal storage is normally FAR faster
03hm
Lots of phones can
03I could look into that for nandroid backups then
03since those take forever
They do
03I had some questions about that too but that's specific to my phone so you prolly wouldn't know
What kinda stuff?
03well
03right now I have this crap installed using SafeStrap
03the problem is that I can't apparently boot into the recovery menu automatically
03I have to manually press the menu key after booting
Yeh, thats phone spesific stuff, dunno about that
03which means no scheduling
03:/
03yeah
03stupid locked bootloaders
This is why I avoided them at all costs
03I had no choice
03I needed a 4G phone with a keyboard
You didnt need, you wanted
:P
^
03same thing
03anyway wtf else was I going to ask
NOT same thing
Not really :P
You need air, food, water
You want, stuff
blah blah blah
</PATF>
03oh, do you know anything about custom lockscreens?
03I already replaced the launcher with ADW Launcher which is what CyanogenMod uses
03but the lockscreen is pretty reta9rded, the swipe to unlock thing is like in the MIDDLE of it, height-wise
Pretty sure theres lockscreens you can use on the market
eg widgetlocker
03hm
03and they can replace the stock one?
You turn off the stock one, and just use the other one
03the ones I found via google looked really stupid
03like all they did was add widgets to the stock one
03how do you "turn off" the stock one
Actually, dunno how they work
03I'm not even sure how the launcher works, I installed AdwLauncher and it literally just replaced the stock one on its own o_O
03and no root required?
Never tried one
Shouldnt need root
03my friend used one called Launcher Pro
I use ADW EX
03why wouldn't you need root to replace the launcher?
Huh
The launcher is just another app
You dont need root to use a diff one
03you need root to take a screenshot but not to replace the launcher/
03?
Launcher is just another app..
03so it doesn't actually replace it?
03well
03how does it tell the stock launcher to gtfo then?
The screen shot thing is due to androids sec model
You can set defaults for stuff
03I can't find any settings for that
03@ launchers
03oh but speaking of settings
03another question I had
03for some stupid reason, all my text is being underlined
03when I type
Install 2 launchers
Hit the home button
03either using the on screen keyboard or the real one
See what it says
03it just used Adw
03on its own
Sleep well Espeon<3
03didn't ask me
Yes..
Then the stock launcher didnt take the default
03I don't even know how I'd switch back, other than removing Adw
03Not that i want to
03anyway
03any idea @ the underlined text?
03I swear I fixed that problem before but forget how
back
03it li[terally underlines every word I type, even with autocorrect turned off
settings > applications > downloaded > click an app > scroll down to launch by defaul
You can manage stuff there
03yeah I know
No clue RE underlining, thats a moto thing not general android
03you sure?
03I'm pretty sure I saw some posts on xda from other manufacturers
Oh, like, the world you are typing is underlined?
Or all text?
03the word
03also
03AdwLauncher has no defaults set :P
03but yet it replaces the stock one
03hence, Magic :P
Then to stock isnt asking for the default
03I just don't know how it can do that without root
03yeah but I mean, the stock one isn't even an app
03it's just there
The launcher is just another app
It is just an app
Just built into the rom
:P
03well it's hidden from the "manage apps" then
Of cause, but if you looked in /system/app
IT will be there
03ahy
03-y
03so like
I have ADW EX built into the rom I am using, I just winrar'ed it in there
03what's all this fuss over freezing system apps? I just delete the apk file LOl
03from /system.app
03*/
Freezing allows you to test before you make the change perma
Also less of a pain if you want to get something back
03yeah but the whole "freeze/restore"
03supposedlyh it doesn't "delete" them
03just prevents them from working
03or something
It doesnt
Theres an XML file, with an option you can toogle, and android will stop an app from running
Pretty sure its what the new ICS disablerling thing is based on
03hm
03I'm curious
03how is ADW EX different than the free one?
03is it the same launcher but with more customization options?
Its a lot "smoother" and more customisation options
03smoother?
Mhhm
I had them side by side, and with my setup EX was a lot faster, and didnt jitter at all
03it was laggy on my older phones but that's due to crappy specs
03it works really well on the new one
03so you think it's worth the $4 or whatever it is?
I had them side by side, EX was a lot better
Meh, I can give you the apk if you wanna try it
03I'm sure I could find it X
03*XD
03ugh god dang though
03and I can't turn them off in the app
Its like ADW but better, so if you like ADW you should like EX more
unno
03can I tell Android to just silence the app from sending notifications/
03I swear I never had that problem before
03and there *was8 an option
03but apparently they removed it, dirty programmers
03that's true, but I use their mail
03I've had it since 2001
03and see no reason to stop XD
Heh
03it works fine for my needs
03and I prefer web-based email to pop3/imap
I had a hotmail email, but I moved to gmail pretty much as soon as it was out
03since I read my emails from everywhere and I hate that whole "webmail" client
03ah there
03I can turn off notifications in the app
03I just had to try the other thing XD
You cant diables notification on a OS lvl
03OK
03hmm
03are widgets just apk files too?
Everythings an apk
Apart from the framework
03res-framework.apk ;p
widgets may be built into the app though
03into which app?
03the framework?
Thats err, more UI stuff, theres also framework.jar
03ah
03well
03there's a widget that I've always had
03called Power Control
03for some stupid reason
03the Droid 4 lacks it
Aahh
03could I just port the apk over from the other phone?
03like, can you *install* it or is that a system thing
03since it always just came with the phone
You would probs have to push it
03it wasn't a Moto-specific thing either, cyanogenmod has it too
But.. it might not work with your framework
03motoblur? :P
03hm
Its kind of a complext intertwining of stock framework, and OEM frameworks
03are the options that show up under Settings built into the framework and/or settings apk?
depends what the apk was compiled against
settings is just an apk
But its compiled against the framework
So they kind of have to match up
Otherwise nothing works
Frameworks provide assests that apps use
And each framework will be diff
depending on how much the OEM screwed around in them
03hm
03well is there a way to remove one of the menus in settings?
03I'm assuming not :/
Yes
But you would need to decompile
And frack around in the XML
and stuff
03oh
03meh, too lazy
03basically
03Verizon has this crap called Backup Assistant
03it was nice back on dumbphones
03it basically syncs all your contacts to their servers
03but all my contacts are on gmail so >_>
Dude, XDA
03but yet, they insist on shoving that crap on their Android phones
03I can delete the APK
Its probs been removed
from the settings menu as well
03so that just breaks it
03if you click on it, it crashes the phone
03LOl
Genrally, if its a good phone, and its been around for a bit, almost all the mods you want will be on that side
-side+forum
03except cyanogenmod :/
03they're apparently working on CM9 for it but it's buggy as frick, as all CM9s are
03hence why I hate ICS
Hmm
Blame the OEMs for not giving us src
I need to go check on the status of ICS kernels/roms soon
Havent been keeping up with dev for the past few days
03My phone supposedly will get ICS
03(stock)
03just in the near future
03but honestly I'm fine with 2.3
We have ICS stock roms
They have been touchjizzed allover
03not for the Droid 4 though
03at least I don't think so
And still are kinda buggy
Nah
When I say we, I mean sgs2
:/
03oh'
03yeah I don't have a Samsung :
03*:P
03and no I'm not a motorola fanboy
03I was considering the Samsung Stratosphere
03but that thing has crap specs for its time x.x
If there was a SGS2 with a KB i would have said go for it
But meh, thats basically just a SGS1 with a KB
:/
03exactly
03Droid 4 is a lot more hardcore hardware wise
03it might not be cutting edge but it's still really good by today's standards
Yeh, its fine
SoC is falling behind, but its still find
*fine
03I got it rooted, I got recovery (sorta), honestly the only thing I'd want at this point is CyanogenMod
03SoC?
INB4 Galaxy S3
System ona chip
:p
03oh
03CAN WE GET NES ON A CHIP IN MY PHONE
You should be able to run a nes emulator np
Why would you want to add a chip todo it?
03I was kidding
Meh.. if they are going quad A9 for the sgs3 I really think about it tbh
03hm.
03OK so
03you know the uh
03battery percentages
03like what it reports to widgets etc
03is that built into framework
03?
Errrh
03for some incredibly stupid reason, the Droid 4 has 10% increments, despite the Droid 2 (hardware, at least) supporting 1% increments >_>
03it's like going backwards LOL
Widgets should still show 1%'s even if the UI only shows 10%'s
03nope.
03Battery Widget shows them in 10s
03maybe it's a crap widget? Got a better one? :P
03Though Battery Widget will show 1% under CyanogenMod on my Droid 2
03whereas it did 10% on stock since the stock UI did 10
Not that you can actually be acrurate enough to make 1% stuff be correct
03yeah but it's more accurateg than 10%
03:P
Depends
Sometimes the % will go up under high load
Err
after high load
due to overestimated etc
as for the % stuff, if even 3rd party stuff is only showing 10%, might need to be edited in framework
03that's wha tI thought
03but well
03I think battery widget just grabs the info from "battery info"
03are there ones that do something else?
Depends on the phone and stuff
eg the fuel guage chip in the sgs2 doesnt give you current draw
Varies from phone to phone
as its a hardware thing
03supposedly the Droid 2 took some tweaking for them to get 1% increments
03but they DID, so it's obviously built into the hardware to do 1%?
03since AFAIK you can't mess with hardware in custom ROMs
You cant measure it well enough todo 1%'s well
as sometimes the charge will go upwards
This is why OEMS do 10%s or no %
So they dont get support calls from stupid people
03I swear I've seen OEMs with 1%
Im rly tired
Thus poor wording
hard to form nice seninces
or spell
frack sake
03you drunk too? :P
No
03surprising
Piss off
I know right
:P

03so is general crap such as the "eco-friendly warnings", like "Your phone is fully charged, unplug it to save power!" is built into the framework?
Somewhere in the framework yeh
LOLFail
03yeah, Motorola is trying to be "green" now >:_>
03*>_>
03what really bugs me too
03and this I think is universal for all Androids
03is that it goes "You can't upload large YouTube videos over 3G, go connect to wifi"
03and I swear there's a hack to fix that
/me huggles the Charizard
03I have unlimited data, so come at me bro
what about
Uploading large stuff will crush the battery though
hotspot uploading
:o
03that's what I did Xd
03I'd use EasyTether
03and just use the computer
03to upload
03and Xanbreon I know, but sometimes I just gotta do it

LOLWUT
03reminds me of you :P
How?
03since yo uonly watch Netflix
03or whatever TF stuff
03*TV
I've never used netflix, Plus it wasn't me using the 360 for the TV related stuff.
03well it's your profile
03all I ever see anymore is you watching videos :P
03not that it really matters, I just saw that picture and was like LOL
Well I am the only Gold holder in my place. So my sister tends to use it a lot, and I can't really do anything on the 360 currently so XD

atleast I've got Legend of Korra to look forward to
WHERE DID THE TIEM GO!
6and that was before korra
6watching that took 45 minutes in itself so yeh
are the two eps up now roara ? :D
6fml so much time went by just from driving ;-;
atleast you can
I wish I could say the same
relying on buses sucks
6my legs are still stiff why did I do that all in one go agh
6jun I've just wondered
6where in the world do you live
so how is the second ep ?
6I think you said new Zealand, but what part
wtf
I've only seen the first
oh
Auckland, North Island
6sorry that was random
6but your time script made me question it
6ah
all of NZ has one timezone
6I want to visit new zealand so badly aaaaaaadfg
6oh does it?
6didn't know that lol
NZST or NZDT
it's not like amerrika or oostralia
wow I'm failing pretty bad at striking up a conversation
then again it is the middle of the night
┐('～`；)┌
I'm guessing Aurora probably also has me on ignore
u can visite me?
which doesn't help things
no?
6I wish
6to visit
6new zealand
I love talking to a wall
i want to go to amerrika
6if I ever do, i'll let you know LOL.
something something amerrika

6amerrika is awkward lol
6california is its own country
/me 6shrugs
I used to live there
a lot of IRC pplz r in amerrika
got too expensive
6yeah they are
6a lot of them are in california too

6nevada is desert land sdfgkdfvnslkv
6I can barely stand central CA
well not all of it
a majority yes but Reno is pretty nice
yep I'm on ignore jun
this sucks
6actually you're not
6but i've already told you I'm not dealing with you
6because everytime I do
I'm trying to be better Aurora
6I come to regret it
6you did a really suckish job
today I am?
hmm
6"you're wasting your own time by ditching class" and then "I don't need anyone's trust"
6gives me no reason to even bother with you
6you can do what you want
I had alot on my plate that day
6and what about the other days
6all of them.
6believe me, I am not an aggressive person
I'm trying to reach out
6the fact you see me aggressive should be a sign in itself
6I'll say this
6just leave me alone, entirely
6I don't like setting ignores, it's a hassle
6if i talk to you, it'll be on my own accord
Aurora: I'm trying
6I've been given no reason to trust you is my point, sato
I hate having enemies
dude frick
6you've said that a number of times, and I've come close to quitting this irc 4 times because of it
6just leave it at that
stop apologizing for aplogizing for aplogizing for aplogizing etc
6work on it, we'll see what comes of it
6jun your sentence made my head hurt
it's a two sided process
Aurora:
just talk (r)
....have i been missing something...
trying to trademark that ?
actually you know what.
its not my buisness..
/me idles.
heh
there's nothing to intrude on
ahh XD
6but by now most people know what's going on anyways lol
this is over
Aurora
>rarely reads chat
>remixes like hell
6its ok
I'm ready to move on I suppose
6god
6*good
no point in rekindling a friendship the other person doesn't want
inb4 mother of god
6sato, that's my point >.>
I don't have to be friends with everyone on here
6I like friendship, you give me no reason to be friends with you, and then you blame me for not wanting to be friends
6and since i don't care, I'll say that, and tell you not to nick alert me to give me special attention
I will be happy to have any friends
6mainly because i'm too lazy to set ignore every time i come on here
6there, done
6and I'm on memebase
6wonderful
6now i might not be sleeping for an hour
so has anyone tried Kid Icarus yet the new 3DS one
I heard the controls can be wonky
I'm hoping Nintendo puts out a 3DS demo
inb4 get a proper IRC client (tm)
Windows 8 hates IRC
she doesnt Win8
my laptop will remain Windows 8 CP and my desktop will be Windows 7 Professional
oh

6my bed isn't even made, I need to do that so I can sleep

that's killer
6who I admittedly havent seen in
6a while.
my return has gone ok so far
thanks for convincing me to give this place a second chance
Uh no problems
And uh, I'm still technically away
and heya Aurora
heya to both of your really
6"technically"
6is such a loose term lol
well
I'm still not at home
and won't be until tomorrow
6oh
6wait where have you been
well might as well put Aurora on ignore to stop my temptation to talk with her
( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱﾊﾊ八八ﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉ ＼ / ＼/ ＼
there we go
SSDs break
really often
6jun faces lol
really?
more so than mechanical ones, apparently, sometimes
I've heard they're better because they're well solid
on camp Aurora
6..
well, they might be better for laptops cuz
I kinda cbf'd to post on the forums
>bangs & knocks
6I KNEW THIS LOL.

6I'm sorry, I've had a long day, I'm losing my brain

6ok well
6to bed I go
\o
but you're the only one who'll talk to me, damn
6i think
6i need to get off the comp
I sure hope not
don't think so
"it can sense if it's being hacked - if the hacking software is getting close to the password it will automatically burn the chip."
that's kinda counter-productive
and expensive?
is it covered in the warranty I wonder
if not this would clearly just be for business
satol alert
if something isn't funded on day 1 of being on kickstarter is that a bad sign?
like funded at all
shrug
hmm
atleast there's no risk
I won't owe anything if the funding fails
but it will mean no one is interested in a Super Mario orchestration project
as is I don't have the tools or team I need
so I thought I would try and see if someone would kickstart my project
wow it's so quiet

ndiswrapper doesn't work either
Whats the card?

i can't remember
it's something among the lines of comcast

installing virtualbox on windows 8
can't believe it's working
;o
it worked for me.
i might actually have to test this out
i'm thinking since linux doesn't like my wireless card that i would just run windows 8
and VM into linux
o-O why would i want to do that :P
02because I run mac-os via USB x3
i want to be able to run linux on my laptop
02just as random fact x3
but the wireless card doesn't want to work with it so i want to use windows 8 to just run a VM of it
02well, use Linux as main source or install it on another harddrive
the reason i want to use windows 8 is because the sucker can boot up really fast
02hmm, so you want to use windows 8 only as start up?
yes
i'm testing right now if windows 8 can actually run a hypervisor though
02you still have to run Linux up then
02oh
i got it to install virtualbox with no trouble
but well :/
i can't seem to make it create a VM
yay it's working now
i didn't tell virtualbox to capture the CD drive
now i can get dizzy
since i'm running a VM of linux mint, inside a VM of windows 8
02x3
02try to have 4 windoses at once, actually 4 different windows desktops
o-O lol
yay found the windows 8 startup directory

[1,0You0,4Tube]: Windows 8 Boots on a 5 1/2 Year-Old PC in 8 Seconds! | by | Length: | Views: 33 196
02DAM!
that's why i want to make it run the hypervisor XD
02and I can understand why *-*
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
i wonder what they do to make it boot up so fast
i know one thing they probably did was disable prefetch
annoying little feature
02hmm yeah
first time installing windows 8
as an actual OS instead of VM
/me 14»»3 WinAmp Pro 5.58 14«»4 Artist (Yamashita Kousuke) 14«»12 Album (Dragonaut -THE RESONANCE- Original Soundtrack - CD1 (2008)) 14«» 7Track (Houkouu Kimochi) 14«» 10Details (00:03/01:22 (4.9%) | 320Kbps | 3.14MB | mp3 | 44KHz) 14»»
02oh good luck!
i don't need luck XD
Win8 is iffy
it is iffy
Remove metro, add start menu
then it'll be fine
well
only reason i'm making it an OS
is to be a hypervisor
XD
it's the fastest bootup OS i know right now
that i have access to
i hope when i told it to install in the 60GB unallocated space
that it takes all 60GB
02so 8 is the fastest non beta start-up OS ?
well
Still beta.
So we'll see in August/RTM or october
02i tought so |3
i wonder if they'll say you can't use the consumer preview anymore when the actual OS comes out
see
I *THINK*
the beta is 1 year
so in 2013 the beta is dead
o-o
give them time to buy the actual OS before it dies :p
what do you mean dies?
they don't support it anymore?
you know.
Unactivates itself
and so
hmm
so it's logic bombed lol

:p
i see
around that time
we aren't going to live that long anyway so :P
haha
02x3
Soo
We can't say Windows boots too slowly
lol
we can't say Windows has too many viruses (Secureboot and better protection this time around)
:P
well, it is *too* easy to infect windows
i'll think of something
i'll probably have to take vista out for windows 7
i think 7 boots faster than vista
:P
02good luck I have windows 7 on this, tough i still hate those bugs, like that damn crashing of folders and explorers
The only times folders crashed was when
I used a floppy disk
:P
well i did everything i know how to speed up a system in vista
disabled prefetch, adjusted it for best performance
turned off system protection
Rukario
How do I disabple prefetch
I haz a vistaPC
:V
the same way you do 7
how.
;V
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms940847(v=winembedded.5).aspx
I never bothered with the prefix
e
r
that should be all you need to know
What does prefetch do anyway?
:p
basically during bootup
windows will load up part of your commonly used applications into memory
that is what prefetch does
12!Pokemon
basically the point is to allow applications to boot up faster inside windows
however, it slows down the boot time for windows
Well
I don't need to worry about that with Vista as... it is on 24/7
Had 2 weeks uptime
i see
WB DRF
03thanks x.x
hi drf
02wb DRF
i think this might work
running a VM of linux inside windows
..Slowpoke?
:P
although i wish i knew how to disable file sharing
on vista
with comodo firewall
LOLWhat
Just go to network and stuff
disable it for private?
:P
both options are grayed out
and it says that to toggle this option, it has to be done in my firewall
and network discovery is set to custom
instead of on or off
i always get notifications that there is other computers on the network
and if i would like to file share with them blahblah
linux doesn't care about other computesr XD
huh?
I never ge tthat in 7
I just set it to public and boom
:P
i get it in 7 as well
even when set to public
03yay, the money is actually in my account now
o-o
03XD
o-o
03frick
03MS Word 2000 is freezing again
03I hate when that happens
03it's some update for the 2007/2010 office suites that breaks 2000
03I think it's "Office Live Add-In"
weird
:p
03LOL what
03**Please note: If you are using Internet Explorer 8 or older, you need to upgrade to IE9**
03Way to just shaft XP users :P
03granted I'm using Firefox but still
02herro Samurott
07WAZZAAAAAAAPPP MysticLugia :P
PAAAAAAAAAAAATRICK
:B
/me tries to listen in
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
02WAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPP
07Yays, it works
02hm? x3
seriusly Vista?
IE9 with 1 tab on facebook/game is taking up half a gig of RAM.
Yay memory leaks?
:P
07Ohai ML
/me was distracted by stuffz
03blame Flash, HML
03since Facebook games are usually Flash
03:P
03Apple products don't support them because they're too crappy to run it
/me hides
rawr
/me hides as well
07drf, did you hear about the problem with the new iPad?
07and no, not the whole thing
10It heats up
07Apparen
07Yes that
03yeah I heard about that
07It gets 16 degrees hotter than the iPad 2 due to (I guess) the new display and the graphics processor
03my Droid 4 gets pretty hot too, granted I was downloading about 57 apps at once
07This is why I don't get technology as soon as it comes out
03inb4 HML now prefers IE10 over 9
03the Droid 4 is kinda odd
03in that it has this "webtop" thing
03that's an entirely separate OS
03and you can't get rid of it
03it makes it so if you buy a Motorola-capable netbook you can pop the phone in the dock and use it as a modem or something
07drf, I'm considering getting a new laptop that's not MacBook, do you have any recommendations?
03MSI
03they're like $1600 and have i7s, 16GB of RAM, Blu-Ray burners
03basically the highest end you can get right now :P
/me ragequits
03Ray, YOUR FAULT FOR USING NICK ALERTS
07I'm thinking I'd like something that works for games, decent internet browsing, and good battery
02BUY ME A MONITOR
02AND THEN I CAN DISABLE IT
03I don't use nick alerts on my laptop and that only has one screen, u mad?
12Blu-Ray :D
03Samurott so in other words you don't want high end? LOL
02because you don't do stuff?
03My logic, usually, is to just get the best system you can get, even if you don't plan on using all of it
03opposed to just "settling" for less
07If it's less than a decent MacBook, then that's good
03I can understand if money is an issue
07I would like mid-high range
03but if you were thinking of buyina Macbook
03those are like $1600+ anyway
03so yeah
02with 1600$
02all the stuff that I'd do..
02:'D
07It makes me lol that they have a MacBook that's on sale at the NEX, $100 and it's still nearly $2100
03exactly
07*$100 off
03the *cheapest* Macbook is like $1000, right? And that one's relatively crap
03I wont'deny that the higher end Macbook Pros are good systems, but they're still way more expensive than they need to be :P
03and in fact
03I installed Mac OSX on my MSI laptop
07I talked with Lighty and he said that ASUS is good
03it works fine, minus the Wi-Fi
03Asus is good, yeah, but their high-end stuff can be even more expensive than APple LOL
07Wow
03I've seen $2000 Asuses
03MSI's highest end is like $1800 or so :P
:P
07hmm
i have an asus
ASUS, pretty good, but yeah stupidly expensive.
03No, I'm not a MSI fanboy
my mobo is an asus as well
XD
03it's just the best thing I've found
03yeah
03Asus and MSI are cool like that
3Mainboard Vendor: ASUSTeK Computer INC.
07I have a max budget of around $1400 now
03since they make motherboards *and* laptops
3Mainboard Name: Rampage III Formula
03versus companies liek SOny
03who just use other brands' boarsd
03well
3Mainboard Version: Rev 1.xx
3Mainboard Vendor: ASRock
12Stupid Norton
03ASRock is basically ASUS
12not letting my install QuickTime.
03it's their uh
12me*
12:/
03it's basically their "experimental" stuff
XD
03because this motherboard
03breaks so many standards XD
;p
03it has 12 SATA ports, and there's like 4 separate SATA controllers
so experiemental
experimental
03yeah
07I'd mostly like to be able to enjoy better word processing on Windows, game with Portal/Portal 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon games, and just browse internet and use mIRC like here
03the problem is sometimes there are random issues :P
03and then there are motherboard vendors like Gigabyte who *don't* make their own computers
03Gigabyte is really good, never heard complaints about them
03so really, the 3 brands I trust for motherboards are MSI, Gigabyte and Asus/ASRock
03EVGA.. supposedly good but as ripoff as Apple
03Intel... it works, but again stupidly overpriced and under-powered
12Intel is pretty good
03their CPUs are, yeah
03but their motherboards are relatively lame
03they're "standard" meaning the usual set of one video card connector (PCIe x16), only 6 SATA connectors, etc
03they don't do anything cutting edge
12well yeah, not as good as their CPUs
03Gigabyte and Asus tend to do the most experimental stuff with motherboards
03just cramming as many ports and connectors on there as humanly possible
12XD
03hence why I have ASRock as it, for some reason, had more SATA's than Asus itself or Gigabyte
03anyway, brb

But minor problem :P
03psssh
03I'm totally sharing my keys with people
What happens if they find out
:P
03They'd probably cancel it
03after I already leech the entire site
03:P

12ew, the new iPad just looks like the last two :x
12it does have 4G though
03my Droid 4 has 4G

03and I might tell articuno to get one as it's pronounced "Xai board"
/me hides
12yeah
12LOL
03LOL car commrecials that are using popular music
12"the new iPad has four times the resolution of the original iPad” <-- yay, comparing your latest product to a product that was made years ago?
03XD all these TechNet downloads are direct HTTP links to the ISOs
CAN I HAZ ONE
/me flee
03sure
03let me see if I can get the link
!pokemon
LLOL NEW iPAd
So lie
12^
12inb4: give it 4G and raise the resolution = new iPad :'D
07I think it's a stupid name
So like, the new ipad has charging issues (No charging when gaming), some Wifi reception problems, some screens have a yellow tint, it gets hotter, is a bit heavier, the apps are like 2x as big so 16GB of space wouldn't be enough :P
07and overheating FTW
The old smartcovers don't work
And so on
some old smartcovers don't work
it depends on the orientation
12HML, all true but I like the fact that it's heavier :p
Why?
12Heavy or GTFO
It's a bit thicker and heavier LOL
makes a betterdoorstop?
/me runs
At this rate, get a laptop
Oh and
12HML, it's harder to break heavy things
The CPU is the same as before :P
Uh
No.
12unless you drop it
inb4 willl it blend
Well, I'm sure the only wayt o break it is to drop it
So like, whoops? :P
07The CPU is still dual-core, but can have up to quad-core graphics
where is that link...
12Either way, I like it when a product is heavier. It just make it feel higher quality
>mfw
12makes*
Kal-El geforce/Tegra 3 has *12* GPU cores
shall we tape bricks to your next laptop to make it "higher quality"?
/me hides
03LOL
12:|
03I'm not really paying attention to this but
┐(￣ー￣)┌
07I think lighter is better, but overall I still think some weight needs to be present
03as much as I hate Apple
Plus, the NewiPad boots slower/is slower than the iPad 2 :V
03I will say
03supposedly it has >1080p resolution
03which isn't bad for a screen of that size
Well DRF
03now, I'm not sure of the other tablets, e.g. Motorola, Samsung etc
07I don't think tablets need to be much lighter than the current ones are
so "HD" actually means "HD+"
Whereisthatablet
as opposed to = "HD-"
03LOL hd-?
03what is this, blood types?
inb4 itunes rentals
03I'm a type HD+
03:>
/me runs
12It has a higher resolution than any other portable
below HD
inb4 hidp
03hidp?
High Dots per Inch
*hidpi
122048-by-1536-pixel resolution
i don't even know my own bloood type
03I don't either
03I shoudl ask
03as I've had a few blood tests recently
i do bloood teste regularly too
the acer iconia is HD
er, A700
Not released yet
07I think it's pretty cool how the new iPad has more pixels than many HDTVs, but obviously Apple needs to work out cooling first
12for a little bit I thought drf kicked me :/
And seriously, the 'retina' display isn't a big deal in real life use
03LOL what?
"Oh wow, a gazillion pixels on a small screen"
03why would I have kicked you
12Apple link XD
I'd prefer a bigger screen with real supported res plz
07Link?
12it just was a ping timeout
03I didn't see that
07Yeah, I've looked on the tech specs page before
07Yeah, I thought the processor was quad-core until I looked there
07just dual core with quad-core graphics
12yep
http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Apples+A5X+Beats+Tegra+3+in+Graphics+But+Not+in+Pure+CPU+Performance/article24255.htm
03Tegra is awesome
03the Zune HD has one
03the graphics are awesome but the lack of apps make it kinda crap :/
So in conclusion, there isn't going to be a major improvement in actual graphics, but just resolution as all the power will be put into that.
While the Tegra 3 can actually do some better physics/effects :V
07Hmm
07So that means the iPad isn't as good for processes but is better for video and the graphics of games
12indeed
02Not exactly
03Angry Birds or gtfo
03that's like, the only use for a tablet
03IMHO
12^
03because for videos... I have a $50 portable DVD player
03:P
03and they make portable Blu-ray players now
12I use my laptop for videos
07Tablets are more tuned for leisure, with the possibility to use some applications that are actually serious
12yay 17.8 inch screen? :D

07while laptops are much more serious and less portable
03yeah but my leizure doesn't include carrying around crap that doesn't fit in my pocket :P
07Meh, I dislike the smallness of most smartphones despite the pocketness
123DS and Android is what I use for leizure
03I swear, Autostarts is the most useful Android thing ever
Get a Galaxy Note.
:V
..like bricks
/me hides
03the Droid 4 has SO much crap that autostarts
07with a tablet you can have a decent small case and it's still light
03that it starts lagging even on a dual-core
03and who's fault is that? Verizon >_>
It's a tablet and a phone
nononon
03I removed most of the bloatware and it still has like 50 processes that start automatically
it's a galaxy note
07Tbh, I'm considering getting an Android that'll last me though Italy
you can't disable them>
?
03you can
03using Autostarts.
but...
03it's the equivalent of using msconfig
03the difference is
03there are more events than just startup
03there's like, text received, screen off, screen on etc
03so I have a bun ch of random crap that tries to run itself when I turn the screen on or off
03I disabled all that
03:P
03it makes the phone run a lot faster
03requires root, obviously
07So would you recommend Galaxy Note, drf?
thank you for flying verizion. this text was bought to you by verizon
?
DRF dislikes non-keyboard phones
07I'm fine without a physical keyboard, unless it's a really bad touch one, like a few Droids I've used
03Samurott if you don't mind touchscreen keyboards it's probably fine
07I can probably take a look at it at the Vodafone store onbase
Well DRF, It is pretty much the most powerful Droid phone, for now.

03someone's selling a Radeon HD 6850 for 1BTC
03that's like $56
03*5
Not again.
LOLOL
03oh wait
03no
03Up for the very first raffle is a Sapphire 6850. Once we get upto 75 bitcoins the raffle will be over and the drawing will take place. For the drawings I will post a video to show the process and to ensure that there is no monkey business happening.
03that's stupid
:s
07Seems as if the contrast is a little better on the Note
Exactly
Retina display is kinda a joke now :P
Notes a good phone
I think the Note is 1280x800 or something silly
Which means you can do HD properly yay?
It is
But its still on GB
:(
/me finally moved to ICS
ICS soon
I think

grr
07GB vs ICS?
I'm not sure which is really better
Android 2.3 vs 4
ICS is generally far better
I mean, there are a ton of new features in ICS
:s
Some apps aint ready yet
But the whole OS is faster and generally better
07Oh yeah, the OS for Android
Just buggy :P
For unoffical
07Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich
Eh, yeh
Xan, what is CM9 like so far?
Varies from phone to phone
Its pretty stable and quick
Not finished messing about with it yet, but it looks a hell of a lot nicer than touchwizzed ICS
03CM9 had issues on all the stuff I tried it on
03hey Xanbreon, do you know of any good flashlight widgets, like that turn the LED flash on/off?
03I used to use one called CamLED, but it got yanked from the market and apparently doesn't work on the Droid 4

7Hey Dari. I've been reminiscing about this place. everyone, together. it really was a wonderful time, wasn't it?
Hey, and yeah. It was pretty awesome.
I still don't understand why it died.
7Real life took over for everyone, I guess. I know I certainly kept forgetting about this place.
We used to have quite a lot of regulars here
Yeah...
That's why mIRC with autojoin is hadny.
handy*
:P

I think RDX pretty much ragequit the internet when the whole pony thing started.
It really scared him
XD
What abbreviation?
7haha
10THG, but I'm sure it's been typed elsewhere
7I can't wait for the two part season finale.

10Drake should really do Puella when he has time
04but I have no tiiiiiiiime
Again, same
7I feel like I should be able to do something. draw everyone back together, revive this place to its former glory.

Well, other than you, clearly. XD

i'm being cruel to vista
i just told my linux VM to take 1.5GB of memory
7haha
13LOL
13Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka is awesome
my computer only has 2GB of memory so that leaves vista with .5GB of memory to work with
lol
13there's a season 2 coming out this spring
Angel, I need to watch that still
inb4 the concepts in C3 were intresting
13Rawraaaa
7well, if anyone could do it it would be me. Because while SR was the admin of this place, I was its king :P
13Watch Black Rock Shooter, the last episode came out yesterday :P

I don't know the name of anyone who makes anime.
Miyazaki is a director, his studio is Studio Ghibli.
I know who he is
D:
heck I like quite a few Studio Ghibli movies
you may know some of his movies such as Nausicaa, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, THe Borrower Arriety, Spirited away, Princess Mononoke, etc
ewww
you mean the person who is letting disney dub his work
:P
I have seen Princess Mononoke
all I can say is *vomit*
its something of a gore fest
My Neighbor Totoro is one I like though
its catchline is "live", apparently
13Spirited Away <3
i saw that in theatres
however my favorite is Kiki's Delivery Service
!pokemon
cuteness :>
10Arrietty and Ponyo... whyDisneywhydidtheygetinvolved
they are under one request from Miyazaki himself
no cuts
inb4 katana in the mail
I really hope you are not one of those anime purists
I cant STAND them
purist asin?
one of those who thinks anime should only be watched in Japanese
Hmm
i've told tihs many times:
Could be I suppose
10Well
i prefer {{dub where available}}}
10but I don't despise dubs by any means
like about 90% of Pokemon
and its only the newest episodes
10I gave up on the Pokémon anime a long time ago
04>Pokemon Anime
04:3
I tend to prefer dubs
04I don't watch much anime. Only stuff people make me watch/convince me to watch
for what little I have seen
7I'd like to get this place going again. but the old guard have heard the 'revival' bullshit from me so many times already. it'd be nice if there was active interest from spyroforum, but I don't think anyone there knows this place exists... does anyone even go there any more?
04I mean, I got onto the Index/Railgun bandwagon because of my friend, and now Skylands is making me was PMMM
but yes I don't watch much anime either

04But still!
ah

14I ate too much tonight x.x but well, it was a party y.y
Viri
i've eaten entire pizzas before
and breadsticks
04Hey, Skylands, srs question here/
14I ate a slice of pizza and a few french fries
14and tons of Coke xD
why didn't you put the french fries on top of the pizza?
genius idea~
huh
14x3 I was more interested at the topics we were talking about more than the food
well peadge
no wonder my irc setup hasnt been working
10Hm?
well i shall bug him when he returns!
because i've no colour script
04Do you think it's possible to be sexually attracted to someone's personality?
D:
04Meaning, well it's difficult to word this.
colour is overrated
/me gives oranges
10Yes
04Ok, I'm glad someone does.
04I was worried there for a second.
10I feel like there's a term for that as well, just can't put my hands on it
04Same.
10Why do you ask?
/me makes you feel embarrassed for asking :P
/me blushes
10Oh u
04Not really sure actually. I just constantly wonder how I'm generally against online-only relationships, and yet there have been several times where I've been interested in someone I haven't even met IRL yet.
10Same
10I am against online relationships too, but I'm in one :'D
/me contradicts herself and doesn't mind
04XD
10I use the excuse, "It just happened,"
10Because that's the truth, tbh
04"You can't explain love! Don't judge us!"

12it needs to be 9001
yes
when i used to host the server for HoR
i kept it private
12is TST's still private?
but someone insisted i make it public to make it easier for new players to stroll in
i don't know
when the official PO server went down
all the 300 something players they had would all relocate to another server
for some reason it'd be the HoR server
XD
and having 2 mods watching over 300 people
12XD
it happened more than once too
12I think could deal with the trolls. I'd want TST's to be public

10Gale and Katniss, Peeta and Katniss
/me runs
10Jacob and Bella, Bella and Edward
From the trailor it doesnt look very scifi
04Gale and Katniss, I never liked that one
apart from its in the future
;/
*set in the
04I prefer Peeta and Katniss. Because Peeta's cool
10I dunno if I like either pairing
04almost
10I just fancy the plot
Suppose
04the plot matters more than the pairings
04as opposed to Twilight
Looks more science fantasy than fiction..
10Twilight's also a couple years old
10Those rabid fangirls have to go somewhere
(scifi: star trek scifiction: star wars)
12lmao
For the kind of distinction
04XD nice one Sky
/me sends them Drakes way
10Not even sure how THG came to be that way
10"Oh hey, a bunch of people are reading this, that means we must do so too!"
10Domino effect
12true Skylands
Might be good, doesnt look earthshattering
10Tons of people at my school haven't read the books, but they go to see the movie
10Just to fit in
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc
:D :D :D
04THG isn't earth shattering
I cant wait for that
04it's a good book that I don't want spoiled by Twilight fans
12the only reason I want to see the movie is the book
10My little sister is a prime example
12if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't care about seeing the movie
10She actually had to red the first book in her english class a year or two ago, before it became big
This trailer makes me squeee
=3
10She said she didn't like the story
10and then all the sudden, once there's a movie
10"I'm gonna go see this with my friends and read the other two books!"
12LOL
10I poked fun of her for that, she acted all butthurt
Damn dirty kids and there weirdness
10Like, "No! I never said that!"
04"Space Nazis from the Moon"
10or "Well, you must have misheard what I said"
Drake, best premise everrrr
10Excuse me, sis, but I know what I heard
=3
04ikr
12she could say it was a IRL typo
/me runs
04Honestly I only ended up reading the book in preparation for the film
04I'd always intended to read it beforehand, but I kept forgetting

12oh well, what matters is high school ;3
/me runs
Highschool was living hell
Till I was able to beat the shit out of the people who used to bully me
Then it got better
10I actually don't mind high school
10Primary and middle sucked
07how many batteries does that make |D
Middleschool was also hell
04High school is chilled
10It got better each time I switched schools
04No one cares what you do anymore, as long as you're nice and don't judge
In the end i broke a few peoples faces and they left me alone
Hah
Not the highschool I went to
04See
04we don't have middle school
10over 9000
04we have pre-school, primary school, high school, and university

03so Xanbreon
03I broke my phone
http://www.sfdm.scad.edu/faculty/mkesson/vsfx419/wip/spring11/shannon_dingle/images/dog-fur.jpg
03well
So drf
03software
^ here's some furry stuff
03I apparently deleted one too many APKs
Good jorb
03so now it crashes on boot
03and Google Maps doesn't work
well done!
What did you remove? :P
03luckily, since I knew deleting APKs was problematic
03I made a vanilla backup
http://puu.sh/5cZI
03as in
03I rooted + recovery, then backed it up
03so I'll restore that
03and uh
03all the system crap that I didn't want
This is why you freeze them, reboot, then see what happens
:/
03the motorola crap
03I used titanium backup
03to "uninstall"
03well
12I'll show you cute: http://www.android.com/media/android_vector.jpg
/me RUNS
03anyway Xanbreon, can ADW free and/or EX just hide apps from the drawer?
drf, probs, dunno
03since if I do that, and I disable them from running on boot, that's basically just as good?
03and that way they're sitll there if programs require them
well that was a bigger reaction than I thought .-.
drf, this is why you freeze, reboot, see what happens
then remove if everything works fine
03as apparently Google Maps requires some of that bloatware ;/
03ah another question I had
Google maps doesnt need any of motarolas stuff
You must have nuked something google
You could just flash gapps
03is there *any* benefit to doing a full (as in powre off, power on) reboot opposed to a hot boot?
03LOL, or remove the built-in maps and then download it from the market? :P
Depends what you need todo
03well
Some stuff is reloaded on kernel boot
Others on OS boot
03what would hotboot not w...oh
03well
03I usually reboot if I'm deleting apps and have problemks
03-k
03would it be more beneficial to do a full reboot?
Nah, most app stuff will be userland
03or sometimes if my service dies, I have to reboot, hot boot usually *doesn't* work for that
So hotreboot is fine
03though it's odd
Service death will need hardreboot as the kernel will need to fireup the baseband again
03Verizon was advertising that their 4G lets you do voice+data at the same time
Or eh
03but yet
03I called someone earlier and the little 4G icon disappeared
Actually, dunno, depends on which SoC you have as to what bit fires up the baseband
03well apparently Motorolas need full reboot
03but that answers myt question really
Kernel or bootloader then
03I noticed there were some times when a hot reboot didn't fix my problems but a full reboot did
03and I was curious if I was just seeing things
03but OK
03I'll just add a "long reboot" button
03to the widget
03(Power Control plus_)
^^
03see
03I can use Poewr Control Plus to replace the regular one
03but the brightness one borks
03regular power control does like 1/2/3/auto-brightness
03PC Plus only does 1/2/3/4
03and I want auto-brightness >_>
O-o
03wait WTF?
03I can get ultimate/enterprise but not business?
03That's a**backwards
03hm so Xanbreon, do you know how the enterprise OSes work, serial-wise?
03since apparently with my technet, I only get one key for enterprise since it'
03s "volume license"
03does that mean I can use that same key a bunch of times?
plenty of emulators
drf, it might be valid for more than 1 activation
and no circumventing firmware blocks
03how would I find out how many o.o
No clue drf, see if they have a FAQ
or email them
03I get free chat support
0324/7 supposedly
03I can go ask them right now XD
Do that
03oh cool, they have the acutal XP SP1a installer (240MB) on here
03all the yhave on the public site is some stupid 2MB web-based installre that doesn't work anymore
03shame that stupid Java thing happened
03TechNet Online Chat
03You have unlimited online chat service.
03of course there's someone ahead of me XD
ohaydere
How do magnets work?
03Holy crap Xanbreon
03Apparently those 3 product keys I get for regular Windows
Mhhm?
03can be activated 10 times
03so that's 30 activations LOL
03and they said the enterprise ones do 500(!) activations
03that's fricking amazing
At the same time? Or before you need todo phone activation?
03at the same time.
Nice

03Danny Forche: Hello, I had a question
03Sam: Hi Danny. Thank you for contacting the TechNet Online Concierge. How may I assist you today?
03Danny Forche: I notice that for the Enterprise versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, I only get one product key - does that allow multiple activations?
03Sam: Thanks for your inquiry. Yes, the Multiple Activation key can activate 500PCs.
03Sam: And please kindly notice that one retail key can be activated 10 times.
03Danny Forche: Ah, so with the regular versions (Windows 7 Professional, etc), I can use each of my 3 keys on 10 PCs?
03Sam: Yes, correct.
03Danny Forche: Thanks
03^ fricking awesome stuff
You can get keys with upto 1000+ activations
03well sure
03but I only paid $300
:P
awesome
03I should just give Win7 enterprise to all ym friends
03with that one key
03I don't even know 500 people :P
03but what I'll prolly do
03is get one Pro key
03and give that to like 10 people
03XD
inb3 post serial on your facebook
home premium keys?
:p
03LOL
Enterprise is basically the same as ultimate btw
03inb4 I give everybody Wijn7 Starter
03*Win
People will hate you moar
:D
03I thought Enterprise was more like Professional
03which is still fine for most people
Nope
Are there any time upgrade keys?
:s
You can put a normal key into anytime upgrade
can I anytimeupgrade vista HP to Professional/Biz?
:<
So I can upgrade this stupid desktop to 7 :V
you can, but you lose WMC ad possibly games
(if you care aboiut those
Not to sure about how it works with vista tbh
> Never use media centre and games
:o
03you can use them as anytime upgrade
03why, need one?
I only have a win7pro OEM dell disk, vista HP PC, want to upgrade without losing data
:<
03hm
03so you have Vista Home Premium right now?
Yes
:s
03I can get you a Windows 7 HP ISO
03and if you just install it wtihout a serial
03then I give you a serial for professional and it should take it as an upgrade key
Well, I'm not worried about pro really
03so you're fine with 7HP?
Just getting Laggyvista to be okay :P
Yeah
03well sure
03I can get you a key for that
03since I don't want it :P
I better find a DVD to waste
Oh wait, I have a DVD-RW
LOL
03or you can use a flash drive
