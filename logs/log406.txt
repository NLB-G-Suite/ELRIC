don't forget the +0
or you can gline *@*.dslgb.com
no need for =
er +*
tis' just 0
up to you
yeh
if you have anope
I think they do
I might akill, we were playing with it earlier
-> /os akill add 0 *@*.dslgb You are not welcome here.
or something
Yup Anope 1.8.7
WIN
I'm running 1.8.7 or somewhat
Maybe I do
maybe I don't
I assume this one
Dun discount me because I switch reason and time fields. 'tis that way on older versions of unreal, pre 3.x
and a few other ircds
Ken's not talking about this one
and fuck, forgot that akill added the oper's nick
I hate that
Eh
Doesn't matter.
Not like he can bitch much
well one moment
he's banned TROLOL
nicve
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
atcha
shesh
I use an alias
and /ns group
you'd have to group the nick anyway to use OS
it won't answer to unreg'd nicks
;p
-OperServ- 1 *@*.dslgb.com [J0rd4n] Go the fuck away.
/ns set display <nick> would be required
>:D
Win
workarounds, go!
yah
but having my nick there is just dodgy
just not now
yah
LOOOOOOOOOOL
lmfao
ogod
XD
"How the fuck did I add my self to the akill list? o.O"
lmfao
"Douchery"
"Must be part of services, haven't figured it fully out"
"Anope hates it"
LOL
for ease of use
Ie the spamfilter
uhm
only uses
users
k
also, !pants
/raw help snomasks
you could learn some snomasks and set those
xD
I have all the snomasks mainly for tracking purposes
/me can't have snomasks ._.
>:D
XD
trolol
You did that for the evulz
XD
XD
wb
>:D
bwhahahahaha
you -could- set up BNC accounts and give each a snomask and load the watch module.
>.>
and have each one print to diff oper only channels
XD
I'm on a BNC anyway
I know
but not hard.
yeah
well, I'd rather write a script
tis' far easier
That works too
might just stick it on ESG
anyway
I'm on xchat
/me forgets where the code is tho
oh
well atm I'm on CGI:IRC
yes
I actually have an oper panel
Xchat wins
oper panels suck cocks
lrn2oper
commands <3
and alias
alises
but mIRC can do pretty well under stress
aliases
depends
hehehehehe
howso?
spammage?
with the amount of snomasks and notices that were printing
trolol
sajoin spam
This is why
you build scripts to detect that
and set snomasks off
and + there was services log chan going on as well
if the snotices get crazay
and flooddetach would mitigate that via ZNC
my xchat was fine though
eh
they're not on ZNC
or script to detect and autopart
and it was snotices
I'm too lazy to do that
lol
pff
and that's the first time it's happened anyway
it's maybe 10 lines of code
and it never hurts to be prepared
probably
I'll make do when I get home
If one makes scripts to avoid mIRC's weaker usecases
and it's only heel is flud
flood mitigation scripts go a long way
well
I kinda want to see things sometimes honestly
This is why I suggested bouncing oper'd mIRC operbots
on larger networks
heh
well as long as things work it's fine
ZNC's flood detach module alone works wonders and it updates the client on re-attach with a piece of the action
if you config it right
though with Presea's sajoin spam we had about I dnno
lol
yeah
heh i lagged the bnc
if i recall
50 lines a second?
I dunno
lmfao yeah
He's pretty awesome but scary

04It's creepy, and I felt like vomiting when I accidentally saw several ;_;
orly
04yarly
a body part is a body part
04No I do not
then again i might be like that because i'm asexual
04probably
04Lack of sexual attraction probably contributes to a lack of a sense of privacy with body parts usually associated with sex and sexual attraction
ya
04Hey, if you're not turned on by /either/ boobs or dicks, that ain't my problem.
i might be attracted to non-gender humans
/me hide
04That was my reaction
why would she archive them
free porn i guess
other then that i see no point
OH WAIT
04XD
04I'll admit, I can see why a lot of guys want her
04She's pretty attractive
heh
alot pigs then
sending her those photos
04I agree completely
04To both points
anyway bbl piano

How are you?
i'm alright
cool
ugh, same old boring day.
yo
how are ya?
Fine thanks, you?
doing good
uh no?
are they doing that because he was recently captured?
Nah, he hasn't been captured.
They're trying to make it happen
yeah
so...what have you been up to lately?
no plans yet on registering the channel? heh
is it posted anywhere?
Well, on SF
And a few other places
spyroforums?
Yeah
"Join us on SpyroChat, the largest live Spyro chatroom!"
>two people
...
I dunno
Maybe not
If DS has one, it's probably active
Unlike here
:P
if there is one
I probably would want to join it
I really dont see this place turning around
Yeah, not likely.
Especially with SR AWOL most of the time, and not appointing any site admins.
do you go to any other irc channels?
I like them, but that's about as far as it goes
hm..
I guess I can check to see if theres an irc channel for DS
but its probably unlikely
it doesnt look like theres anything irc related on the other site
lol
it just links to here
when I searched for an irc channel
there are some discussions about this channel on the forums
they really need to change that description
smallest chatroom lol
you still there dari
Went AFK for a bit
am about go to eat some breakfast
Ok

bbl
hm
anything usful?
oh star wars
didn't watch all of the 2nd one
I like the 3rd episode
ya i liked that one
but i only randomly caught it on tv
I say you need to watch some television.
how
i don't have cable
i do have one of those HD tuners but it picks up maybe 2-3 channels randomly
50 from any city?
and it's just covered with blocky garbage
50 miles*
i see.
that's why
hmm well it's more like 60miles
damn
How long have you been in the town?
this town? about 9 months
the last town i was in was about 8miles closer to the city
but reception was still poor
i'm not the type to listen to radios either
Good thing the net there is quite fair.
oh it's kinda weird
why is that?
you have a choice between 256k dsl, or 12mbps or 20mbps broadband
sure i could get cable out here
but i have no income
i'm on someone else's connectoin
connection*
which just happens to be 256k dsl
oh.
too bad.
radio's been kinda
lol
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCoHT_cHPzY
radio stations have to pay taxes per song
20-30mins of advertisments
before any songs play
that's nonsense
i know
i just said fuck the radio
fuck the law
we get in about
5 country music stations
well, it's hard to get a job in there isn't it?
since you're too far away from the city
hardly anything is around.. it's worse then normal
there's alot of empty buildings where stores used to be
heh one of them was converted into a house
i guess the town allowed it
04NS
04I'm sorry

Do I want to die, or do I want to be saved
If the former, I would be mad
If the latter, I would thank them
^
It does depend
I would not lose any trust at all. I would thank them.
That's because you have something to live for
If I wanted to die, I wouldn't tell anyone, I would just do it
Probably, but still
It's not always that easy
I usually just get over it on my own
You know how it is
Actually, it has worked twice before on people I don't even know IRL.
Unless you are confident you can pull them out yourself
welp
OMG SHE ANSWERED
THANK FUCK
brb
saving her
Good luck
I normally do that
but
I uh
snapped 2 years ago
blah
I need go home
I snapped once, my parents found out. Did not enjoy it, but I'm still alive.
sigh
Any luck>
*?
because i was trying to get my point across to her.
sigh

Is she mad at you?
no

hang on
Is that an e3 skylander?
Holding
I need that shit
well expect to pay a lot for it :P
oh really?
No joke
Mhmmm
are you in college right now or did you graduate?
Silly boy
uhh yes?
Other wise ill just take the disk and a few dlc thanks
heh impressive
that youd be willing to spend that much on spyro
Dont you mean stupid? Not inpressive? :P
why stupid?
well
youd think otherwise if youve seen some friends of mine
Probably, i dont have hardley anyone that collects hardcore
Spending $170 or more on a little toy
lol
thats nothing really
Nu uh
And no
think he spent $700 to buy it
Oh fuck
I imagine it would be worth a lot
To the right people
yep
Dammmmmmit
why?
Want
I doubt youl find one
I know lol
Wasnt planning on looking. And thats why
thats when he bought one of em
Oh
Ohh
Sooooo
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&_trksid=p4340.l2557&hash=item3a707f1557&item=250995479895&nma=true&pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&rt=nc&si=XddyMBtQc7BVHyGOHIKo%252BhEW%252BeI%253D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc
One of my friends was bidding on this
He lost though :/
How much did he bid?
I dont remember
Oh
maybe $325?
Well that went up
yep lots of spyro collectors
it wasnt like this a few years ago
I know
Could i make a lower bid on it then it is? No one else has put a bid in
no you cant bid less than whats shown
you could watch it and see if it is relisted at a lower price
But the thing is when you buy these skylanders figures you use em right?
or do you not open them?
Id like to buy two of each if possible
Mhm
I still havent opened up that ds version of skylanders yet :P
Lol geeze. Oh shit, found one with 2 hours left, $165...
Well if you get it I hope you wrap it in plastic lol
Thisll be my first "rare" i guess
oh
Oh. Theyre pretty dang safe
Could be safer though, but yeah believe me id be very careful with her
Most of my collectables are in separate plastic bags
Oo
If you remember the spyro pics I had, they were all wraped in clear bags
I think i do
how much time left?
Hit
Shit
?
I was going to say dont bid until the last 5 seconds
it gives the current bidder time to outbid you
lol
I know
oh yeah, gotta be 18
Fucking lame
Its because you need a checking account/credit card
Yeah
I honestly think its too expensive
Oh it is
:P

I'm bidding on this soon
Whats its importance?
Yoshis island for one
Oh i see now
Well...arnt most peoples? Mine are
not really
Oh
most people throw em away
hence why they are collectable
yep
Why......loo
Lol*
Oo
Lol i bet
sorry if I'm boring you :P
oh I see
Well i do...not all of it
Bleh
Lol
well
basicly I try to collect whatever is rare/valuable
Hopefully that pays off
I havent opened my mass effect copies yet
Lol
Ive got maybe 10 games I still need to beat
Dang
Vanquish, Ratchet & clank, spyro enter the dragonfly, halo 2
rayman 3d, marioland 3d
I usually beat mine pretty fast, not 100% but still, the story mode once
oh I ment 100%
Ohhh
Lol well i havnt beaten quite a bit 100%
It took me over 1 month to beat the first mass effect 100%
Ouch
and thats playing it daily
actually no I still have a couple things missing
Lol
theres like a ton of side quests
its pretty awesome
I figured
I heard that too
which is a real shame, I thought it was going to be real good...thats why I bought two collector editions >.>
Lol
one to keep one to play just like skylanders :P
:p
You must be in the money
why do you say that?
Do buy two of everything
You buy*
I guess you could say its on the business credit card :P
Lol
I planned on selling the other
I know but still
nah I dont have a lot of cash
Oh hehe
I preordered ME3 last year
I had lots of time to put money aside for it
In about to preorder two sick looking games
I wasnt planning to buy a 2nd copy but I heard they stopped making em cause they capped it
Whyd tey do that
Ph
Oh
except the Halo series
Like legos!
Damn
Probably
its a win win :)
Smarty panta
Pantssss
Oh...hehe
?
Ive been seeing it everywhere
I remember some talk about it being a scam
but if it really is its hard to believe
I heard somethin like that
That the organization was using 70% of the money for itself
thats sad..
Quite
yeah that happens lol
Lol
Yesssss
cool
Infinite*
Do tou want them?
You
I dont have any plans thus far
nah
Aww how come?
Ohs
Ever play the first ones of them?
no but I should
havent checked to see if they are at my local gamestop
I want to play rayman orgins
I heard that was good
I was going to buy it a few weeks ago but apparently they have a limited edition online
and its not sold in stores
Oo
Nice
woah this is wierd
I'm checking my gamestop points card and its showing some games it says I bought
but I didnt actually buy them
and it gave me the points anyway
Uh oh
if they wanna give me points randomly I'm fine with that lol
Lol idk i thought it had a bad side
I guess
Idk

04hi NS
:D
I was thinking
we could use Avatar as inspiration
since that's technically from the future
04yes, like 500 years into the future
well
the reason it's 500 years into the future
is because of the psionics and shit
and weaponry isn't actaully that advanced
like the helicopter Trudy flies
also
04sure
would we be far enough into the future
04So you want a double-rotor aircraft?
to have large aircrafts/flying bases?
well
but
and well
idk
I was mostly just looking at concepts
not paying attention to details
hi u
04http://www.pandorapedia.com/human_operations/vehicles/dragon_gunship
04That thing
04Because yes, I can imagine that
04And it would be cool
yeah
04Then yes that would be awesome
04Nothing too larger than that though
well
would it have enough fuel to last for a month or similar?
04Just punch it out of the sky with missiles
well
maybe not a month
but
a lightweight one that's possibly smaller
04Several weeks? Depends on fuel advances and fuel consumption
it'd be cool for them to use one as a mobile mission base
and they could also use one after they go into hiding
04And no
04Because there'd need to be a crew of at least 5 for a gunship like that
wouldn't specifically have to be a gunship
mostly aerial support platform
or at least a transport one
that wouldn't require more than 2-3
04And I'm not even joking
okay i know I know
but
I know I know
well it'd have to have one
assuming that it'd be suitable enough
I'd say that the aircraft(s) would also be used in invasion fleets
04I can see that
since they /are/ for dropping off troops and all that
04Command aircraft to coordinate other aircraft or simply the invasion force as a whole
04Indie would have several
when they invade the communications tower/center
hah
well
I imagine they'd be used in large team missions
since it's not mobile
could have Rhy as one of the escorters for one mission
04Well look at AVATAR.
04Which makes sense seeing it's basically a helicopter
You wouldn't let Rhy have one on her fighter ):
04Fighter jets don't work like that!
It can still have one
):
doesn't matter
anyway
04Helicopters nearly ALWAYS have some sort of swivel turret
probably
anyway
we've already decided on Rhy's
04No swivel guns.
04Rocket pods
I don't think the gunships would have too much weaponry
04Folding missile rack
because I don't think they'd be too advanced by that stage
yes I know
but yeah
not a whole shitload of weaponry
while it'd still be a heavy-weapon classed aircraft
it can't be something with over 9000 guns or something
because that's unrealistic
by 2077 or whatever we decided on, I"ll look it up later
04yeah
04But two computer-controlled automatic gatling guns, several missile pods and guided missiles, and that should do it.
04Maybe with a side gunner or two
04limited long-range weaponry, but perfectly capable of defending itself against hostile ground forces while it deploys
probably bombs as well
04One or two
well
it's still a weapons platform
and it'd be liable to do a LOT of air-ground attacks
since it'd probably be a half-bomber in a sort of way
and well
there'd be different classes
04true
could probably use a system similar to Star Wars'
theta-class, delta-class, alpha-class, etc.
lolwut
Yes.
http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Galactic_Empire_starship_classes
04Acclamater Assault Ship
04NS, any craft can just be named after anything, then slap some numbers and letters in front or behind it and it looks official
it'd be nice to create some classes
04Choose a theme
04Weapons, Animals, places, battles, mountains, cities, etc.
04Alrighty
or
04That's not overused at all but ok
you could do something like
assault-class, defender-class, etc.
04Hold up
04Here are some of my examples I've made
that's why they're used
or
0422B Incisor helicopter, colloquially known as "The Scissor"
or simple numbers but that's boring and hard to remember
0418T Heavyweight
22B, 18T?
.
04RIN "Lovecraft" Archer
thanks NS
by classes
I mean CLASSES
/me checks logs
77C Mod 49.
intercepter/interceptor
w/e
04Sure
04Let's go with that
and uh, Model Name not Model Type
04Alright, that works
but yeah
I'm talking classes
not model numbers
[19:45:07] <Drake> Weapons, Animals, places, battles, mountains, cities, etc.
[19:45:14] <~Iago> you could do something like
[19:45:23] <~Iago> assault-class, defender-class, etc.
animals is weird
weapons is kinda redundant and confusing
and cities is just sad
haha yes
we could remove that entirely
but
04Not really.
04Maybe the manufacturer?
because the classes would be a certain specifications of things it has and can do
No...
04Or the actual name of the craft?
No
04Since nearly all aircraft are named by their pilots
Leviathan/Aetherwing are the craft names
model names
basically
04I thought we called it-
let me explained it
-ed
ANYWAY
basically
something like a higher Delta-class fighter would have more weaponry with more missiles that can do damage etc.
because that's the name
04Because the model has it's own specs and uses
put it this way
how well it performs, etc.
04Well that's stupid
Oh?
04Who tests the aircraft?
manufacturers?
04Yes
No
it doesn't need to be tested
it's graded via its specs
it's estimates
04And the manufacturers all agree on this.
04Highly unlikely.
it's international standard.
04More than likely they'd keep the specs quiet to all but the people they're selling them too.
besides
and models can have different levels of classes
besides
a lot of aircraft specs ARE made public you know
no, I don't think you get it
pilots do make modifications
while originally something might be classed as a theta-class aircraft
it might be raised to a delta-class after it's been modified
although that's slightly dodgy
but whatever
still
are you seriously going to bother remembering the fucking specs of EVERY SINGLE AIRCRAFT we make?
but still
classes aren't extremely specific
for each category
04I can see that happening for each spec (Speed, Fireposer etc.) but for each craft as a whole? No.
04An Aetherwing might have "Delta-Class" speed, and another Aetherwing might have "Gamma-Class" speed, but I don't see them as entirely worthy of a complete title
if you're going to rate the speeds
you may as well just put the specific range
in total
because it makes no sense to do it for each individual category
besides, as I said
this makes it easier on us
and the readers
04No, it actually makes it more confusing
are we going to fucking state the specs of EVERY single fucking aircraft every time it comes up?
04No, but adding "classes" when we already have a "model" is stupid
04You don't see various classes of F-22's do you?
models are far too specific
they're names
and require dealing out specs for each
04not really
model names
don't you understand?
they're not TYPES
they're NAMES
04WHY THE FUCK WOULD A MODEL HAVE SEVERAL TYPES WHEN IT IS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR A CERTAIN GODDAMN ROLE?
lolwut?
as I said
Models
are specific
they're not MEANT to be specific
04But why would a craft need classes
04Why
Yes we do
we're not going that far
04We don't have to by simply mentioning models.
04Done. No more needs to be said.
or how much weaponry it has?
04Now YOU'RE going too in-depth
04Unless the crew is using it, we really don't need to go to in-depth
It shows the BASICS of that
04Goddamnit NS you're making it far too complex
without us having to go into detail every time
you're not getting the point
lol we spent the last half an hour arguing about this
04I don't want to keep arguing over something like this.
04As are you
feeling's mutual then
/me hugs back
we need to make some model names and such
04I'd rather not right now
04After Mass Effect 2, I need some violent, mindless killing.
04Mass Effect 3*
04And I need to work on DoI
no u
04May hasn't responded to me in ages, which is pissing me off because she was meant to write the next chapter, which I now have to do.
04I want to keep writing, but I'm not sure if using her characters without her to oversee it is really right.
04Problem is, I've integrated them into the story far too much to change it now
04I also have a feeling she doesn't see the story as seriously as I do.
that's the problem with co-authoring
04If it's IRL it's not that bad.
04And online as long as you have a good way to stay in contact...
04But damn I'm pissed off
04I spent 3 years planning this, ironing out every kink and plothole
04I'm not giving up on it.
04Even if I can't do anything with it, I want it written.
.-.
well
write it then
you don't have to post it
04I am. Slowly.
well
good luck
I finished Reminiscence
after
I lost count of how long
04Heh, I'll probably show it to all my friends, but that's about it.
04XD
042 years?
042 and a half?
yeah
I didn't exactly plan it though
04I overplan things
04as evidenced by DoI
04BUT THE CONTINUITY IS WORTH IT
well
and it was my first proper fic
04As was I with the first DoI, thus why I re-made it
I want to remake Reminiscence
except I don't think I'll finish it
and I want to do Leader's Legacy
04XD
04Just write it on-and-off
04No need to put enormous amounts of time into it
that's the thing
you /do/ need to put a lot of time into writing fics
if you write it on and off
it's not as good
when you write fics
you get brainwaves and a lot of ideas
you need to write them all down
into the fic
not into dot points
04I don't write dot points
good then
04I write a 30-page summary about a 30 chapters fanfic
summaries
don't
work
04I find that they do.
but
04Especially since mine are stupidly detailed
the ideas of how to write them
but how you write it
that's the important part
04I find the "What you write" more important to how much I enjoy writing
then just plot it
if that's all you want to do
then there's no need to write out a fic
if you're going to do something
you may as well go all-out
or it'll be for nothing
but that's not the most important part
it's still important to remember first and foremost that the writing ideas that you have are the more important factor(s)
04I know that
04But I'm a continuity nerd
As am I
because that's when you have the best ideas
and when the ideas flow the easiest
I don't anymore
04Best way to waste time while still looking like you're doing work
but I actually have to do work
and I spend time on IRC ;-;
04I still do work of course
04But the IT guys blocked that CGI:IRC link you gave me
oh really?
and find one that works
mine hasn't been blocked for 4 years :D
04XD
04I don't think I'll bother
04no one's on
04And no one talks
highlight people
and they do talk
get on TST
and I want to talk to you
04heh
04I'm always on TST
I'm rarely on TST
I'm always here
oh, fuck my mum
just
fuck her

She set me up on a server and I need help getting the ircd up and services installed
If its unreal, its piss easy
Isnt there a howto in the tarball?
Now I'm up to the point of copying the corresponding ircd.conf example, just don't know how to/where to copy it

04I wasn't asking for a torrent
04I just want to know if a certain track is on the soundtrack, but the problem is no one knows the name of it.
/me shrugs
04bluh
04It's probably bad that I want to write a Mass Effect 3 fanfic
.-.
04I already have DoI, Wake, that story you and I still need to write, and CoE
04No, Wake is my sci-fi one
04Dunno if I'll ever actually do my psychic one
04And I had another Hunger-Games-like dream last night that inspired storiez
04Except it somehow had Spore, Mass EFfect, and Yu-Gi-Oh in it.
04Dunno how that went together.
uh okay
04I blame my friends for the Yu-Gi-Oh part.
04Fucking nerds.
heh
Sazerac loves Yu-Gi-Oh too
I like the games
04Once of them spent over $200 on one card alone. One. Card.

even if it would make it go by quicker
make replicator first
thanks for the tip though Quilava

02And that's why I don't have an alarm clock lol
vista why are you doing this to me
>Vista
why can't you format
ever since i upgraded
it bluescreens at startup
14I have 50gb free
it sat there for 2 seconds and said "please restart computer to finish" XD
LOL
and still didn't fix the problem
14lol
sure
14great :D
that's why you don't upgrae
*upgrade
i mean
update
I have that one :P
and if I sign up for TechNet I can get more
the one from before i see XD
okay XD
14http://i.qkme.me/3ofrjn.jpg
and say "one" when it's installed on a computer and then i have a VM of it
drf
?
dreamspark or something
yes
i have an account with it
i don't think i can grab multiple copies of an OS though
make another account :P
but they only have the server OSes anyway
nah
i downloaded 7 from it before
wait
Dreamspark doesn't have 7
unless you mean MSDNAA
(DreamSpark Premium, same thing)
maybe that was it
MSDNAA is awesome
gah why did i delete that email
that's where my 7 key came from too
gah
no matter where i go
dreamspark doesn't think my account exists
yeah, mine does that sometimes too x.x
well i held onto the email for the longest time
i should have just bookmarked them though
i know the link was like onthehub.blahblah
i'd rather not use the same key as i did with my other computer

i don't want to waste money on that crappy laptop
DRF has his free 7? LOL
Fine, install Win2k or Xp
:P
no, drf has a free 7 that involves giving me a product code he already gave me for the installation for my desktop computer
I have a spare pro key
I think
/me should look for laptops to steal Win7Pro keys from :D
besides i think i just fixed the problem
somehow installing service pack 1 fixed it XD
See

14uhm ok then
you only need like 500-600MB really

yeah, I've used 7 on 1GB
you'll get a huge pagefile anyway

to be honest
It can read Ext3/2
i just move over to vista
You'll have tons of those.
correction
I'd use XP for such purposes
if i have a compatibility issue
i'd use my XP VM
and if i still can't get work done then i'll use vista
it works for me
plus
i'm not wasting money on the laptop to put winodws 7 on it

04WATCH THIS
10What's it about?
04It's about a city in Japan, called Academy City, which is compromised mostly of students.
04However, most students are "Espers", people with various psychic powers.
04The main series is To Aru Majutsu No Index, which Railgun is split from
04There also happens to be loads of characters
04"Railgun" happens to be one of Misaka's abilities using her power, "Electromaster"

10mew
03also wtf
k
03the Droid 4
10for a minute I thought mewtwo was a script there
03has an internal SD card
03so there's like
03two of them
03and it's screwing everything up
03since the *real* MicroSD
10...
03is called "sdcard-ext"
03so all these programs are just putting their backup files in /sdcard
03which isn't actually an SD card
03brilliant logic, right?
10Best song
03inb4 something re...yeah k
10Is it Huge Hallow mix/
10?*
lack of RAM
no, don't have that one
03haven't we been over the fact that the 3DS is a failure of a console?
there's only 128mb
yup
03they could have easily put more
eh
maybe
03"Let's make the best software we can on the incredibly bad hardware... made for us"
instead of larger memory
03er
03*made by us
03*cough* DDR3 1600MHz or whatnot *cough*
greediness
lol
03exactly
03is make the crappiest hardware possible and then try their hardest (usually failing) to make a good user experience for said crappy hardwrae
03*ware
03since they essentially took the GameCube hardware and made it wireless
03and added widescreen
that's all
good for its time?
Not really
03better graphics than the GBA
03they're each good for their own things
03and the PSP screen kinda sucks, it has motion blur
03but yeah, I have both consoles, either way
03well
03the gameboys used TFTS, didn't they?
03*TFTs
03but by the time DS/PSP was around they easily could have uesd LCDs
03and I think the DS did
gameboy used dot matrix
something
drf yeah
03how is that different than TFT?
The DS' dual screen design is like
really cool
03exactly
but the hardware's old :/
03I remember going "LOL two screens, why?"
03but when it came out
03but barely
it's not exactly that innovative
03well
the 2 screens aren't identical
03not only that
03wait
kinda ruins the dual screen thing of the DS
drf at least the 3DS supports specular mapping
XP
03they *were* identical
03on the DS
/me runs
03DS Lite screwed that up
little
eh
?
3DS has nice hardcoded shaders
03the DS touchscreen is the same as the top screen with a little plastic thingy over it to make it touch sensitive
DS lite looks like it has similar screens...
that's pretty much all
03if anything
03the DS Lite looked like it had *bigger* screens
03just due to the ratio
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/120318.jpg
03of plastic to screen XD
12the 3DS does have widescreen though XD
Not the touch screen
on the top screen
12which to me is a good thing
anyway
03it's not 16:9
I have to go
03I don't think anyway
03@calc 400/24o0
03er
= 16.666667
12it is
since the touch screen scratches the top screen
03@calc 400/240
yeah it's a weird ratio
= 1.666667
12almost
03yeah it's narrower
it's 5:3
anyway
12bye Chimew
bai
12The 3DS also has the analog circle pad
03the circle pad is kinda obnoxious
i lose my grip of that all the time
03the rest of them IR'd prefer the D-pad
03*i'd
03no it's not
03MK DS was awesome
03pilotwings is stupid
I play MKDS with dpad
03hated it
03exactly
03MKDS is awesome
12the D-pad on MK DS hurt my fingers :<
a year ago
now it's awesome
12MK DS was awesome, and is awesome
Too bad i can't play online on that anymore
WEP...
my network is WPA2
03that's why you just make another hotspot
03I've go ttwo set up
03one has WPA2
03the other has WEP and doesn't broadcast its SSID
XD
my laptop's wifi board doesn't support adhoc connections
no, i have a router
but it's wireless
03so i smine
03The actual router itself supports up to 5 SSIDs LOL
mine can't
cisco epc2425
03why not just switch it to WEP then?
Insecure
03dude, everything is insecure with aircrack
everything here relies on it
my computer's conneccted to it wirelessly
/me np: [3Song: 9 ()][3Artist: 9][3Album: 9 ()][00m:05s/02m:13s4/128Kbps/44KHz4/()]
err
Supposed to be the roflmao thing
03unless they personally hated me or something XD
12XD
03well then try not doing that?
03I named mine "DON'T STEAL MY BANDWIDTH" and put WEP on it, never had any problems
03that was my router in college
03when I'm at home, the router here is just my last name
03anyway
03the actual partitions support them
03but it just allcaps them
03Windows XP can rename them, but that apparently only renames it on the local computer and not the disk iteslf
03I can't
03but the problem is
03for some reason
03gparted doesn't show it

my hard drives are "ELEMENTS" i think

03I'm going to try the unthinkable

03She was talking about being "third double"
03and I was like
03why are they ranking players
03and I didn't know how "team" tennis works
03given that it's an individual sport
03so I let her explain the whole
03some poeple play by themselves, others play with partners, etc

03well, the part tha tI really didn't get, was how the entire team wins or loses
I mean it's cool
03which kinda su\cks
but like
03he'll win his match
03but the team loses
13:3c
03my sister hates singles too
Doubles is a lot more spontaneous :'D
I don't hate singles
03she refuses to play singles XD
LOL
03she's like "I want a partner or I don't want to play"
lol her coaches let her do that
03well it also gives her a bit of an excuse to not practice
03"oh, my partner is busy, sorry"
03no
03they do that too
03they put her on doubles
03like technically she had no say
03but she hates singles regardless
oh XD
03so she was glad to be put on doubles XD
03but I'm like
03OK
03people take pride in being first, right?
03but then
03you get stuck playing the best person
03I was like, i'd want to be the lowest one
/me runs
03yeah but I mean
03when they rank you at first
or else you would just put the best player last and win all the time
03what if you just intentionally play crappy
03so they think you suck
03DX
13.w. I'll just stop taking things out of context here

03hey, it's worse in tennis I think
03like
03if you lose, everybody else hates you XD
03assuming you're on a team, at least
well
03and she's on the school team
the thing is
our team loses 5/8 of our matches
03I guess if you just play for personal satisf
03action
if you lose
03then sure
IT'S NORMAL
03yeah, same with my dad's team
if you win you're loved XD

03hm?
07and they take a percentage
03ah

07they don't let you use part of it right away?
03nope
03it's weird though'
03I used the Chase mobile app, where you can photograph the check and whatnot

03LOL wow
03in this movie
03they attempt the code "Dinero"
03and the captions say "De nero"
inb4 De nial
03?
Dundunduh
03I'm gonna sign up for Technet Professional
Oh yes?
03Yeah
03they give you 3 of each
03MSDN gives you 10 of each
02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
03so I figure
03it's not worth it
03@ MSDN
03because like
03Technet Professional is $300 with coupon code and you can get 3 of each Windows+Office
Aahh
03which is still *tons* cheaper than retail LOL
03I called them
03and asked
03so that I have it LOL
I mean, are you actually going to use it?
03since I build computers a lot
03that way I'll have a ton of Win7 keys
03the XP and 7 keys sure
03professional/ultimate at leats
Mmhm
03*least
03Yes, that's on there
03XD
03As for professional instead of standard
03standard only gives you 2 keys for each + no enterprise versions
Aaahh
03and I just got another bunch of money for my birthday
03so why not XD
03MSDN
03MSDn gives you 10 of each
Aaah
03but it's craptons more
03I think like $1500?
03if not more
Isnt there supposed to be one that give you daily keys?
03nope
03like
03the daily keys thing
03is stupid
03basically it's 44 keys per day, but still only 3 per product
03so essentially you could claim every single key in a few weeks LOL
Oh I see
03yeah
03I don't quite get it either
03MSDN works the same way
03probably just to avoid server rape
Its just how MS work
03yeah
03imagine if someone got ahold of that keygen Xd
03*XD\
Probs if you need more than 44 keys per day
You should have a VLK
And an activation server
03yeah
hey
Thats the harder part
03at work
03or some sort of enterprise key
03we have the same serial on every computer
03and it activates fine
03like 50 times
Compiler compile the code into ASM
like HTML
interpreter runs it
03so it's probably an activation server
ok
07lol
Interpreter is like java to the JVM
03well
03I'm not sure
XP style, where you dont need to run a server
03and that stopped working
03like after about 3 activations
07|D
03now it's blacklitsed:P
07</random>
youderp
03well
03I've used the same Win7 key about 20 times
ok
thanks
03?
03through MS?
03it's literally the exact same key
03I'm not sure why we don;'t use a VLK for 7
03we literally have store-bought OEM discs
03with the stickers
03for each computer
03why, is that expensive?
And you probs dont have enough machines to make it worth while
Dunno, never bothered to look into it
03heck, why couldn't someone just hack an activation server
03once it's activated, it stays activated
You can just hack the OEM bios activation junk
People used todo that
03*seen
03and for XP I have a crack anyway
Theres tons of BIOS emu junk for 7
03seen people hack the OEM activa4tion
03-4
03well
I just use MSDN or MSDNA keys
03I haven't actually seen any computers that came with preactivated 7
03since all of mine are either home-made or came with Vista+upgrade disc
03like my mom's
03had Visyta
03-t
03and we got the upgrade disc through MS
03and I installed it using that key
03it was a store computer
03it had pre-activated Vista
03but 7 came as an upgrade disc
03that's wha tI mean
03I haven't bought a computer since 7 came out
03or at least a store one
to execute during login?
Its the same junk as vista for the most part
%path's anything really
a logon script that logs off ( ¬‿¬)
You could do that
But it would be kinda pointless
03Xanbreon I got a few Android questions for you
Sure
03and then I put in an actual MicroSD
03so now there are two
03problem is
03my real one shows up as /sdcard-ext
03and all the backup programs use /sdcard
03some don't let me change it
03is there a way to switch the two, or make the internal something like /sdcard-int ?
03darn it
03you can't even swap them?
Hurrhm
You might be able to screw with the mount points
03like
03if I click on my apps
03it actually shows every app (free and paid) that I've ever installed
03it's much easier to just click-click-download than trying to use the phone XD
is /sdcard-ext under /sdcard or are they both under the root dir?
03root
03they literally show up as two defices
03*devices
Hurrhm
Maybe, you would have to check XDA tbh
If its doable, its probs been done
03*devices
I know you cant do it on the SGS2, but eh
03er
03*OK
03so SGS2 has that same crap with two SD cards?
03I wish you could just disable the internal mount point if you have a real MicroSD
03er *card
heh
Wouldnt make much sence for lots of phones that now have 16gig or something of built in storage
03this one's 8
03but I have a 32GB MicroSD
03which is more pro :P
03there are some rumors that it can actually use the 64GB Micro SDXC cards
Internal storage is normally FAR faster
03hm
Lots of phones can
03I could look into that for nandroid backups then
They do
03well
03right now I have this crap installed using SafeStrap
03the problem is that I can't apparently boot into the recovery menu automatically
03I have to manually press the menu key after booting
03which means no scheduling
03:/
03yeah
03stupid locked bootloaders
This is why I avoided them at all costs
03I had no choice
03I needed a 4G phone with a keyboard
You didnt need, you wanted
:P
^
03same thing
03anyway wtf else was I going to ask
NOT same thing
Not really :P
blah blah blah
</PATF>
03oh, do you know anything about custom lockscreens?
03but the lockscreen is pretty reta9rded, the swipe to unlock thing is like in the MIDDLE of it, height-wise
Pretty sure theres lockscreens you can use on the market
eg widgetlocker
03hm
03and they can replace the stock one?
You turn off the stock one, and just use the other one
03like all they did was add widgets to the stock one
03how do you "turn off" the stock one
Actually, dunno how they work
03I'm not even sure how the launcher works, I installed AdwLauncher and it literally just replaced the stock one on its own o_O
03and no root required?
Never tried one
Shouldnt need root
03my friend used one called Launcher Pro
I use ADW EX
03why wouldn't you need root to replace the launcher?
Huh
The launcher is just another app
You dont need root to use a diff one
03you need root to take a screenshot but not to replace the launcher/
03?
Launcher is just another app..
03so it doesn't actually replace it?
03well
03how does it tell the stock launcher to gtfo then?
The screen shot thing is due to androids sec model
03I can't find any settings for that
03@ launchers
03oh but speaking of settings
03for some stupid reason, all my text is being underlined
03when I type
Install 2 launchers
Hit the home button
03either using the on screen keyboard or the real one
03it just used Adw
03on its own
Sleep well Espeon<3
03didn't ask me
Yes..
Then the stock launcher didnt take the default
03I don't even know how I'd switch back, other than removing Adw
03Not that i want to
03anyway
03any idea @ the underlined text?
03I swear I fixed that problem before but forget how
back
03it li[terally underlines every word I type, even with autocorrect turned off
settings > applications > downloaded > click an app > scroll down to launch by defaul
03yeah I know
03you sure?
03I'm pretty sure I saw some posts on xda from other manufacturers
Oh, like, the world you are typing is underlined?
Or all text?
03the word
03also
03AdwLauncher has no defaults set :P
03but yet it replaces the stock one
03hence, Magic :P
Then to stock isnt asking for the default
03I just don't know how it can do that without root
03yeah but I mean, the stock one isn't even an app
03it's just there
The launcher is just another app
It is just an app
Just built into the rom
:P
03well it's hidden from the "manage apps" then
Of cause, but if you looked in /system/app
03ahy
03-y
03so like
I have ADW EX built into the rom I am using, I just winrar'ed it in there
03what's all this fuss over freezing system apps? I just delete the apk file LOl
03from /system.app
03*/
Also less of a pain if you want to get something back
03yeah but the whole "freeze/restore"
03supposedlyh it doesn't "delete" them
03just prevents them from working
03or something
It doesnt
03hm
03I'm curious
03how is ADW EX different than the free one?
03is it the same launcher but with more customization options?
Its a lot "smoother" and more customisation options
03smoother?
Mhhm
I had them side by side, and with my setup EX was a lot faster, and didnt jitter at all
03it was laggy on my older phones but that's due to crappy specs
03so you think it's worth the $4 or whatever it is?
Meh, I can give you the apk if you wanna try it
03*XD
03Yahoo Mail apparently uses notifications
03and I can't turn them off in the app
unno
03can I tell Android to just silence the app from sending notifications/
03I swear I never had that problem before
03and there *was8 an option
"EWH YAHOO"
03but apparently they removed it, dirty programmers
03I've had it since 2001
03and see no reason to stop XD
Heh
03it works fine for my needs
03and I prefer web-based email to pop3/imap
I had a hotmail email, but I moved to gmail pretty much as soon as it was out
03since I read my emails from everywhere and I hate that whole "webmail" client
03ah there
03I can turn off notifications in the app
03I just had to try the other thing XD
You cant diables notification on a OS lvl
03OK
03hmm
03are widgets just apk files too?
Everythings an apk
Apart from the framework
03res-framework.apk ;p
widgets may be built into the app though
03into which app?
03the framework?
03ah
03well
03there's a widget that I've always had
03called Power Control
03for some stupid reason
03the Droid 4 lacks it
Aahh
03could I just port the apk over from the other phone?
03like, can you *install* it or is that a system thing
03since it always just came with the phone
You would probs have to push it
03it wasn't a Moto-specific thing either, cyanogenmod has it too
03motoblur? :P
03hm
Its kind of a complext intertwining of stock framework, and OEM frameworks
03are the options that show up under Settings built into the framework and/or settings apk?
settings is just an apk
But its compiled against the framework
Otherwise nothing works
Frameworks provide assests that apps use
depending on how much the OEM screwed around in them
03hm
03well is there a way to remove one of the menus in settings?
03I'm assuming not :/
Yes
But you would need to decompile
And frack around in the XML
03oh
03meh, too lazy
03basically
03Verizon has this crap called Backup Assistant
03it was nice back on dumbphones
Dude, XDA
03but yet, they insist on shoving that crap on their Android phones
03I can delete the APK
Its probs been removed
03but it's also an entire submenu in the settings
from the settings menu as well
03so that just breaks it
03if you click on it, it crashes the phone
03LOl
-side+forum
03except cyanogenmod :/
03they're apparently working on CM9 for it but it's buggy as frick, as all CM9s are
03hence why I hate ICS
Hmm
Blame the OEMs for not giving us src
I need to go check on the status of ICS kernels/roms soon
03(stock)
03just in the near future
03but honestly I'm fine with 2.3
We have ICS stock roms
They have been touchjizzed allover
03not for the Droid 4 though
And still are kinda buggy
Nah
When I say we, I mean sgs2
:/
03oh'
03yeah I don't have a Samsung :
03*:P
03and no I'm not a motorola fanboy
03I was considering the Samsung Stratosphere
03but that thing has crap specs for its time x.x
If there was a SGS2 with a KB i would have said go for it
But meh, thats basically just a SGS1 with a KB
:/
03exactly
03Droid 4 is a lot more hardcore hardware wise
03it might not be cutting edge but it's still really good by today's standards
Yeh, its fine
SoC is falling behind, but its still find
*fine
03I got it rooted, I got recovery (sorta), honestly the only thing I'd want at this point is CyanogenMod
03SoC?
:p
03oh
You should be able to run a nes emulator np
03I was kidding
Meh.. if they are going quad A9 for the sgs3 I really think about it tbh
03hm.
03you know the uh
03battery percentages
03is that built into framework
03?
Errrh
03for some incredibly stupid reason, the Droid 4 has 10% increments, despite the Droid 2 (hardware, at least) supporting 1% increments >_>
03it's like going backwards LOL
Widgets should still show 1%'s even if the UI only shows 10%'s
03nope.
03Battery Widget shows them in 10s
03whereas it did 10% on stock since the stock UI did 10
03yeah but it's more accurateg than 10%
03:P
Depends
Err
after high load
due to overestimated etc
03that's wha tI thought
03but well
03I think battery widget just grabs the info from "battery info"
03are there ones that do something else?
Varies from phone to phone
as its a hardware thing
03supposedly the Droid 2 took some tweaking for them to get 1% increments
03since AFAIK you can't mess with hardware in custom ROMs
You cant measure it well enough todo 1%'s well
This is why OEMS do 10%s or no %
03I swear I've seen OEMs with 1%
Thus poor wording
hard to form nice seninces
frack sake
03you drunk too? :P
No
03surprising
Piss off
I know right
:P
Tossers
Somewhere in the framework yeh
LOLFail
03yeah, Motorola is trying to be "green" now >:_>
03*>_>
03what really bugs me too
03and this I think is universal for all Androids
03and I swear there's a hack to fix that

6sorry that was random
6ah
all of NZ has one timezone
6oh does it?
6didn't know that lol
NZST or NZDT
it's not like amerrika or oostralia
6ok I might call america amerrika from now on
wow I'm failing pretty bad at striking up a conversation
then again it is the middle of the night
┐('～`；)┌

no?
6I wish
6to visit
6new zealand
i want to go to amerrika
6if I ever do, i'll let you know LOL.

o/`'
6amerrika is awkward lol
6california is its own country
/me 6shrugs
I used to live there
a lot of IRC pplz r in amerrika
got too expensive
6yeah they are
6a lot of them are in california too
6I've met most of them
Reno,NV
Nevada?

yep Nevada
6I can barely stand central CA
well not all of it
a majority yes but Reno is pretty nice
yep I'm on ignore jun
this sucks
6actually you're not
6but i've already told you I'm not dealing with you
6because everytime I do
6I come to regret it
6you did a really suckish job
today I am?
hmm
6gives me no reason to even bother with you
I had alot on my plate that day
6all of them.
6believe me, I am not an aggressive person
I'm trying to reach out
6the fact you see me aggressive should be a sign in itself
6I'll say this
6just leave me alone, entirely
6I don't like setting ignores, it's a hassle
6if i talk to you, it'll be on my own accord
I hate having enemies
dude frick
6just leave it at that
stop apologizing for aplogizing for aplogizing for aplogizing etc
it's a two sided process
just talk (r)
....have i been missing something...
trying to trademark that ?
its not my buisness..
/me idles.
heh
there's nothing to intrude on
6silversonic, it's a long story that I can't believe this is continuing but i'm trying to get it to stop lol
ahh XD
this is over
6its ok
I'm ready to move on I suppose
6god
6*good
6sato, that's my point >.>
I don't have to be friends with everyone on here
6and since i don't care, I'll say that, and tell you not to nick alert me to give me special attention
6mainly because i'm too lazy to set ignore every time i come on here
6there, done
6and I'm on memebase
6wonderful
I heard the controls can be wonky
inb4 get a proper IRC client (tm)

oh

I want to throw an SSD into that desktop
6fuuu
for hell's sake
$330 for 1 TB solid state jun
6who I admittedly havent seen in
6a while.
Uh no problems
And uh, I'm still technically away
6"technically"
6is such a loose term lol
well
I'm still not at home
and won't be until tomorrow
6oh
6wait where have you been
( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱﾊﾊ八八ﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉ ＼ / ＼/ ＼

6jun faces lol

6..
I kinda cbf'd to post on the forums
>bangs & knocks
6I KNEW THIS LOL.
XD
6I'm sorry, I've had a long day, I'm losing my brain
butyeaaa
xD
SSD is still such an expensive investment
6correction

bbl
6ok well
\o
but you're the only one who'll talk to me, damn
6i think
6i need to get off the comp
I sure hope not
that's kinda counter-productive
and expensive?
if not this would clearly just be for business
satol alert
if something isn't funded on day 1 of being on kickstarter is that a bad sign?
like funded at all
shrug
hmm
atleast there's no risk
I won't owe anything if the funding fails
as is I don't have the tools or team I need
I think Grant Kirkhope did such a good job with it
given the limitations he had
very down to earth person, he personally responded to an email of mine once

Win
02hmm, I should look about this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9c-5WAy94
02DAM!
that's why i want to make it run the hypervisor XD
02and I can understand why *-*
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
i know one thing they probably did was disable prefetch
annoying little feature
02hmm yeah
as an actual OS instead of VM
02oh good luck!
i don't need luck XD
Win8 is iffy
it is iffy
Remove metro, add start menu
then it'll be fine
well
only reason i'm making it an OS
is to be a hypervisor
XD
it's the fastest bootup OS i know right now
that i have access to
that it takes all 60GB
well
see
I *THINK*
give them time to buy the actual OS before it dies :p
they don't support it anymore?
you know.
Unactivates itself
hmm

:p
i see
around that time
haha
02x3
Soo
lol
:P
i'll think of something
i think 7 boots faster than vista
:P
The only times folders crashed was when
I used a floppy disk
:P
well i did everything i know how to speed up a system in vista
disabled prefetch, adjusted it for best performance
02*WB03(Light_Latias03)02WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~

How do I disabple prefetch
I haz a vistaPC
the same way you do 7
how.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms940847(v=winembedded.5).aspx
I never bothered with the prefix

that should be all you need to know
:p

12!Pokemon
Well
I don't need to worry about that with Vista as... it is on 24/7
Had 2 weeks uptime
i see
WB DRF
03thanks x.x
hi drf
02wb DRF
i think this might work
..Slowpoke?
:P
although i wish i knew how to disable file sharing
on vista
LOLWhat
:P
both options are grayed out
and network discovery is set to custom
instead of on or off
i always get notifications that there is other computers on the network
huh?
I never ge tthat in 7
I just set it to public and boom
:P
i get it in 7 as well
even when set to public
03yay, the money is actually in my account now

02hm? x3
seriusly Vista?
IE9 with 1 tab on facebook/game is taking up half a gig of RAM.
:P
07Ohai ML
/me was distracted by stuffz
03:P
03Apple products don't support them because they're too crappy to run it

/me hides as well
07and no, not the whole thing
10It heats up
07Apparen
07Yes that
03yeah I heard about that
02<HyperMetalLugia> IE9 with 1 tab on facebook/game is taking up half a gig of RAM. <- Pic or didn't happen
07This is why I don't get technology as soon as it comes out
03the Droid 4 is kinda odd
03in that it has this "webtop" thing
03that's an entirely separate OS
03and you can't get rid of it
03MSI
03they're like $1600 and have i7s, 16GB of RAM, Blu-Ray burners
03basically the highest end you can get right now :P
/me ragequits
02BUY ME A MONITOR
02AND THEN I CAN DISABLE IT
03I don't use nick alerts on my laptop and that only has one screen, u mad?
12Blu-Ray :D
03My logic, usually, is to just get the best system you can get, even if you don't plan on using all of it
03opposed to just "settling" for less
07If it's less than a decent MacBook, then that's good
03I can understand if money is an issue
07I would like mid-high range
03but if you were thinking of buyina Macbook
03those are like $1600+ anyway
03so yeah
02with 1600$
02:'D
03exactly
07*$100 off
03the *cheapest* Macbook is like $1000, right? And that one's relatively crap
03I wont'deny that the higher end Macbook Pros are good systems, but they're still way more expensive than they need to be :P
03and in fact
03it works fine, minus the Wi-Fi
07Wow
03I've seen $2000 Asuses
:P
07hmm
i have an asus
ASUS, pretty good, but yeah stupidly expensive.
my mobo is an asus as well
XD
03it's just the best thing I've found
03yeah
3Mainboard Vendor: ASUSTeK Computer INC.
03since they make motherboards *and* laptops
03who just use other brands' boarsd
03well
3Mainboard Vendor: ASRock
12Stupid Norton
03ASRock is basically ASUS
12not letting my install QuickTime.
03it's their uh
12me*
12:/
subdevision?
XD
03because this motherboard
;p
03it has 12 SATA ports, and there's like 4 separate SATA controllers
experimental
03yeah
03the problem is sometimes there are random issues :P
03Gigabyte is really good, never heard complaints about them
03EVGA.. supposedly good but as ripoff as Apple
03Intel... it works, but again stupidly overpriced and under-powered
12Intel is pretty good
03their CPUs are, yeah
03but their motherboards are relatively lame
03they don't do anything cutting edge
12well yeah, not as good as their CPUs
03just cramming as many ports and connectors on there as humanly possible
12XD
03hence why I have ASRock as it, for some reason, had more SATA's than Asus itself or Gigabyte
03anyway, brb

/me hides
03that it starts lagging even on a dual-core

It's a tablet and a phone
nononon
03I removed most of the bloatware and it still has like 50 processes that start automatically
07Tbh, I'm considering getting an Android that'll last me though Italy
you can't disable them>
?
03you can
03using Autostarts.
but...
03it's the equivalent of using msconfig
03the difference is
03there are more events than just startup
03there's like, text received, screen off, screen on etc
03so I have a bun ch of random crap that tries to run itself when I turn the screen on or off
03I disabled all that
03:P
03it makes the phone run a lot faster

03and ow, I just blinded myself with the LED LOL
03this app works, but it's weird, there's like a 1 second delay before the light actually turns on
03not sure if that's hardware or software
/me shrugs
Might be hardware

Movie looks intresting
First thing that came to mind was Battle Royale tbh
:3
12I have no idea why TL fans like it though. It's nothing like TW o.o
10Xan, it's compared to Battle Royale often
Sky, I am not supprised
10TL? TW?
12and I don't mean that in a good or bad way
1212Twlight
TW being twilight
but whats TL?
12just T, but w/e
twilight as well?
:/
04I dunno why Twilight fans like THG
12^
04they're entirely different
10The whole 'love' aspect
Eeehh
04For one, there's actual emotion
10Gale and Katniss, Peeta and Katniss
/me runs
From the trailor it doesnt look very scifi
04Gale and Katniss, I never liked that one
apart from its in the future
;/
*set in the
04I prefer Peeta and Katniss. Because Peeta's cool
04Xanbreon, it's post-apocalyptic
10I dunno if I like either pairing
04almost
Suppose
04the plot matters more than the pairings
04as opposed to Twilight
10Twilight's also a couple years old
10Those rabid fangirls have to go somewhere
(scifi: star trek scifiction: star wars)
12lmao
For the kind of distinction
04XD nice one Sky
/me sends them Drakes way
10Not even sure how THG came to be that way
10Domino effect
Might be good, doesnt look earthshattering
10Tons of people at my school haven't read the books, but they go to see the movie
10Just to fit in
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc
:D :D :D
04THG isn't earth shattering
I cant wait for that
04it's a good book that I don't want spoiled by Twilight fans
12the only reason I want to see the movie is the book
10My little sister is a prime example
12if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't care about seeing the movie
This trailer makes me squeee
=3
10She said she didn't like the story
10and then all the sudden, once there's a movie
10"I'm gonna go see this with my friends and read the other two books!"
12LOL
Damn dirty kids and there weirdness
10Like, "No! I never said that!"
04"Space Nazis from the Moon"

04ikr
12she could say it was a IRL typo

03well
03software
03I apparently deleted one too many APKs
Good jorb
03so now it crashes on boot
well done!
03luckily, since I knew deleting APKs was problematic
http://puu.sh/5cZI
03as in
03I rooted + recovery, then backed it up
03so I'll restore that
03and uh
03all the system crap that I didn't want
:/
03the motorola crap
03to "uninstall"
03well
12I'll show you cute: http://www.android.com/media/android_vector.jpg
/me RUNS
drf, probs, dunno
03since if I do that, and I disable them from running on boot, that's basically just as good?
03and that way they're sitll there if programs require them
well that was a bigger reaction than I thought .-.
then remove if everything works fine
03is there *any* benefit to doing a full (as in powre off, power on) reboot opposed to a hot boot?
03LOL, or remove the built-in maps and then download it from the market? :P
03well
Others on OS boot
03what would hotboot not w...oh
03well
03I usually reboot if I'm deleting apps and have problemks
03-k
03would it be more beneficial to do a full reboot?
03or sometimes if my service dies, I have to reboot, hot boot usually *doesn't* work for that
03though it's odd
03Verizon was advertising that their 4G lets you do voice+data at the same time
Or eh
03but yet
03I called someone earlier and the little 4G icon disappeared
03well apparently Motorolas need full reboot
Kernel or bootloader then
03I noticed there were some times when a hot reboot didn't fix my problems but a full reboot did
03and I was curious if I was just seeing things
03but OK
03I'll just add a "long reboot" button
03to the widget
03(Power Control plus_)
03see
03I can use Poewr Control Plus to replace the regular one
03but the brightness one borks
03regular power control does like 1/2/3/auto-brightness
03PC Plus only does 1/2/3/4
03and I want auto-brightness >_>
03wait WTF?
03Windows Vista Business is only available to volume-license TechNet subscribers?
03I can get ultimate/enterprise but not business?
03That's a**backwards
03since apparently with my technet, I only get one key for enterprise since it'
03s "volume license"
I guess I picked a decent platform then for mobile devices
03does that mean I can use that same key a bunch of times?
plenty of emulators
and no circumventing firmware blocks
03how would I find out how many o.o
No clue drf, see if they have a FAQ
or email them
0324/7 supposedly
03I can go ask them right now XD
Do that
03oh cool, they have the acutal XP SP1a installer (240MB) on here
03all the yhave on the public site is some stupid 2MB web-based installre that doesn't work anymore
03shame that stupid Java thing happened
03of course there's someone ahead of me XD
ohaydere
How do magnets work?
Mhhm?
03can be activated 10 times
03so that's 30 activations LOL
03and they said the enterprise ones do 500(!) activations
03that's fricking amazing
At the same time? Or before you need todo phone activation?
03at the same time.
Nice
03Privacy Statement
03You are now chatting with 'Sam'.
03Sam: Yes, correct.
03Danny Forche: Thanks
You can get keys with upto 1000+ activations
03well sure
03but I only paid $300
:P
awesome
03I should just give Win7 enterprise to all ym friends
03with that one key
03I don't even know 500 people :P
03is get one Pro key
03and give that to like 10 people
03XD
home premium keys?
:p
03LOL
03inb4 I give everybody Wijn7 Starter
03*Win
:D
03I thought Enterprise was more like Professional
03which is still fine for most people
Are there any time upgrade keys?
You can put a normal key into anytime upgrade
:<
you can, but you lose WMC ad possibly games
(if you care aboiut those
Not to sure about how it works with vista tbh
> Never use media centre and games
:o
03you can use them as anytime upgrade
03why, need one?
:<
03hm
03so you have Vista Home Premium right now?
Yes
03and if you just install it wtihout a serial
03then I give you a serial for professional and it should take it as an upgrade key
Well, I'm not worried about pro really
03so you're fine with 7HP?
Just getting Laggyvista to be okay :P
Yeah
03well sure
03I can get you a key for that
03since I don't want it :P
Oh wait, I have a DVD-RW
LOL
Uh well
