IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FALTERING TO ME.
where was i?
cause his kids have not changed at all
Explain that shit to me, because I just invested two and a half hours of my life in this film and I want some goddamn answers
11OKAY, EXPLINATION
11And I muted the channel so it won't vanish in a second
4<Ghosties>: Explain that shit to me, because I just invested two and a half hours of my life in this film and I want some goddamn answers
9Canonically, it actually fell. So yeah.
11The adventure itself wasn't a dream, as the top fell durring the other parts of the movie.
11Just the ending is a dream.
9OBJECTION!
4...what?
13 42
11what, DCD?
9The ending wasn't a dream, and such was stated in an interview with Alfred's actor.
11That's the actor, not the ending product or the director.
9Canonically, the totem fell
4I don't know if I can sit through this movie again
9but they decided to cut it before it did
8>implying the ending isnt open to interpretation
0Really, there's no real point to arguing the ending. It was meant to be ambiguous
Silverscreen OR IS IT!? We may never know...
the ending simply means he finally acheived his dream, he must be dreaming
9because it was more fun to do so
I disagree on that. The movie doesn't show the top falling, but it leaves the possibility that it might.
MiMichael Caine is the actor.
yeah
YOU'RE KILLING US MODS
I'm leaving guys! G'night! ^_^
HEY!
The top still spinning is simple symbolism to represent that his dream finally came true.
What hipster_brony said!
CREDICEPTION
Oh God yes
I think straight can't now
hey hold on
Ghosties The top still spinning is simple symbolism to represent that his dream finally came true.
Guys, guys, seriously.
IVE SPOKEN 8 LINES, YET NO ONE ELSE HAS SAY ANYTHING
top falls
BULLSHOT! COBB isn't that good of an architect that he could create France and Kenya and Japan and Shit.
That
Unless theres another movie
Mind
the top does begin to fall just before it cut
11The only question I have is...DID SAITO GET OUT OF THE DREAM OR NOT?!
the top isn't even the totem though, it's his wedding ring iirc
I thought the ending is deliberately left ambiguous
G'night
She picked the door with the tiger.
SO MUCH BASS
= blown
so he has not been gone that long?
Your concept of 'canon' is strange and oddly constricting
0guys, i know that you dislike youtube links, but it's important you hear this
Obviously.
is this the real life, is it just fantasy
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM
I LOVE IT
RanYakumo genius!
Both versions of the Debate are canon
SO WHATS NEXT?
Guys, I have a very controversial intepretation:
It's a TRAP!
Did I miss the Tomatoes?
They had it story borded where the totem fell
bluh
i say it fell
silverscreen, yes he did
I liked it
silverscreen - u decie
0it's awesome
TRUELY A MINDFUCK
Oh i get it
The top was faltering, wasn't it?
wf_chronicles no vid links
0silverscreen yes he did, we see him out of it in the end
Tech
4Fuck this shit, I'm about ready to just go to sleep
GOODDAMMIT MY INTERNET CUT OUT RIGHT BEFORE THE END
He had to, or else Cobb would've been arrested.
Tech Dude :o
4THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID SLEEP
It was tilting
yay credits.
in a dream, my totem will be a gyrobowl
once the top were to start wobbling it would eventually fall down
lol @ghosties rage
Brony Movie Night is in a dream I am in
look in cobb's dreams he's still married to his wife, so he's always wearing the ring
Open interpretation. That is all
0unless it was all a dream, then who knows
Saito must have gotten out, because he was awake on the plane just before the ending scene.
Sleep?
WAT!
11RANDOM RUNTIME TRIVIACEPTION: The running time of 2 hours 28 min is a reference to the original length of Édith Piaf's song "Non, je ne regrette rien", which lasts (on its first recorded edition) 2 minutes 28 seconds.
0so guys. what did you thing
What is that?
Me too ghosties
MY BRAINZ ARE HURTING.
i give up
None of you exist
You're already asleep ghosties.
But Ghosties - You're already asleep!
why no one like ambiguous ending and insist one version canon?
Permission to post a link?
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
7I should sleep..
0WHat did you think*
Guys I have an idea, WHAT IF, THE BEGINNING WAS A FLASH FORWARD AND NOT A FLASHBACK? THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE SINCE THE ENDING IS A DREAD RIGHT?
So what's next?
8brb
If Saito didn't wake up, Cobb couldn't get into the States.
The ending is up for speculation. It's part of the beauty of the movie.
7it's 5:30!
GUISE WE NEED TO WHISPER SO THE MODS EARS DONT GET HURT
fdssfdgasdfgdfgsdfgsdfgdfghgf
4:30 AM here. 4:30 am....
lulz
4That's what the movie sure made it seem like
Ohai TechDude
gahh!!! MY MIND.
So what vid is next?
4And unspoken rule
LETS KEEP THE PEACE AND EVEYONE JUST BELEVE WHAT THEY WANT
I figured the end WAS ambiguous, and the top was faltering, but wasn't shown falling. "Was or was it not a dream?"
THIS IS JUST LIKE THE END OF BLADE RUNNER WHERE THEY DON'T *EXPLICITLY* STATE WHETHER OR NOT DECKARD WAS A REPLICANT. IT"S SUPPOSED TO BE AMBIGUOUS> CAPS LOCCK FOR ATTENTION.
Oh crap
I'm giving in to sleep
But Sathi, you're already asleep!DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN! think, how did you get HERE?
o hai
Not a dream, watch the movie next time.
What's next?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM
time for tomatos
7oh right!
/me can't keep up with chat aymore
I swear that that top is faltering before the credit cut! Doesn't anybody agree with me?
CAPS ARE CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
My brain is full of fuck
Daxtno, no video links
I BELIEVE THAT YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE.
Bah! Spoiler!
TEARS LOST IN THE RAIN
Daxton, no vid links
SPOILER: The next movie contains no pickles
9Also Nolan's interpretation of his own ending is "it's reality, BUT COBB DOESN'T CARE", so yeah.
11DAXTON: NO VIDEO LINKS
Seriously, movie itself debunks it.
holy hell daxto that amazing
DSNesmith1 You need to go deeper. The chat will slow down for you.
Daxton mind blown
Wait
@Daxton Thanks.
Now, time for Killer Tomatoes!
NO PICKLES?

Oh snapplejacks, I DIDN'T miss the Tomatoes! Cool.
next you'll insist you know what happens after the last panel in WATCHMEN!
So Ponies aren't real?
Wait

No sleep
Whats this lottery thing i keep hearing about?
SHOW US WHAT YOU'RE TYPING SO WE CAN REPLY TO IT
I'mma read it.
9basically it's like making a fic called Final Fantasy XX, having it do with ponies, and have it labeled a crossover
ATTAAAAAAAAAAAACK OF THE KILLER TOMAAAAAAATOOOOOOOOS
11LOTTERY IS TOMORROW DURING INTERMISSION. THE ORDER OF THE PLAYLIST WILL BE AS SHOWN ON THE BRONY STATE HOME PAGE.
So how awesome was that movie?
Jon, it's for being baked into cupcakes.
Is the stream just gonna be this for the next 8 hours?
Awesome or SUPER AWESOME?
yup
Jon, it's a lottery to pick next week's movies
IF YOU WIN THE LOTTERY YOU WILL WIN DEATH BY, SOMTHING FUCK YOU
Tacowiz Pretty awesome
Someone make a Attack of the Killer tomatos Pony crossover
NOW
pizza.
We need either to watch Gurren Lagann, Doctor Who, Gokaiger or see gameplay of Super Robot War Z2 (on PSP)
It's only crossover if characters from both universes appear.
Moral of the story kids: Ponies are tasty. Being made of candy.
GURRENNN LAGGGGAANNNN!!!!

Goodnight everpony
Ciao o;
512489
YOU WILL NEVER BREAK MY CODE!!
I BROKE IT, U MAD?
I will figure it out Mr Orange....EVENTUALLY!
who wants to see Gurren Lagann?
what is it then?
*raises hand*
GURREN LAGANNN
Your code? IT IS DELICIOUS WITH JELLY.
But I have already seen it.
Naw it ain't.
528491
Lol, still stuck on inception?
I figure it our and it says..."Did you know that Rarity is the best Pony?".......dang I disagree with that secret code.
Code? I only like codes that have jelly.
Rarity?
Someone needs to spell better.
Nope, they spelled it just fine.
I have a feeling that I made a mistake with my spelling.....AGAIN!
It should be "Did you know that Fluttershy is the best Pony?"Then it would be right.
Hmm, if nopony says anything, then everypony will LEAVE HAHAHA. I WILL BE VICTORIOUS!!!
yeah but it wasn't my code, it was Mr Oranges code
42 seems like a good amount to me.
42? That proves it, its the answer to the universe!
We've dropped 2
and 2 more

ARE YOU HERE

You guys are too cool to completely abandon

Best movie night ever
wait...I am cool....I must be doing something wrong
so yeah synctube people are disterbing.
I'm scared of them...
So how are things in the world of bronies.
Only Filly2
Loving and tolerating I hope
we need someone to stream Gurren Lagann somewhere.
maybe I could make a livestream room to put the episodes up...
Mojo did a Gurren Lagann night a month or so ago.
All the eps are on youtube.
(I know about the youtube eps)
So that was fun/
Oops I mean Apple_Bloom sorry that I spell your name wrong
Wow, someone did A Series of Unfortunate Events parody with the CMCs.
Why didn't I think of this?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MTLtt7pWKc
I was able to read cupcakes..
Without puking
..
Were you able to read bittersweet
Yes.
I couldnt handle it
without tearing up?
And I read the gory alt ending
Yes
Bye Bye guys love and what shit to ya
Bittersweet? What is it about?
I read the one where they kill rarity
...we aren't on the same bittersweet i think
I read the one were pinkie goes into a coma and dies.
No...
I should read it
I read Cupcakes and Bittersweet. They weren't great, but they weren't bad either.
due to diabetes
Challenge accepted
Ok
Link me it
ummm give me a sec
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/story-bittersweet.html
Hi,I'm back,I went and watched Wild wild west.
Challenge accepted
I am surprised that the mods aren't getting angry at us when we are talking about cupcakes
Premise does sound sad...
I am happy
Ok I will go read it. If you dont hear from me again, tell my wife hello.
It will satisfy my needs...
Lol
Futurama
^_^
Ok I am reading Bittersweet now......at this very moment.......AT THIS VERY INSTANT!
Watch scrubs?
Part one takes a bit from MY screw up.
I have no strong feelings one way or the other
I read it all...so...I'll provide support.
A little
Guy love
Oh Sumica, I hope your feelings for certain characters in FiM are not tarnished by this.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwgAflY9tg
I might go and try to finish reading the Pony world of warcraft fic or the one where they go and relive the memories of their ancestors.I forget their names.
Good luck.
Mods are asleep
Post ponies
I have been to 4chan, little phases me any more.
I have been to the depths of /b/ and back
Watching that video you posted.An ad for nude furniture fitting came up
................POOR PINKIE :(
Reading
Yeah, and that's my favorite Scrubs episode, so that pissed me right off.
I'm readin' a fic, pig, I'm readin' a fic. Don't you ever interupt me while I'm readin' a fic.
oh look i dont have to read it, people have done readings of it.
awww no after show?
this is the aftershow.
SONIC RAINBOOM ON SYNCHTUBE
quite dead
It sure is dead here, at least that explains the skeleton to my right
Not really
Just watching Gurren Lagann, alone.
...What dead hookers?
so that's what it was all about? I must say I am disapoint.
alone you say: http://troll.me/images/forever-alone-20/forever-alone.jpg
...How do we have a few more people now?
what up yo
Hi
idleing boredom.
well....since no one has nothing on their mind's I might a well say goodbye, see you Bronies tomorrow.
See you all tomorrow
>mfw I discussed Gurren Lagann for the last 4 hours with someone else and now I see a forever alone pic
And chat is now slowly draining.
Or has been.
verry slowly.
R34 chat
si
hey Dari, you still here?
Dari has been gone a long time now I think
darniy
*darnit
time to go ptfo. Catch you all later.
bye
hey sotha
hey
Dermathil
What's going on?
nothing really
Why is there nothing on?
No streamer is currently around?
Ah
slow chat right now
So, I missed it? 4 hours late
Yeah.
It was slow starting up do to technical difficulties, so even though I was a half hour late, I managed to catch both pony episodes, which were played first, as well as almost all of Inception.
Unfortunately, I missed everything after that (i.e. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes)
I do not know if there was any sort of an aftershow, but if appears not.
There wasn't.
That makes sotha sad.
But she does have like 50 billion posts to catch up on in EqD, so it isn't all bad.
There was not, as DCD was tired
There should be one for Saturday's showing
Hum. . . I hope I'll be able to make Saturday's showing. I would like to see the Tomato movie after all. How did y'all like it?
sotha: glorious, glorious cheese
It's a 1978 parody of B "giant menace" movies
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was full of lulz.
cool
Say, I think I'm out for the night. I was enjoyable conversing with you all. And watching movies....So good night (or good morning).
anybody left?
Me, but I'm just about to go.
aww
I'll be back tomorrow.

Anyway, I go!

12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
everybrony asleep?
Nah, I just got back.
HEY!
I actually wanted to talk to a mod about just a little something
Yes?
NewDCD linked to a website testing upload speed and specified minimum speed for streaming - my upload speed is plenty
I just wanted to make this known, so as to not send a second email
Aside from that, were you here for the movie night?
Nope.
I was at a party.
Ah, well how was the party?
It was good.
That's nice~ anything particular happen though?
...Not really sure what question you're asking there. ;)
Did anyone do anything sillee?
what was the party? brithday party? Just generally asking about the party really
Seeing as nooneelse is here, may aswell ask about that :P
It was just a party. :P
A party party.
A PARTEY
Well ok then
uh, so, um, any plans for today? and did you sleep tonight or stay up
Today I'll probably leave for Wales to go climb Snowdon.
:O
yay!
Stay overnight and climb it on Sunday.
Woohoo!
that's gonna be so awesum
Eeyup, should be fun.
Oh, I showed Dermathil one episode of Gurren Lagann - he proceeded to mute the stream and watch about 10 episodes instead :D
Hahaha.
I just looked in the mirror and I have bloodshot eyes
Guess that happens when going to bed at 8am and waking up at 11am for about a week straight :D
Bloodshot eyes - symptom of watching the BMN stream in the EU.
:D
Don't know if I can come to today's : /
Are you gonna be travelling to wales aniway?
during the stream?
Probably.
Ah well
Hey, the EQD bot didn't work yesterday
12BLAAAH
o-o?
12it's still really hard to tell them apart
sec
and sofa so good was posted about 30 minutes ago for me : /
12I really want to use the HGSS ones, they're awesome
yeah it is
MLP, bigger news than terrorism.
Well, use them then :p
Winning. :>
12Yeh but isn't Shiny one of the biggest Ho-oh theme fans >v>
Derpy Ho-Oh/Ho-Oh54 and Shiny are I think
12Why the hell does NO ONE have animated BW sprites?
no idea
Yeah, because I DCed.
what do the BW sprites look like?
I'll look for some
So I had to restart the timer.
12http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/0/0a/Spr_5b_250.png
I'll have it set up automatically some time.
12:/
12Now I remember why I didn't use BW sprites....
12http://imgboot.com/images/aragornbird/250.gif
http://pldh.net/dex/sprites/hooh
oh
12yeh, it's horrible
ew
Oh i see, well if you already knew that's alright then
I have the PMD sprite somewhere
12I absolutely HATE Lugia's animation in BW >v>
12Cool ovo
12Might be too small though
Also, this is like, the best Ho-oh sprite ever
it's small so don't use it :p
http://i26.tinypic.com/3026y34.jpg
12Cute XD
I'm just like <3!
and PMD sprite is about the size of the RSE ones I think
let me find it first xD
12k
it's 55 x 59 I think, dunno where the hell it is
12Small
yeah
12Do you not like the HGSS ones either?
I don't hate them but I don't like them the most either
12Bleh
better than the GSC ones
12I absolutely can't stand the diamond ones XD
12Hmm
it's your choice
12Anyone else got a say in this?
/me slaps Drake
/me is slapped
04What?
04Whatever you do, don't use B/W sprites.
04They're horrible.
04At least for Ho-Oh
04And unless you're going to make a Deino/Zweilous/Hydreigon theme anytime soon, I'd recommend against using any animation from past generations that doesn't use a completely new sprite.
12Lol
12You haven't said what you actually want >v>
06i found my games on the drive! games from 5 year old!
12Ffs Angry Birds wont play on my phone >v>
06android or apple?
12Can't wait for my Galaxy S2 to arrive..
12I use Android ONLY
04Honeslty Arti, I don't mind which one you use as long as it's not the B/W ones.
04Honestly*
12So you like the HGSS ones?
12and lol trust me I hate the BW ones too >v>
06i see, weird that it doesnt play it on android .-.
12it's the phone, it's two years old
06whats kind of phone?
12It's a HTC Magic
06HTC? hm... HTC with android is hell better as with Windows Mobile xD
12lol yeh but it's two years old now
12It ran fine on the old version of Anroid but after it updated itself, it became the slowest phone in the world, can';t handle new OS
12Sucks
12It;s been like this for like a year now :(
12and no one seems to know a way to downgrade!
06ew...
An Articuno
Drake why did I realise that PMD2 also somewhat focuses on criminals and outlaws?
I suck
Articuno: iPhone 3G users share your pain
04XD
/me hugs NS
/me hugs back
Except that we can sorta downgrade
04That's exactly like you
XD
hey, you know I have random stuff to say
I don't though
on the topic of criminals and outlaws
04Of course.
XD
04Ignoring your many stories about laws and criminals...and black/grey morality.
04Sheesh, it's all you dpo
04do*
06PMD 2 is my all time favourite PKMN game
06it's awesome :3
rofl
12Ok done with sprites, they look SO much better now
nice :p
Shiny's probably going to come complaining though
Just warning you :p
12Tell him to animate the diamond/pearl ones properly then :>
04XD
12or find someone who can
06WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, if this is the OLD harddisk i'm usin...and everything is still on it...
06crap
04They should make a Ho-Oh sprite similar to the Gold version one, instead of re-using the 'spread wings' pose every single generation.
06so are the virusses!
04ohshi
/me goes to scan >.<;
12I know it's SO annoying.....
It's not the spread wings thing
it's the legs
12They change every other sprite EXCEPT Ho-ohs
04Ok
12lol the legs were only weird in HGSS ovo
bloody hell, the HGSS one looks like it's doing the splits
12and even then they're not that bad
04this is gonna be a reeeeeeally crude joke but...
Why don't you have a poll or something about the sprites?
which is why I don't like them
and why Shiny hates them
12My canary does that all the time with his legs XD
04Ho-Oh: "Hey guys, can you smell fish?"
/me FLEES
06LMAO
12Why did you have to make that joke? :/
and yes, they don't change Ho-Oh's sprite
and lol
04I just spent three days in a row with no one but other male adolescents.
/me has a thought
04Don't judge me.
I wonder if I can put a theme switcher on my profile...?
12LOL that would be cool
12Though
12The profiles don't do javascript (just remembered)
Oh that's just me
Ignore that
04It'd be pretty cool if they did.
Hey.
06what script do they do then?
(we know each other from another chat)
12Only CSS and formatting stuff
You got any pony toys yet?
I swear it does do JS
12lol it'd be a major security risk
06ouch
12I remember someomne saying they tried it and it didn;t
12But try
iirc I was able to link to my snowflakes script
it only accepts some js
not all
it's like what it does with HML
Other than the McDonald's ones, no
won't accept <link> though, which is what the theme switcher does
12Oh right XD
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Toys.jpg
12Ok
McDonald's toys STILL haven't come here.
...uses
06OHSHI-
04?
12Also
.
06virus scanner went ape just now
04Uh oh
06scanning the older drive i just installed
Where's "here?"
12I tried to get Lugia to help me yesterday but he had to stay behind at work for hours and then only had like an hour to talk >v>
UK
England
The other G4 toys have starteds coming in here in Singapore as well
12The latest visitors are REALLY annoying me....
Nothing here in Ireland, either.
I was checking out the Toy'r'us stores here
No blind bag ponies yet
At the moment it's just Twilight sitting on my desk.
ARGH GET OUT OF MY HEAD
._.
yeah it looks ):
Whyyyy Octavia!?
12and I neeeeeeeeeed food
12I will brb
lmfao okay
04'Kay
04If I may say so, the text on the drop-down menus on your profile is too dark - it's hard to distinguish them from the background.
04*on the Ho-Oh theme
Soon, I hope we get the series, the Canterlot collection, moar ponies, the plushes, the tote bags, the magazines, the books, and the WeLoveFine t-shirts
damn
Also our own pony bus
/me hides
it molested the link rel and javascript
hey RBD
They changed the time slot of MLP here to 7am apparently.
>_>
<_<
sup dermathil :3
04Nice word choice there.
/me sadface
Eek
it's accurate :p
Ohai RainBro.
Hey Dermathil
04True
06great...alotta trojan downloads
I don't even have Boomerang....
06and keyloggers
._.
06oh, and atleast 5 worms!
04:/
so dari what did you get up to last night in the end buddy?
06gonna do it
or liveboot into linux, kill the viruses
04So NS, when's the next TST meeting thingamajig?
06the defrg
06then clean up a bit
read topic
"Next meeting is at 10:30pm GMT 8/8/2011."
which is 8:30am for us
The party turned out to be good, even though most of the people there were younger than me.
creeper ;)
i kid, i kid
I know right. :P
XD
/me smiles at Shaico, "i thought it was amazing!"
04Yeah no, not gonna make it.
... Hmm it's actually pretty damn cool.
so creepy, yet so intriguing"
Well, if I moved it to 8am, would you?
1st time, freak the hell out.
last night was plagued with problems
-again-
2nd time, bop your head to the beat.
I rather like it now :D
I saw in Skype. :/
shit keeps going so fucking wrong. 2 weeks in a row >.>
I'd hate 8am
Did I fall into EAD again?
It's every week I'm not there. :P
in fact, I could do 6:30am
XD
<33
XD
/me bites mirc. work correctly!
04Wouldn't be up at 6:30, parents' would get suspicious. 8am...maybe, but I wouldn't be around very long.
How've you been doing anyway?
not bad
I've got that thing where your ears randomly clog up and you can't hear shit, but that's easily solved
/me turns the music up
7am'd be risky
definitely can't do 7:30am
04Neither
I might not be able to make bmn tonight
04I'll be getting ready for school at that time
Ah right.
I saw Hipster wouldn't make it either?
I probably won't too.
bleugh
yeah
If you read up in Skype, I explained everything.
and not 7:15
i did :)
also: thanks for the tip about the nick list, saved that
04Nope.
048am seems alright.
04But we'll need to check with others.
You want to test if it works?
I'm pretty sure most people will make it
I honestly don't want to do 8:30am
I tested it once, but it'd still be good to test it with someone else.
sure. where does it print it though?
as that requires me to get up early
and catch the 7:03 or 7:08 train
It just msgs you the names one at a time.
!nicks
So you can paste them somewhere then ctrl-f replace the extra stuff at the start.
also hivemind
XD
yeah it worked fine
04...wouldn't 8am make that worse?
Good.
06loool, i have 2 drives inserted into the PC, and one is FULL OF SH*T AND STUFF
06ans i still only use 2 of the 8 CPU's
/me dances triumph
er, I meant for the 8am meeting
7:03 or 7:08
Hai gaise
Hellew
for 8:30 I'd catch the 7:33 at latest
lol hai man
Hai

Skynet?

Sure, first I have to finish downloading all the Doctor Who epsiodes (50% at the moment), then I promised Sathi I'd get House.

But I'll get round to Gurren Lagann after that.
DEAR GOD NO
0610-4: military code for "affermative! or Understood!"

Hey there Dermathil! and YAY
i can believe that there's still people here
where did you get up to?
mib, we are always there.

ever watching.
Dman, dunno if I'm being a giant retard, but you did apply for mod ages ago didn't you? When they were only looking for one EU mod?
alright
well hell, let me refresh and put my real username on
Rainbrodash, this is true. I have applied again, though, on August 3rd
yeah I mean aside from the most recent app. It's cool, circumstances have changed :)
just wanted to make sure
I'd like to add that I took NewDCD's test (using a website he linked) and found that I have enough upload speed to livestream should anything happen
thanks bro
there
RainBrODash ok then
Dman, PM.
thanks again for making me watch gurren lagann btw Dman.
04Ohey look I posted a topic in Pokemon Talk. This is new.
dman what's your upload speed btw?
Dermathil, sure thing bro!
Rainbrodash it was 8 something something
and NewDCD said minimum 5.6 or something
bahaha oh i thought you meant 8meg, i guess 0.8?
yea 0.8 then
.82something or somethignlike that
well I've always been tempted to stream
yeah
like, either with manycam/xsplit or even webcam
but the situation's never really arisen
During the week, rainbrodash, during the week ;)
You could stream yourself singing for me.
:<
DOO EET
XD
I'd stream my guitar playing for you dari~
It can has beez zelda medley tiemz?

ASF - what?
dman it needs a shitload of work
RainBroDash - y u no livestream u practicing / learning it?
I need to try and link about links between songs that don't fit :P

Standtill much chat?
plus there are two parts of the gerudo valley theme which I had down, but can't do all of a sudden
aslkdjfgasgfa
RainBroDash - are you one of half the fanbase who names Link your name, or one of the other half of zelda fans who always, without fail, names your hero 'Link' ?
I call it link
:P
I love you
btw Dman: I do both
1st game is link, 2nd is me
Dermathil that's cool too =]

/me is shocked. active chat in the morning?
Thank god
me posting anything out of fanfiction/helpsuggestions/announcements is unusual
04XD
heyo GGgala
hey Dermathil, everybody
xD
Sup, of course, Gggala
I'm here too but I'm up to shenanigens
and then, of course, there's naming the hero ZELDA
or THIEF
Hey Sprinkles.
6Hey.
My B is broken
Sprinklesception
also hi
So dari... what's with the Magnet bot?
What about it?
Your B?
It's been here for a while.
...what's it for?
My type letter
I've seen it do like, two things.
I'm around, providing Chatzilla doesn't fail on me. I'm doing other things every so often though
I dunno, just for fun, I remove it when the actual streams are on.
The other mods seem to enjoy it.
Hi there
As well as users.
I find some things kinda funny.
When this chat comes ack on call me
back*
Will you be streaming today, then, sirsprinkles?
6Yes.
Bene.
It is REALLY spammy, which is why I remove it for streams.
I can see how that would work.
Any way to disable most of its functions and leave on a few things?
admin states all around!
heyo SirSprinkles
Well I was thinking of having a system to limit use of the scripts to once every 30 seconds or something.
Mostly just want the EqDaily notifications left on. It's a handy feature.
lars
go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LN5GrF-Gb0&NR=1
That's still a lot.
Wait wat
Meh, not compared to most users, if you wouldn't like that, I can try and do what you said, just leave EQD notifications on.
This is the most boring time yet
Oh wait.
We need some Pinkie Pie
EQD notifications aren't on my bot anyway.
I have them on here.
So it doesn't matter.
...lawl.
I'll just remove the bot as I normally do.
Well okay then.
If I ever forget to mods can just kick it anyway.
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/SUP.jpg
GGgala, and THEN there's naming the hero 'Fuck me'
'Oh, fuck me! I didn't see you there!' (entering icecaverns:) 'FUCK ME it's cold in here.' 'Fuck me, you can't defeat me!'
oh awesome
PJIRC 2.0 is wicked
supports /whois now
that's great
lawl Dman
12I loved Pjirc :( I can't believe everyone here made me replace it with Mibbit

Hai Fireant
i always named Amarant in FFIX DUMBASS, so he could introduce himself, "Some call me the Flaming DUMBASS"
hahaha
i wasn't the most creative person
My work here is done.
04Welcome back Arti

Yeah, I understand xD

Did you play on the jungle gym?
What happened
when i type rainbow dash in ponibooru?
INB4 Sex on the beach
I missed that old jungle gym, before it got replaced by the 'kid friendly' version.
A towering construction of hard metal pipes. Much fun was had climbing it and chasing other kids on it.
Welp, I'm off to play some BlazBrony
calling the replacement 'kid friendly' is like calling tiny halloween candy 'fun size'
so much creepy fluttershy stuff on ponibooru :|

Hey Silverscreen.
I would offer one but you obviously know what it's going to be ;)
Ohai silverscreen
11Hi, Dari
I have several opinions on that that I will not express in order to not offend anyone...but that's not saying they're all negative, though
11Hi, Dman

Eh espylacopa, eh
Party balloons, obviously

Unless you mean in mibbit.
But mibbit always has ads.

Not my defibrillator!
11It's not because of Ramsay, it's because of the dumbasses running the place.
agggh it's even worse than before
Oh Balloons I saw what you did there
:)
/me sneaks under to the pipe bomb, and disarms it with a few magical snips
/me walks back up with a charred face and hair blown backward
D-done...
Hmmm.... I think I'll do my re-read of Past Sins
/me falls down dazedly
Since the revisions were pretty expansive
/me says Incendo at the pipe bomb
I thought you were supposed to contain the explosive before detonating it.

Oh wait.
SirSprinkles?
/me leans against a wall, watching Octavia get to work before looking around
/me sits on the ground after the massive explosion
/me has no choice but to lay on the floor on his back, still charred from the blast and looking around dazedly
/me heads starts to bleed a little
Damn it

WHAT'S GOING ON THIS CHAT
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SHIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Sectumsempra popcorn!
Wonder if it worked
/me looks down at Beatline, taking her handkerchief and dipping it in her glass of water, then offers it to the charred pony, "youve got a little something... here" pointing nondescriptly at her face
/me popcorn is splitted in galf
/me flicks his tail noticing Beatline injured and frowns. Walks over to Beat and armours up, running a scan. "More than something, Octavia"
/me smiles at Ghrathryn, "you seem to have more experience, by all means"
Killing time until stream
Hmph
Hey Dave_BroZilla.
GIGA DRILL BREAK
Tru dat
YOURS IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
yeah
/me chuckles. "I noticed." He takes the handkerchief and dabs a majority of the char from his face, handing the blackened cloth back to her by a clean tip as he rolls himself back onto his legs.
So, the percocets finally wore off from my wisdom teeth removal last friday
I convinced Dari to stream Gurren Lagann after House
ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCK
Occupational hazard, Octavia. *Frowns behind his helmet as the scan reveals Beatline's injuries* Doesn't look too bad though. Mostly singed fur by the look of it
>achievement: ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA
when is House streaming?
dunno
After Doctor Who I think
sorry dermahil i'm semiafk
i'm preparing to leave
Wait, was this my Pipe bomb that caused this?
/me giggles softly trying not to offend and tucks it into her saddlebag
I'm so excited for tomorrow. Means new epi of Gokaiger
yeah
Maybe an endoscopist and an orthopedics should do
Huh
/me looks resolutely at tge colt looking over him. "Excuse me, sir, but I'll have you know that I am a doctor. I think I can judge well enough when I am injured."
Meet...THE ORTHOPEDICS AND THE ENDOSCOPIST SPECIALIST
Did the RP channels get shut down or something?
So, lottery is today...what's everyone's choices?
/me dismisses his armour back to wherever

i can talk about my php fiasco going on
Go ahead and discuss something if you wish
but thats not very pony.
Oh, and The Game (the 1997 movie) as B-Movie
And doesn't have a dragon with a modularised version of a guyver unit in it
FUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Actually, haven't given it much thought.
Bridle Gossip as pony ep
But nopony really feels like talking when we DON'T do this.
I lost
GURREN LAGANN EP 20 HERE I COME
Ah
Just esepcially on the AfterDark chan I've been seeing it a lot past couple ddays
PHP problems, Octavia?
Normally I'd be trolling the heck out role players in here but nobody else seems to be doing anything so I'm leaving them alone.
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qfck99QqEE
The Great Mouse Detective as either A or B, but if it's definitively B category, Jurassic Park as A movie
Ghrathryn, its not problems as much as just tying it all together
And The Griffon The Brush Off for pony ep
/me brohoofs Dave_BroZilla for Great Mouse Detective
*shrug*
That's always... interesting with coding
FLIGHT OF THE VALKYRIES
/me recieves and distributes brohoof in kind
If I'd seen it, yes.
I'm fine with cutting the RP when we start discussing something.
This movie is about the horrors of the Vietnam War.
Well Beatline
/me doesn't actually watch a whole lot of movies.
The Heart of Darkness.
(That's what I've heard about it)
And the rain that Firefox's weather addon has been promising finally arrived
Dermathil: I know what it's about, I just don't watch movies.
(never seen it either)
The RP is usually a good catalyst to get ponies in here so we can discuss somethinh.
*thing
You were lucky to not have standardpenetrating and blunt trauma.
WUH
You don't watch the movies/
better than nothing.
Q_Q

besides, im in the topic. so, rock on, bronies.
"Exactly" was at 'Better than nothing', I believe I am fairly lucky not to be injured. xP
/me airguitars. yeaaaaah.
I think cowboys and aliens is good.
Cowboys and Aliens, I've heard, is in the so bad it's good realm
Of course that's from a guy who usually sends his main original characters against daemons, and not the nice ones
yay~
yeah
ARC GURREN
Hm
I feel left out :|
Hmm. Need to practice, I'll be AFK-ish for a bit
Well seeing that if your pretty close to the bomb id say you won't have any injuries
I was going to watch it with friends on thursday, but the girls in the group chickened out and wanted to see Crazy Stupid Love, so we all decided to see Horrible Bosses in the end
very funny
But there will be TM rupture and middle ear damage
So be sure to get medical attention if nescessarry
0H SNAP
TERMINATOR IS ON TV
I don't think he's listenin' Lards

Usually the extremity level of blast injuries are:Traumatic amputation, fractures, crush injuries, compartmentsyndrome, burns, cuts, lacerations, acute arterial occlusion,and air embolism-induced injury
Probably there are more

Story synopsis of Catherine:Vincent likes his girlfriend. Katherine's pretty, smart, and successful. Trouble is, she's starting to talk about long-term commitment, something Vincent's spent his entire life avoiding. Since romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, Vincent meets his friends for their regular night of drinks. Little does he know that he's about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive,
jesus, lol

The second violins would get lovely melodies, which just shouldn't happen.

To survive
Not exactly; there have been these mysterious deaths that no one can explain.
As it said
The viola part isn't that bad.
dave_brozilla yourfacewhen the bass guitar
Climb or Die
TF TF TFT FTFTTFFTF
They stay on the basso continuo for 2/3 of the song before they finally get on the canon
freezeframe i guess :P
er, that much better*
=]
Well, yeah, but the symbolism makes more sense now. Like, for example, the giant creepy baby.
Dermathil left?
There are rumors that the people who have died were cursed due to being unfaithful.
Nope, he's stil here
Still here
I see that, but he 'here' here? Ah you are :P
yay~
More concentrated on Lagann
I'm considering entering the Happy Luna contest.
hi five
And also
Some deaths are aquired during deaths
Worst part is for church choir we had a Pachelbel lyrical setting where the bass section provided the basso continuo
Guess what I sing?
dreams*
WTF DID I JUST WATCH o_o
/me brohoofs Dman.
ATLUS RELEASES NEW GAME MADE OF WTFJAPAN.
And there's the repeated assertion that if you fall in a dream without waking up, you die.
Awesome Vincent climbing stuff
Yep
/me brohoofs Dermathil, his other hand holding a durillu
what do ya sing, freezeframe?
The dream is the reality sometimes i'm guessing?
J. Geils Band?
Yeah, but that's not true. I've died in dreams multiple times and I'm pretty sure I'm alive.
FREEZE FRAME
I died in many ways in my dream
HECK YEAH
80% sure. Needs to be about 20% surer.
/me watches troll.mp4
And trust me you do not wanna know how I die
Dman: I'm a bass
/me loves freezeframe
O i c then :P
80s RULES SUPREME
so its like inception?
/me is a bawss.
Got gunned down in a bank robbery once. Um. Fell. Burned. Blowed up...
Yes
with a rocket lawnchair.
First death dream
My highest note is D above middle C
dat pic. nevergonnagetboredof
Get explicitly teared down by a chainssaw
dat's pretty impressive
hehehe
Usually, you wake up. Sometimes, you can latch onto another character in the dream and start following them around. Then it's less "Inception" and more "Fallen."
Ouch.
before i read past sins should i watch the episodes first?
Nah
Occasionally E if the air is right and I only have to hit one in the song.
But its reccommended
omagad! freezeframe that medley!
Second death you may ask?
/me taps microphone
very impressed
/me smiles at robotpinkie
This thing on?
One might indeed.
Sarah Connor is mother of the future
Getting crawled by babies and being eaten by the babies alive
'sup Dman
Copy that, RP, i hear you loud and clear.
And we have a winner for most borked up dream death ever.

Rarity's is good, too, but the notes that Twilight's singing actor hits without causing ear bleeding are simply impressive.
I just want to know what genius chose "clop" as the word to describe that? To me, it conjures up an image of, well, pony applause.

maybe u can pull it off
1/2 the animation budget in the last 5 eps

I suppose a bit bigger can't hurt...
I can pull it off?
Maybe
in gurren lagann?
yeah, RobotPinkie.
I'm very gory in many ways
Hm
Nah
Happy but gory is possible, assuming it's not like mauling and more just very descriptive

But when he does those 50's style big band renditions, they're pretty sick
WE ALL DIE

It means... uh.... dailymotion?
are you taking requests for the postshow, sprinkles?
But to be honest,Grenade is kinda stupid.

It's the real one.
Err. Wut

It's the first one, though.
6Freeze, why must you mess with my trolling?
That would be hell
What kind of song works in 15/8?
Bowie & Queen.'Nuff said.
None apparently.
Heck if I know
Probably not even that obe xD

Just look at Gummy enjoy himself!

I can't see the chat.
I do have the Queen+ Greatest Hits III, so I have both versions of Under Pressure, and the Wyclef Jean version of Another One Bites the Dust
I did a dance number to this with two friends of mine in Grade 3

It was pretty bawss

Oh okay, I forgive you then

Well,try and see if Youtube is working now Sprinkles!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFCj_Nud5fg — awesome, imo
One of the major issues I've seen mentioned around the net, besides that one, is when you deal with series built for different levels of ability. The amount of sites there are dedicated to 'x-versus-y' is unreal

My sister met the lead singer's brother
at one of them Van's Warped Tour
Hard to inform someone about it, though
SirSprinkles, for mac :-(
the closest i ever came to meeting someone famous was when i went to the colbert/stewart rally in dc last year
Yep, works
i saw them in the distance
FYI I changed my Gamertag, BUT! I am not going to give you any type of clue.
I've met a famous Swedish writer, does that count?
speaking of, colbert gave a shoutout to bronies
why cant i see it???
03sogj
03*sigh
i know it was awesome
06drf
06i fixed that problem
03OK
A guy I met on a cruise met with Eminem before he hit it big on the highway in some state with another friend of his, so he still doesn't count it, but they got these mix CD's from him with a promise he said he'd hit the big time
Yeah, I was shocked. I watch Colbert every day, and I hadn't seen the EQD post yet when I watched it.
06it wasn't the reg
My friend is in Illinois, and lost his mix CD
06pc was DUSTY AS HECK

his Friend is in California, and is holding on to that Eminem mix CD with all his life, lol

...what the fuck are we watching?
ohai silverscreen
sorru dragonrage
sorry*
OHAI SILVERSCREEN! We're watching Gummy groove.
Ohai DragonRage
@silverscreen were waching gummy dancing
Silverscreen: Gummy grooving to random music from SirSprinkles
I see that.
It's been years since I heard this song, too
It's out preshow
our*
i thought gummy danced by standing and waving his tail
lol no
and we all just had a great discussion, everyone finally agreed that the best pony is Cheerilee
nope
wut
cough no that was Caramel cough
11@pony best pony
'80s Cheerilee needs an episode!
wow that is a weird way to spell Rainbow Dash guys
That's when he's getting down Wolf, this is just when he hears a little ditty
Cheerilee? That's not how you spell Vinyl Scratch.
Fluttershy is best pony
I'm pretty sure you misspelled Rarity there.
DAFT PUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6And then Daft Punk.
Derezzed isn't even Daft Punk's best song
11Rarity is best pony
YES!!111
TRON FTW
YES
6Bantering, it's on shuffle.
0cheerilee is meh
Daft Punk's Discovery album crushed their Tron album
6It's just playing whatever.
How does everyone manage to misspell Twilight Sparkle?
Polkarama is my favorite song by Weird Al
I still need to see Tron :(
i saw that
Mandatory gif is mandatory http://arch.413chan.net/MLP_-_DJ_Pon-3_-_Nod_to_the_Beat_%28Close-Up%29-%28n1297202125742%29.gif

DERREZZED FTW.BEST TECHNO BEAT EVER!
His Silvermane!
i need to see inception
the first or the second tron?
6I saw Tron... I don't remember most of it. I was really high.
*Hi. not his
/me 11watches NC instead.
I haven't seen either Tron movie, don't really plan to either...
hi Razyn, other people
DAE saw Tron (not Legacy)?
Not sure why Cheerilee is so popular though, but hey, if somepony that doesn't even exist called "Nyx" can win a popularity contest...
Hi Silvermane
LoneWolf414: That's a weird way of spelling Angry White Boy Polka. :P
I only played Tron 2.0 that was quite nice
ohai Silvermane
Nyx is an abomination
that needs to be kiled
6AND THEN PINK
killed*
So who else was here last night?
I must have seen the original about 4 times
6SHUFFLE IS WTFTASTIC
I was!
Mmmm... pink
me
I was.
people love little Nyx, and I can understand why after falling in love with little Midnight
/me raises hoof
I was here for Killer Tomatoes
0lag?
but yeah, the first Tron is a necessary watch for its awesomeness. The second must be avoided at all costs
I remember MEOWception like it was yesterday.
I will be watching it again.
Og God, Killer Tomatoes....
cannon unsee
There are stories with Midnight?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JiU8I4_fPA
i loved the second tron
BAM

and the daft punk in it was amazing
FUN FACT: TOMATOES ARE FAGS.
Baby Midnight, daughter of ******** and ******
I was here for the final little bit of Inception and all of the tomatoes, but I didn't see any pony......

When does Inception start? Or did I miss it?
Razyn, read Out in the Cold and all 4/5 sequels
yeah when does it start
6It starts after the first pony ep.
6Which is soon.
Awesome
four minutes right?
Yes!
Out in the Cold...
Did I mention that I love ponies?
Five
I hope Bjornfot didn't cause too much trouble when i was gone last night.
RobotPinkie No, really?
if you didn't love ponies you wouldn't be here
it's an amazing sad-shipping story with happy results
Pinkie: I would imagine you do if you hang out in a brony chat :P
Holy shit! You love ponies? SO DO I!
I do too.
Yes, really FluxBrony!
Me too! :O:O:O
HOLY SHIT!

0did you know that my name is based off of gummy and a freestyle rap song?
Razyn :D

HOW I HIDE MY NAME?
The Doctor is a pretty cool pony, he has bow ties and doesn't afraid of anything.
Ohshi-, I told you we shouldn't hang out in a Halo chatroom, guise!
So I might still pick a movie. Sweet.
you can't spell crap without rap
Sirsprinkles, are we going to do a STREAMCEPTION?
I think Bill is a pretty cool guy.He kills zombies and doesn't afraid of anything.
Was anyone here last night when meowception happened?

Better even than Gummy?
Rarity is the only being in existence who can pull off a duckface and not look fucking retarded.
TGPFluttershy nope, that would be Scootaloo XD
Ghosties: I wouldn't believe you one second. Also, idc if people are brony are not anymore, as I will still sing Winter Wrap Up to them either way
Best in Show, in other words, TGPF?
SPOILER: being a unicorn give her magical powers such as making stuff leverage
i just love how brony flame wars play out XD

Gummy and Opal are the only pets that scare L4D Tanks away.
Aponymous: Hence Rarity making a new one for her.
Hmm, I see.
don't you mean "hoofwork"
Burn that dress with fire!
Ah, there's sathi

Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.

never ben here
A TIRE.
ouch
Stream wen't *boom*, now I'm back
Did anyone notice that Twilight's dress that she brought in was one that she tried on in episode one during Rarity's make over scene?
I just woke up fifteen minutes ago
Gummy's teeth rotted out from all the candy Pinkie gave him.
15Durhur.
Random fabric + Bucket on head. Very trendy.
Continuity error?
Odd, I woke up INCREDIBLY early today.
I wonder why noone cares about the excessive amounts of property damage RBD causes....
I think everypony in ponyville has to purchase a Rainbow Dash rider
semi afk cooking something as my tummy is rumbling
Which is weird considering I was working until 1 AM last night.
I love fun things!
It's magic ValtheJean, i don't gotta explain shit
For their insurance
Dash has "Hero insurance"
Probably.
SPOILER: Rainbow Dash loves fun things
ValtheJean: I think by now everyone knows that it's just a regular hazard with living in the same town as her.
Early, eh?
That sucks
You make me hard.
and they can repair it with magic, so

but a rainbow dashtank is epic
0@Silverscreen Pinkie Pie doesn't sing this!
Well, that song and WWU
i mean in the song, silvermane
That would be EPIC.
ah
11@interior_Gummy how observant.
That's not how you spell Twilight Sparkle
Fluttershy: because it's the hub
Because this song rips off an obscure Barbara Streisand song.
After reading On a Sword and Arrow, I want to record myself singing Elusive's version of this.
>.>
hey does anyone know how long this episode is ?
22 mins
interior_gummy is a pinky fan, ay?
22 minutes
0@Silverscreen but you said it was sung by the best pony
Pinkie is best pony, but then again, so is Rarity....... I'm so conflicted. :(
it's like 22 minutes
Not long enough, like all pony eps.
Song was around before Barbara Streisand...
Axel_Foaley Something tell me that Barbara would love it
Axel: that Barbara Streisand song, in turn, ripped off a SOndheim song

0rarity needs the magic of caffiene
i want a m1 abrahms tank painted like rainbow dash
I never really cared for Rarity until this episode
for some reason...this song makes playing Supreme Commander easier...I'm not sure why
That still frame of Rarity's face just before the song always makes me LOL
good point
Exactly. True Frensh fashinable BIRDSNEST.
whoa, suddenly harmony
Rarity always has such good episodes made about her.Since she's such a human-character, it's easy to write very good stories i guess
fashion*
Look before you Sleep was a good one for Rarity, too.
I thought rarity was going to be the one I disliked, she ended up being my favorite
Great, now my dad's trying to bring me out of my room with the smell of popcorn just so he ca nse what I

I need to know if a Spy is here so i can be safe
Definitely.
Fluttershy wouldn't have looked good in that haute couture outfit, anyway.
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
Frubban: No, I'm in your dreams BRAAAAAAAM
No one can out passive aggressive Rarity.
I can agree with that RobotPinkie, just I don't understand why so many people hate it

I laughed so much at how completely Rarity manipulated the diamond dogs
