IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FALTERING TO ME.
where was i?
cause his kids have not changed at all
11OKAY, EXPLINATION
11The adventure itself wasn't a dream, as the top fell durring the other parts of the movie.
9OBJECTION!
4...what?
13 42
9Canonically, the totem fell
4I don't know if I can sit through this movie again
9but they decided to cut it before it did
I disagree on that. The movie doesn't show the top falling, but it leaves the possibility that it might.
MiMichael Caine is the actor.
yeah
YOU'RE KILLING US MODS
I'm leaving guys! G'night! ^_^
HEY!
CREDICEPTION
I think straight can't now
hey hold on
Guys, guys, seriously.
IVE SPOKEN 8 LINES, YET NO ONE ELSE HAS SAY ANYTHING
top falls
BULLSHOT! COBB isn't that good of an architect that he could create France and Kenya and Japan and Shit.
That
Unless theres another movie
Mind
the top does begin to fall just before it cut
G'night
= blown
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM
Both versions of the Debate are canon
Guys, I have a very controversial intepretation:
It's a TRAP!
They had it story borded where the totem fell
bluh
i say it fell
I liked it
0it's awesome
TRUELY A MINDFUCK
Oh i get it
The top was faltering, wasn't it?
wf_chronicles no vid links
0silverscreen yes he did, we see him out of it in the end
Tech
4Fuck this shit, I'm about ready to just go to sleep
He had to, or else Cobb would've been arrested.
Tech Dude :o
4THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID SLEEP
It was tilting
once the top were to start wobbling it would eventually fall down
Open interpretation. That is all
Sleep?
WAT!
MY BRAINZ ARE HURTING.
i give up
None of you exist
Permission to post a link?
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
7I should sleep..

7it's 5:30!
fdssfdgasdfgdfgsdfgsdfgdfghgf
4:30 AM here. 4:30 am....
gahh!!! MY MIND.
4And unspoken rule
I figured the end WAS ambiguous, and the top was faltering, but wasn't shown falling. "Was or was it not a dream?"
Oh crap
I'm giving in to sleep
But Sathi, you're already asleep!DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN! think, how did you get HERE?
o hai
Not a dream, watch the movie next time.
What's next?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM
7oh right!
I swear that that top is faltering before the credit cut! Doesn't anybody agree with me?
My brain is full of fuck
TEARS LOST IN THE RAIN
Daxton, no vid links
4Reality is actual when we sleep, and this, right now, is just our subconscious minds. All of us, right now, are just dreaming
Seriously, movie itself debunks it.

Rarity?
I have a feeling that I made a mistake with my spelling.....AGAIN!
It should be "Did you know that Fluttershy is the best Pony?"Then it would be right.
42 seems like a good amount to me.
42? That proves it, its the answer to the universe!
We've dropped 2

Also, this is like, the best Ho-oh sprite ever
http://i26.tinypic.com/3026y34.jpg
12Cute XD
I'm just like <3!
and PMD sprite is about the size of the RSE ones I think
let me find it first xD
12k
12Small
yeah
12Do you not like the HGSS ones either?
I don't hate them but I don't like them the most either
12Bleh
12Hmm
12Anyone else got a say in this?
/me is slapped
04What?
04Whatever you do, don't use B/W sprites.
04They're horrible.
04At least for Ho-Oh
12Lol
06i found my games on the drive! games from 5 year old!
12Ffs Angry Birds wont play on my phone >v>
06android or apple?
12I use Android ONLY
04Honeslty Arti, I don't mind which one you use as long as it's not the B/W ones.
04Honestly*
12So you like the HGSS ones?
12and lol trust me I hate the BW ones too >v>
06i see, weird that it doesnt play it on android .-.
12It's not the OS thats the problem lightumbreon
12it's the phone, it's two years old
06whats kind of phone?
12It's a HTC Magic
12lol yeh but it's two years old now
12Sucks
12It;s been like this for like a year now :(
12and no one seems to know a way to downgrade!
06ew...
I suck
04XD
/me hugs NS
/me hugs back
Except that we can sorta downgrade
04That's exactly like you
XD
I don't though
on the topic of criminals and outlaws
04Of course.
XD
04Sheesh, it's all you dpo
04do*
06it's awesome :3
rofl

Shiny's probably going to come complaining though
Just warning you :p
12Tell him to animate the diamond/pearl ones properly then :>
04XD
06WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, if this is the OLD harddisk i'm usin...and everything is still on it...
06crap
06so are the virusses!
04ohshi
/me goes to scan >.<;
It's not the spread wings thing
it's the legs
12They change every other sprite EXCEPT Ho-ohs
04Ok
12lol the legs were only weird in HGSS ovo
12and even then they're not that bad
04this is gonna be a reeeeeeally crude joke but...
Why don't you have a poll or something about the sprites?
which is why I don't like them
12My canary does that all the time with his legs XD
04Ho-Oh: "Hey guys, can you smell fish?"
/me FLEES
06LMAO
12prince-dari, because I am impatient and can't be bothered to wait for an answer that long >v<
12Why did you have to make that joke? :/
and yes, they don't change Ho-Oh's sprite
and lol
/me has a thought
12LOL that would be cool
12Though
12The profiles don't do javascript (just remembered)
Oh that's just me
Ignore that
04It'd be pretty cool if they did.
Hey.
06what script do they do then?
(we know each other from another chat)
You got any pony toys yet?
I swear it does do JS
06ouch
12I remember someomne saying they tried it and it didn;t
12But try
iirc I was able to link to my snowflakes script
it only accepts some js
not all
Other than the McDonald's ones, no
12Oh right XD
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Toys.jpg
12Ok
McDonald's toys STILL haven't come here.
...uses
06OHSHI-

06virus scanner went ape just now
04Uh oh

Where's "here?"
UK
England
The other G4 toys have starteds coming in here in Singapore as well
12The latest visitors are REALLY annoying me....
Nothing here in Ireland, either.
I was checking out the Toy'r'us stores here
At the moment it's just Twilight sitting on my desk.

04So NS, when's the next TST meeting thingamajig?
06the defrg
06then clean up a bit
read topic
"Next meeting is at 10:30pm GMT 8/8/2011."
which is 8:30am for us
i kid, i kid
I know right. :P
XD
/me smiles at Shaico, "i thought it was amazing!"
04Yeah no, not gonna make it.
... Hmm it's actually pretty damn cool.
Well, if I moved it to 8am, would you?
last night was plagued with problems
-again-
I rather like it now :D
I saw in Skype. :/
I'd hate 8am
Did I fall into EAD again?
It's every week I'm not there. :P
in fact, I could do 6:30am
XD
<33
XD
/me bites mirc. work correctly!
04Wouldn't be up at 6:30, parents' would get suspicious. 8am...maybe, but I wouldn't be around very long.
How've you been doing anyway?
not bad
/me turns the music up
7am'd be risky
definitely can't do 7:30am
04Neither
I might not be able to make bmn tonight
04I'll be getting ready for school at that time
I probably won't too.
bleugh
yeah
If you read up in Skype, I explained everything.
and not 7:15
i did :)
also: thanks for the tip about the nick list, saved that
04Nope.
048am seems alright.
04But we'll need to check with others.
I honestly don't want to do 8:30am
sure. where does it print it though?
as that requires me to get up early
and catch the 7:03 or 7:08 train
It just msgs you the names one at a time.
!nicks
also hivemind
XD
yeah it worked fine
04...wouldn't 8am make that worse?
Good.
06ans i still only use 2 of the 8 CPU's
/me dances triumph
er, I meant for the 8am meeting
7:03 or 7:08
Hai gaise
Hellew
for 8:30 I'd catch the 7:33 at latest
lol hai man

me posting anything out of fanfiction/helpsuggestions/announcements is unusual
04XD
heyo GGgala
xD
I'm here too but I'm up to shenanigens
and then, of course, there's naming the hero ZELDA
or THIEF
6Hey.
Sprinklesception
also hi
It's been here for a while.
...what's it for?
My type letter
I've seen it do like, two things.
I dunno, just for fun, I remove it when the actual streams are on.
The other mods seem to enjoy it.
Hi there
As well as users.
back*
6Yes.
Bene.
It is REALLY spammy, which is why I remove it for streams.
I can see how that would work.
Any way to disable most of its functions and leave on a few things?
Well I was thinking of having a system to limit use of the scripts to once every 30 seconds or something.
Mostly just want the EqDaily notifications left on. It's a handy feature.
lars
go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LN5GrF-Gb0&NR=1
That's still a lot.
Wait wat
This is the most boring time yet
Oh wait.
We need some Pinkie Pie
I have them on here.
...lawl.
Well okay then.
If I ever forget to mods can just kick it anyway.
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/SUP.jpg
GGgala, and THEN there's naming the hero 'Fuck me'
'Oh, fuck me! I didn't see you there!' (entering icecaverns:) 'FUCK ME it's cold in here.' 'Fuck me, you can't defeat me!'
oh awesome
supports /whois now
that's great
