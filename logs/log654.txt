Meanwhile: I think there is an online chat with a mormon thingy
group hug :)
Caramel: my neighbors are really nice people
the chorus
2,14 in fact, the only disaccuracy of this episode is that they fail to talk about how Joseph Smith was a horney fake who used religion to fuck women
(secret message) i Have a quEstion to ask alL everyPony. whIch Monster in Big ol sEason 1 gIant moNster was ur Guys favorite. i KInD of eNjoyed All the big dragons and their flaPPing wings. thEy looked Damn cool.......find the message
Which is sort of why Mormonism is a running joke that the South Park creators like to touch on.
did NO ONE notice the chorus?
i actually kinda like friends

Randy is by far the best character on this show.
lol
otakon: Yeah I figured it out early, but then, I've seen this ep. :P
CK|Catnap: lol
South Park tends to generalize.
Hes a white guy, right?
and if he was black?
ew
Randy has gone into full redneck mode
ew
ShiningDawn: Then I wonder why hes mormon
ShiningDawn: he wouldn't do a damn thing

no if he was black he would call the cops for "rape"
Still not an excuse.
you must be furiouse
2,14 CK|Catnap: ironically, mormonism is more dangerous than scientology, because it's so much better disguised. Scientology is an obvious cult, mormonism only shows its cultish ways to people who are already in too deep
ShiningDawn: lol
who the heck do these people think they are?
otakon: my neighbors are extremely nice man,
Caramel: that's right ..sadly
Bronysith: do you not trust them?

lol now im remembering Matt Stone and Trey Parker's Orgazmo movie where a mormon becomes a superhero and everytime he says hes from Utah,people get serious and say ":O I'm so sorry." :D
Nittany_Discord: That kinda defeats the point of it.

and then they all had sex
2,14 in fact, they go incredibly easy on mormonism. Probably because Matt and Tray used to be mormons

Caramel: hardened by years of internet. try me
why at the fire station
Caramel: It's kind of hilarious that people believe this. I mean, I can totally understand some religious concepts....but Mormonism seems rather blatantly based on the most nonsensical thing ever. XD
sagas: that one has all John/Jane Doe's for the credits
dear god

This is not 3.5 I think

2,14 yes, it's 3.5
it's g3
I'll just pay attention at lyra's trollface
2,14 3.6 is newborn cuties
oh god

Caramel: may i request some more ponies? o 3o
lets watch newborn cuties next >_>

The song actually isn't that bad
Man so many playing Black Mesa now.
2,14 Sorry Derpy_Hooves: shizu will be taking over after this
How is this song any worst than some in G4 honestly, the big improvement is in characters and writing, not music
My bad im stuck on fucking console
YOU ARE NOT PINKIE PIE :[
Newborn cutiies is the worst

Thanks for the stream, Caramel
mitamaking: FUCK UR LOGIC
thanks for that Caramel
By the way, I AM in a lot of trouble for my conduct during Caramel's stream.
If you're going to show G3 why not show someone's riffing commentary of it? BronyDubs4Life just did this whole movie

Kandarihu hwo so?

this looks like another half-life mod
take care Meanwhile
Night, Meanwhile :)
Night, Meanwhile
night Meanwhile
quick. think of evey inside freemans mind joke you can think of.
Meanwhile: dream of ponies
Night Meanwhile
rdibp: enope
rdibp: Yep it's Shizuka's thing at the moment
night meanwhile
OohShiny: It's a recreation of the original in Source.
Anyway: fuck headcrabs. They can all die. Forever.
2,14 when it comes out on steam, I'm totally getting it
Night Mean- damn
OohShiny, but only until Xen
/me tries to always be respectful of the Shizuka.
Yep.
JESmith71: how come when i search for it its not there :(
i may go play gmod
I wish they would at least set a date and time for next season
Caramel: it's out now, it's free JUST GET IT.
Caramel: No desire to torrent/download?
2,14 meh...not a fan of torrenting unless I have to
Caramel: all you need is Source 2007 and the mod
i love this part
this is black mesa?
Caramel; you have to
so what happened?
2,14 I'd rather just wait for it to be done automatically via steam
yeah
Caramel: you don't have to torrent it, I did because it was faster but there IS a direct download link
inside freemans mind is exactly at this part. its latest episode is right here
is it going to be free on steam?
so, how is black mesa for those who played it?
yup, half-life mod...
yeys
YES! I'm not going to miss this!
What difficulty is this on right now?
the stream resolution is a bit too low
can someone answer me? is it going to be free on steam or not?
DaringDerpy she can't stream it any higher IIRC
rdibp: yes
hey, I'm gonna start playing this...
WHATS GOING ON
:$
2,14 DaringDerpy: playing games while streaming is a huge tax on computers
ShiningDawn this is Black Mesa
where can I download this?
is this black mesa ost
2,14 the fact she can stream this with relatively high graphics settings is already impressive
rdibp would answer if I could
hmhm
It looks like it handles and plays nicely. Too bad I can't get it because I haven't even played the first Half Life
DaringDerpy Steam
search black mesa in google
rdibp: its a mod. its gonna be free. also, they released it for download last friday. so they wouldent go out and put a price on it
i know that but whats goin gon with the game whats going on what happened?
Freefall29: all the downloads i tried was corupt
ded
ShiningDawn: in a nut shell. alien invasion. if it moves, shoot it.
2,14 damn barnacles
oh
hello evryone
I remember I could stream New Vegas perfectly once
hai fluttershyFTW
hi, fluttershyFTW :)
rdibp: try a different download
Hello fluttershyFTW
it's under condemed basicly
<.<
dark mesa
hi fluttershyFTW
ShiningDawn: yeah. I don't wanna spoil much... not that you can, the plot is minimal.
Does one have to play the other Half Life games before they play Black Mesa?
i like the thing on the magnum where you can bring it up to your face
The magnum is the best gun.
It is a revolver. Case. Closed.
PillowPoni: its a remake of the first one]
sup Dken2021
rdash: that's called iron sights
Huh?
PillowPoni: you only need a source game. like half-life 2, left for dead.... all source games save for tf2 come with source sdk. you need the source sdk to download source branch 2007.
Who pinged me...
and evryone else who said hello
rdash otakon did
Lol
SO WHAT I MISS
PillowPoni: Black Mesa is a Source 2007 completely faithful remake of Half Life
caps lock
boy i should really get halflife and see how it is
Freefall29: Unfortunately I don't have any source games because money....
2,14 damn, shizu already has the crossbow. That means I missed the first Icthyosaur :(
BARRELZ! :[
Caramel: yes you did
I don't think tf2 will cover this game.
wasting time till Borderlands 2 launches at Midnight
DO A BARREL ROLL!
this computer im using is impossible to type with compared with my other one
http://derpy.me/oa10a Caramel is this nsfw? or it is just text though so what?
Freefall29: enope, it has to be L4D
fluttershyFTW Caramel just finished streaming South Park. Shizu's playing Black Mesa.
TF2 doesn't count because F2P
2,14 first off: it's not a good idea to ask that in the main chat
otakon: or half-life 2, episode 1, episode 2, portal 1, portal 2,ect
Bronysith that counts IMO
2,14 secondly: it says the link is gone now, so I don't know
Freefall29: yeah
the final boss eh?
Bronysith: next time PM the mod
my keyboard is glitching out
I wonder if Walter Simmons is augmented down there.
i heard the creatures got to play borderlands 2 early
rdibp: lucky bastards
my friend is getting Borderlands 2 tomorrow
Canadian_Brony: so is half the world
Canadian_Brony so is evryone
.ok it fixed now
/me hates not having a lot of the popular games
so this is gordon freeman or someone else?
so what did i miss
what's so good about borderlands 2?
/me isnt getting borderlands 2....
Maybe I would have people to play with if I did'
dat rocket launcher
I haven't played border lands 2, no point in getting 2
this is Harold Scrouter, scientist at black mesa
rdibp not me. I dont' have a PS3 or 360 to play it on, and I don't have a computer that runs Steam games ATM
ah ok
father of Gordon "Freeman" Scrouter
Fuck headcrabs.
00,10damn gordon is a tank
Canadian_Brony: You are just like me :O:O:O
Reikim|Crowbar: that would be weird

stupid cones
13given it took 8 years to make this
13don't hold your breath
Shizuka: I can dream...
this isn't even Part 3, right?
/me holds breathe
breath*
it took them 8 years to fine tune a mod?
13every texture and model is from scratch
Shizuka: its not even done yet. its still in development
:O
13there's a couple sounds i recognize from valve, but otherwise 99% from scratch
that could take 8 years to perfect
well that takes a long time
ah, could understand all that time to fine tune things
MR.BOX NOOOOO

Also, hi Saxy.
13a lot is stock sounds i've heard from everywhere

Well, that would be why
JRP: Me neither
I recognize a few from TF2
Black Mesa is a free project. Of course they'll use a lot of free sounds.
...
to top it off i have a interview today
especially for weapons
I see a Roseluck on the HP bars
ooh JRP, how'd it go?
she looks so comfy
Are you good for the interview?
How are the devs making money off this?
hi JRP
ALIENS
They aren't I don't think.
good luck JRP
No ads, no paying for it...it's a labour of love, and that's why I deeply respect them.
...
Is that a Shizu on top of the health bar?
13nope roseluck

Close enough.

Shizuka: you got a gun. you're whats dangerous
herpy derpy doo
I tried manipulating this part of the game where I could try and blow up everything and still survive it. And that didn't work too well.
13oh
13that
Freefall29 She's only dangerous when she has a flamethrower.
ded
WELP
THATS whats dangerous
i blame SaxyPretender
0,14I do too-
:D oh that
0,14wait
lawl
lol
The whole building goes nuclear.
13and then shizu quicksaved so shooting on load would make things splode
Shizuka I blame SaxyPretender
WHO PUTS THIS MANY EXPLOSIVES IN ONE SPOT
dat mini nuke
WHO
SpadeMagnes[R] see my message?
HEADCRAAAABS
13made it through in one go the other day
The government.
there you go
these scientists clearly arn't very smart
SpadeMagnes[R]: Shizu does. :D
brb, food
Hey, you know how it goes. See empty space, must clutter.
Shizuka: Why not just find something to throw at the mines?
13can't
13set any of them off
Throw a head crab at it
13everything goes boom
Also, why not use flashlight?
The whole building goes nuclear from one explosion.
08,01so i just found my favourite character out of any webcomic ever
08,01does anyone read Menage a Tres?
...That sounds NSFW.
08,01because i just started reading it
08,01and my god, Zii...
08,01she reminds me so much of myself
Sounds VERY NSFW
08,01which is why i like her so much
Piano
DAMN
epic music starts playing
Shizuka 4 YEAR OLD SPAM GO
08,01Reikim: can't remember if there's actual boobies in it
dat backround music
shit just got real
Suddenly music
That's some sexy piano.
its time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... but i'm all outta gum
/me 08,01doesn't pay much attention to boobies
omg all those crats are full of explosives
Fitting music is fitting
lol
I'm back
lawl
WELP
Shizuka: /)
KAbooooom
Nuclear crates
ded
MLG PRo
you know stuffs serious when theres piano msic in half life
i heard boobs
twilight_sprinkle: hellz yeah
Save scumming like a boss
no u know shits serious when a nerd ses dnt do it
I better be mpressed with the black ops models
impressed
Shizu has no need of flashlight!
13SCUM
13SCUM FOR YOUR LIVE
Don't blow up the place now
SCUM?
scum?
Save scumming.
I don't get it
13but seriously the jumping is so crap it's better to scum after every jump
13just in case
oh
Its a term for abuse in savestates
THAT scum
k
I still don't get this scum thing
So what would happen if you didnt break that box?
Save scumming: the practice of abusing free game saves to make puzzles easier, i.e. not having to reset the entire thing after death.
she quicksaves whenever she jumps
13it clips into the beam and booms
cuz this game is bad for that
jumping
But then where's the challenge...?
apparantely
13and yet you saw that first box i broke went right into it and didn't blow up
13then the other box i hit once and blew up
13it's very hit or miss
13thus, save scumming
LOGIC
ah, i see
13because it's a boring as hell stream to watch me reload over and over
Must be even more fun playing it.
I think that second box has a tripmine fixed to its surface. Hense the nucleation of the building.
Shizuka: if its half-life, its not
ah yes the blast room!
got dat right shizuka
/me slaps NewSuperBronyU around a bit with a large trout
Seriously who the fuck took their time to place all
/me 08,01for one would like to hear more abotu Shizu's exploding box.
I love this animation
these explosives
mmm Squishy.
Although honestly I wouldn't mind Shizu having to reload often if it meant I got to listen to that nice piano music over and over again and what the hell is that
the hell is that thing?
What's the trout command anyway? :S
RAPE TIME
awww
it's kind of cute
dafuq is dat

What is that disgusting thing?
NO
...So much awkward.
Don't do that
Well. Seems it accepted it
GRODY
Arm cannon?
I think it enjoyed it
tthat thing is a waepon
0,14what the crap
scout19_tf2: BUT EFFECTIVE
wow.....just wow
Shizuka: why you hurt Mr. Squiggles?
lololo
Then he finds out he can't remove it
DOn't hurt Mr. Squiggles
Oh its the homing dart thing.
He has a shotgun. Me jelly.
Does anyone know what the trout command is? :S
Is that Mario?
that mustache!
those HECU soldiers are the most challenging part of this game
AJIsAwesome: enope
The security guard is having an off day it seems
AJIsAwesome: There is no trout command. You have been lied to.
:(
There is a bass command how ever
Bass command? :S
Note: these security guards? There's a very good reason they're not among the scientists.
Watch as they stand right in front of headcrab zombies to fire at them.
who is playting

Watch as they run headlong into barnacle tentacles.
That's about it . . .
I like how he does not say a thing about what is attached to gordons arm.
Everything seems normal.

13problem is grenades don't have crosshairs

Shizuka: At this point, might as well just run through.
RUN LIKE RAMBO
13AH

Gordon just had a little fit and imagined his own death. Now back to what REALLY happens.

Shizuka: Compensates for all the completely stupid guards.
I love the weapon locker
5 imaginary dollars for the guard dying
If that gaurd is jaded then I dun want to know what Gordon is going through.
HA!
Freeze
Now, there is only one question left... WHERE THE HELL IS HL3?
Just point the crazy living alien weapon at them.
This was my favorite room.
They definitly needed a lot more voice actors for this mod
get niar guns
...Gimme gimme gimme
Especially the scientists all sound the same
tthis room is just as epic as it was in the original
13and some of these and some of these
13definitely need some of these
Recharge, replenish, and reload EVERYTHING.
what no guns
LEAVE THEM DEFENSELESS
Okay, now let's burn this mother DOWN!
Dat BSoD
"So, where did, what did you say his name was again? Freeman? Where did he go?" "Um. I dunno. But it seems all the armaments are gone." "What? He took everything? How can he even hold all the stuff?"
Don't forget revolver amo
...Yesssss
Crossbow the entire facility
a little of everything
"You know, I am starting to doub this guy even went to University."
/me agrees with Barbetos.
"This man has been like this for a while now, and by a while I mean he should have been taken by the Grim Reaper already. I’ve tried visiting him, moving him out then moving him back in, but he just stands there, without a body. Just his feet and head. Plus, he’s also apparently in labor and I’ve made my Sims try and take him to the hospital but nothing happe
Lonko: university of pain
you don't want to knwo
*know
"Gordon Freeman. Male, 27. PhD, MIT. Scientist."
YUP.
Barbetos: hes gordon freeman he can hold anything
bag of holding
killed em all
sounds like a thing from Minecraft
Watching Shizu makes me realize...I really suck at FPS games.
:o
Bag of Holding
Canadian_Brony: ...It's from DnD.
Is that in the actual game your playing right now?
Reikim whatev.
I love the chromatic abberation effect
lol
I love the voice acting lol
"Come on guys! It's one scientist! He probably FAILED Phys-ed! WHY CAN'T WE KILL HIM?"
...
But I have to say, the best thing about this was the train ride and the music
No, it's on simsgonewrong :P
I'm back.......and i'm watching Son Of The Mask......it sucks
haha
"Because he has all the weapons sir!" "What do you mean all the weapons? He just has two hands!" "I know, but he has...ALL...the weapons."
Yes, because they would use such old computers
lol
where did the 2 cops go

...Someone's got some rage
hi Dark92Enigma. Gah, that's an awful movie. Watch the stream. Shizu's playing Black Mesa
It's a good thing the HEV has that high impact reactive armor
I laughed so hard that I coughed so hard XD
Is Shizuka streaming?...i knew it

watch it instead of the movie
Dark92Enigma: yeah

Canadian_Brony: in fact, i'm planning on reviewing it
Just like the old kreedz climbing days
...That was such a BS jump.
that looks wierd
Is it just me or did this chapter get shortened?
Canadian_Brony: since rumor has it, NC hanged up his tie

0,14I'm seeing all these platforms
A man with no body that's in labor XD
0,14and I'm imagining going through them Assassin's Creed style
...That would be a completely epic crossover fic.
but in case of any AWFUL scene, i'll get back here

I see what you did thar

derpy advice #33 when you want to know a video game that takes place in a school than buy bully for ps2
This game kind of lacks any sort of decent long-ranged weaponry.
Shizuka can yo aim in?
*you
no snipa rifles
BOOM
damn
You here that Shizu? You gonna TAKE that?
And even after launching rockets you're still getting picked at from afar.
You would need a spotter
Reikim: hear
"You ain't got shit!" "I've got more weapons than are supposed to even exist!"
"And a PhD!"
Lonko: well why go in teams when you can just spot on your own
... overkill much
I am sure Gordon Freeman would be a fan of Breaking Bad

I WENT TO COLLEGE

Hi, DocSane :)

hi DocSane :)
Hey DocSane
Well that's one way to push a button.
Hey DocSane
I just spent a long day of running around and installing in wall ethernet jacks in my house.
DO you guys recommend Desktops or Laptops for gaming?
tik tik tickity
oh shyt
Desktops.
is there anyway to revive squishy
Freman no push button with his finger! Pathetic! Freeman use CROWBAR to push button!
im back wut just happend
0,14who dumped mountain dew?
AJIsAwesome: Desktops. Always.
oh shit
Alright, thanks.
Me. Sorry.
Laptops are good but are very hard to upgrade.
/me drinks mountain dew
Desktops are much easier.
Gotta love how the HEV suit has a built-in Geiger counter. And it actually makes sense!
/me hates Mountain Dew.
Gordon's head: "Looks like I am taking some souvenirs with me. Like... pancreatic cancer."
fluttershyFTW: Don't drink that! It's poisonous.
its a mountain dew factory
Ponies47 I C. I had about a dozen Fall crates, so I sold them all for some metal
/me glows green
Anyway, AJIsAwesome, for serious gaming you need something with more oomph than a laptop.
do i get super powers now
Reikim: Hmm.......like what exactly?
All the way up there. For a battery.
AJIsAwesome: A desktop, naturally. Laptops are limited due to size, heating, and so on.
eeyup
fluttershyFTW: You get.....THE ABILITY TO SHAPE SHIFT INTO A BUCKET!!!
Canadian_Brony: Ah. Eh I got some good stuff from them crates :3
Reikim Strange, my laptop does pretty well. Phase4 uses a laptop for gaming I believe.
/me shapeshifts into a sandwhich "LIAR"
DashWithRainbows: So do I, but let's be honest, a proper desktop would be preferable.
It's just a matter of finding a good one for a reasonable price.
I use a Desktop for everything. :P
00,02DashWithRainbows, Ping
Nope, lies.
my friend has a laptop with 6 gigs of RAM. Awesome for gaming
i dont have a desktop
DashWithRainbows: The other problem? Most laptops don't come with a GPU.
You're imagining things Phase4.
Phase4 WAZZUP
Canadian_Brony: Nice. :O
00,02Reikim, not if you want to take it anywhere
over kill
Precisely.
00,02Canadian_Brony, MINECRAFT
AJIsAwesome my friend, not me. I wish I had it tho
Winecraft!
00,02Reikim, hence why i have a laptop, i get less power than a desktop for the same price but i can use that power anywhere
/me mines out one block of bedrock
So, AJIsAwesome. If you want to do mainly gaming and you're not concerned with portability, get a good PC.
Aye, laptop is good since I will be able to take it to college and play some C&C in free time.
HA TAKE THAT
mine has 8 gigs of ram
So you would recommend something like TF2 for a desktop, correct?
00,02cowvarkian, my laptop has 16 :3
LOL these guys try to find a hitman online

AJIsAwesome yeah
Phase4 Wizardy at its finest. Did you upgrade it to 16 yourself?
Phase4: I got some awesome stuff from 2 fall crates I had! : D
Wizardry* or however you spell it.
00,02AJIsAwesome, oh yeah, if you dont want to move it then sure, get a desktop

Okay, thanks.
00,02if power isnt much of a concern get a cheap desktop

i have a gaming desktop i use my laptop for homework
Wow my laptop sure is crappy.
i only got 4 GB ram :<
Starring Shizu Freemane in Pony with a Shotgun!
00,02AJIsAwesome, think about it though, laptops can be prety cool
The desktop I got was on sale for about #500 it retails for I think it was $700 or so
00,02plus battery == intergrated ups, never loose your work again!
is too bad i lost that pic of Phase4 saying i love windows with bill gates on the backgrouund

AJIsAwesome: Okay, another question. Going to uni/college anytime soon?
Note: dont ever buy anything from acer, scers shit
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, oh what a shame

"does anybody in here kill people for money?"
Reikim: Already IN college, my friend. :$
AJIsAwesome: whats yer major?
I'm going to build myself a desktop. I'll order in any parts I need and get too it. Hopefully upgrade to a 64-bit and get 8 gigs of RAM if I save enough.
00,02I, inb4 Me and Myself
wow best name ever
twilight_sprinkle: Chemistry.
AJIsAwesome: ...Huh. Well, it's always hard to tell around here. If you want to have it available for class, go get a laptop. If space and portability are not a concern, then get a desktop.
AJIsAwesome: oh god ;_; that word scares me
Okay. Thanks.

+phase4:are you doing a stream?
hmm...disagree to some extent, i dont like more advanced mathematics. when it becomes more of a chore to figure out the problem, its just boring
00,02ShiningDawn, nope, ShiningDawn
physics is Not mostly math
ok
00,02twilight_sprinkle, yes it is
twilight_sprinkle: Yes. It is.
half the time you wont solve a problem just with math
I like physics and chemistry and stuff. The math in those is manageable
ShiningDawn: try using tab. Makes things easier.
The hierarchy works like this.
you need to understand the processes to solve a lot of problems
00,02physics is an application of math
agreed magmablock
It's stuff like advanced trig that I really hate
my parents are both into the sciences. Physics is mostly math
tab? what are you talking about?
Phase4: i appreciate the physical application aspects of math
Overly complicated crap that I will literally never use in my entire life
PSYCHOLOGY is just applied BIOLOGY. BIOLOGY is just applied CHEMISTRY. CHEMISTRY is just applied PHYSICS. And PHYSICS is just applied MATH.
oh good we get to spill some stuff
math is used in physics, but physics exists well without math. math is justa measuring tool
ShiningDawn: Type someone's name in partially and push the Tab button. It'll autocomplete it.

Reikim|GW2 seeing as how dividing with negative integers comes out to "WTF?"
wasnt sure if they were just people or what Shammy , they ran funny
00,02twilight_sprinkle, awww
Canadian_Brony: No it doesn't it results in a negative number.
lol what happened?
...
12I do
a ton of problems in electromagnetics dont even have any math in it
12:{D
and then there's imaginary numbers, like the square root of a negative number
00,02twilight_sprinkle, point is physics is very much math
yeah
...
You do what, moustashes?
00,02twilight_sprinkle, its used to describe the relation betwene forces
...
Electronics too. Figuring out circuit calculations and whatnot.
00,02fluttershyFTW, ...
it is, but hysics isnt math, its physics
The proper grammer is "I am"
fluttershyFTW: What is it?
it uses math, true
00,02Mozdoc, indeed
but its not math
/me throws muffins at Phase4 and fluttershyFTW
ah
I really don't understand the point of imaginary numbers. I mean, the concept and problems aren't that hard, but there is literally no ue for it.
Depends on the money
math is artificial, whereas physics isnt
j
physics is math related, but since it lets me figure out how high i need to aim a gun in order to hit a target due to the natural speed at which it falls and accounting for its movement speed and wind resistance, that makes it cool

Reikim|GW2: it often doesnt
I clone myself if that counts for anything

twilight_sprinkle physics is mostly math. Physics is composed of mathematical calculations to determine the relationship between objects, energy, and forces. AKA, math.
k
00,10yeah Phase4
?
twilight_sprinkle: Name a field of physics that does not require math.
00,10many sounds were used
well all of life requires math
hey, guess what, we're arguing about somethign pointless, lets stop
ut I couldn't click anywhere on firefox or anything and then firefox just suddenly shrunk down after a while and I clicked on it and everything is fine again
Canadian_Brony: no, math is just a way of expressing physics, but physis isnt math. if we wanted, we could measure force in apples, not numbers
Ingwaz: NEVER! Also how are you?
grey man O_o
00,02twilight_sprinkle, apples would then be a different kind of number
twilight_sprinkle: math is the basis of everything man
00,10but it would be a number of apples
otakon: crappy...i need to write a 1500 word paper on the novel persuasion by jane austen
!pokemon
13oh NOW i learn the bug hand has an altfire
twilight_sprinkle how do you have a negative apple
epic battle
twilight_sprinkle: Would still be math because it would still be numbers. That's like saying that if you're speaking Spanish, you're not talking.
00,02bug hand has alt fire?
Ingwaz: well good luck with that man
eeaughyeamaybeokay
otakon: which in case you've never read it, was published in 1818, the writing in it is pretty old...and its really really boring
Shizuka: you didn't kill Mr. Squiggles! YAY!
Canadian_Brony: sign is just direction.
I'm still scared ;__;
00,02ah
Hooray for TS defending an indefensible position. Again.
Ingwaz: so it's like the Catcher in the Rye for me huh?
otakon his name is Squishy
the bug
not the gun
Canadian_Brony: MR. SQUIGGLES
number of apples=/= the math we use, its just basic arithmetics, my point being that math is a tool used in physics, but physics =/= math
or the bug gun
Freely ignores good questions when he feels like it.
otakon: no, catcher in the rye does not compare, at the very elast not on the level of the writing in it
Phase4: its called the hiave mind or some such~
Ingwaz: I'll give you that one
hive*
00,02twilight_sprinkle, they are not equal, its just that physics is for the most part a bunch of math
otakon: catcher in the rye was a bit older, to be sure, persuasion is 200 years old
twilight_sprinkle: But math is still required for physics. Again, name a branch of physics that does not require math.
Remember Bronies: without Math we are caveman!!!
wut ?
shoot him
in squishy we trust
Without Math!
twilight_sprinkle I didn't say physics is math. I said . . . what Phase4 just said.
e.g., to find the direction of a particle in an electro-magnetic field doesnt require math
There ARE NO BUBBLES!

Freeman is smart, bitch.
nods in agreement
He's claiming that math is not necessary for physics.
lol, i do enjoy how whoever is playing nods or shakes their head when appropriate
challenge accepted
Sketch_Toku_Brony: NIce! Link it?
Basically, he's doing the whole "this thing is superior" argument.
no
Phase4: but calculations only come after the analysis, you cant do anything right in physics without analyzing the situation. it uses a lot of math true, but thats not what physics is about, calculations are just measurement
AJIsAwesome: gonna upload it in abit
physics is just applied math
twilight_sprinkle: And physics is measurement.
00,10or is it the fathplate sound was based on Hl1 sounds Phase4
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Okay. Thanks.
...
00,02Sumica, probably, i've not played through hl1
/me drinks tea
twilight_sprinkle: without the math its useless as well. measurements is part of science, and physics is a science
Reikim|GW2: physics isnt measurement. refer to the e-m field problem i mentioned
The vacuum cleaner!

Shizuka: tell me that gun has infinite ammo
hey shizu what does the alt fire on that do anyways?
fluttershyFTW: Here I come!! EYAAAAAH!!!!
Reikim|GW2: e.g., to find the direction of a particle in an electro-magnetic field doesnt require math

otakon: nope and its shit on ammo usage
+1 for Chaos
:Dnodding
And he treats everyone else with such goddamn disdain.
amiright?

or amiright?
/me slashes fluttershyFTW
test it on the nerd
13altfire is making my hand do that
/me blocks
13dunno what it's for
twilight_sprinkle: to find the direction, perhaps not, however, to measure the readings at all will almost certainly require math. perhaps not done by a human, but done none the less
Reikim|GW2: there are no measurements required in such a problem
no
oh common...

13am holding
I got nothin'
/me stabs AJIisAwesome
Reikim|GW2: in a way i guess, but its not math
Awww, he's sentimental.
well thats done
Reikim|GW2: it can be expressed through math, but doesnt have to be
Ooops.

/me dodges and counters
My bad!!!
00,10shame it did't miss him
you kilt him
twilight_sprinkle: Still, ninety percent of physics requires math. And math greatly enriches physics. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Shizu: Quickload?
00,02Sumica, *rimshot*
twilight_sprinkle: okay, so you can find the direction a partical goes. whoop de doo. what are you going to do with that? not a whole lot without math somewhere. also, i'm betting that the machinery used to find that direction requires math. so, math is involved
Shizuka: WHA?!? WHY!?
DAMN
13too late, loading next map
/me waits
When you get him going, he is SUCH a pain in the ass.
otakon reasons
WHAT REASONS?
13shizu freeman isn't ALWAYS benevolent
Reikim|GW2: it doesnt enhance it, and it is very useful. but im saying that physics exists well without math
00,10Dickfreeman
Shizuka: you evil :P
then why get him going ?
:D
where is my duck face emote?
That's terrible! :D
I need a Rarity duckface emote
otakon Shizuka is Shizuka. What more do you want, a muffin?
;)
twilight_sprinkle: Aaaaand bullshit again. Seriously, take a look. Ninety percent of physics is math. If you were to remove math from physics, what would you be left with? Very little.
:S
Canadian_Brony: yes, chocolate chip please
Freemans here! The door broke!
poor science dude didnt resist the power of shizuka
He gets himself going.
He literally hunts for reasons to act superior.
/me shoves an apple into otakon's mouth
twilight_sprinkle?
no muffin 4 U
00,02I HAVE NEW WEAPON
Did... he just kill that scientistß
why do you bother listening to him?
so Shizuka, i have not been payiong attention, why does gordan go on a massive killing spree in half-life/blackmesa?
Lonko: that was a minute ago
I know it's a bad habit but...dammit.
sorry :p
I HAVE NEW TOY-heavy Wepons
Why did he do that?
85% of statistics are just made up on the spot
You know, physics is the STUDY of physical forces and interactions, and as such requires math in order to accurately describe them.
00,02i'm yet to meet someone who could outsmart gluon
Ingwaz: machinery is engineering.
ill stop
13i feel like impulse 101ing to get mah squishy back
All of his logic is weak and he is incapable of listening to arguments and...you know what, you're right.
Why do I even bother?
twilight_sprinkle: and that machine is made using math and i'm betting requires math to find out what direction that partical is going
So, while physical forces and such exist without math, you need math in order to describe them and make predictions about them.
Lonko for one, Shizuka is a girl. Two, you're laggin'. refresh. Three, yes she did.
don't feed the parasprites, as well as the ignorant
squishy will be back
so is black mesa the whole episode 1?
Reikim|GW2: lol its not bullshit. physics Exists without math, but math is certainly very useful
/me laughs and leaves
yes
Canadian_Brony: He = Gordon Freeman
he about got blasted
Canadian_Brony: He ain't named Gordette
another white cop
This medieval alchemist can bullshit himself.
Ingwaz: it doesnt actually. you just need a material that displays the path of the particle
twilight_sprinkle: What. Would you be left with. If you took the math out of physics?
00,10Hi Kilner
The Scientists. They all sound the same
run science dude
Just need to get one question answered...
HE WILL KILL US ALL KILL US ALL KILL US ALL KILL US ALL
Reikim|GW2: physics is laws of nature, it doesnt need math to exist. math helps understand it
00,10but HEV dont have helm
twilight_sprinkle: i'm betting math is involved in its operation at some point, if not by the operator, by the machine itself, or in realizing what the result is
twilight_sprinkle: You fail to answer the question. Good night now.
13logic kids
Lol
13working on the ultra secret
why do they make gordon do all of this crazy stuff
13and they don't have spare HEVs
Ingwaz: it isnt. you can find the popularity of the magnets, the track of the particle, all without using math
00,10they had two spares over in sector C
00,02Shizuka, do they have ANY other hev's anywhere?
Seriously though, that's not supposed to happene :p
Reikim|GW2: i answered it.
i guess i won the duel
ShiningDawn: Because he's survived everything else to this point, so he's reasonably the only guy who can do this.
13i'm glad he has his old sidearm...?
Phase4: yeah 1 more at the very end haha
13BITCH I GOT A SQUISHY
Reikim|GW2: in other words, physics is perfectly intact without math.
twilight_sprinkle: No you didn't. You gave me something tangentially related that didn't actually answer the question.
00,10presumably 2 othr guys like gordon are out there
haha
yeah i gess you are right
yay squishy
Phase4 well there a 3 HEV's lockers on the start but we never see the others

SQUISHY IS BACK YAY
Reikim|GW2: you aksed me what is left. im saying everything is left.
yay for Lord Squishy!
Reikim|GW2: math just helps us understand it
alright, so, for argument sake twilight_sprinkle, what would you get if you used absolutely no math at all when finding its direction, give me an example of a potential result you could get
00,10O2 coolent

how long is a ban anyway
and iirc you got asked to change your name
fluttershyFTW: hes still here
oh
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Because who doesn't love a dictatorship
So I got banned because some guy with power hates my name
twilight_sprinkle: i'm betting that that the ability to derive such things, some of them relied on math at first in order to figure out how it worked
Guy?
i have one of the worst timings
twilight_sprinkle: Physics as a science is the study of Nature. So is Chemistry. So is Biology. So is, to an extent, Psychology. Yes, Nature itself would exist without them. But our understanding of Nature, our ability to comprehend them...well, it would be nil. That is science. Thus, with that definition of the term "Physics", we may say with complete certainty that it is enriched by math and that math is essential for deep and
Lonko no one is forcing you to use the chat, obey the rules or don't use it
Ingwaz: it doesnt, it can all be done just by observing interactions with materials
Lonko it's like that everywhere
no squishy?

weird how i hate science but i love psychology
And that's without even bringing logic into the equation.

Now I want to know why he said I had to change the username
Oh my god, he's a physics/engineering major.
fluttershyFTW: Draw. :I
HE?
You'd think he'd be a little more loving of math.
fin draw
twilight_sprinkle: is psychology a college or university course?
fine*
Didn't he mention he hates math earlier?
well look who it is
where is Shizuka now?
twilight_sprinkle: Sorry, but from what I'm seen, you're pushing a bad argument.
fluttershyFTW: YAY! :$
AJIsAwesome: Do you think I know peoples genders
13Lolicon: Change your nick.
:)
lol
why must he change his name shizuka
DocSane: and fyi i already agreed with Reikim if considering phyics just a study. but id appreciate if you would keep your groundless claims like "youre wrong" without proof to yourself. kthxbai
watch it be soemthing equally as bad
Lolicon: Your nick is inappropriate. It is a reference to child pornography. The fact that I have to point this out to you, or anyone for that matter, is depressing. Just change it and spare us the grief.
13Because it is a wholly inappropriate term.
^
oh ic
you know he left already
twilight_sprinkle: I didn't say "you're wrong". I said "you are inexact". You were defining "Physics" as "Nature". This is technically inaccurate. That's all I said.
wait lolicon is child pornography O_O
EWWWWWWWWWWW
Reikim: You should never enter a japanese toy store, lol
da fuq
Reikim: i didnt say you said you were wrong, that other guy did
fluttershyFTW: Yes, unfortunately.
no, it isn't
Reikim: No, *I* said his argument was wrong.
fluttershyFTW: it refers to a type of drawn child pornography in general, so yes
oh for fucks sake..
13Look who's cruising for a ban.
Reikim: but if defining physics as a study in itself, then i agree 100%
twilight_sprinkle: Oh my bad, skimmed that badly. Yeah, go right ahead. Don't mind me. 'Tis late and I just expended all my logical powers for the night...
sigh
0,14...so you still haven't changed your name, eh?
not cp
13LOLICON: I will not warn you again.
fluttershyFTW: Technially, it's a reference to it.
how do u know that its a porno
Reikim: mkay lol
ShiningDawn: this is the internet, you need brain bleach here
Shizuka: What in the actual fuck are you trying to prove
Loli does not automatically mean porn.
...
shizu is putting the smack down
.........
wow
LOLICON lol bye bye
bye bye LOLICON
13That by telling you to change your nick, it does not mean change it to caps lock.
Und than Shizu chokes a bitch. YEAH.a
ShiningDawn . . . they taught someweird shit in grade 7
bye
13Change your nick or leave.

Boolean logic does, after all, form the basis for computer architecture. And Aristotelian logic formed the basis for that.
have mercy!
^relic from an older age
fluttershyFTW: i dont think it s lost i think i wasnt taught
The people who haven't responded are simply in shock.
pretty much depends on the teacher
brb gona watch rvb
oh, I miss when noallcaps would be muttered every instance of any more than 2 words capsed out

All right.
ah yes, a time where bumtasing and candybars roamed the earth
some of them do it all theory and leave the practic up to you
superretroworld: well it was rediscovered in the renaissance
others is the other way arounds
Sounds like every single teacher from high school onwards.
or tuna
Or dead
So, exactly as expected.
oh
All right then.

or whatever that maceral was
Okay, time for the Daily Show. Night, all.

However there is ONE that is true

Shizuka: wait you are there already?
AJIsAwesome: hmm maybe,trying to make him perhaps some form of Sketch so i figured his past life or experiences involving a changeling physically or mentally were a Facade hence the name though Epigon/Epigone kinda reminds me of Espionage like a spy or sleeper agent,etc.
yeah it starts to lag really bad at 20 fps
Noob709 it's fine too
my body is regi

Well, you'll need to google for the translation patch. then, you'll need to purchase a flashcart. There's usually not more than 20$.
New, waxing, quarter, half, full, half, quarter, waning, new.

waxing: getting more waning: getting less
I will defenitely remember that

Fraggle Rock is some of Jim Henson's best work.

The lady bugs don't know squinking but they know to dance to a song about it.
weeping_pegasi82: because you can't look away
13i'm pretty sure you shouldn't squink in public
00,10Sounds like something on dose in the bathroom
13i think you can be arrested for that in most states
Shizuka: since when is equestria a state?
squink sounds like something naughty
/me only has one squink in him officer
13RUN KID

But I REALLLLLYYYYY wanted to mess with the fabric of space-time :(
2,14 Rush Limbaugh comment: "Never before has the Republican party been so pink"
this play could be improvd by a pony eating fly trap

13i think heathspikes are banned in four states
emantrollslayer: I'm not wearing pants...
Imminent Chaos? Have a Tea Party!!!
Spectrum_Rush: Heatspike actually

13lots and lots of drugs
otakon: shorts, portmanteau for short pants....
The tea is made with a secret recipe. 4 parts Moonshine, 1 part tea
emantrollslayer: still not called pants anymore

I wish I was high
DECIDED TO PLAY THIS
2,14 FiM needs to have a villain that sends them into another dimension, where they interact with their pre-g4 versions
13not as good as alpine hue
No wonder they are so happy about it!
pony_4430: Caramel did

Caramel: A BUNCH
13all unicorns have their horn sticking out of their nose
Now where is the fic where Adventure Time gets mixed with MLP?
Whistle Thistle: Played by Kenny Baker
WHAT
Dragon Quest is actually directly based off a Gen 1 episode
Slenderman: G3.5 actually and yes
Caramel: no wonder you still use the name "Caramel" if you dont pay attention to fanfics
XAX: cool
2,14 otakon: false
oh god
2,14 this is G3
13nothing is impossible! except exceeding the speed of light!
I can't even hear this
XAX O.O
Generation 3.5.... Celestia help us all
2,14 G3.5 is the more chibi version
all i can do for gen 4 is watch the desktop pony or link pictures ;_;
Caramel: thanks for the correction
2,14 with G3.6 being newborn cutie version of 3.5

pony_4430: the curse of the earlier MLP, it was girl with no conflict of any kind or personalities
2,14 you have to hand it to these actors though. Their legs must be sore as hell
I think my dick size went down a little bit just from watching this
I hate that crack in their voice...
PillowFluff: sadly this is real
best lyrics ever: "yum yum yum yum yum yum yummy yum yum yum yum" fucking literary genious right there
Caramel: isn't it like and hour and a half long?

2,14 simple leg moves of the ponies mean giant kicks from the actors
is it bad that i hum along to some of these songs?
pony_4430: Touche
otakon: I'm flat-ironing my hair
weeping_pegasi82: I'm gonna start lweeping now I think
PillowFluff: oh

Why would you let your Richard Nixon out in public?
I'd better get out of this theatre!
otakon: Wasn't that bad. Now if it were in the middle of my hand I'd be screaming
Caramel: what if you have a pet pony named richard? >:

otakon: Four-foot-eleven
pony_4430: I'm not dressed like one you pu these clothes on me.
/me dumps the tea "I'm not amused."
PillowFluff: damn your shorter than Meanwhile the shortest brit I know.

CHINA?

NocturnalBlade: RUN

otakon: I know. He's laughed at that little fact. >.>

Slenderman: You should get that checked out.
PillowFluff: he gets very short when that's brought up.
What. The. FUCK?
NocturnalBlade: Because he is behind it
2,14 NocturnalBlade: maybe because Caramel is sleeping in the corner?
Shizuka: Getting Borderlands 2?
13nope
13broke
NocturnalBlade: bc of Caramel on the corner and Caramel loves to feed off of our tears
Caramel: that could be it XD
2,14 plus I love this vid :P
Shizuka: a'wwww
13besides
Mods be paraspriting
otakon: I see what you did there.
13borderlands 1 is BOOOOOORIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
Shizuka: See that door over there?
PillowFluff: yeah took me some thinking at lenght to come up with that.
Caramel: Tell Princess Luna to kill the with fire. Or go call Twilight to kill them with science.
Shizuka: the second one is not
Shizuka: your the only one keeping me sane
/me slaps NocturnalBlade with a brain "How do you not see the sleeping pony to see know who is streaming?
ALRIGHT PONIES
68.232.163.125:27015

pony_4430: what is that?
that ip
oh
Zzz...
13but i already do
Shizuka: Okay, now go put this helmet on and jump in this cannon...
pony_4430: What's that code? A hack?
pony_4430: sorry man but that's advertising
otakon: Okay I get it. I'm an Oompa-Loompa in the chat. Two short jokes are the limit
2,14 here's a thought: before advertising something like that, clear it with the mods first
Slenderman: it's an IP address for a server
PillowFluff: i knew who it was thats why i said it XD
It's not for my server
lol
00,10what an unusealy long IP address
2,14 given, you know, that thing we call the rules
13Sumica: includes port :3
00,10for a tf2 server
that's because it has a port on it
This shit right here is why people think bronies are gay/pedos...
you put that into tf2
13:27015 is source's default port
PillowFluff: oh no not you, Meanwhile...well both of you just this once
darling I hate the word
Sumica: What shizu said.
Why is Rarity dressed as Rainbow Dash?
weeping_pegasi82: me too now
13in any case
Eddmario: bc that IS Rainbow Dash
13don't advertise
Look ban or kick me if you honestly think that's hurting someone
00,10it's also not needed if it's the defalt
And why is one of the Kanker sisters dressed as Scootaloo and singing?
I need G4 pony therapy... I wish I had a pony plushy right now.
I don't care I'm advertising to get some bronies on a tf2 server so 68.232.163.125:27015 Comes join if you want
Tf2 2fort
............
is that scootaloo? I can't tell EVERYTHINGS PINK!!
Lol
pony_4430: relax man, they're just giving you the heads up is all. All you have to do is clear it with a mod first next time.
gg
otakon: Lolol very funny. I have had two of my friends sing the Oompa Loompa song on me
dat ban
This is like some bad GMOD video turned into a reality...
probably not banned
inb4 I'm proven wrong
Kinda creepy how accurate the lipsync is...
otakon: No, that's a ban

So, why am I here again?

VenHur: Po po po po po POWAH!
Sumica: my god, i hear it
VenHur: him and michael bay
Sumica: oh goddammit so do I
There's no way these are people in suits. They're obviously robots. And holy shit, that's Mayor Mare as Rarity!
Even that baby doesn't want to see this abomination. :D
smush the cakes
Eddmario: tabitha St. Germain worked on G3, 3.5 and 3.6
Tabitha WHY DID YOU WASTE YOU TALENT ON THIS?
Wait... so this show is for... Generation 4?
Alright, there's booze and drugs in the Spike room. Come join if you wanna keep yourself from suiciding
There was a G3.6?

VenHur: Babies
Slenderman: heaven's no!
...Oh yeah... [shrudders]

Unicorina...aren't you glad G4 has better names than this (Canterlot, Equestria, etc.)?
otakon: Mayer Mare has the same VA as G4 Spike though
But the names...
/me growls
/me dies from saying that name and comes back to life
00,10supprised no one has caught on to wisteria being Tabitha St. Germain
Eddmario: hmmm
Sumica: She's just that good
Fuck me sideways i'm going to sleep... -__-

Except where you did all that crap in the Rainbow movie not-Rarity

er...
Well...it's G4...so it's SLIGHTLY better...
The way she said grand
00,10frankly the g3 ones are better then this
...Still, we need Terry Crews to give those terrible scirpts some POWER!!!!
that's Twi from the future, you can tell because her butt is sagging
definitely
their mouth moved, and their back legs were better
kirz|art: ha!
oh yea they sing some songs here and change some of the lyrics :<
hi manny

And the gate raises above the stage so you can't see the back legs
that was the only G3 thing that made me .. uneasy (?) ...

TheMaster: well this is official, so for kids probably
oh okay.
I guess thats better
I crying at this now...they don't have a taco stand...
but then that awkward moment when audience is all adult
mfw i thought this was in a mall
that must be really unpleasant to be in though. people arn't meant to be in that position
not since we were monkies anyway
Calgary Stampede I think
That's one place where they had this thing
yeah, i feel sorry for the actors, tis a tough crowd
its amazing they can coordinate though, how do they even see?
Twi is starting to deflate
Alberta, Canada is the location
season 3 had better start soon, lest the fandom lose its marbles even more
how Do they see in those things
hey guys whats go...........AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I think Justin Bieber was behind all of this...
Mr Krabs is behind this...
TheMaster: If we don't hear anything this week I bet they'll announce it at Canterlot Gardens
Modeabel: this
So one or two weeks? They couldn't possibly wait that much longer...right?
Caramelsponge bib?
inb4 season starts in december
While you were just standing there?
Caramel Sponge bob?
they got to the gala quite fast...
...Maybe they teleported...
...Or maybe they got there a Sonic Rainboom secound...
people actually paid to see balloons jump around while a recording plays
DaringDoo: Well it was one thing at whatever this park is so they didn't pay just for that
good
Spy: That was unfortunate.
DaringDoo: Actually this was at a rodeo in Canada
... [sigh] ...It's...over...
More high kick
...But...WHERE THE HECK ARE THE OTHERS?
2,14 this next video is what your minds are like right now

derpy.me﻿/crbPY
Oh Luna, not THIS again...
well the attack in libya happened at a consulate, not the embassy
nah, my mind is far more blank than this right now
At least it's not PONIES: The Anthology...
yaaaay, im ok with this!

00,10your ability to not realise it's one guy is not very good.

I know it's 1 guy, but I wanna know how he faked it so well
oh god, not That 70s show...
terrible theme, terrible show
i loved that 70's show
00,10it's not that well, you can see the color diffrence in the couch

TheMaster: I saw a few full episodes when it was still airing. Had no idea what the fuck was going on the entire time

Plus the theme is terrible
Isn't True Blood supposed to be Twiligh for guys?

So I was thinking, maybe my cat carried it there, but why? Did she think it was another of her kittens? Is that what kittens look like to their mothers? Measuring cups? I dunno, but I put it closer to her and sh
e started purring. I guess the measuring cup was hungry...?"

Eeyup
Umm, its called rooms
I think Ive heard of that one
My god Gold_Demona.
Wut Jmo :P
Ive been using IrcDroid
Dat Kerbal.
:D
My poops smell like vegetables today
look thar, unicorns!
http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/47855/forest-rarity-shani-hyena-twilight_sparkle
Phase4's fault. He infested my brain with Kerbals.
Got to be kidding me
Try IrcDroid Suinide
So good, but yet scary.
It might work better for you
Two things at once is just too much or this
This is the first really GOOD drawing I've done in a VERY long time. I'm loving this. :D
so it turns out i can't even launch the KSP demo
somethings up with my computer
:\
Aww :C
Ill check it out later
ok
time to curse the gods, i'd say
Meh
I've pooped many times today.
I think this may be working now
Gotta go check mah email
k
only thing else i can get it on is my mac, and my mac hates gaming
Irc can be wierd
macs usually do
As much as I love my mac, it is not a gaming platform. =/
That's what I have my PC for. :P
?
Doing alright thanks, yourself?
Im alright, todays hopefully gonna be a good day
trying to keep this place going :P
Borderlands 2 comes out :3 i loved the first one
Hehe
http://news.sky.com/story/986584/two-policewomen-killed-in-manchester-shooting
chat is ded
that site has one of the worst and most obnoxious layouts ever
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-7RlL3YtiQ
this was bound to happen sooner or later, police cuts and failing to equip them properly to combat these increasing instances
you WILL want
well duh
haven't I been saying how stupid it is for police to not be allowed guns?
there is absolutely no possible way that you couldnt want
I dunno but if you did I agree
yeah I did
and people like Articuno kept arguing against me
Telling me it sent me something when it hasnt
it's bad in the UK, our police are virtually powerless nowadays without being criticised from all sides whatever they do
criminals don't follow laws, it's that simple, so making guns illegal is stupid
I would rather have FLUDD :$
:/
like with Raoul Moat, I think the police were going to be investigated for using hi-power taser guns to apprehend him
whats that?
:O
our officers are still using batons and cuffs fgs, people like Moat and that guy in Manchester have god knows what guns, the latter grenades
You don't what FLUDD is?
Hmm. What are you doing at the moment kimo
yeah
Super Mario Sunshine, my friend.
I have two sims that are stuck cuddling in the hot tub and they won't do anything :c
"Stupid cop pulled me over for speeding" well if you were speeding, that's your fault...
never cared much for that guy
Maybe I'll try making them tired o:
yeah
youtube :P
I don't really watch tv these days
and probably going to make breakfast soon
How long have you been awake?
and chat is ded again
me? umm an hour?
I'm coloring my Kerbal. :3
I made them very tired and they're still just sitting there >.<
Yeah you. Okie, just wonderin
yup
FLUDD is the Flash Liquidizer...thingy...
Hehe sheep
hey
2-1 buy
Hiya
2-2 jailbreak
We talking of Sunshine
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
yep
STAY AWAY FROM THE BEST PONI THING
hmm?
I love that Fludd could kill Mario if he leaned his head back wrong
I like Sunshine more than 64 or Galaxy.
http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/3/3e/FLUDD.jpg/180px-FLUDD.jpg
I think it is Galaxy>Galaxy 2>Sunshine>64
I don't know, maybe because it's more overlooked than the other games...
Galaxy, Sunshine, 64.
I LOVE Sunshine.
THEY MOVED
what...?
I liked Sunshine alot, had the best bosses in a Mario game I believe
And the fact that the water effects at the time were so stunning.
Oh, definitely.
THEY MOVED
I <3 Gamecube water effects
Though the 100% ending is NOT worth it.
And now they're not moving again
The other ending was better
Suddently, the Nintendo logo.
Hi Nintendo logo, wish I knew which game that was from, I am thinking Goldeneye
Actually, the normal nding could be a sequel to Super Mario Sunshine 2.
ohhhh
...Wait, are we're watching the Pokemon the...
Suddenly the 4kids logo.
I thought so.
And I lost interest.
Please P2K
Holy fuck
yes
ohgod, 4kids
yeah but why do you need new ones if the old ones are the same
Yes! This movie!
Nice job scaring me brony state.
Best Pokemon movie
Is htis Scoots!
btw, the image is laggy
It's 4kids. I'm out. Enjoy. :P
Bye Lasharus
What movie is this
4Kids did great with Pokemon
4Kids did great with nothing.
4kids: The GOOD version.
They did acceptable. They didn't do great anywhere. Except at butchery.
They did good with Pokemon, I stand by that
...Is this a film?
Yes.
Actually, TMNT 2003 is the other great thing they doned.
i have to go everypony
Yeah dair. It's the second Pok?mon movie
i came in at a good time
dair*
Gold_Demona: yep
hello everypony
Bye, Maid_RainBow :)
MORE POKEMONZ
huh?
POKEMAANZ
Hi, Snow :)
Bye everyone listening to TCR while playing Binding of isaac
hello everyone
like what?
Hiyo yuki
omg 2000!
Hi, yuki :)
How to type :>
wasnt this supposed to be on friday?
TYPE HOW DO IT!? :O
No.
^
Wont send me an email so i can register a nickname
I mean the dub is fine and to be honest, not much to cut in Pokemon
To download everything would come in at about 165GB
They're moving but they're not doing anything I tell them, they're just cuddling and looking around >.<
mitamaking, onigiri
oh I can help you with that
Kandarihu: oh come on, it's a donut
Fair enough I suppose mitamaking.
Japanese signs, musicless scenes.
lol dat donut
Can?
yuki: iseewhatyoudidthere.
which nickname are you trying to register?
Most of what 4kids has done from what I've seen just makes me want to end the company.
I've never heard of a rice donut, but ok. :P
But then I'm a cynic. :P
This pokemon movie theme is awesome
oh hey Snow
mitamaking, it's NOT A DOUGHNUT! It's tightly packed rice with seaweed lining!
Now Yu-gi-oh, wow
That was a bad dub
Sonic X.
I LOVE Rice balls. :$
The original was pretty shit to begin with, but ye GODS.
I loved the anime, despite its flaws and cheesyness (Here lookin' at 'ya, Team Rocket...), but when Misty left, that's where I called it quitted.
hey i made these donuts!
I like most 4Kids themes too, I know the obvious exception
Mew Mew Power, Shaman King, Sonic X, Kirby
Same here VenHur
Uhh its a secret
arbok evolves into seviper! duh!
And One Piece.
Kirby was fun
can you PM me?
yuki: I remember that. :D
Not this one
Shaman King's theme is one of my favorite movies
They BUTCHERED One Piece so much.
Put it this way mitamaking. The only good thing they did with Sonic X is that they hired Mike Pollock as VA for Dr. Eggman/Robotnik. At least HE was talented. :P
DONT START ABOUT ONE PIECE
One Piece's Theme was freaking awesome...
do you have Suinide registered?
I pose
Angel!
00,02dat pokemon 2k
I dont know, dont think so
Despite I hate rap...
VenHur: Well, the unused english one was.
quick everyone abduct her because her script will not allow it!
hi
13ohai :3
13D:
THIS THEME!!!! OMG LOVE IT!
i can play the lugia song on guitar
me on keyboard :D
The Power of One(with Misty's help)
Lasharus: And he's the voice of Eggman in the games to this day.
I know VenHur.
...God DAMN that guitar solo!
serious pikachu
They actually got him to say Snooping As Usual, i See. :D
Oh man I miss these dub voices so much, the new ones stink
dem Orange Islands
shiz about to go down
wow the voices sound so kid-like
mitamaking: Actually, Gen 5 is pretty good.
You don't know a lot of guitars in the Pokemon comunity...
I mean...never mind...
wuts this?
I'm a bona fide Robotnik fanboy VenHur. The only good thing they did with Sonic X's voice cast is Mike Pollock. Sadly, SEGA also hired the rest of the cast. Which... was a shame.
Season 2 theme
I really would've liked the Japanese music. :$
PKMN Y2K.
We all live in a Pokemon word
so is this a movie?
/me dances to the music
Such a true line in 2000
Yes Barbetos. It's the second Pok?mon movie
Snow: how do you do that?
Tracy always made me want to be an arist.
é Alt 130
yuki you type /me followed by what you do.
yuki: /me
/me gets it now and thanks you 2
I know that because of pokémon
Pikachu?
/me thumbs up yuki.
is the the first movie?
Wut, ANOTHER Pokemon movie? *mutes*
So many haters
dem magicarps.
First movie had vikings, Ryunosuke.
from minesota right?
incoming Minnesota jokes.
EspyLacopa: I thought they all lived in Minnesota
I'm not interested enough in Pokémon, but I'm not about to hate on it for no particular reason.
I'll just... you know, not watch :P
hence why I asked :p
AJIsAwesome: ;)
inb4 storm
mitamaking: :P
You beat me by a second
It's a Loogie!
LOOGIEJA
Youdon'tsay.jpg
Yeah funny how they screwed up with Lugia later on
I need to idle, cooking
Bai
I am really not in the mood I guess right now, love the movie though
.
DAT PUN
lol dem bad puns
puns everywhere
IT HURTS
Team Rocket, you must call upon the sea ponies!
hki

*hi
EspyLacopa, I may have to punch you for that.
Mime mime mime mime

inb4 diglets
Yes.
Are you a boy or a girl?
:D
Sea Ponies are always referenced.
>has to take the test on paper and computer
Clearly.
what is the name of my grandson again?
o.o
I hate AP Psych still
lol Iseewutyoudidthere yuki
I'll just go back to turning on some music so it doesn't get stuck in my brain :P
yuki: Gary
She expects us to get everything done in 5 minutes
I'm Red!
:<
I've always wanted to see Aurora Lights IRL.
wat i told you guys
Gold_Demona: oh i thought it was assballs
I don't work that way
diglets
triotriotrio
SO MANY DIGLETS
I need to take my time
yuki: No, it's Gary Motherfuckin Oak. :D
Nah, Prof's grandson is named Blue.
the pokemon sense shits about to go down
Gary wuz here. Ash iz a loser.
Probably won'y eve
actually his name is green
That's in the games, Espy. :P
Blue/Green same thing
won't even bother taking the AP thing at the end if the year
I found those masks funny instead of intimidating. :D
Blue, green, it's all the same to them wacky japanese.
that's what my friend did for physics
lolled
he knew he wouldn't pass so he didn't waste the money
neck cracking
well
ouch, dem neck cracks
W00T!
...................
do you pay for AP classes ahead of time?
The world shall fall to ash!
the tests you mean?
You're too close to my face.............
Did get out of the camera!
or not until the final
you pay for them like, maybe a month ahead
you can't drive, it's too misty
if the test is in May you pay in April
or something
yuki: Boo.................
O.o
k
HE GOT KISSED
Now THAT's a tradition!
AJIsAwesome: boo too :3
BURN!!!!!!!!!
my friend takes all honors classes and just barely got a 3 on her AP Psych one
Ohai :)
Oh pokemon :)
Hi, MaxTheBrony :)
That guy's costume reminds me of those bird people from World of Warcraft.
So much romantic tension between Ash and Misty, and they NEVER HOOK UP! WTF?!
:[
hi MaxTheBrony
I am not in any smart classes
Gold_Demona: Because they're too young.
Hiyo MaxTheBrony
And for japanese, that's saying something.
EspyLacopa: So? It's an anime.
Heya AJIsAwesome And yuki and Gold_Demona :)
Gold_Demona: its by 4kids, what you expect?
because ash is permanently 10 and also dumb shonen hero
EspyLacopa: I've seen anime where YOUNGER kids hook up.
"crabbies" :S
Also, Status Quo must be maintained! STATUS QUOOOOOO
Because Ash is in love with Pikachu.
Snow: 4kids didn't make the series. They only dubbed it
SHe has "crabbies"? :S
O.o
its zelda
Gold_Demona: Like that's stopped 4kids from butchering shows.
i can play this, on my keyboard :D
Youdon'tsay.jpg
Gold_Demona: Are you familiar with what 4kids did to One Piece?
"you played the song of storms!"
never say the words 4kids and one piece again
it must never be discussed
EspyLacopa: Yes, but that was long after they stopped doing pok?mon, which they did decently.
"Poison Suction" :D
or have been
*snicker*
The hammer pistol.
EspyLacopa: Except for a few cuts and censors, they never cut out major plot points.
i guess you could say he's a lucky ducky
TheMaster: ? i dont such thing as one piece dubbed by 4kids.
HA
dont know*
Never cut major plot points. HA>
they cut out a enormous section of the plot. all so they could get to chopper quicker
EspyLacopa: Baloom. :|
(is sarcastic)
wat
They cut out Baloom. :|
"who needs laboon"
wut?
Poor Brooke.
*Laboon
Haha misty is jealous
"get me a boner and im ready!" O.o
Stupid ash.
i heard that.
Snow: :D
Someone get this Ash a shotgun.
what a odd search in youtube
What?!
lets watch one piece!
Aw
Aw, man. :(
oh man!
Aww, ok
Do one of the one piece movies!
Some one picked pokemon as a movie though XD
How about Funimation One Piece?
should do the most recent one piece movie
Gold_Demona: Funimation One PIece is good thouhg.
Not great, but very good.
...Lol
Oh god this
strong world is the best one piece movie, should watch that
XD
I actually watch the dubs of One Piece. :$
PINGAS
CILIT BANG
They're not that bad.
Also i tried the actual water from that commercial they are surprisingly good
Krillin is best liar, AJIsAwesome.
krillin is best space duck
Robotnick!
EspyLacopa: Everyone knows that. :P
so clearly I would do worse
mama luigi
Anyways, class gtg
EspyLacopa, that's spelled "Robotnik"
Why does eveyone add in a c there?
*shrug*
:D
PINGAS
XD
what is this, I have just returned
AJIsAwesome - I may just slap you. :P
Lasharus: :P
but...what exactly happend to the movie?
Sad news everyone. The dramatic look gopher is dead.
Which one?
it died
:(
:'( Nooo, he was a hero
can't do movies from the movie lotto list
XD
TheMaster We need people to pick the movie so we can get a higher chance of getting it picked
oh god
strong world?
So no Grave of the Fireflies until I get chosen for A Movie.
plus nobody would understand what was going on.
...
You say this as though anyone understands what is being shown -right now-
It's YouTube style randomosity.
Snow: why are we still watching this again?
Asking 'what is going on' is the wrong question.
You're a dead motherfucker.
well most of us have seen toy story before. I doubt most of the bronystate viewers have watched one piece or other animes
Akira would be good though
Personally, I'd ask 'why in the limitless hells do people still make this tripe?' but then I'm a cynical bastard.

DaringDerpy: I mean when they started in september they would air about 11-12 episodes till december
racism is boring...is this show about anything else too?
mostly commentary on black culture
yes, Alchemist, true.
what about?
here in the city black culture is mostly about selling illegal chemicals
the village collects money and sends a young man to europe, we he gets into the asylum process...this process can take a few years, lots of time to sell street drugs and send money back to the village
+re

Lo MadSurge.

MadSurge: I did not.
O.o

o lol this vid
Meanwhile: you just type "mustache" during a match and bam, all zombies have mustaches :D
DaringDerpy, it's a case of double jeopardy then. Respond and be known for trollbait. Ignore it and silence will stand as a confession for whatever reprehensible thing she stands accused of.
MadSurge: x]
And you get an achievement too :D
Kandarihu|OldComp: either way, she loses
MadSurge, and that's not fair.
NOOO, GORDON FREEMAN

who cares about accusations? she could has just blocked the number. but she even went back to the phone to tell him she's not barbara
DaringDerpy, maybe she's waiting for an important phone call.

Heya Lil_B
Kandarihu|OldComp: If they succeed they might finally figure Omega out.
Hello Lil_B
hey
I guess ponies already assimilated more than the Borg
thanks MLP_Brovakiin|Away Obsidian and Applejack2011 :)
discordx2...
mother of god
Tervicz, the Borg can't assimilate what the ponies have.
nice find wrek
it is so annoying to see those ads everywhere. I know they need some money, but on some pages it is too much - for example those huge adds about viagra on one news page :S
clap clap

I don't mind dubstep

wubstep =/= Dubstep?
It's my choice if I'm gonna Listen to it or not :/
I don't mind wubestdubstep
I agree some sites have way too much advertising
Holla everypony! :)

The heck is this video?
Apparently shift clicking the mailbox and selecting kid gets an A+ makes the school bus just drive by without stopping and the selected kid automatically has an A+... I did that and all I got was the bus driving by, no A+

I had the kids playing chess for a whole day once cuz I kept dragging up on their need bars so they never stopped xD
pokemon emerald yes
G1 is...meh. But I have to agree, the villains were great...
Snow: Have you seen Ballad of the Brony?
G1 was good for its time
is on my to watch list
AJIsAwesome, G2 only includes the Friendship Gardens game.
the need to play chess?
thats the same as saying tetris was a shitty game when it was brought out
is anyone interested to play my game?
Kandarihu|OldComp: Friendship Gardens game?
...And let us not forget the...Sea Ponies...
ponymon?
?
yes thats me
shoo be doo
Sea ponies ^^
oh for the love of...there's actually a band out there called "Murder By Death"
serious?
yu
*yup
....
Interesting. :S
why did they play chess all day?
RAWRity: always remember kids: if you can still decipher the bandname in the logo, it's nut brutal enough
I kept dragging up their need bars so they never got tired or hungry or had to go to the bathroom
so do any of you guys know a good fim fanfic?
One time, I was in an airport waiting for my airplane, and the guy next to me was talking on the phone with a bluetooth headset. It was a cool sight.
Journey to my imagination
i reccomend it

Ohh ok
Snow: Synopsis, please?

Snow: A description.

I recommend The truth about Pokey Pierce

Hmm, sounds interesting!

\did anyone killed a red spy on the way here?
no?
then we still have a problem
yeah
and a knife
If FiM ends, I'd expect to see a 4.5 that caters exclusively to brony audiences. And it would only make sense if FiM fails to perform well with their core demographic.
Ohohoo
Big problem, i kill pleanty of spies

I'd also expect bronies to react poorly to a darker and edgier 4.5, and beg Hasbro to bring back G4.
No offence
boondocks?
if you killed them i assure you they were NOT like me, and nothing, NOTHING like the man loose inside this building
Yay I unstuck them
14how goes?
I hope for an epic 4.5
Kandarihu|OldComp: I actually wouldn't mind a darker gen 4 if they made it.
