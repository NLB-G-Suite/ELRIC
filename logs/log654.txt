12[12:22] <%drf-Droid> "does anybody in here kill people for money?"
00,02fluttershyFTW, ...
it is, but hysics isnt math, its physics
The proper grammer is "I am"
but its not math
I really don't understand the point of imaginary numbers. I mean, the concept and problems aren't that hard, but there is literally no ue for it.
Depends on the money
math is artificial, whereas physics isnt
j
jk*
00,02twilight_sprinkle, theres portions of it that are not math but they are minor
is*
12a lot of money
12like
And we live in a 3-D world
121 penny
is anybody here in psychology?
00,02Every major's terrible!

00,02wait, did i just hear a faith plate
the Every Major's Terrible

?
grey man O_o
epic battle
eeaughyeamaybeokay
00,02ah
Hooray for TS defending an indefensible position. Again.
not the gun
Freely ignores good questions when he feels like it.
hive*
00,02twilight_sprinkle, they are not equal, its just that physics is for the most part a bunch of math
wut ?
shoot him
Without Math!
e.g., to find the direction of a particle in an electro-magnetic field doesnt require math
rofl
haha
sure you are
thats the scientific method
draw straws
and I'm on the coast of Alaska
hes gonna die
...
00,02moar faith plate noise
yay~ just finish my awesome pic,KR Wizard+Twilight and EoH :$
/me has still yet to get an answer
nods in agreement
He's claiming that math is not necessary for physics.
lol, i do enjoy how whoever is playing nods or shakes their head when appropriate
challenge accepted
Basically, he's doing the whole "this thing is superior" argument.
no
physics is just applied math
...
00,02Sumica, probably, i've not played through hl1
/me drinks tea
The vacuum cleaner!
00,02i meen i got most of the way through many years ago but cant remember
reclaimed!
nodding
*logs
Exactly.
use it on him
He claims it isn't.
dat gun
no
His attituse is basically that physics is superior to math and can exist without it.
00,02i'ma fireing my lazors
yea
no
he fired a laser
00,10killed it
00,02yeah, i fired my lazors
go figure
waiting*
...
:Dnodding
And he treats everyone else with such goddamn disdain.
amiright?
or amiright?
13altfire is making my hand do that
/me blocks

/me waits
00,10Dickfreeman
then why get him going ?
:D
That's terrible! :D
I need a Rarity duckface emote
;)
He literally hunts for reasons to act superior.
/me shoves an apple into otakon's mouth
Did... he just kill that scientistß
why do you bother listening to him?
I know it's a bad habit but...dammit.
sorry :p
Why did he do that?
85% of statistics are just made up on the spot
You know, physics is the STUDY of physical forces and interactions, and as such requires math in order to accurately describe them.
ill stop
Why do I even bother?
/me laughs and leaves
yes
he about got blasted

there is absolutely no possible way that you couldnt want
I dunno but if you did I agree

Telling me it sent me something when it hasnt
it's bad in the UK, our police are virtually powerless nowadays without being criticised from all sides whatever they do
I would rather have FLUDD :$
