.
^
:P
Wait, which day are we talking about? :p
THAT day.
Was someone playing Brodyquest/Pinkiequest just now?
?
Tier 1 is highest
Rainbow Dash Tier is highest, Fluttershy Tier is lowest
and lowest?
Uh.. tier?
Tier 5 is lowest
lol
^
It is large and smells of peches
Peaches*
2 and 1?
Now I'm curious about how you came to that conclusion, but I'm not entirely sure I want to know.
The latter.
Latter, but I'm curious.
who wants to see my haircut?
I disagree, but I'll leave it at that. :)
And tier one?
At least 80%
what's going on?
DAT SKYRIM SONG
Over a year's time?
Oh, misread that.
uh?
Been here for 80%+ of BMNs
oh right. I'm Tier 1 I guess
If there are about 48 fridays in a year, then you need to be to AT LEAST 38 of them. (not including nor requiring encore presentations)
Except he said over the course of a year.
agreed
cause I'd be like...Tier 3 or 2
Also one that doesnt require the knowing of a (very specific) website.
May 13th was the first day
guys
i don't know D:
what's going on
I don't either dude.
I've had pinkiequest on loop for an hour and a half
Sleep well!
http://youtu.be/iyC2ccF_-Pc
Okay, let me try to rectify this...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FiFMKR3LGc&feature=related
/me IS LURKING
Lurk moar.
Tier 5 Watch and enjoy atleast 3 episodes of MLP:Fim
Tier 4 Watch the 1st season more than once
(well? o_o)
and not just one pic
or vid
I'mma stop the Pinkiequest loop at 30 loops.
One more loop~
Nah.
30 is a good stopping point.
Tier 2 (alt) Visit Equestria Daily, daily for a few months
(yay! I've done that :3)
I've done that, but I didn't qualify for Tier 3. >_>
Last loop~
I'm sticking to tier two. >_>
Well, I've memorized every song.
/me shrugs
Whoops. Went to 31 loops.
Anyway, that's closed
I made it to tier 3. I would be at Tier 1 but only 4 recrutes...
<3
although I dont recognise iBringDaLulz
I'd like to be recognized for the cursors, but I have a lot of work before I'm telling anyone.

I eventually get to Porvoo, then world bucks me in the arse and the bus I could've taken went 5 minutes ago
I wait another 10 minutes there and then take the bus to home, walk home, slump to the chair and turn the computer on
I open Winamp, I put the speakers on and put Makkon befriends Jeffthestrider - Impressions of Celestia Origins

Illinois Consolidated
They had to close the old thread because it was too laggy for mods
whats that?
How laggy, you ask: 10 to 15 seconds per page
D:
i really really wanted to see how far it goes
lol my service provider :P
woah...
oh
thats alot of pages
I have rogers
Vbulletin experts said you should close them at 10k posts
aka ATT
>implying they ever get that far ever
http://i52.tinypic.com/n53gut.png is a proper reaction
I even shot an e-mail to EqD about it :P
cool
Ouch, what's the problem?
Haha, that's a common problem with many things...
i just done random things and then it connected me
That's good!
I presume we're the only ones active here right now?
i have to do 6 lessons per day, each 50 minutes each
It should, but if not you could use the online IRC clients.
Unless you are at a public school that filters content...
Why only 3/6?
yep
tuesday the same
They might filter out the IRC server
wednesday 3 lessons
thursday - same as wednesday
but it takes ages to connect
I used to have that problem when I was back in high school
Well…it wasn't 'quick' but it WORKED
Jerks haha
embc i think
i dont remember
might try
but they act fast
It reroutes the connection past their filters
mods came in around 1 minute after he accessed it
Haha wow
this is kettering buccleuch academy
its fucking shit
Oh damn
only good thing about it is that it is a sports academy
Alright, I'm back
That's not bad.
Yeah.
Just keep a list of proxies handy haha
(which I should be doing with mine at work, but I've been too lazy to)
That's good, didn't know if this was the kind of school you lived at during the school year :P
A spy…?
hello?
thats classified.
Am not!
Err...

07,01I think most i've seen yes
Have you ever added them to the playlist?
07,01most are in yes
Cool :)
07,0123 mins before showtime!
07,01^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK9nTmt1pWQ#t=35m55s
Anybody else talking?
naw
I'm just suffering here on my own
Oooh
Stomach is a' hurtin
I know what'll cheer you up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK9nTmt1pWQ#t=35m55s
watched it
didnt see much difference
7,1in 20mins and reupload),and alot of the music score seems out of place as in doesn't﻿ fit the scene. good effort though
07,01is pretty much how I feel about it
2,14 meh, I just wish it did more than change the music/color
^Isn't that one of the comments?
07,01eeeyup
07,01that's why I said this: :P
And yeah, the whole thing was a little disappointing for me. I just think the last part was good.
I thought it would be more epic
07,01I just cried...
07,01http://i.imgur.com/kgXwv.jpg
07,01:(
2,14 yeah I saw that one
that me cry aswell Luna
07,01god...
well the style was fine but the expressions were confusing
Probably just a random friend
2,14 I choose to think of my Equestria as Cancer free :P
free cancer? where?
/me beats the crao out of sickness before it reaches Equestria
I was thinking about this today while having breakfast
07,01I know...
How there's no real "evil" in equestria
Luna
We are going to take Equestria
For example, the villains aren't exactly violent
AND PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
resident evil: equestria
Well it IS a kids show don't forget
But I think that's not entirely accurate if you take the Hydra trying to eat ponies into consideration
Yeah, that too :p
and there could be violence
Yeah, i know
and good thoughts are good and bad thoughts are bad
Fun things are fun
than a fic where its sad when someone dies
kiss or kick?
then again, wouldnt anyone?
kick
*kick
not kiss
comedy fics are my favourite
2,14 eh, I think that's just a coincidence
I dunno
to be friends with ofc
The target audience has simply shifted to us
2,14 yeah, but that's basically the only example
Whatever the case is, it was fun hearing twilight say it.
2,14 I think we're looking WAY too much into it
Not officially though
WE NEED TO THINK DEEPER
faust even admitted that she knew about the derpy mail thing. it was probably her shoutout to us
but they animated the scene first.. then they went back and changed the eyes.. if you're talking about episode 15 and such (i think that was the one anyway)
I think it's cool they make references to us here and there but if the show starts catering too much to the adult fandom it's gonna lose everything
i am pretty dang sure..
06,15Yay stream!
STREA
lol wowhead.com :D
^ i know
STREAM!!
yay~
Yeah, i expected nothing more though
someone likes to play wow ;)
Hm stream?
06,15I had page open, lawl
2,14 Luna: the stream now automatically updates
I heard the sound
bam It's there Luna
it changed instantly
i think the thing people don't exactly realize is that they ALWAYS had those references around.. unless we were reading too much into that as well (i doubt it)
I'm pretty sure if you click play on the stream, it automatically loads anything that appears
2,14 everything else is just us drawing way too much
moar musics
awesome!
HOUSE!
woot House :D
they extracted the soundtrack from the episode!
Too bad the recent seasons have been getting progressively worse...
a few shoutouts here and there is perfectly fine.. but the show hasn't changed cause of it
07,01what photo?
2,14 is anyone else getting stutters?
07,01yea am working on it
06,15Ah okay.
lo all
06Roger that let me try it with another film

This song has been in he head all day as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nff3Bj09glk
WAITING TO GET BUUUUCKED
lol
but not getting bucked
yeah, that'd hurt
we on a backup again?
Is the stream up atm?
One of the things the Bayformers had running for them was good music
I'm willing to bet that a lot of the music was simply from Immediate Music
probably
i don't have watched Transformers 3 yet :I
you need to watch it
I haven't watched any of the 3
and I plan to keep it that way
I don't give them the credit for them. Just say it worked good to use them
watch 3, forget 1 and 2
lol
accept 1 Erase 2 and watch 3
That song is amazing, LC
I KNOW RIGHT!?
then purchase brain bleach, AMIRITE?
Soon
/me shudders
2 is an Eldritch Abomination
it's terrible
xD
it's really well done, but it's insanely disturbing
there are about 20 alternate endings
i read one where Applejack broke into the room and saved her last minute
but killed pinkie with a self-defensive kick
read that one LC
UH!
suggest awesome stories i have to read
No seriously it's awesome READ IT!
but later
or now. since the stream isn't up yet
it won't make you forget. It helps you get over it
good stories to suggest?
anyone?

Theres a mad pony spoof :P
Huh, looks pretty warm for freezing temps
this marks the first time I am watching Digimon in Japanese.
lol
time for me to go study some more
I hope you enjoy
I know it
Oh?
oh yeah we're streaming all Digimans seasons eventually
I have no preference between the english and japanese versions of S1 digimon. <3
Wear a coat then, you dope! D:<
my irc stopped updating :P
Was the best of both worlds
fair warning, everybody, if we get to S2 in English
Huh
my Davis/Daisuke fanboyism knows NO BOUNDS
Oh lord.
I dont even remember everyones names...
In S1?
at all
:(
And then everypony fell into the Twilight Zone
Oh, I remember when I watched all of G2, G3 and G4 Digimon
damn I was a kid when I first saw this
but not G1
If I can only harvest this power...
the storylines are kinda cool, but nothing tops the evo songs
if you could harvest said power
You'd become a Harvest Moon protagonist
I can't rember any thing about this now
Yes... and all the radishes would be /mine/.

Good riddance.
PSP
everyone's favorite season is Tamers (except me)
PATAPON
familiar faces
Tamers. <3
one of the last announced games for the system
Sadly since Vita is coming soon that means that chances of it being localized are smaller than normal
<3 Strong Heart
S4 had amazing potential..
/me glomps herospirit
lol
Tamers was awesome and darkish
G4 Digimon was cool, but digimon kinda blew after G21
G2
Okay guys pain meds win, I can't stay awake any longer.

'Night.

Sleep well!
G5 was pure trash
I didn't even bother with G6
later Kalisia
which one was the one with the obelisk things?
G@
*G2
Oh. He mad.
which is my favorite
And then everypony died
also Digimon exists in a multiverse
Ryo from Tamers was born in Tai's world
G4 is my fav for the musics
yeah, I remember it being pretty damn good
G2 is my fav for the plot
I also remember watching the movie a bajillion times
Ugh, I zoned off right before I was going to hit the quit button.
lol
g'night
I have all 4 movies (in the US dub) recorded on a VHS
Was G4 the one where the main characters transformed instead of having digimon?
yes
yep herospirit
Yep!
The music. Oh gog.
i seem to remember that too
I liked it
somewhat
I agree G4 had the best music.
how many Gs are there in total?
52
O_O
5 afaik.
Did they start a 6th? >_>
Definitely 52
5
k'

Kalumon's Deus Ex Machina is awoken
There are currently 6 series, with a 7th on the way.
O hai
end*
Though there's also V-Tamer and the assorted mangos and games
there was also one where there were digimon that ate the world's code
which one was that?
that... was G4
iirc
zomg digimon
G3 digimons would eat other digimon code
G4 digimons ate the world
omg
yep
......
Guys. We watch ponies.
We are
lol
totally awesome

Digimon is always halfway between awesome and stupid for me
YES
Fair. It tended to flicker between those two pretty often
yeah

BRAWL
BATTLE ROYALE
PRETENDER
Wait

I have a sudden urge to watch Transformers.
Hello.
Hullo.
DAT DRAWFRIEND
Hullo KuchikiYorume
hey there KuchikiYorume
To be continued...
When my friend told me about this, I assumed it was a forum of some sort.
KuchikiYorume, it's IRC :3
They are two separate entities that are married into one concept KuchikiYorume
You watch, we watch, you talk, we talk.
All in real time.
Except during BMN, then communication is impossible
ffffffff, I missed drawfriend 198
Well, I figured once I entered. But then, it's hard for me to focus when there's some sort of interesting show on. *shrug*
x3
It's nearly impossible during a Season 2 Premeire episode.
like...
I remember the summer movie nights.
it's why we comunicate via memes at times
Leaverage
I like to imagine that...
I'm a firetruck.
^whut
or
Trending meme...
...he?
XD
http://www.knowyourmeme.com
Lol, it's the "Idiot Nerd Girl" meme
My Little Pony is ALWAYS trending.

Ohp, here it is, got back to "This is not my child"

Last 3 episodes of the Bount arc are made of the EXACT same flashback.
I was very dissapoint
^
and Halibel was best Espada ;_;
Night all
Sleep well!
/me sheds manly tears for Halibel.
If he reached SHIKAI he'd blow up the world D:
later #bronystate
well, Kenpachi's sword is the same type as Ichigo's
meaning he's in permanent Shikai
Well, I'm always willing to talk about Bleach. Just look for KuchikiYorume! XD
Yeah, I know
But if you count him from before the betrayal, than he's my second fave
and then he split someone in half. :I
Gin's my second favourite character regardless
*beat
OhTheyDodged
My favourite character... well, I'd be pretty worried if you haven't figured that out by now XD
all the good Espada died badly
.....
Starrk/Lilinet, Hallibel
I lold at Nell's full name
Zommari deserved to die. I don't know much about it, but still. XD
I'm glad I don't really plan on watching Bleach
That fag with 50 something eyes? KuchikiYorume
Yes.
from Billy and Mandy
yea. arrogance like that is awefull.
herospirit sorry bout that
And Zommari's arrogance... is intolerable. I loved watching the backwards race in the AE though.
*RobotSnatch*
Bleach... egh.
lol
It's fine, I'll probably forget them by the time I start watching the show, if I ever do.
I like it, but by Celestia it just doesn't stop

I found a jungle rose by accident. :3
Whoa, boob rockets XD Ahh, digimon
Yeah, I was wondering if you and me could play some time.
Oh, yeah, that'd be cool.
z;0
I like Terraria. Problem is, unless I play on hardcore it is no longer fun
How much does Terraria cost, again?
I mean, seriously

No, actually. Never had a dream where I'm a pony.

Someone has to clean this shit up you know
Fiber. Lots of fiber.

WaruMonzaemon was scary
It scares the crap out of me
BOOM

agreed
Saved by the shitmon

/me snuggles up with his pinkie pie plushie
Ikr
See, now I wouldn't really have a problem with having the main cursor in most of the loading animations....
/me sighs
by the way he is one of the worst ultimate digimon
well power wise
aggro'd the boss
...
lol
._.
my timing is spectacular
Yes.
I think I stepped in something! XD
it's is utterly SMASHING
Sorry, I was using the japanese names >->
He's pretty weak.
ya
pretty weak for a ultimate as i said
He's more defensive, but that's... ehh
Ultimate
I've only played Digimon World DS, and anime is... well, it fluctuates.
Fuck ya cactuse
WaruMonzaemon is frightening
THEME MUSIC POWER UP
my bad then
...Did a Champion level just beat an Ultimate level?
I think
he really DID suck
but yes a champion level won up to a ultimate thats saying something about him
he sucks
Palmon, thank you for beating the shit out of me
heart**
Anyone else think "Rookie -> Champion -> Ultimate -> Mega" is kinda stupid?
nah
I'd switch the last two, personally.
same
same
YESH
/me highfive
I've always thought that
same
/me huggles herospirit
i don't know i thought it seems resonable
exactly
that especially bothers me
well, we all know
that Japan is a REALLY strange place
XD

x3
C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
Was born there~ ...don't remember anything from it though...
put on the digimon movie :D the first one
if you have it
I was two when we moved away D:
herospirit: "Alternate Select is used as a separate cursor for selecting things in certain applications."
>mfw they need two select cursors 3:<
Lol XD
The name Ikkakumon makes me laugh now
WHY DO YOU NEED ANOTHER CURSOR FOR SELECTING SOMETHING
the link select for the alternate select
<- me
I do too
goggles*
this seems meh
Okay wait
Yalls need to hear the English G4 theme
lemme grab it real fast.
xD
wait, it the Cactusmon a Champion?
ya
that really is a weak ultimate then
we don't get their ultimate forms till they get back to the real world
and yes he was very very weak ultimate
with the crests/tags
The Eldest Scroll
O_O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjJsh_Oaw6E <--- best digimon opening

AS WE WORK TOWARDS ONE SOLUION
there we go this one works
The first half is so-so
second half is epic
kefka that swiping card thing blah
I liked season 4, well...because I'd always wanted to turn into a Digimon myself...
I can see that.
Like, understand it, that kind of thing.
in honest opinion i did not like the egg digivolving but i enjoyed the DNA digivolving
Yeah, but some ponies don't like not having a cursor for everything...
yeah DNA digivolving was awesome
Paildramon was a boss
just hated the DNA digivolving between armaarmodillo and patamon
Shankuamon?
building up to the awesome fusion and get get a claydoll
FIGHT HIM JYOU
Zephyrmon was cool, but a bit confusing
because of gender
i was suprised it was not easy to break that digimon xD i was thinking that and laughing
xD
well here let me get you the digimon
also claydol is based on the old breakable dolls
YOU READY?
PUT YA GUNS ON

nope.avi
GM: Yup
actually, MaloMyostismon from S2 came from Myotismon
if I remember correctly, Apocalymon came out of nowhere
he has 3 digievolutions apparently
LIKE A BAWS
VenomMyotismon[4]Apocalymon* (w/ DemiDevimon, Vilemon, LadyDevimon, SkullSatamon, Puppetmon)[5]
Do you want to be dissasembled molecule by molecule?
....
he had to use 4 digimon to DNA to apocalymon
But that was a Ghostbusters referance....

I don't know you anymore...
Haven't watched ANY of the Transformers movies / LotT
Lord of the Rings*
Haven't played through Modern Warfare 1 or 2 yet (but have both :P)
I can cause I'm only a senior in High School
I can't cause I'm only a Senior in college :P
Among other things...
I've taken many a college level classes before :/
also
having an iPhone makes my AP Macronomics and Micronomics classes sooooooo much easier
Really now? I took Introduction to Economics before, why does it make it easier? (To cheat on the tests? :P)
nah
don't have to write notes
You just record the lectures?
nah
You type the notes using the iPhone...?
I take pictures of the slides
OHICNOW
I tried doing that.
Haha
meh
it was worth it for me
But most importantly, every analogy would involve the use of alcohol or cigarettes in some form.
Oh wait
Fail at reading.
and it was a kick in the face when I found out how easy geometry was
You could take it anyway :P Geometry isn't that hard.
basically
But I hated geometry…with a passion...
although I won't get as many collage credits for taking AP Classes
yeah
Equestria Daily is really on a roll tonight.
Algebra was my favorite
Algebra > Geometry
although
I could of taken AP Statistics
That would have sucked.
yeah
I'm a genius at math, but Statistics was one of my hardest courses :P

*also
English was a fucking joke
They would go up to her the day a paper was due and ask for a 2 week extension, which she gave them.
all my teachers except my geometry teacher got that concept
Just talking about which Pony is best.
we were?
You bet!
The answer is Fluttershy
http://youtu.be/uES_r44ASck <3
oh no you don't!
YEAH I DID
Ponies
:3
Moral of the story?
But with PONIES!!
Upgrade compleat!
Took you long enough!
My ISp finaly got around to geting my net upgrades
Oh boy!
HD Streams!
perhaps
:3
Yeah, cause HD was totally last year you know...
It's not like I think it's cool or anything...
i don't normally watch in hd, but when i do
it's in uvhd
d- net to b+ net
is that like boasting 120fps?
:P
when the parin cant even percive 60fps
Sure.
Stream this in HD: http://youtu.be/5NylmdC_uEM
For the record...
I choose the Rarity room
Somehow that extra 'o' slipped in there...
my that was stupid
no seems they swaped streems on me again.
:<
IT'S FINE
/me is further out.
Nah it's cool, we're still friends :P
Which stream are you using? The main room and back up streams don't work.
Or in other words, they WORK but nothing is being streamed.
dont know if I have the back up publish info and main stream is giving faild to publish errors
What's going on in here?
Ponies and lots of 'em.
Hm, my comp says the broadcast is offline. Is it?
Or is my comp just shit? (note: it is)
No real broadcast, just performin' tests.
k
That must be it, he said he was setting up his computer to stream till like 4 AM
Whatever time zone that was...
Lots of Ping timeouts...
There are like a bazillion different plants out there
I'd say it can be imaginative when it needs to be
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As8cmHb-aKU
here pretend this is the stream.
Stream isn't very high quality :P
My TOASTER can achieve that resolution.
Over a DIAL-UP network
While ON THE PHONE
Especially cut up and fried...mmm...
Where were we again?
I am here, I have no clue where you are.
And how do you know where you are...
Nyeah... the target.
I ahve one of those little map things with the arrow saying you are here.
Also bad grammarz.
I know kung fu
dang
I'd like to learn via RAINBOW DASH.
microwave the book first
heat rises
good point
TTG: MICROWAVES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!
And if you get too warm from the book, make sure you have a windmill nearby to cool you down
I'M HACKING THIS STREAM!
http://youtu.be/2XtoP4kucy4
zomg hax
watching that machina you posted earlier
That's only if the sun RISES!
It's thoroughly disorienting for G-man to have such a normal voice
Anyway, I'm sure we can all agree that Fluttershy is the best pony.
feh
/me doesn't take kindly to such blasphemy.
I'm glad you agree!
That is not the consensus that I just proposed.
/setsnewtopic
Twilight is best pony.
But…she's best Pony :<
but if she keeps doing those things I makes it even harder to stay asleep.
Pinkiy Pih
Are these terrifying "Hi! I watch you watching me!" dreams, or
Maybe if I focus more on the ponies and less on studying...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B9-TQVXYpM

Is that just me, then?
Someone has been spying on us.

Nah, I was AFK

This is where the magic happens: http://youtu.be/jy8GyQaFUUo
Since when is it National Pony Writing Month?
NaPoWriMo?
That's a thing now?
I...
oh one of those.
Any requests for stream?
Dash is an expert, she knows when to 'hide her thing'.
She's playing hard to get…but still coming closer to us...
It's pretty half-assed though, rough vector, it's only a minute long
/me is disappoint.
must be some one trying to coppy.
Seems like someone dared to click the link...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3r77uYTNrJ4#!
Uggh, great, now THIS is on the stream...
some great songs though
DD is best pony =p

lmao
/me 's mind is gone...
Brain is got the dumbs..
It was a bootleg caption job from china or something that was making the rounds a few years back
there were some great lines in there but DO NOT WANT hit critical meme mass fast and hard
Now everyone uses variants of that meme
"Sort of want"
Do want.
heh
even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
wtf, ok people around here are crazy.
there is currently a paintball war taking place at my apartment.

back from studying a forums that didn't seem to have been touched by bronydom
there's a forum i think i'm gonna be the first to post about ponies on lol
just haven't done it yet
g'afternoon
just that the threads went inactive
yeah
Nevar forget!
that ponychan crawler thing aint working.. any ideas why?
it just starts trying to download a thread and then says done after apparently loading the thread or something.. as if it's not detecting any pictures whatsoever
bad regex?
well ok i dunno how it applies here anyway
everything seems normal except that it's just not actually downloading anything
except the thread.. it does take time to load that
but right after it does it's just "done!"
hi RP :)
06,15How is everypony this fine day?
Hello from me too to everyone

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IjQNNppx6w

Shed imaginary manly tears
9God
9Xros wars looks like Gurren Laganna nd Digimon had a night of hardcore sex
9and that is amazing
Hmm
Hey
A cupe of flour, a teaspoon of balogne, and counting to four.

*Coffee

Coffee is good.

*bleh
/me prefers root beer.
I tried root beer one time
It was the most awful thing I ever tasted
XD
Maybe it was just because I was younger
Fun part with root beer is that all the brands for it taste different.
Orly
Root beer is pretty good when it is made by Virgil's.
Root beer is ok
:I
/me brohoofs Daei
*Dari
You're at home Dari?
Yeah.
I envey you right now
I found a can of 15 year old tea the other day. Do you guys think I sould drink some?
>can
>tea
Wut
It's those little single serving, Tea-bag things.
Heh. Root Beer made with sassafrass.
Guys, I just read "Bubbles" for the first time. I then read "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever" for the fist time...
Like arizon tea?
LAWL
I found it in my grandparents basement.
*Arizona
Arizona tea is amazing.
That is hilarious.
Hmmm
That it is
Heh
A good second for favorite drink is some tasty apple cider.
As in proper cider.
Not weird American non-alcohlic cider.
Hey.

9 Sadfrog.jpg
hahahaha
You talking about the one at 0:22?
And bigger chests.
Also, goggles
Digimon always has goggles.
Since those goggles can change shape and form over time when passed down through generations
Though I suppose it may be possible, sometime down the road, for the Goggles to be owned by a girl. . .
Le gasp!
Since technically, the first series had a girl with goggles (Sora)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAlxqBJprVI
Those are nice
Also WB Rp
She just had a silly hat.

06,15puzzle platformer for the PS2, they just released the HD version on PS3
06,15I know it's been pushed back to 2012
06,15I'm guessing holiday 2012, since they're saying spring :P
9 Back from McD's...got Rainbow Dash. They didn't have Pinkie. Unless the Pony toys are still sold next week, I won't get Pinkie D: she's the only one missing from my set
06,15Aw damn...
well
MFW still no pony toys at all in McD here.
They've never had them.
9at least I have my Top 3 instead of my Top 4 but still
9they light up and shit
The US has had both the light up ones and the normal ones. :/
We've had neither.

http://arch.413chan.net/photo_finish_cutie_mark-(n1300777195794).png
oh derp'd link. just copypasta it or somethin
:O
Animation derp?
yeah, you could say it's an animation derp
To explain why it's like that
They used Twilight Sparkle's body as a template for Photo Finish
My friend (who works for MLP) checked it out
He remove her shades and hair
http://bit.ly/mQD5cz
uhm
?
Yep, pretty much.
they probably hid a few features
and drew over it
i don't think they did
That's how it's suppose to go
but I honeslty have no idea why they used Twilight as their template for Pony Gaga
greetings everypony
hey
<3
except quaraezha
anyway i still think they didnt use twilight template
:<
But that's the only explaination as to why
AND face.
just kidding

Well, I believe you anyway Quaraezha. XD

Hiya LunaTheForgotten~
Favorite cartoons, shows, etc
^
Hi LTF
Hey guys.
TTGL for myself
MLP:FiM is my favorite.. what's yalls?
My favourite used to be Kenan And Kel,or Doug.
06,15Out of all shows, animes, cartoons?
TTGL, S-Cry-Ed...
Champloo.
ooh s-cry-ed
STUTTGART IST VIEL SCHÖNER ALS BERLIN (Stuttgart is much prettier than Berlin)
I clump cartoon and anime into one category, cartoons.
Needs more Reboot
Reboot disappointed me when they cut off the series with a crazy Megabyte in invading the central place of Mainframe.
I keep them apart since they usually never cross topics.
The comicbook?
After all the crazy net adventures they had.
Can't forget about Freakazoid either
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O292KICg8_s
06Ja, aber Saxony ist die Schönste~ ;D
Dat be awesome
I always held Animu in a higher regard than cartoons because rarely a cartoon had comparable quality...
Until FiM.
06,15They very frequently cross topics, I think... The biggest difference is that in Japan more TV-cartoons are aimed at adults.
MeteorVenture: RRRRRRRGH
/me hugs Luna
Also, it's the older-targeted japanese cartoons that typically get exported from Japan.
lol that ship is just bad enough to make me consider rage as a viable option
