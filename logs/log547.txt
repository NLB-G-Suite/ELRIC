I avoid sad fanfics.
Sadfics > darkfics

I don't get why some fans need to work out their personal grief by imposing it on these ponies.
I dont usually read dark/sadfics

11,01Anxiety kept me up last night.
its somewhere in the area of 100+ here
oh 89, it cooled off considerably\
It's onky 73 degrees here.
still feels like 96 though:p
Anyone else get rained on yesterday?
11,01Not sure. Probably over jobs again.

11,01Something like that.
It shouldn't be illegal.
We are all brothers and sisters here :)
I decided to ask my parents to pre order me Dream Drop distance
I decided to hold off on it for a bit
My parents are "arguing" again
Suddenly stream
the hay
i do
same
My parents argue..alot
Can anyone ever forgive me? :(
11,01It's because we stream copyrighted material. We already operate under the threat of cease and desist letters.
one tiny thing pisses them off and they go at it
11,01If we start taking donations, that would skyrocket our chances of getting that letter.
11,01And we could get sued.
Also I have to control my bronyism when I watch Hellfirecoms
Spades-Magnes[R]: my parents used o argue all the time... their seperated now. having parents argue sucks.

having a male alicorn means that Alicorns procreating is possible, which means people could techincally justify their alicorn OCs and that's horrible.

0,14I do too
Dang I finally got home. i just walked from my dad's house home
*Moopy has joined chat* hey everypony whats up
allo
0,14<3 Animorphs
Ello
Animorphs?
never read the books, but the covers were nice
:$
Does that still exist in some form?
yo
0,14nah, the series ended years ago
The Andalites in the TV show look different than the drawings on the Scholastic site
I'd like to have one as a roommate, though.
0,14oh yeah, there was a TV series
The tv show didnt last long....
/me would totally pay a couple bucks for Pipsqueak's Thunder Plunder
soo
0,14I've been all right
oh neat
I remember enough of the Animorphs TV show to know that Stephenie Meyer stole the bad guys from that to use in "The Host"
i got 4 around here somewhere
I never read "The Host".
whats atm?
oh wait i got it
at the moment
literally all we know right now is that there is a 3rd season.
that's all.
at the moment
why is that?
0,14a lot of people didn't like it
0,14because it was slow in comparison to the earlier games
/me is now the chat's resident Andalite
0,14and because people didn't like the Star Wars characters
lol
0,14so after 4, Namco decided it wasn't worth making more
I think they're still setting up that, you know with voice acting and editing and all
0,14and then they did
yep
0,14Nightmare was awesome
0,14Patience, young grasshopper
I wish i could be the voice acter
acting classes helps
0,14^
0,14"take acting classes if you want to be a VA"
sure you could make silly voices, but there's also acting as well
0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^
My voice is just for telling stories
One does not simply, Become a VA
Hmmmm
Not identical; SIMILAR.
loved when i found out those finishers
0,14as much as being a VA would be a dream job of mine, not sure how good I would be at it
I'm gonna guess no
0,14the few times I've acted, it's been kinda more expression in a physical manner
unless they loved to block
0,14indeed
Welp going to sleep, Bye everypony
Peace
0,14Guilmon and Leeron
Nope.avi he didn't put it up yet
he has a range from 12 year old boys...to 13 year old boys
0,14heh

0,14so I've heard
0,14and speaking of me acting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fD8kE2LyU8

Damn shame that Bulletstorm didn't sell well
0,14watching that vid again, i don't think I emote with my voice enough

for the simple reason that you can edit it in plain text

hmm Lost my singal for a second
00,02is a silly reason
Is anypony's team fortress 2 bucking up?
the last one i wrote was a total of about 80 lines consisting of "run this SQL statement that itself is 20 lines"
"then write the result to .txt"
00,02if its simple script then why not python?
00,02MirrorImage: you can get python for windows
00,02at least 3 implimentations out there
if I'm just doing text, I use perl.
he wants something that anyone can edit, and vb is sufficiently plain-english
00,02never understood perl
...
thankfully the scripts were heavily commented...
though its concerning when the comment lines take up more lines than the code itself

or at all actually
instead there are fixed borders where you're in the planet's influence, then suddenly in the sun or moon's.
it's nearly 3 here...

11,02Fruits ^-^
/me slouches instead
if you're not a fruit, you're a vegetable.
Did someone say fruits? :D
I'm a vegetable!
Is the moon a territory, or a full-on province?
... Am I doing it right?
i'd say add srb's but i have no clue where to add srb's without taring the ship apart
:D
the rest is histroy
hoo-ray
I think that was me. But that was when he was using air-breathing engines.
not enough for escape
oh well

suggestion, send the outer fuel tanks fuel line to the center tank, that should make them all empty at a constant rate
http://derpy.me/Dvsbe
think you can do a vertical landing?
well that works too, sorta.
should empty from the sides evenly at least
20%

04Right
04Sooooo how old are you?

04Nice

same here, I'm feeling elderly lol
damn you are old

04Do we have people here older than 20?
yes
o_o
I walked into my old Elemenatry school during Exam week. I felt really freakin' old around the kids
04Oh wow
That had to suck.
I know there are other 14 years old here. But I guess there not logged on right now
i'm 15 o_o
04Yeah, we have quite a few "youngin's" in community now
04*in the community
Yep.
as long as we dont have annoying 7-9 yr olds every thing is k
I agree with that.
04You know, we had one person claim he was 11
its amazing how much changes in only a couple years
D:
i guess
04It's inevitable that as the show became bigger the interest would trickle down and stop being a niche interest

/me uses mIRC
00,02FairysHuff, its free
00,02i dont like mirc, its meh
00,02just used more
Arr.
I'd try XChat, but I just can't bother learning the differences between the two.
Shortcuts, features, et cetera.
XD
00,02theres realy not much difference
00,02Kammerjunk, meh
00,02seen one config interface, seen them all
00,02well, seen most of them
seen one rainbow script seen them all?
00,02still come across a bizare one every now and again
00,02XD
Fair 'nuff.
XD
Wait, is that an X-Wing?
06,02R04,02A07,02I08,02N09,02B03,02O06,02W04,02S
00,02Kammerjunk, yup
MY MIND
mind fuck
00,02no, i wrote this script
idk :P
Fair enough.
might be because of those bass acwards wings on the front
I shall check out xchat but if I have to go through another tedious set-up process just to get it the way I want it again I may not bother ^_^ Took long enough to learn how to do it with mIRC
If I'm not mistaken, dari isn't very technical-like.
:(
Rain: Oh? I did not know that.
those wings are sooooo close to the ground XD
00,02SUCCESS

00,02thats one of the reasons i REALY like music that combines both
standing roket please

space!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111 please!!!! :(
the little guys down there are dancing :P
then you should strap some rockets to it and set them off when you break atmosphere
...Assuming rockets wouldn't break it.
00,02not sure if its rounding errors or simulation errors
they should make real planes like this....no emmisions *trollface*
00,02XD
00,02exploit rounding errors in the universe
Rina Chan is best....err....something
might be be the fact that the wings are working like fans
00,02i'ma head for that island
head for that landingstrip infront of you
00,02oh
00,02nvm
