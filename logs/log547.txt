00,03They want to raise 600,000$ to name a land Equestria....
WHY
13why not
Scoot-Scootaloo: AND build a monument to Celestia on said island
Scoot-Scootaloo: The bigger question is, will there be ponies?
TO EQUASTRIA
00,03....no.... oh God no....
/me insert Instant pony
Shizuka: seems like kind of an enormous waste of money.
Yes. But not the ponies we want.
13so? their money to waste
So waste it on something less stupid.
00,03RAWRity: Seems?
13*cough*lottery*cough
Like, maybe donate 600K to charities?
yes i do.
or, you know, something NOT as useless as a god damn island.
WE can make money off that island somehow.
/me thinks hes done enough damage and climbs back into his air vent
"Ooh, i named this piece of land. Totally worth more money than most people will make in their entire lives.
13that's economics
BY the way, anypony noticed that there's no Poster for this movie night'
?
13if it really is useless, someone out there just got $600,000 richer for nothing
what is the movie for the next movie night anyway?
What are the movies this week?
Shizuka someone like DONALD TRUMP! (Ba dum tss)
Road to Eldorado for the A movie
Wasn't talking to you.
11,02Sorry for the delay everypony, the interview stream will be started in just a few min...
he ain't gettin no money from me :p
And who has the money to rent aircraft to get to an island, let alone a boat or ferry? Hell, regular airline tickets are expensive as it is.
SuperBrony64: what interview?
/me glomps SuperBrony64
Robin Hood: Men in Tights for B movie
i agree with hen3ry but there would need to be lots of weed
And what interview?
Still True.
if you just want an island named equestria, dump a big rock in a slow shallow river, and then you have your new island. and as "discoverer" you name it what you want.
Eh, fair enough. :3
Pony Episode A: Ponyville Confidential
An island that only costs $600,000? Must be pretty small. :/
/me glomps Shizuka
00,03Not just the island, a freaking monument.
or in a really, really miserable place.
00,03Might as well make it out of paper meche'
hiya guys, what's up?
http://8bitwinning.tumblr.com/post/26588254052/fyeahfriendshipismagic-abjimmyz
Again, who has money for small aircraft for a ferry? Tickets for cruises and airlines are high as shit.

Oh god not the bees
Meanwhile: what? HWO? I don't like Ed, Edd and Eddy! I don't find it funny or quirky, i just find the kids in it friggin nutso and little monsters. WHERE ARE THE PARENTS IN THAT CUL DE SAC?
otakon: They died. Are you happy now?
I don't know if I'm allergic, but I don't quite want to find out (I'm allergic to a bunch of stuff :( _
)
Meanwhile: no, no I'm not.
Bronysith: you think thats bad? mine died by eating its own children
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yeah

Bronysith: Troll harder, she left.
Nittany_Discord: same here. Especially Ed, he was treated like dirt half the damn time. He just was too dense to realize it.
no dusty, it was not

But reading - Silent Ponyville 1-2-3 - My Little Dashie - The Last Party - Sweet Apple Massacre it isnt helping

brb guys
"Twilight Sparkle sat back from the viewer, not sure what to think. It was a world of hairless apes, furiously clopping to images of her. It was flattering and horrifying, all at once."
Make sure to tell us how it goes.
when this happens, http://goo.gl/yDWFS , then yes, they are going to clop to you Twi :)
My Little Dashie and The Last Party made me cry alot :l

/me hugs twilight_sprinkle
Welp I'm gonna jump in the shower :P

Im going to go be depressed
CCCP hiya :D
I avoid sad fanfics.
hi killerpony7733
Sadfics > darkfics
hi CCCP
and take lots of pictures
I don't get why some fans need to work out their personal grief by imposing it on these ponies.
hello LoGaN
CCCP Hows it going? :P
Hi CCCP
I dont usually read dark/sadfics
killerpony7733: pretty good..
who here plays runescape
hi AttacktheAndalite
:(
I have read fics with dark elements to it though, See: Vagabond
CCCP lucky you, I tried sleeping for two hours, But i failed badly luckily the painkillers i took for the annoying headache i had before i tried sleeping is working now
Geh
.-.
too hot here to sleep
11,01Anxiety kept me up last night.
killerpony7733: aww
its somewhere in the area of 100+ here
for what Nittany_Discord
oh 89, it cooled off considerably\
Nittany_Discord: why were you anxious?
/me gives Nittany_Discord chloroform
It's onky 73 degrees here.
it seems like it's about to Thunderstorm here
Ryunosuke: That's a good fic.
still feels like 96 though:p
Nittany_Discord: does this smell like chloroform?
CCCP Bleh i'll just wait till i feel more tired and then go to sleep hopefully i won't have any headache before or after
quick: suggest manga for me to read while I wait for Digimon to download.
11,01Not sure. Probably over jobs again.
haha i asked him first CCCP your too slow
DocSane: you lucky bugger, it's still like 93 here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cLQCUZt3Dg&feature=plcp
11,01Bronysith: No. Smells like cloth.
killerpony7733: thats usually works
Because we launched an epic war against the rain clouds here in Boston last night.
LoGaN: indeed :|
damnit, 2 mc servers and a singleplayer world
11,01I really wish I could go back to school and get a PhD.
do not make for a productive night
why dont you then Nittany_Discord
A stupendous amount of explosives was fired at the rain, and I'm pleased to report that we beat the enemy back.
especially if bronystate is open too
I DEMAND PONIES
/me runs and hides
Did I miss the interview?
/me gives Nittany_Discord a phd
11,01LoGaN: I don't have anything to offer a school right now.
11,01Also, it's too late to apply.
me/ says hi to everypony/brony
11,01And my family wants me to get a job.
ooh it's on movie night
hm
being a moderator on bronystate is a job Nittany_Discord
11,01A job that pays.
LoGaN: Not one that pays
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cLQCUZt3Dg&feature=plcp is a good song...
Firefox seems so laggy for me lately....
Shizuka: Arth thow there?
11,01Bronystate is a job, but it will never pay due to various reasons.
Liokin hiya guess you are still here too :D
Should I get rid of firefox?
Nittany_Discord: don't you like it though?
13yay first major bug
killerpony7733: Yup.
13how to get this buffer to actually fill..
11,01I love it.
Spade-Magnes[R]: I wouldnt.
At least you aren't bored.
11,01I love working here.
13yup
It sounds rewarding
too bad you could incorporate as a formal internet TV channel. but that'd involve advertsing
So, will there be a stream tonight?
*couldn't
Spade-Magnes[R]: You should search for an update. route through your plug ins to look for unnecesitys. Or try to update your client.
Nittany_Discord: how you become moderator?
Liokin: I tried sleeping for two hours didn't work, now i'm here though atleast the painkillers i took made my headache go away
all of the buffers
Nittany_Discord: You....work here?
This isnt even my comp so I have no idea what does what
I would've denied the offer to be rewarded if I would be in brony state. I just do stuff for fun.
Nittany_Discord: :D
11,01Application. Interview. Trial.
My_Little_Dashie: hi
oh crap, i was supposed to get frame buffers working tonight
Hello CCCP
All I've tried doing is deleting crap no one uses anymore
thanks for the reminder, also, can't wait to see the result there Shizu
11,01If Bronystate paid, I wouldn't look for work. Unfortunately, we can't accept money.
Against the law?
ype
Nittany_Discord: And I love that you work here. Your by far one of the best damn ponys I know and I take pride in calling you a brother.
11,01Something like that.
11,01Thanks Liokin
It shouldn't be illegal.
We are all brothers and sisters here :)
Except otakon.
I decided to ask my parents to pre order me Dream Drop distance
One big family :D
otakon is the racist grandparent.
I decided to hold off on it for a bit
To all bronies out there, I gotta say sorry...
My parents are "arguing" again
Suddenly stream
the hay
and now its dead
howdy everypony
I'm sorry for ever hating and doubting the show. I've just never watched it and when I started watching it a while back, I fell in love..
hai High_Flyer
Am I the only one who still lives with his/her parents?
i do
Spade-Magnes[R]: I do,
Spade-Magnes[R]: Hardly. I just turned 16.
same
My parents argue..alot
Can anyone ever forgive me? :(
11,01It's because we stream copyrighted material. We already operate under the threat of cease and desist letters.
one tiny thing pisses them off and they go at it
My_Little_Dashie: Pretty sure we all could.
My_Little_Dashie: I forgive you
Spade-Magnes[R]: another here
Thank you all so much!
11,01And we could get sued.
My_Little_Dashie: Also, pretty sure we were all doubters and haters of a sort in the beginning.
Also I have to control my bronyism when I watch Hellfirecoms
My_Little_Dashie: S'all cool. While I don't exactly follow the whole "love and tolerance" thing fanatically, I do hold the concept of tolerance despite differences.
They've had issues.. with brony nutjobs
Spades-Magnes[R]: my parents used o argue all the time... their seperated now. having parents argue sucks.
DocSane: Except for the people who were just neutral about the whole thing.
I'd like to give a huge credit of my bronyship to OverCastGabe, he is a big brony and he turned me into one.
I'm back
Kammerjunk: I've found few who were neutral about it.
what I miss?
wb otakon
brb
Kammerjunk: I went through a long phase of "I'm disturbed by how much I like this show."
DocSane: I mean, I never really hated the show, nor did I find the fandom revolting. I just kinda scrolled past it on 4chan back when I frequented that infernal site.
♪

4chan... the scum of the internet
Never went to 4chan.
DocSane: For some reason, when I decided I wanted to try the show out, I downloaded the entirety of the first series in 720p.
I always liked ponies :)
Just because.
It always kind of scared me.
/me waits patiently for someone to stream
Can I ask a question about browsers?
Back from me shower :)
Whats the difference between firefox and chrome?
Kammerjunk: I didn't really give the show a chance till Iread a review in the A/V Room and decided to check out "The Cutie Mark Chronicles."
did you clean behind your ears Ponies47?
Spade-Magnes[R]: One probably looks shinier than the other.
sagas: Yes -_-
Kammerjunk: I didn;t realize Scootaloo was a girl until far into the episode.
Spade-Magnes[R]: One is a canine and the other is a metal.
I ment, preformances
DocSane: Oh, lol.
Derpydash! XD
<.<
I just remembered I wrote this
Meanwhile: Do ho ho.
... is anyone going to stream?
You know what I find stupid?
8,6depends, is anyone going to bitch about what gets streamed?
dat stream
Spade-Magnes[R]: Rhetorical questions?
Kammerjunk: But, consequently, I have a big soft spot for the CMC as a result, since they were the first characters I really "met" on the show.
The 3DS XL gets a charger for every country but europe
kirzstryfe: Depends, what's streaming?
You have to buy it seperatly there
Woah this video
@kirzstryfe: no
oooh musics
The music is good
DocSane: I always kinda liked Sweetie Belle the most of the three.
dat pic. Link anyone?
Suddenly stream :O
kirzstryfe: I won't. I sleep with the stream
<3 Aj.....
Aww, knocked out applejack. Long day working on the farm,
Kammerjunk: Same here.
Spade-Magnes[R] Europe iss a country now?
Spade-Magnes[R]: Europ isn't a country.
8,6sound coming through ok?
My_Little_Dashie: WHY DID YOU HAVE TO REMIND ME OF THAT FIC!>
?
What sagas
sounds is alright
Yep
kirzstryfe: Yup, sounds fine.
Spade-Magnes[R]: Country=/=Continent
Vordox: Applejack is pretty darn neat. Twilght will always take the prize for me, though.
Oh nononno, I wrote it myself with my friend..
kirzstryfe coming through loud and clear
Kammerjunk: Pretty much the same for me.
Kammerjunk: Just cause Twi's the one iwth the most screen time =P
okay guys
I might have to go soon
Kammerjunk: Although I've got love for Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie, too.
I just checked in briefly. But since I can't really be here, I just paused it on this beautiful art.
bad storm rolling in
sounds fine to me
Man I wish some games would come out so I can fucking make my list
I know all the elements and who gets which element.
don't want to risk frying my PC
Vordox: I 'unno. Maybe it's because I can relate to her the most. What with having a bit over 700 books (Still not enough, by the way).
otakon: You stay safe, dude.
Elements of Harmony
My_Little_Dashie: Thanks for reminding me of that sad, sad fanfic... -_-
There's a shit storm a-brewin.
8,6ok, going to open up #Vinyl_Scratch for some music requests in a minute, make sure you include a link and the title with your request, keep them clean, and I reserve the right to alter the order of the requests
OH OH OH OH
There is a derpydash fanfic?
DocSane: I think Dashie takes the second place for me and Pinkie the third. Dashie always striked me more cute than awesome.
11,01I request kirzstryfe naked.
11,01:p
I made a clopfic with my friend out of bordem... I dont wanna go into detail about it... ._.
Vordox: I relate to Twi best, but mainly for her "I'm the only sane person in an insane world" vibe.
It took me forever to releize Kanto and Johto were based off of regions in japan
I request kirzstryfe being the hero BronyState deserves.
My_Little_Dashie: There's a shipfic of everything. Literally. Even that keyhole Celestia used to unlock the room with the Elements in the beginning of S2 has been shipped with Celestia.
guys
What do you call an Aligator in a vest? c:
Oh I didnt know that
Discord + Disco RD
An INVESTAGATOR

Oh well my friend did
He is known abit around bronies

Nittany_Discord: Say whut :D

DocSane: thats the problem im too lazy to do that.

|Discord| THAT'S THE JOKE!

00,10We are all weird. so soon weird will be normal and we will mock the normals for being weird
you dont do that already Sumica?
Sumica: That reminds me of how being hipster is mainstream.
Sumica: there is no "normal" there is a average
6_9
Sumica: Crazy is already normal nowadays. Weird is just the next level down

Knowledge has made us synical, our cleverness hard and unkind. Why? Cause we use it to hurt others.
I torture myself to much.
This helps me with haters and trolls
11,01Sir_Brony: No video links during stream, please.

DimahMoonstar: hi

8,6I use my 3ds to play tetris >.>
AS I WAS SAYING
Sir_Brony: unless you have a ACTUAL CONTROLLER
|Discord|: You were referencing it. "Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too litle." Et cetera, et cetera.
Kammerjunk: I was?
kirzstryfe: you could use your PHONE to do that
Everything is attached, just the left side of it the hull seems loose
It's a very good speech. Very accurate.

Meh. I'm not really one for strong alcohols. Although I do have a bottle of rum. 80%.
Why is the rum gone?
I took a sip but once.
Nittany_Discord: which one? the alcometer or the troll dad?
/me cracks Spade-Magnes[R]'s face on a cinderblock. "Oi, don't steal my gimmick."

Oh and kirz scores a critical hit on otakon's self esteem.
Now, I do love me a good bottle of scotch.

Hey Bronysith 's favorite song! :3

Spade-Magnes[R]: nice, too bad it's still a niche system and has no backwards compatiblity
Ohh shining armor! I'll be there very soon!

Oh this song is awesome~
Spade-Magnes[R]: sound proof rooms
/me is ded
/me Respawns
um... the isle?
good song. terrible singer though to my taste
Spade-Magnes[R]: bc, you know Luna and THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE.
Spade-Magnes[R]: Hey, it's singing. I'm fairly certain every other character in a show with song is obligated to ignore anything if it's ung.
sung*
Come Bronysith can't you ever remeber that?
Play - Equstria Girls
Play that next please! :D
/me breaks Ponies47 s neck again
Somepony HAD to have had heard her singing this
You like This Day Aria, don't you Bronysith? http://i53.tinypic.com/igzvqe.jpg

Oi...
Spade-Magnes[R]: I guess he doesn't like Britt McKillip.
kirzstryfe and RAWRity have the right idea
Which is a shame, because Britt McKillip has done a lot of work.
Well, somewhat anyway.
I'm too tired to come up with a retort anyway
OneTrickPony: Anti dust?
Kammerjunk: what?
I tihkn mine would provoke a wat.. especially without the video

having a male alicorn means that Alicorns procreating is possible, which means people could techincally justify their alicorn OCs and that's horrible.

Yay thanks :D
Good point RAWRity
I have never owned any game console before PlayStation 2. I used to play PlayStation 1 and Gamecube a lot, but wasn't on mine.
Let's not do that
/me steals 80 cakes
I still get together about once a month with friends and play the origional smash bros. game
If you guys had a chance to become a pony and live in ponyville, would you accept it? (Your parents and family will come too)
RAWRity: you have to be of Lauren Faust status to justify any OC alicorn :/
I would accept it instantly.
11,01I started as a console gamer, but I started gaming in the NES era.
RAWRity: Except alicorn OC's are totally unjustifiable. With the exception of Fausticorn.
My_Little_Dashie: FUCK YES!
YES ABSOLUTELY
"Nuh-uh, my OC works! He's Celestia and Prince Pegacorn's son! and he's in love with Cadance and she totally likes him better than Shining Army!"
Pfff
>Shining Army
Oh, you.
uuuugh I'm not sure my parents would appreciate it
Meanwhile: Yep, in the universe Alicorns are demigods so OP
Nittany_Discord: ah, good times. Ever play Kirby's Adventure or Dragon Warrior man?
1000x better than Shining Armor
RAWRity: Are people really that stupid?
killerpony7733: That and it's just stupid.
unts unts unts
TheHoodyNinja: Ofc they are.
Its the internet man
11,01No.
TheHoodyNinja: HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE BAD OC TUMBLR?
Hello everypony.
nope
i would teach the royal canterlot gaurds to use m16s ohhhhhhhh that would be epic
hai Zappy|Tired
Living in a happy world where depression doesn't exist and there is no crimes?! How would they not like it?!
killerpony7733: The thing is, we've seen that Alicorns aren't goddesses. I mean, both Nightmare Moon, Discord AND Chrysalis defeated Celestia.
Nittany_Discord: dude, CLASSIC GAMES man
RAWRity: i donot interact with Tumblr
why? Is it a parody of some sort of good OC tumblr?
YES!
Maybe Celestia just sucks
11,01*psst*: People need to stop getting pissy about OCs.
Hello Jim.

Kammerjunk: correction, they aren't OMNIPOTENT goddesses. Gods aren't always invincible you know.
8,6*psst*: People need to stop getting pissy about ponies
YES!
who is getting pissy about ponies?
otakon: It's not even canon that they ARE goddesses.
I love this song!
wait, have i seen this oc before?
this is buttercream, she is a decedent of the royal canterlot family who was blessed by the gods with eternal youth, she was adopted by trixie where she was taught how to use magic, she later decide to join the wonderbolts where she became an expert flyer, she has surpassed spitfire in speed and skill, she then settled down in ponyville and became close friends with the apple family, she is now in ponyville and tries to find her
WHo was it that sings this?

That is sad
Nittany_Discord: True, Still people should try to confine that within certain borders that fit with the universe of the show
Doesn't WOoden Taoster mostly just do Music, not sinign?
Nittany: We shouldn't, but it's a lot of fun to.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0qvptLzj51rncbeqo1_500.png is very sad.
Nittany_Discord: we should if they try to create their imagination and it turns out terrible
11,01Not saying we shouldn't criticize bad ideas.
The definition of "bad" has been distorted way too far to encompass too much...
Nittany_Discord: there's imaginitive, and then there's making an OP mary sue character who can beat everyone at everything so that they can fullfill fantasies
I don't mind "OP" OCs as long as you don't use them for serious roleplay. Me, I wouldn't use an OC for anything, but if you just make music, I really couldn't care less how bad your OC is.
the hell?
RAWRity: exactly
User0: I'd say the word "entitled" has been distorted waaay more than bad
"I am Paramedic. I used to be a part of the Royal family, but was disowned after he joined the Navy. I fought in the war as a Corpsman. After that, I founded the Wonderbolts"

8,6which you may have guessed based on the current song :P
this song is so. hypnotic
For once I wish I could get some criticisim except nothing I make gets noticed
The Wrek is a lie.
08,01i've been working for the last 12 hours
to be fair, if you contact the runner of the tumblr, they're perfectly fine with taking it down.
Schism...This song is pretty awesome.
08,01i'm going to keep workign until 5pm tomorrow
It depresses me
I can't recall the name of this song for some reason. what is it?
RAWRity: Yeah i noticed that,

08,01except i took 2 hours off to eat pizza and drink port
Wait, someone on here had their OC put up on the badponyOC tumblr?

Pretty good. Why are you in pain?

00,10but yeah I would recomend keeping that to PM's
Liokin: dude, I've seen far worse. but you should KNOW the rules and that stuff is not supposed to be thrown about willy nilly.
kirzstryfe: I forgot about PM'ing I guess and just went ahead and dropped the wrong thing in the wrong area
Kammerjunk: mature content pony pic.
Ah.
Liokin: seriously dude wtf?
otakon: yeah yeah whine whine. I'm sorry guy I really dont wanna hear your mouth -lol
Liokin: it happens, so no worries eh?
Why do people draw that stuff?
TheHoodyNinja: cause I can. -lol
why do people draw anything?
because they wants to
Why is Wrek not on right now?
TheHoodyNinja: the same reason they draw tentacles: they want to.
TheHoodyNinja: because you touch yourself at night
AttacktheAndalite: OH CELESTIA!
Liokin: okay, I was trying to be nice but fine. it's obvious you don't give a damn if you made a mistake or not. I'm not whining ...
Sumica: Yeah, sorry about that. I wasnt thinking. Meh...

Mutterguy: He just said it was the original video with the dude dancing.

You know, if you listen closely, you can hear his man-boobs jiggle
You know, When I grow old, I'm going to look back on my years in the world and the first thing thats probably going to come to mind is this & all the other memes that have buried themselves deep in my brain
RAWRity: ohgodwhy

Bronysith: Yeah, but relative to how awesome she is, I think she's cuter.
Oh, so this is some music only and some normal videos. If I knew that, I wouldn't have cancelled.
I love this song
Sumica: Depends. which Jurassic Park?

Best pony?
MOTTE MOTTE
Yo! I haz question! has any anti bronies ever infiltated this most sacred of places?
TheHoodyNinja: Watch as it ends right before yours

Sumica: Jurassic Ponies would be awesome
Yes, we're going to make real magical talking poniez! With DNA from a mosquito, and genetic manipulation, and... oh shoot they don't just eat hay and baked goods run!
Sumica, they island project is destined to fail unless they can suplicate the effect of weather magic

Dovah: Sure they have. Plenty of times.
GODDAMMIT THE SONG OF BURNING PASSION!

RX-78-SweetieBot: What song is this?

Bronysith: why are you sitting on me? do I look like a bench?
Sweetie Belle: "Hammer"
Hammer.
otakon: ...
TheHoodyNinja: the running
So it's more or less 5 AM now - Should I go to sleep or just coffee it down like a man?
/me looks at otakon "yes.yes you do"
Kammerjunk: COFFEE! SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK.
otakon: looks more like speed walking
If all the Island Project gets is $40 a day, It'll take them over 41 years to get that island...I dont think this fandom will be around by then - It'll be just like Woodstock in the minds of those who were there :)
Kammerjunk: I recommend sleep.
otakon: Yeah, I say that all the time, but then I ended up paying the prize.
Kammerjunk: COFFEE NOW! :[
Reikim: But the stream!
Sleeep. Coffee is a crutch!
What kind of prize, Kammerjunk ?
Kammerjunk: Coffee like a man!
Kammerjunk: Same here, failed to sleep though atleast the painkillers i took for my headache is working, I may need sleep however
Kammerjunk: well, then sleep then. don't want to miss the movies later tomorrow do ya?
Why is the fandom stupid sometimes?
owlicious: Not being able to keep awake.
Kammerjunk: Coffee and energy drinks.
Kammerjunk: Ignore these loonies. Sleep now, enjoy more stream later. Greater gains this way.
Spade-Magnes[R]: bc, fandoms are sometimes.
Wooohooo! I usually need coffee for that
Spade-Magnes[R]: about what?
Reikim: Dude, sleep deprivation is so fun in the summer break.
They seriously hope to replicate magical ponies on a island?
oops
misread that
Are they insane?
Starring at my wallpaper didnt do anything.
Are they in-SAIYAN?
the ban me emergency system
Spade-Magnes[R]: oh that, I have no idea what they're thinking.
i liek this
Kammerjunk: I still say sleep. Sleeping is good for you.
otakon: Bah, it's my birthday party right after film night. I can stay awake through that.
Bronysith: would Fluttershy survive?
11,02Attack[Visser3]: It's a precautionary measure we place on silly fillies :3
11,02Just in case o___o
TheHoodyNinja: what?
Bronysith: Who?
I wonder though - is the 600k just for the island or will it include some building budget
SuperBrony64: Who else has an emergency ban system?
Reikim: Well, sleep -is- where my eyes go all crazy-like.
WhoahOhOh
SuperBrony64: But then...wouldn't we all be banned because we're all silly fillies in a way, some just siller than others :3
11,02Reikim: YOUR FACE
SuperBrony64: Okie..................doki.................loki :S
Who the hell would be crazy enough to fund the bastards?
Come on! Flying horses would be great!
this ban system is named after me

SuperBrony64: I'm offensive and i find this silly filly,

SuperBrony64: Does everypony have one? 6_9
And the chat has turned to utter chaos
SuperBrony64: I half expected you to slam a hammer on his head.
Okay, we need a horse that can do a sonic rainboom! Get the nitro and some paint / mist sprayers!
11,02Ponies47: Everypony has one~
RAWRity: ah, the early days of the net.

05,15Attack[Visser3] you haven't seen chaos yet
Chaos huh?
and put it on kickstarter
/me glomps SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: But you're a silly filly too, so...don't you have an emergency ban system? Can mods HAVE emergency ban systems?

SuperBomb64, do you accept cookies as anti explosifies?
I foresee many disapointed contributors when the project fails and nopony gets their money back

Best ship is USS Essess/
Well that was awkward

lol
they look so cute
this is the Kanto Gym Leader music from the Pokemon B/W 2 OST.
This reminds me that I cought them all
TheHoodyNinja: Rainbow Pie is a pretty good ship, too.
this is fun
PinkieDash - DerpyDash - AppleDash looks good
Kandarihu: You are HIRO
Idiots who think they can just waste millions and think it will get them somewhere should not be allowed to live
Kammerjunk: same thing...
we shuld lissen to raideo graffety
RAWRity: What. They're bringing back the Kanto leaders?
8,6TaviScratch is best ship
TheHoodyNinja: Yeah, I was just confirming you.

^^
^^^
kirzstryfe: Now there's a great ship if I ever saw one.
Lightning_Dash: Ghost?
Reikim: B/W2 has a "World Tournament" mode where you get to fight all the past gym leaders, champions, and elite 4. And even Red!
Spade-Magnes[R]: Huh where did you get that?
kirzstryfe: No, best ship is Titanic

05,15I dunno. i think the USS Ronald Regan is a pretty nice ship.
ya him

GHOST
An off button? I was planning on taking responsibility for starting it in the first place.
still your stomach?
fluttercry: like the boat, not so much the namesake
RAWRity: Aw, I was hoping they'd bring back the Kanto/Johto regions. Oh well, so much for that.
Bronysith: eh..
08,01nope, it's... other parts...
Reikim: hey, you want kanto/johto, you got HG/SS

08,01hey otakon
hmm. needs more Friends in Low Places.
hey SuperBrony64 did you know that NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams is coming to pc,xbox and psn ?
RAWRity: Meh, I'll take the originals any day of the week. But the internal battery on my Silver cart died :'(
08,01care to join me in SST?
05,15How about we make a pokemon game, where ALL the regions are open from the very beginning?
05,15Nah Cypresswolf
11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: OMG IKR, I'm SO EXCITED ;A;
fluttercry: But they have to at least PRETEND that there's a plot for you to follow.
If I met a brony hater, I wouldve knocked him out. Tied him up to a chair with a tv in front of him with MLP on it. I will leave him there for 3 days. But give him water and food.
05,15I might have plans for that in the future but I have to test some things first.
How about we make a pokemon game where we get 12 year olds to capture pokemon for us to experiment on
fluttercry: :) you're better off /)
Reikim: I honestly don't get people preferring the originals. Those games had some horrendous balancing issues.
08,01otakon: i was just trying to make a simple sandwich
Apple Jack Daniels
owlicious: So, you play as Professor Oak?
11,02I want NiGHTS into Dreams... now on all those systems ^.^
yep
RAWRity: its all nostalgia
:) Some mod should stream a few play throughs of SCP
RAWRity: It's the nostalgia filters. I've never played HG/SS, but I would probably enjoy them to be honest. What I don't like about the newer gens is the designs.
Dreams?
http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2013?px=3108963&pg=personal&fr_id=1441
Cypresswolf: Reactions too
fluttercry: no offense, but all 5 regions available for the entire game? That'd break the fucking power scale real fast.
just read that eh?
or you could be an item shop owner, but that's been done
Someone should serve some actual applejack at one of these conventions... well, afterwards anyway.
/me Sadness mod activited
:(
RAWRity: Character and location design generally went uphill. Pokemon design...not so much.
Save it for October, though :)
like a boss
05,15Screw your power scale! I want to make my own pokemon adventure!
"Okay, you beat region one with your lvl 20 pokemon. Now onto johto!
http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg this is funny
is applejack even part of jack daniels? All i can find is honey jack daniels
Well I feel depressed again, I dont know where to get help from it but bye everyone!
fluttercry: There's a tabletop game for that, I think. That or ROM hacking.
Everypony*
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG GREEN HILL ZONE
/me Sadness at level 1 :(
:3
05,15No no, you would have to put the same time into the regions as usual. It would just be a really really really long game
08,01loldepression.
owlicious: applejack daniels is a fan meme. But there is an actual drink called applejack, and it's apparently fairly easy (if time consuming) to make.
/me doesnt know whats going on but will act like he does
08,01fuck everything about it
Also illegal but what the heck.
fluttercry: Maybe five games. With one ongoing plot.
Have everypony turn off the light and watch the run through - freak out together and see who lasts the longest without muting or pausing the stream
05,15But that defeats the purpose of having all 5 regions.
/me Sadness mood deactived
:)
05,15I might as well just play the individual games again
fluttercry: But what game could possibly hold all ive regions? Maybe a console game...
fluttercry: again, that would basically man after your first region, you have a bunch of beefed up pokemon taht you can either walk through the next one with, or you end up fight all LVL 100s by the end of the game.
*mean after
and no
hen3ry: so what, do you have to crush your own apples to make it?
it's just freeze-distilled hard cider.
she's asking for donations for her marathon ride
RAWRity: The game could force an Ash and make you drop all your mons.
sweet
YEESSSSSSSSSS
08,01guys, killerpony7733 is stripping in you know where
yay
kirz is now best mod ever.
05,15RAWRity not if the pokemon in other regions are scaled to your level.
Reikim: it is canon
fresh apples would be important since you need the yeasts to ferment the alcohols.
you know, pledge so much money for her riding the distance
05,15THERE IS A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK DAMMIT
.......What :D
Reikim: then what's even the fucking point of not playing the separate games at that point.
also, HELL YEAH
RAWRity: not if the game makers make it like the series where Pikachu seems to reset in level in every new spinoff
Scratching dat Vinyl
THIS SONG
Bleach?
Inglesh
fluttercry: How about something from multiple perspectives?
u no spik eet
fluttercry: then they'd have to increase the lvl cap to like 200, which means even MORE time between learning moves.
Or Naruto...?
Vordox, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
Vordox: it is not crap anime
Oh
ah, neighpon.
8,6Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann OST - Sorairo Days [Tengen Toppa edition]
Vordox: IT IS GURREN LAGANN. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!
05,15There is no way to make this idea work is there...awww
Cypresswolf: again, still no point in it, if you're essentially restarting the game every new region, you might as well just play separate games.
ya know you just slow the leveling
Vordox: how do you not recodnize it? i dont even watch the show and i know it
best
fluttercry: Have the player play one game from one character's perspective, then switch and have them play another region, and have the five different plot threads link up in the end
05,15Can someone explain to me how a drill works?
anime music ever
fluttercry: if there was, don't you think Nintendo would have cash-grabbed the fuck otu of it?
Reikim: fluttercry needs to know how hte drill works
TheHoodyNinja: I read only good mangas, sorry =P
fluttercry: Actually that would be a really great fanfic project...
fluttercry: well it peirces the heavens and shit
Pokemon is what - in season 14 or something like that - Pikachu has been EVERWHERE, but still gets knocked out in half its battles :| I call BS on that
fluttercry: How does a drill work? HOW DOES IT WORK?
Vordox: I dont read manga, but i like anime
This anime was good until about chapter 12, then I decided to drop it for being boring
fluttercry mind if i draw your OC ?
fluttercry: A drill doesn't WORK. It EXISTS. It is an extension of your SOUL.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: this is me http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg
You know what the Pokemon anime should have done? They should have gone the way of the Pokemon Special manga.
Pokemon has 743 episodes total plus a bunch of specials and movies. ya for random fact!
Reikim: ogod this music is just win
Bronysith: hair cut and your ready for the bar
Where every new region we get a new plot/protagonist.
Bronysith Alright(?).
But RAWRity. That would imply competence on the writers' part. And it would imply them actually caring.
TheHoodyNinja: im not going to drink
Wow... just wow
Reikim: it wouldn't even need to be competent. They could literally just adapt the manga.
I got all the way to the elite 4 in Black version before I resorted to using my Even pokemon
RAWRity: Also I just suggested the region/protagonist thing.

Why didnt they keep May?
Eddmario: i posted that like 100 times today mate
TheHoodyNinja: See the "Ash is in a coma" theory.
08,01otakon: they breed
Eddmario: and that's how Molestia woke up with a distended anus
otakon: to be fair, Dawn was worse than him.
Eddmario: um...a little much man.
Eddmario: haha
RAWRity: yeah, but she wasn't battling
also, apparently Brock is back for the 2nd B/W anime.
Pokemon is the next Simpsons, when it started airing in the US in 1998 - I was 13 - I feel old O_o
Eddmario: I mean funny, but slightly inappropriate
A Lannister always pays his debts
Guys, don't you know? Ash is in a coma the entire time.
oooh i know... Gold/Silver and Diamond /pearl set in the present and RED/BLuE is supposed to be in the pastas well soooo maybe you make it something similar to Chrono trigger
THE CHAMP IS HERE
This has been explained. He had to get rid of May because he was becoming attached to her.
Hallo thar Bronystate (O_O)/"
meow
in the pastas? Sounds tasty
hi Randall1160
hai
Mutterguy: no, NO time travel and pokemon and don't you DARE compare the two.
hiya Randall1160 how ya been man?
8,6the just need to let Ash evolve into a gym leader and find a new lead
Kamina: Throw away your logic and kick reason to the curb! Beautifully following the golden road!Simon: If there's a wall, we'll knock it down! It's a road built with these hands! Kamina and Simon: The Magma of the Heart's Final Ignition! Perfect Unification! Gurren-Lagann!Simon: Who do you-Kamina: All of you!Kamina and Simon: THINK WE ARE?!
geeewwddd gooooddd
kirzstryfe: there you go.
people trying to find continuity in the Pokemon games are like the people who try to map out a timeline of all the Zelda games: effort in futility
kirzstryfe: never gonna happen.
/me nods his head
Bronysith: goddammit words to friggin live by.
I wonder what would happen if Team Rocket FINALLY gave up on getting Ash's Pikachu...
kirzstryfe: Blasphemy. They can't POSSIBLY break the status quo. Heck, next you might suggest that they introduce an actual overarching plot.
Ash doesnt seem to age much in the series, wasn't he 10 in the original?
derp i know this... wut is it!!!
Eddmario: what is they succeded?
pikachu probably has 10 pikachus by now
*ash probably ...
How old is Ash portrayed as now?
Dovah: 3 days grace time of dying
15?
Cypresswolf: IIRC, he's now all the way up to 11
still young
Cypresswolf: like 13 I think
TheHoodyNinja: thanks
ash should be in his twenties
RAWRity: There's continuity now. G4 is confirmed as happening before G5, and G5 gets a direct sequel.
so should Bart Simpson
Cypresswolf Still 10. He's like a Twilight "vampire" mixed with a TimeLod
*Time Lord
that explains how he survives lightning
Eddmario: with no Time Lord redeeming qualities sadly
Eddmario: im a time lord sith brony
:D 14 years to tell a 3 year story and no one ages - seems legit
he's exactly like the simpsons
Reikim: ah, but what part of G4 happened first? D/P or HG/SS?
RAWRity: Also G1 comes before G2, since you fight Silver. It's only with G3 that the timeline got muddled.
Mutterguy: the simpsons need to die already
Bronysith Hah, I'm a Shadowlord. Specifically a Guardian.
RAWRity: HG/SS also muddled the timeline.
Reikim: because THERE IS NO TIMELINE.
RAWRity: It's, again, like the Zelda series. There's a timeline. It's just stupidly convoluted and not given to us.
05,15Okay that was weird
MFW irish_pony s oc is on worst tumblr http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg
Ah, i love this site, talk about one thing then another and forget the first thing entirely
http://imgur.com/gallery/neVmK
All we know is that G/S and HG/SS comes after R/B and FR/LG and the B/W is followed by B/W 2, and there is POSSIBLY a hint that D/P is before B/W
8,6up next, a very, very, very bad rendition of Winter Wrapup
I play a game to enjoy it not question its time line
05,15Cypresswolf what about The Simpsons? They've been around forever and are still the same age
I dare not bring logic into this equations because there isnt any - season 1 there are only 151 known worldwide - then Johto comes along and suddenly 100 new pokemon never seen before are well known world wide O_o
Next

I think I hear Saxy.

Reikim: Shy, dari I can tell out
Singing over skype must be hard
8,6nope, this was from back in october
Bronysith That picture replaced the gray box behind the chat box
is that shizu?
That Rarity makes it better
kirzstryfe: still seems like a day and a age ago
/me 13does not and will not have a microphone
kirzstryfe: So why didn't you all record it over in Bronycon when all was there? XD
Mutterguy: no, that's Shy a mod who left quite awhile agao.
kirzstryfe Was this when there were only 2 or 3 Bronystate mods?
Shizuka: hello dear, how are you tonight?
I missed a lot before I joined Bronystate, didn't I?
Shizuka's voice is fucking powerful?
ooh I remember her
Shizuka: I will send you a microphone

Were you guys drunk or something?
kirzstryfe: (criies) MAKE IT STOP OH MAKE IT STOP! D:
fluttercry: The thing with the Simpsons is its run its course, there is no humor in it anymore - no new ideas - it was funny as hell in the first several seasons, but after 20+ years, I dont know why they keep making more eps
Attack[Visser3]: I joined up in October
kirzstryfe: laughing at mods is fun
kirzstryfe: It was worth it XD
How much "cider" did they have before singing that?
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/6068713466/mount-ragemore i say we tear down mount rushmore adn replace it with this

Nothing but white!
fluttercry: god i hope so

is anything going on in sst?
cute
fluttercry: probably not until Jack Black needs the money
RAWRity: so...never?
Maybe when Gaben decides to make Episode 3
Incoming great solo
05,15Then again, sequels are rarely as good as the first. Except for Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Godfather Part 2
Bronysith: considering how some of his latest movies have flopped, I imagine he'll get to it eventually
And by these tunes, I'll say good night
RAWRity: yea
G'night Bronystate
Night, Jim.
night Jim
rule of advice
night Jim
fluttercry: Lethal Weapon, Police Academy
fluttercry: If the makers of Epic Movie can still get away with making similar movies, I don't see how Tenacious D can't
night Jim
So if we had the Cutie mark crusaders as different beatles, would we want Silver Spoon as John Lennon?
05,15I forgot all about Lethal Weapon!

NEVER EAT BROWNIES before going to a pink floyd or aussie pink floyd show. you will regret it and want to murder your troll of a brother

Woo Hoo ^_^ Tomorrow's friday and pay day!
05,15One of those movies where everyone made it out to be SOOOO FUNNY so no matter what it's disappointing

RAWRity: better be good
tripe?
fluttercry: I want to see Ted

Ban/kick evasion is, if I remember correctly, rather frowned upon.
Reikim: Yeah full ban i thinkz
Reikim: ban evasion yes
So just listening to music I see, or rather, hear
can't do anything about kick evasion
Ban evasion results in permaban, iirc.

otakon: Why even bother? You can just rejoin after a kick.
but you've seen me, I get kicked too goddamn much at times it's aggravating
I've only been banned from one site, man I wish Gendou would let me back
Reikim: still aggravating
lol RAWRity that made my day
night
er...
whatever
Kicking's not much of a hassle, really. And the rules are in there for a reason.
weve all been kicked
I've seen enough TiaraWhy that I can't unhear Queen Chrysalis, Pinkie, and Twilight in the background
ive never been banned before though
Auto-kicked, usually.
I haven't been ki..... never mind
I got banned for a day :D
The message limit kick. Actually quite effective in slowing things down.
I've never been banned.
And I got kicked once because I was having issues with my nick.
ive been kicked as a joke before, wich really isnt that funny
I toe that line between inappropriate and hilarious
Reikim: Think it's 1 sec before each message
I avoided the auto-kick a few times, hilarious to see a chat just stop, then spam with why I was kicked questions
RAWRity: Not always successfully.
I believe the only times I've gotten kicked were either for my roommate typing something on here when I was taking a leak, or when I use the proper definition of certain words...
RAWRity: i wouldnt say hilarious persey
your too young to play persona
Reikim: still never gotten banned.
05,15TheHoodyNinja what are you talking about, it's hilarious.
evening, everypony! :) How are we all tonight?
fluttercry: what is hilarious?
Attack[Visser3]: Ouch
05,15Joke kicks
Sylandest: Hiya sylandest
Hello, Sylandest
hi
hi every pony
RAWRity is not hilarious, per se. More accurately, he is damn hilarious. I admire his ability to tow said line with a modicum of tipping to either side.
/me attempts to kick fluttercry, but misses and sprains ankle
Yeah but only the mod and the person they kicked gets it
fluttercry: oh yea
/me waves at killerpony7733, Attack[Visser3], mitamaking , TheKoreanBrony1354
I SENSE SOMEONE WILL GET KICKED IN A MATTER OF SECONDSSS! who can it BEEEE???!!!
/me gets Nyx and ice pack
Reikim: somebody is a fan~
Vordox: probably otakon
huh?
8,6when you get kicked, there's a message that tells you why you were kicked
bye Vordox
what about kicks?
mitamaking: I think they are slow on the uptake. :P
TheHoodyNinja: Nah, I was just taking the opportunity to be excessively eloquent on an IRC channel.
argh kickbots..BANE OF MY ONLINE EXISTENCE
otakon: We can tell
Reikim: good job, wanna medal
I thought it was shipping otakon
TheHoodyNinja: Yes, actually. What's it made out of?
seriously i have a box full of these things i have NO IDEA what to do with

Pokémon the first movie right
wow, Pokemon?

I CAN GET THE RESIDENT EVIL 6 DEMO NOW
That song take me back - I remember standing in line for that movie JUST to get the promo card
huzzah
Man I did not like this movie
05,15Remember when Ash got turned to stone. I didn't cry at that part.
otakon: BUTTHURT
otakon: inb4 your internet cuts out as it's downloading
The first movie was the best movie.
otakon: im so butthurt
kenne: dude, I'm sorry but it's ON the Dragon's Dogma disc
8,6fluttercry, yes you did, don't lie :p
kenne: you wouldn't be able to play it remember?
2000 and 3 are best Pokemon movies
I stopped watching Pokemon after I saw the Jirachi movie
otakon: my friends were rubbing it in my face the other day becuase they just got the game and they know im a big rezi fan :(
I cried when Ash turned to stone.
I enjoyed the first movie because it was so much more...mature? than the rest of the series. It was deeper and more sophisticated.
05,15No really, I actually didn't. I knew they wouldn't kill him off.
mitamaking Sillypony, that's not how you spell Poemon 4Ever
kenne: well that does suck. I'm sorry again I couldn't give ya the code.
O_O You know what else - This movie came out BEFORE dvd's
05,15Reikim soooo the opposite of the Digimon movie?
8,6Pokemon 2000 was the best imo, they were on a roll from the first, and they hadn't started to get repetitive yet
05,15Cypresswolf VHS is best format
Nyx: Maybe if the dub hadn't ripped out the real plot I may agree
otakon: well at least the release ate got pushed forward
date*
fluttercry: Heck Yeah! /)
fluttercry: Ahaha, too bad I never watched Digimon...yeah. My childhood was pretty bland.
1 and 4 are my least favorite
fluttercy You better not be hating on Digimon...
That first Pokemon movie kicked ASS!
8,6lol
fluttercry i still own a BETA player :p
Mewtwo was a great villain after they put his backstory back in.
oh i JUST now realised kirz changed his color
In fact 2>3>>7>??5>6>>>>>1>4
The greatest crime: Ash and Misty never getting together in Pokemon
RAWRity: It's a kid's show. They'll never do a serious ship.
Hell. Yes
RAWRity: I am praying the new season fixes that
RAWRity: IKR RIGHT!
05,15RAWRity you mean May and Ash right?
second greatest crime: Tai and Sora never getting together in Digimon
Bucky O'Hare
And i find 2000 great, but anticlimatic
Hell yes Balloon Party.
Well FINALLY y'all play mah song!
:):)
surely you mean gary
I mean they brought back DAWN, who care about Dawn
Until last summer i had one of those old tvs that you had to pull the volume knob out to turn on and press it in to turn off. It also had VERY sensitive channel buttons, and we used the VHS that was hooked up to it to watch TV
One /) to anyone who loved this album.
mitamaking WAIT............NEW SEASON WITH MISTY IN IT????
Reikim: (\
fluttercry: psh, all may had going for her was her unusually large chest for a 10 y/o
05,15Exactly
Reikim: (\ Also, Balloon Party|After Party came out yester
Dark92Enigma: I am crossing my fingers she is, the plot is about the grand tournament
I liked Dawn the best, personally
The only VCR I own anymore is one of those old box tv sets - 13"
Misty actually had a connection with Ash. plus 2000 made it obvious she liked him.
Attack[Visser3]: ...Must DL now.
Reikim: Do iiit.
Is 2000 cannon?
Also misty and ash never really hooked up at all or anything throughout all the seasons?
8,6pretty sure he never got her a new bike though
As i was saying, 2000 was great, but i personally find the first movie better (NO SPOILERS ABOUT MEWTWO RETURNS, please)
mitamaking: as much as any of the other movies I suppose
kirzstryfe: That's because he's in a coma.
8,6?
No remote either - You have to get up & manually change the channel :O Isn't that shocking?
kirzstryfe: Her bike got fixed when they came back after Johto
kirzstryfe he did, but it got destroyed again
kirzstryfe: pokemon theory that the entire series has been Ash's hallucinations while in a coma
mitamaking The Great Tournament? Something like a bigger Pokemon League?
kirzstryfe: Never heard that one before? It's been floating around the internet since...G2 or 3, I think.
8,6lol
good lord, what was the vocalist in this song doing?
kirzstryfe: It's horrible because it makes a scary amount of sense.
Dark92Enigma: Have you been following Black and White 2 news?
lulz?
05,15something something indoctrination theory something something
wtf?
mitamaking, honestly no......(i feel left out)
I must have at leat 100 vcr tapes full of stuff I taped in the 90's
11,01La.
this is new
Dark92Enigma: Pokemon B/W 2 has "World Tournament" in the games that allows the player to fight all the past gym leaders, elite 4, champions, and even Red.
http://i.imgur.com/lXd21.jpg
Dont even know whats on them anymore - figure one of these days Ill make time to watch them again
Okay, in the new games there is a major tournament of previous characters, people like Blue and Misty show up in it, Cynthia eluded to it in Black and White, well the plot of the new season is the grand tournament I believe
RAWRity: I can't wait to hate Lance again.
RAWRity: Is Red confirmed?!?!?!
RAWRity: IKR GOD DAMN THAT BASTARD
mitamaking: I believe so, yes.
Awesome
RAWRity: Gary was a cakewalk in comparison.
RAWRity WOW, i mean......Pokemon is becoming INTERESTING to watch/play AGAIN??????? OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
Reikim: Jokes on him, I'mma get an ice type and FUCK HIM UP
ONE MORE THING!
Dark92Enigma: Black and White were good games
05,15I liked pokemon before they started doing all the weird stuff like natures
DRAGON/FLYING? FUCK YOU ICE. ICE EVERYWHERE.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljtkofwaZ11qf087qo1_1280.png
Dark92Enigma: thats only because they're bringing back all the stuff people loved
/me hated fighting N during the final battle
Fear of Lance, please, my Feraligator knows Ice Fang
oooooo
Well, I'm off. See ya'll later.
RAWRity: I'mma repeat my G1 strategy by getting a plant-type, teaching it Sleep Powder, and riding that shit all the way through the game. CAN'T USE HYPER BEAM IN YOUR SLEEP
I know I have some WCW, WWF matches, a bunch of specials TLC used to have about technology & space, anime from CN from original Toonami....not sure what else
mitamaking So i heard, but i pleayed until RED BLUE i guess
Reikim: better boost its speed somethin feirce
G'night.
mitamaking played¨*
So you plated the first game and that is it?
RAWRity: But of course! Weepinbell has some nice speed to start with, so no worries~
why does dubstep sound all the same?
*played
i always hated dubstep until this fandom, its amazing what ponies can do
08,01Bronysith: because WUB WUB WUB
RAWRity: And if that fails, I get a Gardevoir with Hypnosis and Thunder. AHAHAHAHA
and thats just from memory - been over 10 years since I watched any of those tapes
Reikim: Feraligator used Ice Fang, it is super effective :)
gonna be honest, in terms of game mechanics and story, B/W were the best games in the series.
mitamaking Wait, THAT WAS THE FIST GAME? I'm confused,.......what's the game themed after Hoenn????
I wish I didn't live in the middle of nowhere. I'm hungry...
Ruby and Sapphire
RAWRity: I concur. But those pokemon designs...with a few exceptions, I just can't handle them.
mitamaking THAT'S THE ONE
8,6back in my day, you had to catch an abra at L5 and swap-level him to 20 if you wanted a psychic type, we didn't have these fancy pokemon with their attack abilities at the start of the game /endoldmanrant
Reikim: eh, the designs were okay to me. Plus, I just used the ones with the best ones.
Well, at least play Heart Gold/ Soul Silver, Gen 2 remakes, brillant
kirzstryfe: /)
05,15kirzstryfe GENWUNNER
/me dat old man style complaing
RAWRity IT'S OFFICIAL.....gonna find an emulator, and play Pokemon B/W!!!!!!!!
RAWRity: Character designs, though, hit their peak in G5. I especially enjoy the non-girly female protagonist.
kirzstryfe: Ikr? Nowadays Psychics are op and you dont even work for it
/me never was a big pokemon fan
back in my day, you had to catch a caterpee or metapod and it would only know string shot and harden
kirzstryfe: in my day, Psychic types were broken as fuck and the power balance was shit, so I went to the new days where the games work like they should.
I didn't even train a psychic in Gen 5
please dont kill me
(\ Jspang1
TheHoodyNinja: Nope, Dark-Types and Ghost-types eat Psychic for breakfast.
05,15Gen 1 is best Gen
Gen 2 is best gen
Stallion_of_War: /)
TheHoodyNinja: OP? dude, there's an entire TYPE that Psychic attacks don't work on.
kirzstryfe: In mah day I had to power-level to 60 just to challenge the Elite Four!...And I still have to!
I started drawing a ponified version of The Master from The End of Time :)
kirzstryfe: I raised him FROM SCRATCH ever time.
Reikim: When do you ever encounter those, though? Srsly i never caught a ghost/dark type through red or gold
In my day Gyrados were blue
the hell is this?
Red & Blue were so one sided if you had a psychic type
fluttercry: not me, God I miss Mr. Fish
TheHoodyNinja: See, that was red/gold. Red didn't have Dark. Gold had them in some places.
Funfact: as a kid I had no idea how types worked, so I just grinded my pokemon to 10 lvls above the Gym leaders and brute forced my way through everything.
1 hit KO's most everytime
8,6I remember when steel and dark were novel
RAWRity: That is basically what I still do, only I am equal level and cussing at bad critical hits
Reikim: yeah but you didnt need to swap level a psychic type by the time they fixed that
05,15yeah i got screwed in yellow.
Lemons! I'll make you take the lemons back!
what am I listening ti?
05,15I had to raise a butterfree for Brock
I don't want your **** lemons!
8,6grinding the safari zone trying to catch that dratini, then having to level it 40 levels to be useful
What am I supposed to do with these??
fluttercry there are mankeys on the way to the indigo plateu
fluttercry: You didn't catch the Bellossom?
kirzstryfe: But my Dratini knows Extreme Speed :p
First time I beat Pokemon Red, I was down to my last pokemon, Primape, who had 15 HP left. It scored a critical hit on Blue's Blastoise and knocked it out. FUCK YEAH
05,15eenope
Butterfree best pokemon
Funfact: on my second playthrough of Yellow, I beat broc with a Kakuna
8,6extreme speed didn't exist :P
Butterfree, a pink one in Crystal, my only shiny ever
^
fluttercry: I hated magicarp, I had the patience to raise all my pokemon equally, but magicarp I thought were useless - until I saw Garados for the first time - O_o What pokemon evolves into that?
unfortunately in gen 1 bug pokemon sucked alot
kirzstryfe: god I hated Dratinit, so hard to catch.
good morning! :)
Did he just describe Derpy's god?
05,15RAWRity did you harden him to death?
In Crystal, I can't move it up
Cosmic muffin?
allo derpy_pony
Cypresswolf: the greatest ofc
/me loved his Gyrados
otakon: gross man
8,6had a Scizor in Silver, that was nice :)
Dat give up
On my first time beating the Rival, I got really lucky with Sleep Powder and half his Mons being weak to Grass.
fluttercry: yes, actually. Hardened until his onix couldn't hurt me much, then ran out of PP, and used struggle until Onix died, with Kakuna have 3 HP left.
Bronysith: not THAT way ya sicko
/me had a garydos but never used it
Scizor, names Bro, gen 2 is my bi***
05,15lol
/me thumbs up at song
I call it the War of Attrition strategy
yay
RAWRity: Combine that with Toxic and you've got aparty.
Sand Attack! Insta-Rage at every use
Was Toxic in gen 1?
8,6it was
That day, a lvl 9 Kakuna that only knew Harden beat a lvl 12 onix.
Yes this song! Shot what was the name of it?
mitamaking: I think it was signature for the Muk family?
8,6TM from Koga
oh yeah
05,15My team in Yellow is OP. all three starters, pidgeot, pikachu and an HM slave
Gen 1, broken wrap too
I had like 8 pokemon on blue that were on lv100, then I attempted to catch a missingno, game kept glitching
kirzstryfe: What's the name of this song?
because dammit, that Kakuna WANTED TO EVOLVE and he was gonna do it even if it meant killing himself.
8,6The Stars Will Aid In Her Escape (Cosmic Love)
Cosmic Love
Anyone here play games like Quake or Doom at the age of 8 or 9?
kirzstryfe: Thank you :)
Cypresswolf: yes
I'm so glad B/W got rid of TM slaves
fluttercry: Blastoise, Charizard, Pikachu, Bellossom, Primape, and Dugtrio. I wrecked shit.
RAWRity: if it died it wouldn't evolve, that is a dumb kakuna
*HM
mitamaking: it was a DETERMINED kakuna
They got rid of HM slaves?
Did you keep it on the team?
RAWRity: both start with a D
05,15they got rid of HM slaves?
05,15WHY?
gonna download Florence + The Machine
mitamaking: That wasn't the point. It was a test of the Kakuna's manliness. And it passed.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4045/
well they made using HMs optinal in the meta-game
fluttercry: because it was pointless. in B/W you only have to use Cut ONCE to advance the plot.
I beat Erika with my HM slave in Gen 1, that ratata leveled up alot
didn't have to use it as much
TheHoodyNinja: And you got those mixed messages from your parents too, right? games with blood and violence A-OK - cartoons like Beavis & Butthead or Ren & Stimpy - Not OK
05,15RAWRity really? huh
the rest of the HM uses are just for your own purposes/exploring the world
Never watched either of those
5AM, bed time. Night everypony.
fluttercry: B/W was also generous enough to GIVE you the version legendary.
goodnight Meanwhile
Night, Meanwhile
RAWRity: Well Surf, but I always taught that to my starter anyway
night Meanwhile
/me watches as the chat debates about Pokemon
night Meanwhile
05,15Cypresswolf my parents were cool. They knew that I knew none of it was real and I was smart enough not to try any of the stuff I saw, so I could pretty much do anything.
Night Meanwhile
Cypresswolf: i was watching family guy and robot shicken at 7. lol my parents dont care what i watch
mitamaking: nope. Don't even have to use surf in B/W to finish the storyline
Sure you did.... wait
8,6Last song for me tonight, hope you all enjoyed it, and if you didn't, here's something special for you ^_^
TheHoodyNinja: or act, really. I can cuss around both my parents

RaveBrony Yes mitamaking Hmm possibly?
fluttercry: when you turn on spotify, go to the top where your picture and name are. Click on it, and a little menu should pop up. Click "private session" and nobody will know what you're listening to.
okay guys, it's been fun but I'm out for now
So Bronystate has it's official cutie mark, all in favor say aye
Round and round and round it goes... when will it stop? Only mods know :3

rofl
/me Listens to the Robot Hell song From Futurama
Sylandest: The screen is failing, the wiring around it is frayed and it finally gave out. I'm hoping it can be repaired for Saturday's show, but it's a 4 year old machine. I'm honestly waiting for "We can't repair it."
great song by the way. you should look it up.
Grr how am I expected to write this fic without sound?:|
Dovah: Improvise!

You know, I've got a friend who's still running a computer with DDR2 memory
Sylandest: Tell me about it, but the worst part is, I have no money what-so-ever to get a new one :(. I'm up a certain creek some might say.
use everfree radio?
youtube repeater?
Everlasting_Joy: indeed. It's time to start digging for money to get a replacement if it cant be fixed. Sad to say, but I did so when I needed a comp, and it worked out alright in the end
I can pick 2 options, 1.favor for going to sleep. 2. Stay awake and stay on bronystate :D
there is no option 1, it doesn't exist

Batman SPANK YOU!
ohai saxy
0,14oh hai everyone
ohai SaxyPretender
SolairePony89: Oh. I couldn't just put the number 47 I had to spell it Out like this Ponies Forty-Seven
SaxyPretender: i blame you
0,14>Visser 3
http://tinypic.com/r/34yo51w/6
Ohai SaxyPretender :P
my pony
0,14Animorphs reference?
0,14I do too
SaxyPretender: Nah, I just decided to make it up on ya--yes
Dang I finally got home. i just walked from my dad's house home
*Moopy has joined chat* hey everypony whats up
allo xxMoopyxx
allo
0,14<3 Animorphs
'Ello xxMoopyxx
Ello
Animorphs?
SaxyPretender: Fuckin' yeah. That's how I met one of my longtime friends
never read the books, but the covers were nice
:$
Yo xxMoopyxx! :)
Does that still exist in some form?
yo
0,14nah, the series ended years ago
The Andalites in the TV show look different than the drawings on the Scholastic site
So whos going to stream tonight?
I'd like to have one as a roommate, though.
0,14oh yeah, there was a TV series
The tv show didnt last long....
/me would totally pay a couple bucks for Pipsqueak's Thunder Plunder
They have episoes on YouTube, not sure how many.
soo
how have you been SaxyPretender?
0,14I've been all right
Attack[Visser3]: i know. i meant to play it
0,14been playing Soul Calibur V most of the day
oh neat
Hey everypony is there a final season for MLP or what?
I remember enough of the Animorphs TV show to know that Stephenie Meyer stole the bad guys from that to use in "The Host"
i got 4 around here somewhere
xxMoopyxx no one knows atm
I never read "The Host".
whats atm?
oh wait i got it
at the moment
0,14ah, 4, the one that almost killed the franchise @_@
literally all we know right now is that there is a 3rd season.
there is certainly a final MLP season. We may just not know at the time we're seeing it
that's all.
at the moment
why is that?
0,14a lot of people didn't like it
We don't know if there will be another, or how many eps there are, or when S3 starts, or anything else
0,14because it was slow in comparison to the earlier games
all we know: S3 will happen some time in the future
/me is now the chat's resident Andalite
0,14and because people didn't like the Star Wars characters
so many zubats... ugh
lol
Hey im not to sure you guys herd this or not but theres this video called phoenix wright of my little pony this guy nameed pwaamlpfim and hes making part 4 i guess did he put it up or what?
0,14so after 4, Namco decided it wasn't worth making more
I think they're still setting up that, you know with voice acting and editing and all
well im just waiting for part 4 to come out
0,14until the old Project Souls team decided, "we don't want our last game to leave a bad impression, so let's make a good Soul Calibur game"
0,14and then they did
yep
i played nightmare alot
Cause its like been days and i need to find out what happens to them
0,14Nightmare was awesome
Not yet he was looking for some new voice actors
0,14Patience, young grasshopper
I wish i could be the voice acter
acting classes helps
0,14^
what are you talking about bro?
0,14just about every voice actor will say,
0,14"take acting classes if you want to be a VA"
sure you could make silly voices, but there's also acting as well
0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^
My voice is just for telling stories
One does not simply, Become a VA
i kicked so much AI ass with him
Everybody knows the way to becoe a Voice Actor is to promise to marry an aspiring mangaka as long as he makes a manga that's big enough to get an anime that you can play the lead heroine in. /BakumanLessons
Hmmmm
found out how to soul break with im..
Sounds similar to Detective Conan, RAWRity.
Not identical; SIMILAR.
loved when i found out those finishers
Polydunami: never read mre than a few chapters of that series.
0,14as much as being a VA would be a dream job of mine, not sure how good I would be at it
Hang on a minute im going to check real quick if he already put it up or not ok
0,14oh those were so awesome to do
0,14but not very practical against human opponents >.<
I'm gonna guess no
SaxyPretender: you could always take the Vic Mignagna route and get famous despite only having, like, 3 voices
0,14the few times I've acted, it's been kinda more expression in a physical manner
nope
unless they loved to block
or in patrick warburton's case, only one
0,14indeed
Welp going to sleep, Bye everypony
nighty killerpony7733
Peace
0,14Guilmon and Leeron
SaxyPretender: and Amon. and like half the voices in Great Teacher Onizuka
Nope.avi he didn't put it up yet
0,14Amon's closer to what he normally does though
so yeah, Blum does have a recognizable voice, but he also has some damn fine range when directors give him a good role.
0,14my personal favorite roles from him will still be BlackWarGreymon and Yamaki
Vic, not so much
Hey ponies47 you still here bro?
he has a range from 12 year old boys...to 13 year old boys
0,14heh
SaxyPretender: Ever play Bulletstorm? He did a great job voice acting there
0,14haven't played Bulletstorm >.<
You really need to fix that. Game is fun as all hell
0,14so I've heard
Nuts, I haven't even HEARD of Bulletstorm :S
0,14and speaking of me acting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fD8kE2LyU8
It's like "I played edward elric! and...um...the guy from Kekaishi!
"
Damn shame that Bulletstorm didn't sell well
0,14watching that vid again, i don't think I emote with my voice enough
drinkable snacks, huh..
"increasing the drankitude of our snack line"
awww dang it they don't got it in games in there
SaxyPretender: I like how the first related video t that is a Soilwork song.
0,14so it is
:(
0,14never heard Soilwork before
0,14of even OF them
SaxyPretender: they make some pretty good stuff
Lets so what's going on. On the Ponies47 Youtube page :P

SolairePony89: You sent me a freind request I accpected it. :3

Ponies47: Eeyup :P

SolairePony89: Yep :P
Go there now ponies47
. . . but she gave no reaction when I called her Sweetie Belle
or Sugarcube
I hope she didn't get too frightened by the Deceptive Cadance.
lol
I think the effect only works on girls
I called my older brother my BBBFF and i got a remote through at me =_=
Oh while your there click the black screen there you shoot rockets
haha
:D
Polydunami nah, she just said stuff like "She's mean" and whatnot
RaveBrony ROFL
I guess it doesn't work on guys unless they are bronies too
He hates that im a brony, so it was understandable :D
Well, that's nice.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dRdwWhFvns
RaveBrony: Sounds like a nice fellow
She also told my Grandparents that Rainbow Dash was by GF.

Somehow, my sister found a t-shirt with this on it and asked my mother to buy it for me http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.10203779.3789/fc,550x550,black.jpg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM
Kinda wish she did . . .
Lunar_Brony: Thats cute :D
RaveBrony: Ouchy. That wasen't nice of your brother. My brother will never be my BBBFF. NEVER -_-
Ponies47: I feel ya there....
My goodness your sister is just too adorable and somehow understanding
Ponies47 I am a BBBFF :$
My younger bro has coped with it tho! :) Constantly pointing out pony stuff for me :P
RaveBrony: After all the (squee) I've told you guys about him yeah -_-
/me Hugs Lunar_Brony
I cant have a BBBFF only be a BBBFF
I am the oldest so...yeah
Lightning-Quill as much as I love her, she annoys the crap out of me at times. Whenever she asks what I'm doing on the computer, she asks if I'm going to watch MLP
My parents dont care anymore, they even bought me a Dj Pon-3 t-shirt! :)
they have MLP pillows at Walmart :o
RaveBrony awesome parents
no Rarity ones.... :(
TASTE THE 90'S CHEESE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM
Lunar_Brony: Youre parents dont like that youre a brony?
RaveBrony that makes me very ruslted
Ponies47: http://www.walmart.com/ip/My-Little-Pony-Pillow-Pinkie-Pie/16651248
RaveBrony I went to Wal-Mart and found "Do their mane" toys
:o
RaveBrony they don't mind.
funniest cmment on that video: somebody saying that BSB are copying One Direction
Lunar_Brony: Alright then, good :)
RaveBrony: Mom don't care I'm a brony dad still doesn't know :s
^
Like I said before I am going to buy MLP shirts from hottopic
Ponies47: Dang...thats tough....
only Twilight and Pinkie Pie pillows though
Ponies47: My parents are divorced, and I spend most of my time with my mom, so that's why my dad doesn't know
My younger bro told my dad i was a brony.... but hell, im so weird already my father couldnt help but laugh :D
RaveBrony: Well my likes the fact I watch MLP I'm to scared to tell my dad :S
I remember the day my friend told my parents and my sister I was a brony. Just about strangled him.
but now he's a brony too
Hahaha
Nice
I have the perfect way to tell parents/ friends that you're a brony
Ponies47: Why? D:
Brony on brony violence is bad, m'kay
it is?
Only if it's not entertaining.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0EjwF8o0g I found some more '90s nostalgia
Both my parents know and they don't seem to mind but my dad teases me
RaveBrony last April Fool's Day, I shut my mouth as an April Fool's joke
the reactions were priceless
Lunar_Brony: Lolwut? :D
RaveBrony: Some of the ways he acts sometimes and my parents are divorced to.
Best way to tell your parents or friends is to make a CD full of Brony music then put it in your car and then roll around bumping those jams
0,14so I herd you like 90's stuff
Ponies47: Oh....
Admit it, you listened to this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfhhWA9GF0M

13so.. got a code going at least halfway through the rotor chain
0,14I see RAWRity is doing his best Radio Disney impression >.>
13not sure if it's coming out the other end right yet
the way i showed my mom is a brony is by going to buy MLP shirts wih her
13and doesn't build up the buffer right
Aaron Carter: the Justin Beiber of the 90's
13but other than that, it's working!
RaveBrony: Yeah. He can have mood swings. He's been in a pretty decent mood lately but I'm gonna wait a little bit longer :S
RaveBrony I talk a lot. I over-exagerate my hand gestures and facial expressions and make lots of MLP references. On that day, I talked so little one of my teachers asked the class if something was wrong with me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLcFVau5wvk&feature=g-u-u

Polydunami: Your on bronystate right? Like the website?
Polydunami LOL this is the first time i've ever used the chat and i have no idea how to talk directly to someone, so i'm trying everything
+Phase4- :P
Why do you have the cockpit backwards?
that shit's gonna crash
Greeting signs as you enter states.
0,14I'm liking this remix
I'm on the website right now, Ponies47
Welcome to Montana. There's nobody here.

Oh no worries, SexyBuford. It's Youtube syndrome

Wait, did you say this is your first time on Bronystate, SexyBuford?
/me Checks the names list for Polydunami "I see you but you have no @ before your name"
tron music strangely apropriate
Welcome to Rhode Island. Thanks for visiting Rhode Island.

Well i think i am going to play TF2
:D
Polydunami yeah it is
You can join me if you want, steam id ; masterboss43
Sumica: clearly you lack rockets
that might fly
No, Ponies47, I was rolling with somepony putting an "@ symbol" before my name like on Youtube comments and such.
Captain_MasterBoss43 I don't have Steam access on this computer.
downloading and converting videos into mp3
Come at hang out at Alabama!
Zombie_Brony: Then don't tell me dude.
Oh yeah
this would never work irl
Welcome to Bronystate, SexyBuford!
but in this game it might
I hate my computer -_-
weeeeee
it hasn't crashed yet!
nevermind.
those control flaps seem to be working at crosspurposese
cross purposes.
Captain_MasterBoss43 Just saying cuz I would be playing with you, otherwise
hasnt exploded yet
Zombie_Brony: Oh ok.... Sorry for that....
Captain_MasterBoss43 s'alright bro.
can you point those engines to thrust downards at all?
now let me eat your brains
Oahi Phase4 :)
maybe that'll counteract the tendency to flip upwards
But brb, gonna play sum tf2....
ohai Ponies47

What the heck?
what is this
i don't even
Phase4: No colors on makes it hard to see you :P
Now you have some bewm

Spectacular failure!
oh shit
fail jet
oh shit
well im off bye everypony :$
shit's broken
Sumica: TAKE OFF
NOW
so has anyone told us what this game is yet?
did you put those beby rockets on both sides?
your front rockets do not appear to be firing...
Dis gon b gud
Whoops, he got kicked :S
MirrorImage those are secondary rockets. If he ever gets to that stage
ded
hmm
i can see a motivational poster out of this...
double the fun!
No Lift Off? MORE ROCKETS!
this game
aliens
It's like those films of all the failed flight attempts before Kitty Hawk
agan
MirrorImage gets it
lol
overhyped game
LOLFAIL
TheRareP0N3: underhyped game
ded
hmm i think it needs a retune
Phase4: overhyped
Mime fail
underveloped as well, but underhyped.
Phase4 you got a doppleganer by the name of "Phase4-"
Phase4: agreed... now if only someone would tell us what this is...
Zombie_Brony: he's on a diferent desktop
dafaq
Im going to say that every time he crashes
MirrorImage: kerbal space program?
Phase4 who's "he"?
to google!
to the google!
00,02Zombie_Brony, he's me
00,02two clients
oh so now you type in blue words
Phase4- oh, right -_(\
this is the web client
Right, I'll be watching some more Doctor Who; the Doctor's in the French Revolution :3
ded
you can /ctcp VERSION me to check
does that not mean it is a mod
one sec
It should be perfectly symmetrical... so yeah, no clue
ohai Phase4
Sumica: Methinks the physics are off
Lightning-Quill he's using two accounts
derp?
idk
It's a lunatic design, but it's balanced.
nah, this is just a game of politics as far as i can see
wait you can make an account?
don't like the Laws of Physics? change them.
hen3ry oh great, another name change
ffs
brb
XD
ded
seems legit
IF he ever get's to the moon, let alone space
Yes, change the gravitational constant of the universe and apply bad rounding methods to the value of pi
totally legit
00,12der we go
00,12hacked colour into the web client
0,14ooh this song
he gets to space on occasion.
Phase4 so vibrant
0,14...Phase4 confirmed to be a wizard
00,02and now i'm using the correct blue
Hey do you guys have gmod?
00,02XD
xxMoopyxx: yes, but not installed
song name?
plz?
tell me he's not going to...
oh my
go buy it and get it installed dude
It looks like some kind of robot...
KILL IT BEFOAR IT LAYS EGGZ!
Good Phase4. Now I can see you :)
00,02SaxyPretender: i can show you how, its quite easy
00,02lol Ponies47
welp, night you guys. I'm gonna go watch Redline
Sumcia song name?
Redline, huh?
0,14later RAWRity
He is.
00,02RAWRity: gnight, enjoy insanity
See you RAWRity!

they're splitters.
0,14also, this is InfinityDash's remix of Pinkie's Party Song
0,14iirc

Right. Doctor Who right now.
Phase4: COL..awww (squee) i keep forgeting I don't ahve colors because I'm not a mod :(
what am i watching
in this case, jet engines.
Hey phase4 whast up bro?

thx SaxyPretender
pony_9444: Kerbal Space Program

Heh lol

00,02MirrorImage: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.awt.AWTPermission" "accessEventQueue")
that's working too well
Sumica: I just dont know what went wrong
hi kids
far too well
well
00,02basically i'm allowed to make a gui but not access its event loop
you're not all kids
it's working as long as he keeps it _perfectly_ straight
hi Woodenshy
I'm going to try to be recognized on the Internet...eventually.
00,02does anyone here play second life?
Phase4: yeah... that's why i prefer to use VB for GUI programs
Phase4: eek
uh oh...
it's tipping
00,02MirrorImage: dont get me started on vb
00,02better than java sure
00,02shoddy language though
actually, jets are vectoring, so he can maneouver... a little
Hey guys i dare you all to do the reaction of derpy whooves again with the texting and stuff i want you guys do it
Phase4 is that the game where people spend hours at a time living a life they are never able to IRL?
then no
too much tilt tho, and it'll be unrecoverable.
Phase4: ehh... it's all a matter of getting it done
Phase4: I was on SL once upon a time...I quit because it got boring and my computer now can't handle it
Something tells me it's failing
though admittedly i'm partial to VB.NET, so i'm cheating it a bit
miserably
00,02MirrorImage: true, and vb.net runs on .net so its meh, before that was bad though
half of fuel gone
falling
you're going up at 100' per . . . nevermind, you're going down
00,02MirrorImage: i would recomend switching to c#
00,02much nicer language
actually... funny thing about that...
in a conversation with my boss, we've actually decided to go DOWN to vbscript...
00,02>this design
00,02seems legit
for the simple reason that you can edit it in plain text
00,02MirrorImage: o_O
as opposed to needing a compiler
00,02that
hmm Lost my singal for a second
00,02is a silly reason
Is anypony's team fortress 2 bucking up?
It's a hovercraft. It shouldn't work that well, but... kerbal physics.
we're not talking terribly big programs anyways
Captain_MasterBoss43: havnt been playing today
Phase4 the only programming I do is in "Scratch". Not true programming, but a good introduction
Captain_MasterBoss43: Haven't played in a while so IDK :p
the last one i wrote was a total of about 80 lines consisting of "run this SQL statement that itself is 20 lines"
"then write the result to .txt"
00,02if its simple script then why not python?
because Windows?
00,02Lunar_Brony: i've heard of that, visual programing thing right?
00,02MirrorImage: you can get python for windows
hell, we're converting them from perl, he's not particularly concerned
00,02at least 3 implimentations out there
if I'm just doing text, I use perl.
he wants something that anyone can edit, and vb is sufficiently plain-english
00,02never understood perl
Phase4 somethin' like that. I use it quite a bit. I made a board game with it.
Wait im going to watch that reaction again about seeing derpy whooves HA!
oh i had a hell of a time deciphering it
...
thankfully the scripts were heavily commented...
I had to learn it, bout.. .shoot 12, 13 years ago now for a small project that balooned.
though its concerning when the comment lines take up more lines than the code itself
just trying to explain what the code is doing
nose dive!
But how can i get rainbow colour?

BTW Sumica, we can't actually hear you except as a mumble in the background of the music.
Man I would love to be a mod here
hai
Phase4 my computer and internet are probably too slow for me to be a Mod or Admin
Hey ponibas :)
i'd love to see that balance right about now...
fuel will flow...
You guys were really funny in that chatroom cause you were going off about derpy heh and you guys were awesome
but no way you have enough lift
too much weight for one rocket
Phase4: harumph!
oops
eeyep...
lol
What do you guys think would happen if I became a mod? 6_9
. . .
Sumica: good call
Ponies47: prozac
Ponies47 hell would break loose. That's saying something for Bronystate
...
you were like omg derpy :P :P :P :P
ummm
all of it.
00,02lolwut
that's what part
00,02how
WAT
00,02Sumica: HOW DID YOU DO DAT
I'm drooling right now...
Sumica: Save that ship design!
he wanted... 12 fuel tanks, powered by one rocket...
with a lander atop the mess.
Gravity is a cruel mistress.
00,02i dont know
Heh im going to click it again its funny as hell
00,02my first assumption is it wont carry fuel
new coulours, Phase4?
00,02sure as heck wont get of the ground
*colours
I wub bronystate
00,02MakerDusk: new?
Come on you guys would think it would be that bad? 6_9
. . . huh
but fuel flowed through on your hovercraft...
ah. Directional, perhaps
/me has used these colours sense he used colours
maybe
a hovercraft is NOT a rocket however
now I'm off to test.
unless you put enough helium in it
Phase4: I don't think I've ever noticed you using them before >_<
my hovercraft is full of eels.
00,02hen3ry: fo science!
Dare I ask why Kerbal has a Giant can opener factory?
00,02MakerDusk: yeah, i tend to leave them off
this is how I'm feeling about High School right about now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRgnb8hfXD0
lol
of course mine will be much lighter... lol
00,02inb4 wobble
looks staged to me.
the few times I use colours in here, I do it manually
inb4Challenger?
Heh derpy took derpy to the cracked hole heh lol
brb. Need Coca-Cola
you're not gonna make orbit
afk. Need Coca-Cola
i mean derpy took rainbow into the cracked hole
00,02 /me ponders what crit-a-cola would taste like
ah, but imagine the extra thrust you get from spontaneous full fuel burn!
00,02wobble wobble wobble
Phase4 you could try it but.. BOOM headshot
Lunar_Brony: you wont learn almost anything useful for a job in college. Its just a requirement to put your foot inside the door and actually learn something by doing it.
I could never play this, it would be like a professional classical guitarist playing guitar hero >_<
00,02Sumica: can you show that one which colapses the rcs tank?
I hate my computer so much right now -_-
00,02ah
WE HAVE LIFTOFF
I have no Cola. I need a flashlight
why are they still screaming?
It's swiming!!!

00,02Woodenshy: you have seen Sumica's rockets right?
No
O muh gawd Just finnished writing first chapter of this fic imma gonna sleep now night everypony.
wait
OH
OH GOING DOWN
. . .
afk
Oh yeah I have, so many end in sweet, SWEET failure.
ded
oooooo. aaaahhhhh.
it did challenger
yup. directional. Ah well, I could have found a purpose for a re-coupler in a couple places.
ded
Has Sumica done a successful launch and taken it seriously?
good call MirrorImage
is that a 90s style house/club music I hear in the background? :)
you can use the x key to switch the symmetry btw
....
ALL the rockets!
Sumica, spinner rocket??
00,02O_O
00,02seems safe
00,02launch it
DO IT.
escape velocity before leaving atmosphere?
00,02staging failure XD
this is going to be big
hen3ry pretty much
Hush now, quiet now Kerbals, it's time to lay your sleepy head
the magic school bus anyone?
oh god the Gs
if Ms. Frizzle were a homicidal maniac.
it just did 0 to 200, straight up in about... now seconds?
realistically, they'd be dead from G forces
God not the Gs! Not the Gs!!!!!!!!!
MY EYES! NOT THE G'S!
Alchemist: >_<
yes...ALL the Gs
ROFL
...what happened?
00,02moah g's
Explosions
i'd like to know too
fall down, go boom
ah, the Fourth of July Rocket
Lots of explosions'
how many G?
thanks Sumi
00,02MirrorImage: falling is for sissies
00,02just explode where you are
Can one go to the moon and beyond?
and then fall everywhere?
Woodenshy: yes
00,02Woodenshy: yep
cant' see G forces
00,02i've been there
So it crashes into the air?
"Mommy, why is the rain red?"
although there's not much "beyond"
"And on fire?"
Is it possible to go to Mars?
00,02not recently, all my recent missions explode
and oh
no mars in the game yet
that's...boring.
00,02Woodenshy: no other planets yet, just two moons
just a sun, one planet and two moons so far
MirrorImage, because I willed it
00,02yeah, i wish there was another planet
...oh hai
that was awkward
I'm gonna wait until they start putting other planets on.
00,02i have a craft that should be capable of lading on it
I just realized, I'm covered in bug bites. D:
and what's for movie night tomorrow? If there is one...
"If"?
00,02Woodenshy: should be in the newsletter
is it the FF stuff?
sumica, u need to dust off your 4km/s rocket
And as far as I know the Sun isnt really there, it has no physical body, just a gravity field, you can literally fly through it.
00,02there is going to be one tomorow
cuz that's all I saw
and can't hear you over engines
Alchemist: in .13 that was true, now it's a quasi-physical body, Sumi crashed into it
I have seen the Final Fantasy film, but...it's not very good.
00,02huh
ponibas: give it about 10 seconds
they'll run out
:D
00,02newsletter link wasnt updated
Nope!
hah
there they go
00,02ah well, movie nigs tomorow, doesnt matter now
00,02and you will be outside the atmosphere soon
hey, they have liftoff! Anyways, what's on for tomorrow?
he's already out of it
00,02there you go
well out of it
00,02hen3ry: atmosphere stops at 70KM
no escape
Next stop earth
00,02how fast are you going?
RIP 3 more kerba;s
of course you have to launch at midnight to escape the sun! It has to be DARK!
00,02yeah
is that 6000?
can you land in the sun in a fiery death?
oh he's on his way.
Hey ponies47
he has no thrust to adjust his course
yeah that's gonig to leave the solar system
so either his course will "hit" or it won't.
and no it won't, that blue circle is his orbit
wonder if you leave it running enough.. if you can end up crashing back into Kerbin
note it's a circle not a parabola
Yeah, he's off course. :s
spalt the sun!
splat*
"And that, gentlemen, is how a star is constructed. With the blood and soul of 3 brave Kerbals."
this is the least crowded I've seen Bronystate. Ever.
ponies47
kerbal on the right is like "This is FUN!"
and no, he won't hit the planet. the game doesn't do n-body well.
or at all actually
Woodenshy: 3-4 more hours later there will be even less people here (usually around 80-90)
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: a footnote on the Kerbal Space Program, it is
true
instead there are fixed borders where you're in the planet's influence, then suddenly in the sun or moon's.
it's nearly 3 here...
Woodenshy: am or pm
you'll hit about 30km/s I think, maybe 32.
should I go to sleep? (I forgot how nice everyone is here)
/me prepares rocket to burn up on solar passage
am then I presume :)
and Alchemist, 3 in ze morning. Time for a krabby patty!
00,02Sumica: yeah, cant spin during warp > 2x
ohai Phase4..
Woodenshy: having trouble sleeping?
00,02ohai Shamroc
Hey ponies47 type this on youtube and watch bronies average reaction to derpy's canon voice and watch that dude in the shadow come in starts clappin in the shadows
Phase4.....hows it goin?'
I didn't go to sleep yet Alchemist. I'm a night owl.
0,14well, I'm off to bed

I'm not so sure about that... we've sent things to Mercury with no problems.
hello Phase4
do eet!
00,02ohai Texasboykc09
fill spaces with more SRBs!
Phase4: done any neat stuff lately?
hey ponies
Mercury is -100 c on thenight side
00,02Shamroc: done some stuff in paintchat that meens i can start fixing it
Mission accomplished!
send in a drawing or a donation!
hen3ry: didnt we send only one satellite to the mercury?
Phase4: that is indeed neat
I don't remember how many
well. I'm not doing that again.
7 cans of Coca-Cola smuggled up 2 flights of stairs
WITHOUT light OR pockets
I love that song
AND in one trip
sumica's pc is revolting against the design
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mercury
00,02needs a seperator
you may have to couple it to the center core, rather than rocket-to-rocket
yeah no seperator, no staging.
oh, how perfect
oh we sent 2 and a third is on the way
00,02oh god
00,02are you going to put 5 of those on there?
Phase4: as many as it takes
my point is we can build things that can safely travel that close to the sun. people probably don't count as those things, but...
THEY WERE SINGING THIS AT BRONYCON
HOLY CRAP. I just realized this! :o
who wants Coca-Cola? I got 6 cans to share
i do
:3
So...who went to Bronycon?
My wager is this will snap at that connector.
/me gives Darkts3|Drawing|MLG a can of Coca-Cola
anyone else?
hen3ry: at which point you panic and engage the second stage
the entire stress of the design is focused at one point.
dat wobble
lol
hahahaha

oh hey, challenger
boom
It's.... IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
well. There it goes!
who would've thought? :D

he knows he's gonna die, but he got high before takeoff.
00,02you can aim it
ooooooo
ded
Alchemist: He might as well enjoy his last few moments alive
he's using solids tho.
harder to control those.
00,02it hasnt exploded yet
"yet"
vital word
plus it's extremely heavy to maneouver with gyros.
hello every pony
SolairePony89: I had a roommate once who's response to extreme stress was laughing. It was annoying as hell.
Sumica, slot rockets in the spaces
00,02still alive
too bad it'll hit the tower
Yeah...this won't end well.
and when you're dead?
00,02they realy need a limit on the sprites
big*
00,02theres the ground
00,02knew it was aroudn here somewhere
YES!!
00,02one's still burning XD
mwuhahahaha
Alchemist: My responce to pain is usually laughter, so I kinda know how he feels
Imagine if this was like Minecraft and you blew a massive object made of TNT up.
MOAR POWER!
MOAR DUCT TAPE!
I'm surprised this hasn't crashed yet.
this... is a boomstick.
Woodenshy: yeah, i crippled a server like that once...
lol
omg
WAT
"Hey, can I blow up this MOUNTAIN!"
"sure"
What are those lyrics?
flutteryay
Flying bomb available.
Wait, you were in charge in San Diego?
anyways
anyone wanna see a guy drowning? lol
Thats alot of rockets phase4
lol
i do
i see buffer
ack - my stream died
I have a bad feeling about this one.
Stream is ded
Last night I went out to a firework show... realized as the first one went off that I was directly under the debris field... ended up doing first aid instead of watching show :/
00,02xxMoopyxx: Sumica 's streaming
hellp every pony
00,02streams not ded here
methinks Sumica's PC didn't like this design
00,02wait
Heya brony_boy115

00,02no
00,02its not dead
Phase4 mine died, but it's back
suddenly, musics back
00,02just lag
i mean hello
flaming firework pieces falling on little kids. Moronic.
oh well i want to see a guy
SolairePony89: but that's pain not stress . Its one thing when you break your leg and start to laugh than when everyone around you is stressed out of your mind (lets say a friend is having a serious operation) and hes just laughing.
sumica had to do CPR on his system
hi brony_boy115
SCIENCE
0_0
How much you wanna bet this won't go well?
00,02Sumica: crazy or genius! the line is so fine
Hey sumica you have alot of rockets there buddy
Woodenshy: i counter-bet that, regardless, it will go awesome!
hi Linar_Brony
Okay!
Phase4 that line isn't fine.. it's very blurry
Woodenshy 50 bits says this thing will Crash and Burn. Or more like Burn and Crash.
Alchemist: I can see how that would be annoyed and REALLY innapropriate
taht said... you have enough bewm to get escape, no matter when you launch, I think.
annoying*
who needs chute???
omg
Just test it real qick
now turn it "on"
ignition!!!
how is it not overheating?
00,02inb4 instant detonate on.... nvm
holy shit
wow
00,02how is this not on fire
Phase4: ponies
00,02it should be on fire and exploding
Phase4: give it... 20 seconds?
fast rojet
that movement...
Inb4 boom
all those rockets bumping
00,02fun fact: the orion launch vehicle (i think) actually did melt the pad
not gonna end well!
booster wobble
here comes my
here comes my $50
yet.... almost good
00,02allso was more damaged than anticipated after re-entry, so was probably more powerfull than they thought
...did the solid fuel rockets just die?
Woodenshy awww, dammit. I think I owe you 50 bits . . .
and that's space
Yeah!
just as the rockets finish
wait, maxed out Gs and they are still alive?
whats velo?
00,02the rocket itself is a performance problem
DUKE says: all those curves and leave me with no breaks!
Woodenshy would you take a can of Coca-Cola instead?
what!
it's cold
!
lay it on me Lunar_Brony!
00,02dat larger orbit
*grabs can*
that should have been enough bewm to escape no matter when you launched.
well, he's still going up
yeah, they would have died from Gs... theyd have been turned into paste
/me gives Woodenshy a can of Coca-Cola
11,02Woodenshy: I never met Luna yet either :/
/me hugs SuperBrony64
I hear she's really nice. I'd love to get to know her.
11,02She is awesome ^-^
/me hugs Phase4 back
/me hugs SuperBrony64 for being awesome admin
I challnge all of you in here to a paint program who ever makes the best wins
hi SuperBrony64. I have. She's really nice, just stay away from her toaster
/me hugs Woodenshy back for being cool :3
SuperBrony64, I've yet to meet the Doctor, myself.
YEAH!
11,02Lunar_Brony: O.O
So how many follow me on my FB page?
how many G??
11,02I want Luna's toaster now D:
/me steals Luna's toaster.
:D
SuperBrony64 I ended up buried in Moon sand in a deep crater
FlareChaser you'll be sorry. Luna's after you right now
._.
Hey sumica i challnge you to a paint program who ever makes the best wins
/me gives SuperBrony64 the toaster.
FULL POWR!
:D? :D?
00,02i'm suprised the capsule doesnt crush under the preasure
ALL SYSTEMS, FULL POWER!
11,02:O
FlareChaser SuperBrony64 I suggest the two of you run. Now.
11,02Give the toaster back to Luna, thanks though :3
AHH, he's not gonna get away with this!
im surprised the many boomsticks crashing into each other doesn't start an epic mushroom cloud
00,02Sumica: put parachutes on it and activate them just after takeoff
But, I didn't steal anything.
._.
*yawn* good morning Bronystate!
Mornin' MadSurge
SuperBrony64 FlareChaser or give her Moonshine. She'll forgive you if you do.
mornin MadSurge
mornin' Madsurge

/me gives Luna Moonshine.
Wat.
Sumica, did you build a "gentlemen" rocket? :D
00,02its large enough that you'd eventualy fall together
FlareChaser yeah, she's cool. Tell SuperBrony64 to do the same. Luna's still kinda pissed at him.
holy carp stream lag
Uh oh the stream froze
k ._.
eeyikes!
the hay is that abomination?
SuperBrony64 is my big bro, he'll listen :3
(We're not related)
Has anyone built a phallic rocket?
now its lagging crazy
this is put to gether with sticks of gum
Well, that might not have been the best question to ask...
xxMoopyxx same
Woodenshy: basically all rockets are phallic :D
Is a rocket never phallic, Woodenshy?
eeyup
How is this holding together? :3
duct tape
^
booom
This is some damn powerful duct tape!
umm
FlareChaser duct tape. I should know, I'm Canadian after all.
It's Canadian, Woodenshy :3
WOOOOOO
Sumica, full power!!!
I'm Canadian too! :D
and nothing happened! Oh...COLUMBIA! RIP those dudes.
uhhhhhhh
NOOOOO
O_O
Polydunami is also a Canadian!
oh

Polydunami|DoctorWho duct tape can fix (almost) anything
my eyes!
they bleed
my god
o_O
God dang it sumica you almost froze up the chatroom in here
Can't do shit for the environment, though.
nah, he just froze the stream.
thats a lot of sprites to render
You know, is NASA going to keep allowing this? It's just a waste of money.
ded
boom?
WHAT IM PLAYING THIS SONG ON STEP MANIA XD
and btw, what's the song playing right now? Can someone please tell me?
and im failing at it XD
I'd like to add to Ipod, along with Discord

Woodenshy they're ending the space program, but we're sending people to Mars in, like, 2025?
No one answered my question.
Ha, you cooked the rocket :D
/me stays away from Sumica
WHAT MUSIC IS PLAYING?
Woodenshy it may Saltikritz's Winter Gala Remix
but I wasn't listening
oh...oh
D:
Woodenshy yeah, it's Saltikritz
Winter Gala
oh thanks

What was the one before with Fluttershy?
Woodenshy now I'm starting to think it isn't Winter Gala . . . I'll check. BRB
No I think it is...
Woodenshy=Fluttertree
THANK YOU.
DMAN
Sumica : you are being silly agian?
Woodenshy it isn't Winter Gala.

I now have no clue what's playing. Sumica what's the song name?
Hello RainBowJack :3
RainBowJack eeyup

that would kill them
RainBowJack: No it's not.
you know you need fuel lines now right?
I saw it SOMEWHERE

Polydurian|DoctorWho just don't mention the opposite of insanity and mayhem, and we cool
Yeah, but at a certain point you'll want to apply engineering rather than science.
it knows its a plane and wants to go sideways

I think it's safe to say I have a majority of the brony music
no
/me Walks over to the table to get some punch and cookies but then notices a apple sitting near by

you can even it out if you put all the fuel lines to the central body tank.

there is a totaly valid reason for my nickname

Shizuka and Shamroc play a lot of GMod, but I just think it would be rude to join them.
MadSurge I should be, but I have Sugar and Caffeine . . . yes. Think of me as a hungover Pinkie Pie.
Peach4: What would that be?

hi mangoguy
if you're not a fruit, you're a vegetable.
Peach4 eeyup
Did someone say fruits? :D
cher3ry no, I'm a Canadian Brony.
Lunar_Brony you've already said hi. I just changed my name
CrazyCherry: No but whne there's so much fruit I get scared
I didn't know Canada owned the moon now!
I'm a vegetable!
Is the moon a territory, or a full-on province?
... Am I doing it right?
i'd say add srb's but i have no clue where to add srb's without taring the ship apart
cher3ry we don't. I pissed off Celestia
ahem.... SPACE! IT'S IN SPACE!
:D
FlareBerry: no... not at all
the rest is histroy
It would seem so..
<- Wisconsin brony right and the only Wisconsin brony in this chat :(
... getting bored of space now
it seems that Ponies47 and I are the only ones who aren't fruit.
ok, who said he couldnt?
hoo-ray
TheHoodyPlum why not necterine?
I think that was me. But that was when he was using air-breathing engines.
mangoguy: plums are the ninjas of fruit
not enough for escape
oh well
still proof of concept. VTOL hovercraft into space, probably had enough delta V for stable orbit if he'd watched his apo carefully
that does mena you have a desing for a vertical craft though
*design
cher3ry: he cant put it under any stress
otherwise the tanks fall off
bewm
what would you call it when you should feel tired, and you know you're tired, but you aren't?
k.i.a.
I didn't say it was a great craft. :D
bits of it did
hi Barrel_of_Fun

Nom nom nom
TheHoodyPlum I know that feeling. This isn't it. I mean, I just downed 2 cans of Coca-Cola and the caffeine and sugar is keeping me awake. But I know that I really should be very tired. It's a strange feeling
FlareChaser: D:
incorrect. I am most certainly not a pony.
and hard to explain
Lunar_Brony: ikr?
/me *ded*
cher3ry: fine
Oh no, I have killed Phase ._.

/me speaks to Peach4[Eaten] through FlareChaser "Are you alright in there?"
All of you will change your nick names back to your orginals @_@

/me punches FlareChaser in the gut to make him spit up Peach4[Eaten]
Ponies47 okay . . .
Ow..
Who's streaming?
Peach4[Eaten] is going to get pooped out :x
/me throws up on Shamelon
D:

we don't need to think about that thanks
Ponies47 this is my original. Happy?
/me beats FlareChaser with the angry stick
I'm Lunar_Brony
FYI
FlareChaser: You will spit out Peach4[Eaten] @_@
Ow :'(
Canadian_Brony: you look Canadian to me
/me spits out Peach4
Hey Canadian_Brony, you can use /nick to change your username without logging off.
D:
Sumica: Are ya streaming?
Sumica: start it at full throttle
Polydunami . . . -_(\

Lunar_Brony, you changed your nick at the most opportune time xD
ok im tired g'night crazy peoplz
or aerodynamic
Polydunami I did?
at this point of course it's just a very silly designed rocket.
You DO know this song, right?
It's about Luna.
Night TheHoodyPlum :)
Polydunami I changed it twice. From Lunar, to Canadian, then back to Lunar
yeah but the drag is what breaks it
Polydunami oh! I've heard it, but I don't remember the name
it's by TheLivingTombstone, right?
It's okay, neither do I :s
Nope.
I think I got a new favorite tumblr blog
Sumica what's the song playing currently?
It's actually by Odyssey Eurobeat, also known as Eurobeat Brony.
twang
...
suggestion, send the outer fuel tanks fuel line to the center tank, that should make them all empty at a constant rate
/me noms on Peach4 again.
Polydunami oh, right -_(\
http://derpy.me/Dvsbe
think you can do a vertical landing?
Sumica k, thx. I need a pen . . .
CrimsonPhoenix, I have no strong feelings one way of the other.
*or :S
well that works too, sorta.
should empty from the sides evenly at least
20%
o_O
O_o
Whoa
chat derp?
. . .
I wonder what it'd take to make a Marvel Helicarrier?
Can you hear me now?
I can't think of any actual city that has a monorail. except Vegas.
my chat is being stupid tonight
Lunar_Brony, are you using the web client?
won't let me type this: /)_(\
Polydunami yeah
y?
Seattle doesn't actually exist.
Gatwick airport have one
cher3ry and Beverly Hills isn't part of the universe
That's very true actually.
Beverly Hills is an alternate reality
Lunar_Brony add a space to the front
I dunno if I want to type the /slash command, actually :$
Sumica oh. I was trying to make a Double Facehoof
/)_(\
mangoguy like that
how'd you do that?
/)
Polydunami /)
when I said the center, I meant the center of the ship - the middle tank between all the orange blobs. :D
like i said, add a space at the front so it's no longer a command
hi
Mutterguy k, thx
Sumica: seperators?
hi Sweetie_Belle
you're draging some heavy and empty tanks into space
hi Sweetie_Belle
POPCORN SONG

04Good early morning, everyone

Me too o_o
is it time for ghost stuff Ghosties?
Ghosties morning, I guess. Not very good for me.
dis song
04...why are there two voice activated nicks? o_o
I'm trembling... :(
both are Phase
its fruit time
SparklyWaffles same. My hands are sweaty. At least I can type faster . . .
04Phase, why two voice activated nicks?
XD
One of em is a spy, Ghosties :P
Ghosties: two what now?
srb is still going XD
04+Peace4 and +Pear4...why are there 2?
Pear4: is xchat
this is the website client
04Why do you have twin clients open? :/
Ghosties one is on a laptop
so i dont have to alt+tab
we have lift-off!
needs more canard
04Huh...I suppose
:3
04Lot of people here tonight, I'm surprised
Sumica: i recomend parachutest
I'm considering making my computer a dual-screen when I get home, but I need space for a second monitor
and a second monitor
Oahi Ghosties :)
04Hello
is nice isnt it Ghosties...bunch of people to sell ghosts to
o-o
Ghosties you missed a link that SparklyWaffles and I clicked on. It was a screamer . . . I'm still jumpy
04So many customers o_o
mind you, I'm wearing Headphones . . .
also...im still waiting for that second ghost....where the buck is it?
04I'm sorry about the screamer, I've had that happen to me before
...As was I...
/me sends a ghost to Shamelon
04There
Ghosties I would prefer to to Rick Roll'd.
XD
Sumica: nice shot
04I dunno, getting Rick Roll'd is pretty embarrassing
thanks Ghosties....
04No problem, Shamelon
also
im a melon
TBH, I've been Rick Roll'd so many times, the song's starting to get catchy
Jokes on you, I like the song.
SparklyWaffles LoLz it's growing on me
oh crap :D
durka?
What... are we watching and listening to?
I'm lost.
wait what
i alt tabed
SparklyWaffles the video is Kerbal Space Program. Song . . . couldn't help yah
what the heck id Sumica do
did'
Getting Rick Roll'd? Meh, I like the song~
I hate being Rick Roll'd -_-
Kerbal... space program? So many things I've never heard of.
capsule weighs many times the srb's
FlareChaser it's growing on me. Better than that screamer
yall should do that one movie night.
The only screamer that doesn't scare me is that scary maze game; I actually laugh
Oh, that screamer? that gave me a heart attack.
Start the scheduled pony episode... then as the theme song starts, instead... Rick.
not the maze one
the one that a certain pony posted..
just for the pandimonium reaction
FlareChaser: the song is ok, I don't understand why they chose that to troll people :D I'd have picked something far more annoying!
SparklyWaffles I remember setting up the built-in cameras at School last year and getting people to play the scary maze game and record their reactions
many LoLz were shared in those days
suddenly space
bbl, home time
BACK TO EARTH
you're falling
Well, they're dead.
physics!
. . . do not apply to this game
Exactly
xD

04No, he's not, DeathStar :I

04Try it, Flare :3
...
I'm urged to..
FlareChaser "Giggle at the ghosties"
the fourth wall would chew you up and spit you out.
It knows you're no Pinkie.
...
._.
the lyric is "Giggle at the ghosties"
/me giggles at Ghosties
:D?
/me munches on popcorn that really isnt' ther
Kick? really? ._.
Alright, I learned..
04Unlike the song in the pilot episode of Friendship is Magic, I'm a sentient being :3
and he dont like being laughed at
Hmm
What if I don't laugh at him?
/me shrugs
04I give you coffee? I dunno...
/me doesn't laugh at Ghosties

04Thanks guys
*glare at link*
Ghosties: I'm only 14 and I DON'T CARE! Mah brother swears everyday at me for no reason! :d

FlareChaser: its not
Alchemist: Good.
mostly FUCK and SHIT
its a luna pic
But... it says derpy.
CONFUSION.
My brother sickens me sometimes -_-
does anpony know where I can get the pic on the stream?
/me grabs Octavia
04I would ask about your home life, 47, but I don't need to get caught up in that
its because derpy.me is a link shortener site
gimmie <3
SparklyWaffles: derp.me is a website that shortens links so it wont be a full page link when I copypaste it
Alchemist: Human Luna nad pony Luna :P
Wait, one sec...
FlareChaser she's a filly. Just sayin'
adorable, may I add
Well... ok o~o
Let's see~
Ghosties: It's a very long painful and sad story. All of you guys would get pretty sad and I would get sad/mad :S
Filly Rainbow Dash is adorable
it's been 2 months since I started to like Octavia, people said I was going to last a month.
lolwutnow.
04I see...well, I hope the guys here and BronyState can help alleviate some of that pain
http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.10203779.3789/fc,550x550,black.jpg
Ponies47: Lemme hear that story, I'm sure we can help you :)
... ;~;
I think I have a fear of links now.
Ghosties: Yeah. Watching ponies or talking with you guys always helps :)
SparklyWaffles I made a Pinkie Promise, remember?
Lunar_Brony: http://derpy.me/WsghH
Listening to Smile, smile, smile doesn't even seem to help..!
FlareChaser: I fI told you the story you will get very sad and plus it would take a very long to tell it -_-
*If
Alchemist huh.
SparklyWaffles: If the link ends in .jpg then its probably not a creamer :)
Ponies47: Alrigjt, you don't have to tell it~
creamer=scream
04It COULD be a creamer if it was a coffee jpeg
00,10Some day ghosties, you will need to learn to stream. cause you like to be awake during the gap when every one but phase sleeps
;~;
FlareChaser: Thank you
04Yep, Sumi

00,10oh thanks for remidning me Alchemist

In science, we were studying planets of the solar system, and one of our assignments was to do a brochure for a planet. I chose Earth.
xD
I was explaining weather, and when I got to rainbows, a picture of Rainbow Dash came up.
VioletGreySha: I like everypony. But that smile is just priceless! I even found a Pinkie Pie shirt with her doing that smile! :d
04And did the class laugh?
I pretended it wasn't supposed to happen and quickly changed it to a rainbow.
yes. Yes they did
04Did they know who it was?
Ponies47: well twilight is my fave pony sow i love it :3
You were trolled by rainbow dash, then...? :D
The ponies, they won't leave us :D
VioletGreySha: Evewrypony thinks doffrent I'm pretty sure Wrek would like that wallpaper :P

04By the way, what school are you in?
Ponies47 idk. That was the pic I used, and she was only up for about 3 seconds
Zombie_Brony: AH
00,02super mnc confused me and wants to download 1.5GB for an update
Ghosties DP Todd Secondary
00,02*uninstall*
Prince George
04Hmm...perhaps I should have said grade instead
p-p
Ghosties yeah . . . I was in Grade 9 when I did the project
/me Is gonna be in 9th grade this year :)
:3
I Like Trains!.. :3
hehe Phase4
00,02ohai
/me is dead by a train
04I tend to ask a lot of people in the BronyState community their age, I hope it doesn't weird you out. I've been in the fandom for a long while and I've come to notice that the stereotype of "men liking ponies" has really declined since Season 2 of the show. It's kinda interesting, but I guess that's only nature: Friendship is Magic became pretty mainstream in media and culture, it seems.
/me 00,02runs over Dark_of_Max
Hello.
colored text o_o
long message is long
Crap. How do I change my username again?
Ghosties I don't blame you for asking my age. Turned 15 in June.
/me D:
Ghosties seems legit
/me wants to be a mod :3
Ghosties: 14 and 9th grade. Will be 15 in December there you go :P
pony_724657 type something like "/nick Zombie_Brony"
I'm turning 15 July 19th... :)
The average age here at Bronystate is much lower than I expected.
ikr
Ah ok
00,02might end up with a spare car battery
Thanks Zombie Brony
04It didn't use to be this low, Alchemist
Who doesn't?
00,02next logical step is to build a ups for my internet
your welcome bro
04If you rewind the clocks back to this time last year the typical age was around 20, maybe 21
brb
Ghosties: I wasnt around here, I only came here about 2 months ago.
04Right
04Sooooo how old are you?
26
04Nice
all them young whippersnappers , i should change my nick to old man jenkins or something ^^
xD
hi TrixieMuffin
same here, I'm feeling elderly lol
damn you are old
xD
hi Zombie_Brony
04Do we have people here older than 20?
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/113/213/shutup_fluttershy.jpg <- It seems like every meme is being ponyfied. Even the SHUT AND TAKE MY MONEY thing from Futurama. :P
yes
31 Ghosties
o_o
I walked into my old Elemenatry school during Exam week. I felt really freakin' old around the kids
04Oh wow
That had to suck.
I know there are other 14 years old here. But I guess there not logged on right now
i'm 15 o_o
I have Trixie beat, btw. :-P
closest to death from natural causes yay!
04Yeah, we have quite a few "youngin's" in community now
04*in the community
Yep.
as long as we dont have annoying 7-9 yr olds every thing is k
I agree with that.
04You know, we had one person claim he was 11
o-o
LittleBud1 it was kinda funny, in a way. I remember looking at an old photo with a friend. I said to him "I had short hair!" I looked at him "You had short hair!"
I see nothing wrong this btw, actually its great to see that the show appeals to such a huge range of people.
im 18..... i dont have words im bored right now
i say we take MLP and move it somewhere else :3
its amazing how much changes in only a couple years
D:
04I just think it's a natural process of the show's growth in popularity, Alchemist.
Ghosties: how old are you?
Ghosties is probably 20+
theres nothing wrong with it per se, but it does mean there has to be some caution shown in some ways vis a vis whats streamed and what the chat standards actually are.
i guess
04It's inevitable that as the show became bigger the interest would trickle down and stop being a niche interest
What's appropriate for 18-30 isn't always so for 12.
04...redundant use of 'interest' is redundant
04Anyways, I'm 24
:3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGdhtHe1NR8&feature=g-all-c <- They person who did this voice for Colgate. Is just amazing it fits her so well! O_O
Ghosties: nice ^^
Ghosties: well, its obvious that if you take something and practically mass advetise it, it will have more followers.
Colgate is the 13th doctor
Ponies47 that's adorable . ..
Zombie_Brony: It's just head on. It fits her so well
04Except I don't think the Hub and Hasbro really marketed it that much. It was consequently the Internet and the fandom that helped it explode, I'm sure of that.
yup
/me Agrees with Ghosties
hmmm which is worse Hasbro or Micro$oft?
that and Fox saying "it's bad" therefore making it good because of Fox's constant use of the Opposite Filter :D
Ponies47 It sounds a bit like Twi.
Hullo
Ghosties: and the articles, and the news coverage (not just fox :D )
04Well, at least Hasbro doesn't mind the fanbase
GuntherDW: Yeah sort of
I learned about MLP from a friend who bought a MW3/MLP t-shirt with money that my friend gave him for items in TF2
04That is true, Alchemist. I forgot that the brony culture was covered by a few news outlets
there is a large chain of reactions that got me into MLP
Ghosties: Yeah. Thats good. I'm glad they don't think of us as freaks.
hello every one
Hey cow334
hi cow334
hey Ponies47 and Zombie_Brony
04What I mean is that Hasbro doesn't mind fan sites that use their material
http://fav.me/d49p4jw
04Because I'm sure they see it as a means of advertisement
except for some youtube uploads (actual episodes)
00,02http://xkcd.com/1078/ Tangential learning
hey Irish_Pony
04And that's essentially what all of these pony sites are, just advertisement for the product if you really think about it
ima neutral brony

Arr.
04Yeah, the more you use it the longer you'll have to keep exiting out of the registration screen every time it asks you to register
Phase4 Hm.. I shall check out xchat then.
I'd try XChat, but I just can't bother learning the differences between the two.
Shortcuts, features, et cetera.
Ghosties, its what I use. you just click continue
what are these guys trying to accomplish?
XD
space, rdibp >_>
00,02theres realy not much difference
I've finally learned the basics of mIRC and that was a pain ^_^ Not looking forward to learning new stuff with xchat
00,02if your a technical user like me, then there is
Phase4: In general usage, probably not. I mean how to configure it.
00,02Kammerjunk, meh
00,02seen one config interface, seen them all
00,02well, seen most of them
seen one rainbow script seen them all?
00,02still come across a bizare one every now and again
00,02XD
Fair 'nuff.
XD
Wait, is that an X-Wing?
06,02R04,02A07,02I08,02N09,02B03,02O06,02W04,02S
00,02Kammerjunk, yup
MY MIND
mind fuck
Phase4 Stealin' dari's rainbow text are we? :P
OHH IM THE 999,999 VISITO IN FT LAUDERDALE!!!!
rdibp: ...Do you get a prize?
00,02no, i wrote this script
well everypony im doing a operation to try and stay up till 10 to get my sleep back in order its is currently 7:02 AM im looking for 10 PM
idk :P
Fair enough.
might be because of those bass acwards wings on the front
I shall check out xchat but if I have to go through another tedious set-up process just to get it the way I want it again I may not bother ^_^ Took long enough to learn how to do it with mIRC
If I'm not mistaken, dari isn't very technical-like.
rdibp: Shame.
:(
Quick_Thinker http://www.wikihow.com/Stay-Awake-at-Work
the first thing im doing as a stay up till 10 is write a random fnafic
then you might be mistaken, Kammerjunk. I believe he wrote the EQD script that posts every update by them
FairysHuff: Basically, coffee.
i dont have a job im 15
Rain: Oh? I did not know that.
Quick_Thinker Still works.
those wings are sooooo close to the ground XD
00,02SUCCESS
go to space
Kammerjunk I can't drink coffee. Heart thingy mah bobby.
00,02i need more power
FairysHuff: Shame. Coffee is awesome.
Phase4: ulltra spice power
Mocha, cappocino, zoega, they're all awesome.
24 HOUR POOOWWWAAAA
cappuccino*
you need 5 hour energy drink
Kammerjunk Took one caffeine pill to try and stay awake a few weeks back. My heart started rattling around inside my chest. Was a little scary.
FairysHuff: Ah.
the music i will listen to will be pony things
"Moar powar"
ULTIMATE POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
full speed
so lets get started ion writing a random fic so anypony got an idea?
Kammerjunk Your not on steam right?
Quick_Thinker Fluttershy wants a new bra
the hay
go to space
00,02clearly i need more power
I wonder how far you can throw that thing with those wings on it
FairysHuff: I sure am - My name is just Kammerjunk. I'm the guy who's online.
moar rokets
Also, uno momento.
ok now give me some characters and plot develpment and a GOD DAMN REASON TO MAKE IT
more wheels
g'day everypony
Mop
i read this fanfic called "A Clopfic by... Spike!?" It actually wasen't that bad
Phase4, try to throw the cockpit as far as you can and see if those wings on it actually carry it well
im talking
yeah and i read a fic called how twilight got pregant it was terrible
D3rb
Kammerjunk Which one? Theres 10 ^_^ And two of them have the same avatar
more wheels
I read a fic called Today, Tomorrow, and Forever. My Little Dashie was nothing compaired.
JRP2234[iPhone], whats happening mate?
which one is more disturbing, Cupcakes or Sweet Apple Masacure?
that said, I dont like MLD anyway, so my opinion might be bias
D3rb I'm not sober
:o
:O:O
i shall be like that soon JRP2234[iPhone]
:o:o:o
:D:D:D
D3rb r u in epping?
:D:D:D:D:D
somany rokets
00,02hmm
so many wonders
00,02front heavy
rdibp, asking that is like asking which is more useful, an empty box of matches or a wet piece of paper. both are pretty useless
explosion
use ALL the rockets!!!!
00,02dat should help a little
that is to say, rdibp, that neither were disturbing
6_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_9:P6_96_9 spot the different one
Rain, obviously something is wrong with you :P
wheres the kaboom?
hmm.. I dont know, brony_boy115. could it be the one that is : P?
third tolast
I think one of you's is here with me
how many rockets can that thing hold?
,=,e
more on front
00,02i'm adding rockets
what do you mean JRP2234[iPhone] ?
00,02why isnt it going to space
yeah, I dont know what you were doing with that, brony_boy115. like :P is blatiantly different than 6_9
bigger wings?
You need a stable plane under it, Phase4
,=,e
Why must be a electronic artist
FairysHuff: Sorry, I had to help carry in groceries. I'm the guy with the Appledash avatar who's online.
i know its a tease
:D
gonna be going to San Diego, California in 5 days!! ;););)
D3rb where u live?
"I opened the chutes. Why didnt it go to space!?"
more front rokets
FairysHuff: Well, technically I'm both the guys with the Appledash avatar, I just don't play on one.
I can't help with planes - you and Sumi are way ahead of me on that (my computer lags badly with big ships)
Kammerjunk Steam is being a pain. It's not finding you even though it did before. This may take a while.
JRP2234[iPhone], sorta kinda near ferntree gully but not in ferntree gully
:O
D3rb will u marry me
rdibp: for what if you dont mind me asking?
also the central jet is probably actually a rocket, because it doesn't have an air intake
wat?
6-9
no JRP2234[iPhone] i will not marry you lol
6_9
Me sad
but that's minor compared to the lack of lift you're getting
rdibp: you sayed you were going to san diego
you can have this muffin though
yes? :)
/me gives JRP2234[iPhone] a muffin
to da moon
anyway
night
gn hen3ry
rdibp: for what?
IM CONFUSED!!! :[
what time is it
Ghosties: will you marry me
best landing ever
rdibp: like are you going there for vaction or something
cow334_Box: oh! Vacation
rdibp: awesome have fun
i might be going to comic con
Lol why an I here in this state
Kammerjunk At last ^_^ we got there
you should be able to make a plane that is just 2 wheels, a cockpit, parachutes, and a big fan to push the chutes
nice, get a derpy toy rdibp
FairysHuff: Yes indeedy.
rdibp: that is even better
i was guessing that was wy you where going there seems legit
but all the derpys, sell on ebay, $$$
Dosh.
buy**
cow334_Box: tickets are sold out so my dad is going to try to get tickets from somone else
00,02needs more parachutes
best way to go is to stop, Phase4 :3
also, you startin'?
oh well good luck rdibp
cow334_Box: BTW main reason im going there is to see my dad
awesome rdibp
wait is there going to be a my little pony convention at comic con? any one know
like a panel or something
cow334_Box: i heard that Tabitha St. Germain might be there
there will be mlp merch cow334_Box but i THINK thats about it
im probably wrong though
wow that is going to be awesome
d3rb: seems okay then
It is not definate that i am going but the odds look good
comic con i mean
Divine Divinity £3.99 on steam right now. Though I would buy it on GOG instead.
Phase4, needs more LIFT
whats going on all i see is a flaming roket movie and exploding mind freeze 6_9
00,02rockets == lift
00,02i have plently of lift
silence
I'd buy stuff on Steam, but I need the dosh for EVE Online.
if rockets = lift this would hit space in 30 seconds
00,02hmmm
00,02brb
I want this song to play at my wedding
rockets also = weight
Kammerjunk Never got into EVE, tried it but didn't like the controls or third person style of the game.
and you also have a lot of that
FairysHuff: Most of the game is looking at numbers, too.
welp guys, I'm going now. Talk to you on Monday
cya AttackAndalite
AttackAndalite: Valedico! Have fun!
/me hugs for ALL TEH CHAT
/me is huged
,=,e
hya
hey brony_boy115
*BIG YAWN*
had to tidy house
/me yawns
...DAMMIT
^_^
I'm listening to AnimeNfo radio to keep me awake. O_o
Nothing like J-pop to keep you bouncy
e_0
what about happy hardcore/freeform hardcore?
WHut? O_o
suger helps stay awake
needs more jet
brony_boy115 I have that as well in the form of Lucozade
lolege
Sugar & J-pop = happy bounce ^_^
MORE JETS
00,02hmm
00,02not enough
only 11 hours till movie night
00,02contro
00,02control
00,02needs more control
it needs to be about 20% cooler
i aim to please
Phase4: you make Rarity very happy ;)
Kammerjunk I see you have Civ V, I found it to be overly simplistic and too easy. What did you think?
lawl
i know
FairysHuff: On itself, I think it was alright. The main reason I play it some times is because some friends play it.
just a few addons
I cant wait to see what this place looks like when season 3 premires
LIFT!
mah blue flaming head :3
00,02getting close
rdibp, if its anything like season 2's premire, then there are going to be over 7k people
danm Bungie
Kammerjunk I'd like it a lot more if it wasn't so formulaic. Theres so little choice. Once you get into a pattern in the game you just repeat that until you win. >_> Not great for a strategy game
:$
88 mph!
back in time!
:$
FairysHuff: I agree. I prefer the previous game.
Kammerjunk Never played it
From the drop, this sounds kind of like Skrillex.
eww dubstep
do a standing roket
Rain: there were more bronies in the season 2 premire than in the season 1 finale, there will probably be like 1000 coments a second
what is this game called?
Sammiver: Kerbal Space Program, IIRC.
i remember when music was played on instruments
00,02hmmmm
kammerjunk ok thanks :$
00,02mabey it does need struts
rdibp, you should have been here for the season 1 premire! :D
...wait.......CELESTIADAMMIT
kerbals yum yum (drules.....)
add more rockets!
that rocket totally needs more rockets
fried kerbal
I'm just downloading MiicroVolts on steam. Been waiting for this game for a year ^_^
is a macbook an instrument?
rdibp: Actually, Skrillex does play the guitar.
it needs about 20% more rockets
docter whoof
00,02problem fixed
00,02Sammiver, true dat
PARTAY
rdibp: Also, you remind me of an old grumpy man quoted as saying "You have technicians here making noise. No one is a musician. They're not artists because nobody can play the guitar."
rdibp, your not gonna start with the this isnt real music thing are you?
cake fight
00,02i call that a success
d3rb: just stating a point and nothing else :P
00,02what to do now?
Or we could all just agree that everyone likes different types of music.
who would win chocolate or lemon
The whole "electronic isn't music" thing is silly. Music is "the art or science of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion."
00,02^
i just dont know what went wrong
00,02Kammerjunk gets it
you point is invalid though
00,02thats one of the reasons i REALY like music that combines both
I love various forms of Japanese music which most people I know think I'm a weirdo for liking. *Shrugs* We're all different
standing roket please
im not saying that dubstep is bad, i just would rather prefer music from the past, unless it has something to do with ponies :P
a drum machine is an instrament, so is a synthasizer
00,02ooo
00,02new alex s
Me, I like most genres of music. Hell, I even like a little pop and a little rap.
has anyone heard alex s new VIP?
cow334_Box: what now?
00,02rdibp, listening now
The fun has been doubled!
I hate rap mysep but I wouldn't complain to someone about it who liked it ^_^
Phase4: ITS SO AWESOME /)^3^(\
free for all to see who is the best out of us
Oh hey, a Trixie song.
i love thissong
sure custom
00,02not liking it as much as the pinkie vip
watch in awe!
heard it
d3rb Yup. As is everything in life.
00,02the next plane i'm flying is not mine
Phase4 it gets better
00,02found it on the kerbal fourm
cow334_Box: k
Phase4: The question is, does it work?
00,02it utilizes an interesting bug in the physics engine
Oh.
00,02Kammerjunk, it does
Kammerjunk: the real question is, does it blend
rdibp: Everything blends.
...Except plastic made to look like Chuck Norris, apparently.
sooooooo much lift
Kammerjunk Not everything blends. Ponies don't blend. We won't let them.
00,02its tricky to pilot
lol
i know one certian pony that blends ponies......:O
cow334_Box: speed halo next?
this VIP is awesome
Dat drop.
needs more cowbell
Phase4 that looks, unwieldy
LOL
/me is loving this plane
:D
its a fan plane! XD
needs to be 20% coo- well you know what
Hey Hey Hey
MicroVolts almost finished downloading. sssooooo close to playing as a japanese anime figurine ^_^
/me hums ride of the valkyrie
where are the engines!?!?! :[
00,02der we go
00,02rdibp, there are no engines
:[:[:[
00,02its powerd completly by sas bugs
i hate balloons
INFINITE POWAAAAAAAAAAH!
what.....
not infinite
PIKACHU POWARH
00,02doesnt work outside the atmosphere
really? damn
space!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111 please!!!! :(
Phase4: how the hell is that thing flying? :D
the little guys down there are dancing :P
then you should strap some rockets to it and set them off when you break atmosphere
...Assuming rockets wouldn't break it.
00,02Irish_Pony, as i said, sas bugs
00,02not sure if its rounding errors or simulation errors
they should make real planes like this....no emmisions *trollface*
00,02XD
00,02exploit rounding errors in the universe
Rina Chan is best....err....something
might be be the fact that the wings are working like fans
Well, this doesn't looks silly when it's flying at all.
space spae
00,02i'ma head for that island
head for that landingstrip infront of you
00,02oh
00,02nvm
To infinity and beyond!
Sammiver: thats falling with style
INB4 splash.
why are the wings in synch with the music?
there goes the wings lol
00,02its quite fragile
lawl
Who is playing?
Phase4 is
pindrop
:O
ded
runway
are they ever going to reach the moon???
and lifttooooofffff
Boom.
00,02AWESOME
+phase4 is best pony! :P
boom boom
00,02all planes should do that
rdibp: If I'm not mistaken, Phase4 fly to the Moon and back again.
00,02?
!
00,02i did make it there and back
Phase4 what happens if oyou put boosters on that plane?
00,02more than once
00,02Chrysalis, lets find out
was there a parade on arrival?
eeyup find out
you must save all the ponies stuck on the moon!
to the moon quik
inb4 it tears apart
those are going to hit the wings when they detach
inb4 ded
huh that works quite well...
oh wait
there goes a wing
burned off the wing?
and the other
speed halo time :3
YEAHHHAHHAH
called it
wait what staight up
I will fly you to the Moon and back if you'll be (if you'll be) my baby.
promote me to tleader
leader
it is still going fast, Chrysalis. you pull up and it will go up
The power of friendship will help you fly!
/me promotes cow334_Box leader
dat savage garden
:P
00,02this plane actually kinda hovers down
Well, this doesn't look silly at all.
because of so much lift
cow334_Box: there
lol
physics'
eeyup
it looks like a crossbow
turn on sas while pointing up
04BronyState 101; a class in film and ponies~

um
cow334_Box: i forgot to dowload my classic halo maps XD
is it just floatin
wtf
/me was looking at the user count up top
HALO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
indeed XD
Chrysalis: Pinkie Pie might be behind this
LAWL
this plane is epic
00,02i wonder
splashdown
it needs no chutes
Titanic
lolege
winder?
bigger rockets?
dammit where have i heard this song before?
add more rockets
mount them underneath so they dont tear the wings
whos sings this?
rdibp: Hey Ocean.
sound is mixed by DJ
rdibp: The original, anyway. The song is called Make a New Dance Up.
*facehoof* dammit im an idiot
Asleigh Ball is best singer
Oh right, she sung this, didn't she?
eeyup
00,02this should be interesting
"sing until you have no voice" oh the irony
why?
OMG! O_O I'm playing as an anime girl figurine! I'm SO HAPPY ^_^ WOO!
nothing left of her voice, autotuned to the MAX
Rain: because of her work voicing Rainbow Dash her voice often gets screwed up so she cant perform in concerts
This song is good...
00,02hmmm
It made me have the most FUCKED UP DREAM
But good
00,02oh god Vordox
What music is it?
look up Hey Ocean
I hate guitar hero because of my brothers playing it when I am sleeping
it makes me have some wierd ass dreams
i dreamed i was a pony in ponyville and pinkie pie was my best friend
Goo blues!!!!! Yea as
its sung by the same person who voices Rainbow Dash
Rain: lawl i love that game
i play expert
OHH THIS IS MY JAM
as do I. doesnt mean I dont hate the game with a passion
/me ears bleeding
Rain: My sister plays Guitar Hero all the time. So I got myself a headset.
i hate balloons with a PASSION
...And she also likes Bieber.
/me fixes d3rb's ears with Pinkie Pie's froth wall abilitys
Thats a neat design
forth*
why did they put a thruster on the back if it does nothing?
oh sweet, pinkie pie gave me some awesome music to listen to
the bleeding has stopped
:$
OH SWEET CELESTIA IT FLIES! not
hold B for breaks :3
Sammiver, it actually does

obsession*
Lil_B everytime i come on here he is always playing this game
:D Ghost
00,02i think its time for a different game
Lets face it:

Going to space is impossible
I am your host, the man they call Ghost.

CCCP *Cuddles* ^_^
PYRO
Phase4: isnt wrek on vacation?
hey guys
I kind of have a bit of a distaste for Football. Too many people missing out on more interesting stuff just to watch a bunch of people running back and forth a field with a handegg.
hay alexxm
hi alexxm
Hey quick question, whats the movie tonight
?
Kandarihu I loathe all team sports.
hye VioletGreySha and CCCP how have you been
04Are you sure, Violet? You wouldn't mind a request?
i have the element of loyalty :3
So repetitive
Kandarihu I prefer stuff like swimming, rock climbing, archery etc. Now those take skill.
nope they take practice
wkes up yawns and streches
i have the element of laughter :O
Sports are meant to be played, not watched (except for becoming a better player)
04Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood, Men In Tights
Ghosties: sure if you like my artstyle then there isnt a problem xD
hey brony_boy115 you sleep well
SAMMIVER GIGGLE AT GHOSTIES
XD
I won't be able to make it for BMN tonight.
Smash your head against your keyboard and post the results
Hmm... My download is still lagging. Barely half a meg a second O_o
04Alright, thanks Violet!
gedfhfdjfgtjswrtjkrsytuisytks

CCCP: bn
I'll probably be able to be here for Euro Movie Night, but I might have to leave early.
Hey CCCP! :)
CCCP gtdfgtrggftgbtfv
lol
hi MadSurge :3
04If you could, would you draw a bag of pork rinds serenading a pig in a strawberry tower?
Speaking of movie night what are the movies tonight?
Kandarihu: :<
Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood: Men in Tights
04^
FairysHuff road to eldorado and robinhood men in tights
I LOVE that B Movie
Ghosties: äääh i only draw ponies and yah xD
oh lawd yess
i hope someone airs a long pony movie we can watch :D thats fanmade
SABERSPARK
Has never heard of Road to Eldorado. Unless you mean the old black and white western?
and its funny :3
nope, animated kids one
04Awwwwww, no bag of pork rinds serenading a pig in a tower made out of strawberries?
It's raining cats and dogs here all of a sudden o__o
Sir_Brony Ah... think I'll skip it then
This game looks like it's playing more like Dodgeball than Football
clear skies for me and dang
it's a good movie
Ghosties: eww, a tower made of ground-up tongues!
someone should read My Little Dashie and air it :D
Ghosties: no sorry iam still not able to draw something else then ponies
Sammiver: Scoot-Scootaloo already did.
I think there have been attempts
SCOOTALOOS A CHICKEN
I've heard that there is a film version of MLD being created...
DEAL WITH IT
Come ON! FFS! What is eating up my bandwidth O_o It shouldn't be running so slow.
sammiver: mic already did
sonicandmario85: Fun fact: The description for the Scootaloo toy starts out with "Scootaloo is no chicken!"
um zero, that was a my little brony spoof pic
That can't possibly be coincidence.
:'(
Kammerjunk, that's awesome. I hate that meme.
i dont have any mlp toys
im a closet brony
:3
I have g1
no wait g2
Sir_Brony: no, there is
sleepy colt
Friend of mine works at McDonalds. She gave me Twilight and Fluttershy when they came out as the Happy Meal toy.
I still need to buy a brush, though.
really? and the tears are coming with the laughter
http://derpy.me/R25Sx
Well while my download sits at 20 minutes left for the next two hours I think I shall get a little nap. Can't do anything online while it's downing anyways.
Ghosties: if you want ponies pm me if not then not :P
04Hmm
FairysHuff: Read a book!
That Scootaloo = Chicken meme is all based on Apple Bloom falsely accusing her of being a chicken, and it's just gotten out of hand.
04I was really set on that bag of pork rinds serenading a pig in a tower made out of strawberries :/
CCCP:dr.rainbow dash XD
sonicandmario85: :D
04Oh well, I can't really think of anything else right now. Maybe later? ^_^
Kammerjunk I've read every book I have 7 times ^_^ And all the new stuff is shallow.
Phase4: what is that
FairysHuff|Sleep: You need more books. Hell, I... "own"... a little over 700 books, and guess what?
fifty shades of worser than the twilight
NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
00,02cow334_Box, what is what?
Kammerjunk I have about the same ^_^
Phase4: the map you are playing one
on like wow
FairysHuff|Sleep: Yay reading!
00,02surf something
00,02its a surf map
AND THEN THERE WERE SANDVICHES
Kammerjunk Mostly Fantasy books. Raymond e feist, Katherine Kerr etc.
Phase4: wow looks cool
Ghosties: iam nearly 24h at my computer 5 of them are sleep and the rest doin stuff like drawin i got so much time just message me at a random time xD
http://derpy.me/-COGl
I made a Sandvich yesterday, actually. Some mayo on white bread, salad, cheese, tomatoes, a bit of this fantastic salami we have, and then another piece of bread.
It was delicious.
Kammerjunk The new fantasy writers that started in the past ten years, their works feel so bland and shallow. I just can't read them their so boring.
04Oh, sure Violet. Thanks ^^
FairysHuff|Sleep: Yeah, I hear ya there.
Ghosties: np :3
"This is my commandment: love each other in the same way I have loved you" John 16:12
