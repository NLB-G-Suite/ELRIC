why doesnt she just use her horn?
i <3 rarity
Well then you two are shameful
Rarity is my favorite Pony.
why not use her magic? :P
I think she is such a darling
The way rarity acts makes me want to slap her some times
Someone's is speaking bad things of Rarity?
My self hugging shirt!
The lack of Rainbow Dash in this ep disturbs me
The whole point of Rarity is that she's stuck up and flawed, but ultimately generous and kind ;)
It's goddamn suspicious, yes
Rarity is my favourite out of the mane six
that rage repression
But hey, we all knew how it would turn out.
my turn?
The lack of rainbow dash in this episode pleases me
only Starmie and Gengar have consistently remained beasts.
Why is an ad for asian women pop out of my screen?
You gotta spend money to make money, as Apple well knows.
ZNNT!
kawaii!
00,02RosePetal, you forgot to install adblock
Wait
ALL the Mane 6 have one character flaw or more, despite their heroism.
don't forget, Gen 5 also got rid of the need of HM whores.

Which one is best?
Also no opinion is bad
The gasps have been doubled!
DAT VOICE CRACK
There are no bad opinions, only stupid ones.
Stupid diva...
Rarity thinks everything is a war crime
I noticed that in Season 2 There was more CMC episodes.
And my opinions are automatically best.
I closed the page when ponies came on.
episode 4 of season 3 is supposibly gonna be a CMC episode
And then there are opinions you don't agree with.
How do you know?
...
CMC should have their spin-off
I think I've got withdrawal.

But still I'm going to be getting desktop soon
the benefit of a desktop is that when it's time to upgrade, you don't have to replace EVERYTHING
Ok it seems alo0t say desktop...
YES LANDING
It's all about preference, but I really prefer desktops because they're much easier to get behind the hood of
or not
OMG WERE LANDING
*alot
13they're expensive, but can do waaaaay more than consoles
00,02i accidentally went into orbit
OH NICE XD
Which, if you know/don't wanna know much about the guts of a computer, then that wouldn't be an advantage.

00,02MirrorImage, wine == wine is not an emulator
alright, let me rephrase that
13Wine Isn't An Emulator
/me doesn't use emulators
13sixth for mvm?
Damn, we're going to the moon.
emulator is a very broad term in that sense
00,02tSparx, its fun :P
Oh my gawd

is he landing
00,02MirrorImage, ^

/me cheers
woot woot
00,02tSparx, its less than that
Let's land this motherfucker.
00,02tSparx, its anywhere betwene 0 and 15KM altitude

I want amneasia NAAAAO
Guys, landing a multi-ton spaceship on a moon from thousands of feet up requires a lot of decelaration and patience. No drag force to slow the ship down, after all, and he wants to be able to take off afterward
This is where the Mars Direct approach works
Why take off? We can live on the moon with Luna.
All you need to do is send people to the moon
then keep sending supplies until you figure out how to get them back home
00,02stop going up please
lol
Celestia moon banishment program
ooh, dat tilt
Brb.
She sent us all to the moon :(

No, not really.
No. I have dealt with it a lot though.
I'm on a different nick.

I find that amusing
lol nice.
Books are good.
That's very useful.
a few months ago, I bought a book conveniently titled "How to be a Canadian *even if you already are on"
They usually are....
For example, only Newfoundlanders have sex.
and our government doesn't work
We complain alot.
We have 12 ways to say sorry, but rarely apologize.

You'd think that, with 101 users on the channel, there'd be some convo
Is Super-Squeezy all an entire Music Man parody? Somehow I missed this episode
Well, the opening song certainly is.
The Music Man, it's a musical
I'm not sure then :/
This song isn't even trying to hide the fact that it's a MM parody haha
00,10the bomb
00,10not the tanks
Yes?
NDAs suck
I has awesome but tell none I can
Also ninjaing a spot in MvM
:p
00,02whats with all the metal
X3 now I has 3 nda's
If not more
Well
00,02Dumorimasoddaa, stopped playing :(
Darn
00,02they need to make ksp multiplayer
Yeah okay, the rest of Super-Squeezy isn't really a Music Man parody
wat
00,02PonyNegZero, i recomend sleep

anyone playing Guild Wars 2 right now?
00,02this seems totaly safe
it is release now
00,10this is going to be a spectacular fireball
00,02bet you the outer rockets crush everything as soon as i turn the srb's on
I am on the sorrows furnace america server
00,10yep
00,02oh wow
character name Kristof Bowen
00,02WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe
which server?
Darkhaven
00,02indeed
is it automatic?
That is going to blow up...
00,02there we go
00,02i'm totaly sure
Then go for it
00,02already have
yeah A little for me I think i should just refresh
00,02or fuel
00,02that can help
And duct tape. :P
00,02lol it goes too fast
I'll be right back
Aghhhhhj
Fuck you gws
/me calms down
00,02heard something about that
00,02other team was 93 ahead or something at half time
128 points
00,02fast landing
00,02not enough fuel
Holla everypony! :)
into Mun*

00,02i like this lander
00,02lolnice mas
00,02MASF123, '
00,02anyone still watcing
00,02?
00,02watching'
00,02derpspell
/me raises his hand :P
00,02Sumica, you there?
Cbf playing anything, just readin' a book.
00,02PonyNegZero, SLEEP :<
o_O
00,10yeah, what's up?
Sleep is for the weak
00,02interesting takeof procedure for this lander
00,02Sumica, watch
00,02not sure how far behind stream is
00,10all them nubs
00,02ikr
00,02i think the most efficent way to de-orbin from the mun is gust go up
00,02Sumica, its fine
00,02just takes a while
00,10yeah best way is to wait till facing kerblin and just lift off
00,02thsi could be bad
00,10try for an orbit
00,10ah
00,02found kerbin
I have no idea what's going on O.o
00,02ekips, i'm returning from the mun
00,02Sumica, this lander gives no fucks, slam it in to the ground at 15M/s and it'll just bounce
00,10lol
We need the expert
Call Bill Nye we need his advice
I still think it needs more rockets. :P
00,02oh come on bill
Then suddenly bagpipes
00,02your barely passing 2 g's
00,02stop complaining
08,01i want pizza
08,01i always get like this
08,01i have pizza, then i want more pizza
/me nuzzles Saturn.
I got to go to my high school graduation today
00,02Saturn, i have that same cycle with pasta's
00,02i'll brb
00,02PonyNegZero, AND Y U NO SLEEP :<
00,02i sware no one here sleeps
hallo :)
such fitting music
/me 08,01licks PonyNegZero's cheek
I know this music...where is it from?
Waltz for Trixie
sleep
wooy woot
00,02Malk, no, no it does not
00,02i need another playlist
00,02but i like makkon's music :(
Well I sleep on mondays
Mondays nothing goes on monday thats sleep day
np :)
/me tries to find a music identification software that works with the browser
get SoundHound
no phone
I only have an old blackberry
brb
all the softwares I find want me to hum into the micro...
and i'm me again
definately
no fins?
if it doesnt, just add more rockets
00,02oops
this is madness
if in doubt
add more rockets
left something behind there? :D
OHHH NO
if not in doubt
add more rockets
oh...this is bad
Whoa :O
Boooom
boom
00,02PonyNegZero, :( i hope you get enough sleep
hey guys
00,02what the
good good. busy procrastinating
bang
awesome
10
00,02it was a staging problem
and still no fins
before you are satisfied
you monster
all of them
00,02there may also be other issues
he lives!
lol
00,02now i have to buy all these parachutes
Good night every one
blasphemy!
hm...or the stability thing
00,02come to think of it
00,02i may have put some of the upper srb's on the lower tage
that would explain the effect
00,02ok
lower stage ignited first
yes
and again, Dil survives for another run
Is the top half even attached to the bottom?
00,02RD_is_awesome, via a seperator
needs a strong frame structure
auxiliary start boosters on the upper stage
wobbly
The top does look like it is just sitting on the bottom when you get on the launch pad and the wobbles start
apply struts everywhere
statics problem
it needs an exoskeleton
00,02oh nvm
00,02its working
Haha :D
outrages
cool
still not exploded
give it time derpy
00,02ok
oops
00,02new problem found
the gods of aerodynamics and tensile stress would kick you in the face for this anyway
00,02AdamTheDuck, link from another channel
this stage works
next
the struts fail
all of them
00,02only works ~50% of the time
wait...the inner boosters collide with each other during the separation process, right?
tanks
:)
redlong finds this unsettling
00,02cant stop the spinning
00,02this is gona get anoying
00,02on the plus side i got the entire thing into orbit
<3 this song :3
Avast Octavia's Plot :)
a single maneuvering thruster should be enough to stop the spinning
First pony song I ever heard. :)
Same here. And still as good as ever. :)
I think the music is fitting for the successful launch, this was a triumph
still awesome
if someone had told me a year ago, I wouldn't have believed it
don't know this one
You might want to check it out.
I'm at it
It's very similiar to the Avast Octavia's plot.
Bell Crystals is the name of the song.
00,02^
Additional supply depoits requires... FUUUUUU
00,02i time warped a little too long
the lack of rockets disgusts me
^
april is early
00,02i'm honestly not sure how to add more
00,02its alreay trying to explode on the pad
00,02unless.....
Dat "unless" :D
oh know he is going to do it, que dramatic music
Inb4 evil laugh.
uh oh
unless is a dangerous wor
My first live episode was Read It And Weep :)
thing episode 23 was the first to come out after I joined
00,02Chrysalis, those caused it to explode
00,02plus all the structural points are covered in srb
erm
My 1st live episode was Feeling Pinkie Keen
add more rockts to push it together?
the driven stage folds the stage above it together until explosion
00,02someone link me a playlist
00,02prefferably pony orchestral
00,02that'll work
most couldn't handle the sudden load
It's ideal background music.
5 bits says it wxplodes on takeoff
00,02i'm suprised it doesnt instantly crush the engines
00,02i actually didnt expect this
imposssibruuuuuuuuuuu
00,02^
add more stages!
beautiful
I think that is Jeb
mayday mayday
00,02he survived
jebediah was the pilot
Jebediah is always off his chops
00,02jeb is the only one i could convince to fly it
00,02not sure why
00,02oh go
00,02god'
00,02when jeb screams you know something is wrong
00,02oh nvm
00,02looks like it might just achive lift
00,02there we go
00,02look at all those struts
needs more rockets
Anyone got marshmallows?
would a rarity work?
wheeeeeeee :D
/me passes the marshmallows around
OMG it spins.
00,02theres something i want to try
00,02not sure if this has enough power to do it
00,02oh damn
00,02launched the wrong way
00,02lets see if i can remove the escape velocity
fast forward
00,02Malavolent, the up down orbit
00,02heh
00,02i like how its predicting a mun intercept when to actually encounter it i would need to orbit THROUGH kerbin
^
might give kurth a bit of a kiss on the sling shot
the physics engine lets you cut through planets fine
00,02i'ma get soo much speed with these little rockets
Next sop: Galiffrey.
00,02hurry up and go faster pls
I wanna see the g-force report on re-entry
00,02i actually want to try exploiting kerbins orbit and getting a re-entry speed of > 20KM/s
00,02brb
hello everypony
00,02and back
00,02its still going
chat's quiet today
actually for me it's afternoon
00,02http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/24/3254422/apple-samsung-trial-verdict
42 minutes into the afternoon
too bad those on the jury all used iphones
13:42 here
00,02RoboGerbil, ikr
00,02"the company was found to have infringed the design patent for the iPhone's array of icons across the board."
afternoon
12:43 here
00,02no
00,02it was against most of samsungs devices
00,02apple
00,02has a patent
00,02on a grid
/me hides his Samsung TV
00,02"didn't make sense because the jury had awarded money to Apple for devices it said hadn't infringed in the first place."
00,02yeah, i'm certin something else is going on here
randomly chosen citizens decided this?
10 bucks apple payed off the jury
00,025.2 KM/s
(\
00,02because its an incredibly evil thing to do
00,02and would probably kill apple
Now I feel like selling my iPhone and buying an android :D
00,026KM/s
it would be stupid to not buy the jury
00,02this'll be fun
here come the g-forces, also apple need to stop being cryfags
00,02?
i have 2 android devices, an EEEpad and a LG Optimus
00,02oh, jeb;s in this one
I would be a cryfag for a billion
lol
00,0251.3G
00,02now i have an idea
LOL, jeb is mince meat
eva during a high G arc :3
00,02what the
lol
they are?
OOPS
all i've ever bought from apple was an ipod and that was when i had no phone
00,02k, launching at sunrise
I grew up only on Apple. I'm more of a nostalgiafag than applefag.
compared to this, bronydom looks highly reasonable
LE COLLAPSE :D
ouchie
00,10use launch braces
00,02Sumica, cant
I never used an apple
too expensive for the things it can do
BOOOOOOOOOOOM
wouldn't rejects one though
AND HE LIVED :D
00,02Sumica, i can only attach to the srb's which doesnt really work
00,10plenty of room inside
heheheh, Angry Whopper
00,10quite a desgine flaw
00,10it blows off a section when ejecting the srb's
00,02and the lander is unharmed
00,02i can totaly land this thing
http://cheezburger.com/6529347584 WANT WANT WANT
hi everyone :)
00,02dose are nice shoes
yes they are
00,02high speed landing is go
00,02he totaly survived that
00,10thud
And he lived!
Jeb lives yet again!
00,10his spine is also 7 inches shorter from that landing
only 5.7Gs he lives
00,10could try the tanks between the stages
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
MY FACE HURTS
00,02kirzstryfe, whatever do you meen >_>
damn shaver
00,10that way you can do you dawn launch with out having to worry about it falling over
thats a lot of fish ... I mean rockets
Hey Lil_B1
*!
whats this song called
BOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
00,10coupeling failure
hi :)
the dodo
the cmc overcoming their learning disabilities is against the rules. they are too convenient how they are
00,10reminds me of gt3 music
where is le allegro?
08,01cmc are best cmc
/me glomps Saturn
00,02ooooo
00,02tough call
I'll go with Sweete belle too
I've studied too much already. cmc=critical micelle concentration
00,02so
00,02i think i need to rethink this
hey everypony
no inner tanks. they collide too often
dem rockets
00,02ksp is soo laggy
EXPEL EVERYTHING
Pinkie <3
00,02i have to give up those three srb's :(
08,01see, i like AB's tenacity and determination
08,01i think i could make somethign good with that
00,02i dont think i'd chose any, because it migh seperate one from the rest
08,01ADOPT ALL THE CMC
00,02^^^^^^^^^^^
08,01i want children :(
Saturn with kids?
omg
Saturn + 3 miniSaturns
thats a terrifying though
Saturn with moons
How many Rockets are that?
they should get nameed after the moons of Saturn
hey Saturn
obai pony pepple
00,02WorkingJoe11, not enough
Like dere's neva enuff Dakka
oh the huma... kerbality!
00,02bronies? where
00,02Finally
00,02oh this is much more successfull
00,02i do have a plan
00,02there is a point to this mission
00,02OH COME ON
00,02stupid fuel lines
Foiled again!
~You spin me right round baby right round~
well it spins
you spin me right round
something hit you in midair
We can only hope :)
00,02that caused explosive instability
00,02we can try again
00,02last time
00,02:<
00,02that doesnt usualy happen
00,10it's inerita alowed it to break orbit
00,02XD
00,02Nice
00,02one more one more
00,02lat time
Goddessdammit, Guild Wars, log in!!
00,02last'
http://cheezburger.com/6518968832
08,01Chrysalis: shush you; i'm great with kids
08,01so long as i don't drop them
Saturn: good to know
00,02fuel in the lower stage is emptying
PERIOD
00,02Bronysith, XD
is GW2 down for anyone else?
00,02this is my plan
well
I have been playing for hours now, but got disco'd and cant log back in
00,02have to slow a smidge
00,02nvm, have to speed up
Guess there's been a massive influx of people trying to log in and their servers went "LOLNOPE".
login servers are down
lame
00,02XD
there we go
TIEM TO MURDER ALL THE DEMONS
all the guild wars servers are down too
00,02love how flat the orbit is
00,02somehow
00,02may JUST be able to do this
those stress tests must not have stressed enough
00,02i should totaly be recording this
00,02there we go
00,02and i'm not trying to hit the sun
Not dropping in to see Celestia, then?
00,02n
00,02no'
00,02trying to go back to kerbin
:)
00,02but in a fun way
damn I was having fun too
00,02Sumica, how fast?
00,101km/s by 10km up
00,02holy
00,02you start re-entry by taking off
00,10not enough fule to matain that burn
00,10ran out of fuel by 15km
00,10iniertia took it up to 65 km
00,02k, this is the slow booring bit where we need to wait for it to run out of fuel
00,02and hopefully hit about 3.5KM/s
11,02Night everypony ^-^
00,02so
00,02but the principal seems sound
00,02want to'
00,02need a faster time warp
00,02one more orbit then i'm probably gona stop streaming
why am I not surprised that a programm crashes when I set a parameter to "infinity" ?
heh heh heh
00,02run wordpress on freebsd
00,02well
00,02php is broke
00,02and its not telling me why
00,02i'm just trying to run phpinfo for now
basedir restrictions still apply there
00,02there we go
00,02php5-script, not php-script
nvm then :)
never used mod_php
00,02shana, i'm not sure if nsf is using mod_php or php-fpm
well php-fpm would be a seperate process
00,02come to think of it they're probably using fpm which makes this excersize a massive waste of time
I hope they're using php-fpm :)
00,02i am annoyed by this
00,02wat
Best music to code by in my opinion....
11,02Equestria LA sold out...I wanted to go to it ;~;
00,02scoots needs an episode
00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, :(
GUys
Hey everypony, who's streaming?
11,02AdamTheDuck: Cause I found out that convention sold out before I could get a ticket to it...
meh Equestria Daily is run by Rina-Chan
lolwat
I smell a conspiracy
:3
and there's way too much convention right now
It's the season, afterall
still should be spread
00,02thats enough streaming for me
oh lawl
If a con was during winter workmonths, it would have poor attendance,
also
Hehe, poor kerbals
http://youtu.be/Hu1No6jq-Q4 EileMonty>>>>>>>>Rina-Chan
Don't know either
Hehe
Soundfonts!
Build a mini soundproof room then :P
Dat.
Worth it!
INSAANIITTYY~
Hehehe, yeah- it's rather expensive for good VSTis and such
I mainly use live instruments, not cheaper to do that though
Hi
!
Thank you?
dat apprentenship
Live instrument>samples
I've got..12 guitars and basses <,<
Good afternoon everyone :)
23
No but honestly some of them cost like 100 dollars, 3 of them to be exact-
heavily modified by now though
and I got my first bass for around 150 dollars from my cousin. 92 Fender Mexico precision
but again you're awesome for that
Hehe
Do you play?
I well....play Violin....quite badly
though I know HOW to play it just not that good
hello :3
Aah, hehe- I always wanted to learn violin-
I have one that used to be my sisters, but I can't play it at all
I Tried to watch FiM with my ten year old cousin, she didn't want to watch it cus she said it was for babies
Aww-
That's a shame. :(
But I think she secretly enjoyed it
On demos you hear- crazy good samples
Ello everyone
Ello

11,02dat meh o.o
Reeaapeeer
It's 'free' if you use it--for non commercial or something
It's like- eh you download the full version, and it asks you everytime if you want to pay
Well I'm off to sleep. Goodnight everyone. :)
I used it while I was saving for Cubase, which cost-- 350 dollars
Studio*
can't decide-
headphones ftw
but--yeah- I have to consider headphones. I while back it was said that it was a bad idea, but- headphones have gotten really good, you know? So- yeah.
I'll get the Sennheisser SP 25-13-SpII
I'm going to buy a Sennheiser e906 microphone as soon as I can- thouh I'd probably need speakers or headphones before that
you guys need something to listen to? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZM4Z7W0_M
but if I really want something that works long and is just incredible for it's price I should use this sennheisser model, and he quite convinced me XD
Hmm- I have to stop by the musicstore and check it out too. I mean, all my mixing is done in mono at the moment <,<
I had these eh I dunno 50 dollar empire speakers. They were really nice until they blew out
I'm back! Good morining everypony
Mornin'!
Maybe headphones would allow me to- play without having to use such loud speakers too
Did they <----- streamed the Hub last weekend?
I had to make my speakers match up with my bass amp, and after about a month they blew out
blowing out takes quite a while
aah nice, yeah
i had these for 1 year
Hon
Same here
heh yeah
YES YES YES YES YES
1- At No Way Out
(Ziggler replaced ADR)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZM4Z7W0_M
2- Money In The Bank (Sheamus def. ADR)
3- Summerslam (Sheamus won......with a low blow???)
Shouldn't the heel play dirty, not the other way around?
Yeah it doesn't make him look good to do that
I honestly wish we streamed more G4 episodes of ponies
Meh
here is a neat vid http://youtu.be/WsqdmqRgrIc
That's Slick Rick, there's no denying he's a legend......
^
yep
He's supossed to win by BRUTE STRENGTH
>Sheamus....
>_>
No doubt
it's like when they tried to turn him heel by attacking tarji but the fans wouldn't boo him
Lol
Tarjiri was cool
OK, on a further note, in the pre-show....Antonio Cesaro won the US title......finally, it's getting back some prestige
Yup
hey ppl
(it was an accident)
Nothing beats when he went against Undertaker at Wrestlemania. That reason alone I bought the PPV
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN!
Hmm, stream is down, huh?

Also, at the risk of sounding stupid, how did he get his OC as a desktop pony?

Makes sense.
I think- most of them were made in mspaint? or SAI, and then just made into gifs of some kind and imported
loooollll
lets do this
00,02this wasnt exploding earlier
aw
ALL THE ROCKETS
dinggggg
I have one week to finish my summer work and I'm doing this.

I heard that song in many movies
OHSHOOT
00,02its still going up
Never said it was horrible
00,02dont worry
It's still going
Hi everypony
Derpy did it, it's her fault^
00,02normally it would have 6 more boosters and power through this
00,02but the boosters in the center kept taking out the rockets
"A-Russian compoonents, A-Amerikan compoonents... ALL MADE IN TAIWAN!" *clang!*
00,02XD
:D
I'm in Taiwan right now, FYI
/me hugs wiff X3
"There! *clang* Now we can go home!" *clang*

It's working!
don't stop. Believing!
HOLD ON THE THAT FEEELLINGANG!!
to that*
ohshoot :O
That altimeter keeps messing up
That doesn't look good
And the stream is lagging on me.
BBR Breakfest
*BRB
that's baaad, 1st stage gone and it's only like a mile up...
that is some thrust to weight ratio there...
Maybe it's in kilometers?
I know.
Just, hafta have dat peak impulse, and then maximize time accelerating.
it is slowly losing momentum
=o
Lol
00,02Kurra, you did model rockets?
00,02alexxm, get to apoapsis
00,02and turn around
Estes is my dealer. X3
00,02go the other way
GW servs down :(
let them actually get the servers right
then play
00,02oooo
00,02this is problematic
CUTE BOMB DETECTED
http://i.imgur.com/Ma3yt.png
00,02i need a delta-v of 10KM/s
There's still 2 more stages I think
00,02i dont have that
I would watch that actually
and then THE ASTROCAM
00,02this wont work
poner pepple?
It'll work is we believe!
00,02i cant add anymore to this design
00,02i had to REMOVE rockets to stop it exploding
00,02what else do i have

00,02surely it should be 0.2% cargo
perhaps it changed since the 1990s
i r back. =|
the song
Wow. okay. I am just repeating myself now
Mornin everypony
whats this bein streamed?
looks fun
hmm never heard of it ;)
00,02RAGE
00,02launched the wrong way
intentionally or not, yes
more often not
there's a free demo, or i think the "Minecraft" version of it is about $15
and by "Minecraft," I'm referring to the development cycle
Back
00,02nuuuuuu! i missed it
/me is afk because of home renovation
whut?
*astronauts
is that debree going to collide?
00,02our poor kerbinaut would eventually colide with kerbin
00,02but meh
I think part of the fun is that it's realistic, but not hyperrealistic.
00,02Emil, i can launch them easy
00,02VioletLynnScraton, i am
ok
00,02DrSteveSCARz, the goal was to power into a higher orbit than kerbin
00,02then turn around and go backward
i see
This music.
wonderbolts win
00,02i want to do this cause it would cause the capsule to hit kerbin with a velocity of over 20KM/s
nuff said
00,02Nyst,
00,02?
Yaay!
00,02it would be
you know
00,02it would be just a smidge hard
cool
;_;
00,02Mishia, terrible
Without My little pony
/me turns depression into a trabable currency
but they were all without pony.
i personally like seing the Kerbals die with a grin on their face
KND EENE, Fosters,
I did
:) my frist action show
Loved it to tears
Powerpuff Girls FTW.
00,02Nyst, i need to reach about 3KM/s at 140KM above kerbin, this puts me into escape velocity and i enter a high orbit around the sun
Craig McCracken ftw. (Lauren Faust's Husband)
00,02Nyst, when i reach apoapsis, i'm going at ~6KM/s
00,02plus a bit more to do correction burns, make sure i actually hit kerbin
KM/s?
0,5ya
mhhm
00,02Emil, its all relitive
same here
00,02Nyst, yeah, once you learn the navball though its much easier
^
Toonami.
Toonami is back
no stream atm?
Bah, I want season 3 to come out

I just usually turn off my modem/router and wait a minute.
http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
dammit
11,01I would do a modem reset right now.
13it could be fixed by the breakup of at&t not causing cable companies to escape the common carrier distinction and cities giving single cable companies exclusive rights to operate in a given area
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdl23H_Y9Nk&feature=g-vrec
whose line was my fave show as a child.
Hah, I don't even have the opportunity to use AT&T.
Franchise laws should be struck down.

There! Now you have a full ep to watch
Yar har
Fiddle dee
The whole point of breaking up Ma Bell was to stop a monopoly. The fact that it resulted in regional monopolies is apalling.
LOL LIMEWIRE!
I want some bell peppers and beef
11,01Sad fact is: there are some markets where only a monopoly can exist.
hi evs
1,11Well, I'm going to continue reading the webcomic until stream's back up.
Stream, why you didn't tell us about it?
Like our goverment?
back owo
11,01Example could be power companies.
stream not up anymore?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3OiI3yVHYc
Oh okay.
11,01I think ISPs can compete in some areas.
11,01They did back when I lived in PA.
dayum people are docuhes today
jsut relax dudes
oh...wrong smiley
13if it dies again i have to give up
1,11Movie's back.

1,11We get any railing deaths yet?

And back

switch provider?
11,01Verizon did that to me.
13red_ony: there is no other provider, it's comcast or dialup
Just got back... Stream Down??
13and actually since we killed our landline, it's comcast or bust
Yep
Dialup STILL exists?
11,01And that's the problem with regional monopolies.
13welcome to the world of municipal monopolies
13no other cable company is allowed to operate in my city
That's murica for you
Time Warner is the only option for me
Pony some areas are kinda too far for ISPs to set up
/me remeber when i had to choose Satalitte or Dialup
how can that be legal..here I douzens of providers to chose from
and let the america hate commence
13just about is
13of the cable providers in the country, they all agree to not actually compete with each other
13it's collusion, not full on monopoly, which lets them skirt around antitrust
I swear, if I had the files and the knowhow (and the time), _I_ could stream this thing.
its not that way everywhere in america.
13if they were common carriers, we wouldn't have this problem, but they squirmed out of that category when ma bell broke up
We need to stream the mods playing monopoly
This is illegal you know
Sonofabitch internet/
They both shatter friendships just as well :)
13trying to see if we have anyone
My local Comcast chapter tried to fight the establishment of EPB-Fi like crazy. They lost the court battle

Pony: We are fine with the current amount,
I think we already have enough streamers as is

Saturn is still at work i assume?
You know? I never really thought of Comcast being a jerk to me, even when I was using them. Even though I saw all the hate that was being sent their way. Just the whole forging RST packets to slow down my torrents, which they stopped after getting caught.
