fluttercry: Goodnight, sweet prince.
I only watch this movie for Will Smith, Boomer, The "Hello boys, I'm BAAAAAACK!" guy, the exploshions, and Starfox copying.
woot woot \
00,02thats it, sorry cat but i have to stand
Drunk Redneck Guy will be remembered alongside other great heroes... Like Raincloud... :(
13july 5th, fireball finally out of tunnel
00,02you move now
The interim between S2 and S3 is extremely painful.
pony?
05,15Also let us take this moment to rejoice that our friend Boomer......lived
00,03Awww shieee SCOUT!
This movie......>>>>> Godzilla
Pony
13bit of a hyperactive pony
Shizuka no thats the 6th
Dark92CHECKMATE: I though you liked girls... but Mares, well... It's your opinion though...
Pony!
Oh, hi random Pony.
13awww the box missed
Oh, bee tee dubs....if you pre-purchased GW2, the headstart access begins in 3 hours and 15ish minutes. :3
Gravity Falls is pretty fun. Motorcity is really awesome. MLP Season 3 should start soon, and Wander Over Yonder is coming sometime next year, along with Book Two of Korra. And hey, maybe even YOung Justice will get its shit together.
00,03MLG pony, more like id :D
Of the next year, Fangrend :O
I'm waiting for the next season of Dexter and The Walking Dead to come out over here.
compooter?
or maybe TV is the same and videogames suck so much that they seem better in comparison.
00,03it*
My little gamer
Korra
Phase4: ever have your cat repeatedly push its paws against you while starting to fall asleep?
I need something like that, now.
OohShiny: I'm joking here.....by mares i meant GIRLS (Well Duh!?)
I guess so.
00,03Sumica, how many times have I said "I love you"?
Now where's the sequel to this called "The Day After Independence Day"?
OohShiny: That's the joke
Reikim: have you seen Motorcity?
Nah
Ultimate Spider-man is, eeeeehhhhhhh
go watch it.
yay~
Dark92CHECKMATE: Yeah, I understand the joke and wanted to mess with you a bit (Well Duh!?)
someone have watched Alphas ?
Aw, I missed it.
13VenHur: no no that's the day which is two days hence from the previous day
It looked interesting, but
I'm wary
00,10never so far as i know
USM can suck a clock.
I might look at it now
AW I MISSED INDEPENDENCE DAY? BLOODY HELL!
05,15I feel like BMN went a bit longer than usual
OohShiny: Point taken.
00,03Well I love you Sumi <3
Shizuka: ...
USM?
0,14Spectacular SPider-Man was gone too soon
Ultimate SPider Man
Ah
13i'll show day after tomorrow riff sometime
Video games
Amazing Spider Man.
no, tv show
fluttercry: still not as long as when enthiran was streamed
I have fifty dollars...Canadian, for using on Steam.
What do.
13someone really wants to squish scoot with a crate
I think they should make a joint sequel to both the movies "Independence Day" AND "GroundHog Day". It's just like the movie we just saw but it keeps repeating for Will Smith each and every day anew when he wakes up. :P
13AND THEY KEEP MISSING
tSparx: Yeah, you missed the Nameless Redneck.
05,15Walk from DC to New York in the worst snow storm in history? Seems legit
Spectacular. Ultimate.
is it sad i have been hm raiding in wow thru this movie
Disregard Wolvering an the X-Men, acquire Ultimate Spider-Man
Btw has anypony played the 4th wall?
Reikim do what gaben would do and get hats
Brb, bathroom break!
I suggest getting Din's Curse
How long are these credits?
so, what pony episode now?
0,14As much as I have a fondness for the 90's Spider-Man show, Spectacular Spider-Man was soooo much better
I would excise my own heart before buying a hat.
I just took mine VenHur
Amusing. Splendid. Somewhat-above-average Spider-Man never took off.
05,1560's spiderman is best spiderman
RosePetal as long as Patriotic Movies Credits
Luna Eclipsed no?
0,14XD
Ultimave SPider-man got Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cancelled, so marvel could make a new series in canon with USM
Shizuka so....it's 6th of July?
Shizuka, that's a movie that deserves to be riffed.
Fangrend: Not at all
LAWL
00,10yeah cause you can some how expose parts of the planet to the cold vacume of space
13it's a good riff too
13doesn't have mike though :<
05,15no mike!?
13just bill and kevin
13they hold it pretty well though
00,10booo
In short.....Independence DAY >>>> Godzilla
do we have a teamspeak?
0,14woah
00,03Godzilla is a communist >: (
0,14that's a mighty bold claim there
Reikim what type of game you like/play the most ?
Shizuka: is there a rifftrax of Godzilla?
13dunno
Erm
Hard to say
DARN IT! I missed the movie!:[
Godzilla is just a giant turtle...
Bejewelled.
let me guess, this was the B movie
Because Reikim is a mother.
So what is better. A laptop or a desktop. I'm gettinga new computer soon and I CAN'T CHOOSE! I don't know if I should get a laptop or a desktop! D:
My taste in games is about as eclectic as my taste in music.
Yes, yes it was >_>
What movie was this?
Reikim: just buy Pokemon B/W 2 when it comes out.
cachi01 what movie are you talking about?
welp, what's next
/me hisses
A giant turtle with fire coming from his mouth...
Scoot-Scootaloo: Nope.avi The awful movie made him look like the bad guy
AJIsAwesome: Independance day
13Ponies47: if you intend to do anything beyond web browsing, get a desktop
AJIsAwesome: Independance Day with Rifftrax
Ponies47: I choose desktop
Seriously Rei you remind of an old friends mother.
00,02Malk, bronystate doesnt have a teamspeak server but enough people have asked that i might set one up
Ponies47: If you don't plan on going out with it much just get a desktop.
>mfw I've stopped listening to music, just like Bella from Twilight.
Polydunami: (dramatic turn) OF COURSE
Spademagnes[R]: Isn't that the movie with Boomer?
11,01I think there were talks of an Independence Day sequel.
05,15New pokemon suuuuuuucks
pokemond died after Crystal and thats it
the end...
11,01And a Twister sequel.
fuk no
00,02Nittany_Discord, HOW

and now... P-O-N-I-E-S!
5th of July just doesn't have that same ring to it.
Nittany_Discord: HAH!
00,02i meen twister maybe
I am not a mother
gen 5 has the worst metagame ever
also, Tovler, Bella listened to music. Specifically, Linking Park
Shizuka: Yeah like TF2 that needs ALOT of power and ram and such to run
PONIES!!!!!
hello there sumica
Oh man
Scoot-Scootaloo: They already have Thankskilling though.
There are rumors of a top gun sequel and a independence day sequel
oh this
freaking weather teams everywhere
maybe emerald but thr new ones suck
SMOKE
I smell Sisterhooves' Social
My favorite episode!

11,01I don't remember. I might be wrong about ID4 2
Another successful scouting mission

Nittany_Discord: Bill Paxton said if there ever were to be a Twister sequal, he would direct it, i think
Ponies!!
Is it to late to join the lottery?
Yay Sisterhoove's!
Yay sisterhooves social

05,15Does it make me a Genwunner if I liked 1-3?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Phase4, if only I could get my Mumble to connect to servers, I'd love to see more of that.
Nittany_Discord: *grapples*
Is this the episode that has ponies in it?
oh boy, White Whore in How to Be a Bitch
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Was Independence Day A or B movie?
Mishia both of them
Mishia: We've already seen both movies
Mishia we just watched Independence Day :O
00,02Kandarihu, your what?
Mishia: Independnce day.

RAGE
11,01Hi Mishia
yea Mishia you missed Independance Day
FACE
Mishia: I think
Aw :(
:<
Reikim: you just kind of do. Which is a bit weird since she got drunk at a barbeque and slipped me some boob.
>wasting time on breeding
seriously, Gen 5 is fucking great. All ya'll can go eat a bag of poke-dicks.
FRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENDS!!!!!!!!!

0,14ah that
owloysius: But why would you? You would then miss France
Burning juice...
Gen 5's mechanics were great. The character designs were great. The pokemon designs should be buried and forgotten.
Rarity talks that way cause she wants to.
That toast haunts my nightmares... :'(

I love toast!@
Shizuka: yup.
Yummy

Dat Sweetie Belle :3
How the hell do her parents not have the same type of accent as she does?
IT MAKES SENSE!
aw don't worry DerpStar just kidding around your all my friends :3
Reikim: Gen 5 also had the best story of the games so far.

Good night SaxyPretender sleep well :3
But as long as those designs stick around I'm going to continue to be leery of it.

Maybe Rarity practiced using the Canterlot accent I guess.
I can't pretend to know what that lawsuit is about nor can I pretend to care.
Poop!
Its chared
PaladinDrakkenwolf: When did we see Twilight's parents?
burnt turds
Sufficed to say I wouldn't mind getting the money.
0,14off to bed
11,01Shizuka: Maybe in the near future.
Reikim: well hey, B/W 2 will have pokemon from past regions from the get go. You can even catch a wild Eevee
Its not Polydunami?
Night Saxy.
0,14good night, Regs
Shizuka, yeah, people in #geek were raging over that this morning
dat stuff
tSparx: in a flashback and the Wedding Episode
>Get cereal
WOWO RARITY HAS PARENTS?
Maybe in Season 3, we might learn more about Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy.
including me :< :< :<
Cutie Mark Chronicles, tSparx?
Wild Evee was possible in Gen 4 in this little park thing.
>Chop carrots
05,15Need a new pokemon? Why not this ice cream cone.
11,01Night SaxyPretender
Not surprised you're in a channel called geek Phase4.
i dream of a world without alicorn OCs, including cadence
How come we never see their parents........like AGAIN?
I knows right?
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Oh there were in the ssn 3 finale
God I hate you so much Rarity
Also we've been breeding them like mad since Gen 2
ssn 1*
Generous my ass
ssn 2*
>End up making fried eggs.:S
lots of classic pokemon got retconned into beasts, like Cloyster
That OCD
Everyone hates her
tSparx: yeah at the end
Gen 5 is so broken they even got BLAZIKEN banned!
You ARE helping... You're... um... moral support! Yeah... ;)
I don't hate her!
You mess up it blows up
Buytoast: I like Rarity.....
This reminds me of when I used to make pancakes every week. I'd sometimes let them sit a LITTLE too long on the pan.
fluttercry: as opposed to the oh so dignified "pile of mud" pokemon. Or the ever imaginative "pokeball with a face" pokemon.
Cloyster
lolSmogon
Also, Rarity's dad does not remind me of Thomas Magnum at all :P
WAS ALWAYS
I like Rarity!
a beast.
huzzah!
why doesnt she just use her horn?
i <3 rarity
She's my least favorite of the mane6, personally, but I would still bro out with her all day and love her to deth
Well then you two are shameful
05,15RAWRity IT'S BETTER DAMMIT
Rarity is my favorite Pony.
owloysius and i dream with a world without shitty music and no facebook but its never going to happen :(
why not use her magic? :P
I think she is such a darling
The way rarity acts makes me want to slap her some times
You have to feel bad for the two of them, Rarity does not want Sweetie Belle to stay out of trouble but Sweetie Belle just wants to be with her sister.
my internet is failing hard right now
Someone's is speaking bad things of Rarity?
My self hugging shirt!
"The jury returned a verdict after just two days of deliberation." thats suspicious
The lack of Rainbow Dash in this ep disturbs me
Sweetie Belle trying to make herself useful... so fucking cute
Do I have to smack a filly?
The whole point of Rarity is that she's stuck up and flawed, but ultimately generous and kind ;)
Who will hug me now!
It's goddamn suspicious, yes
Rarity is my favourite out of the mane six
that rage repression
But hey, we all knew how it would turn out.
my turn?
The lack of rainbow dash in this episode pleases me
only Starmie and Gengar have consistently remained beasts.
Spademagnes[R]: :D
Why is an ad for asian women pop out of my screen?
You gotta spend money to make money, as Apple well knows.
QUESTION: Why we never see their parents again?
ZNNT!
Scoot
So cute!
scoot scoot
Just enjoy it rosepetal
SO BORED
kawaii!
Holding in anger is not a good thing at all. TRUST ME ;_;
00,02RosePetal, you forgot to install adblock
Wait
Use the dead raccoon!
so CUTE!!!
ALL the Mane 6 have one character flaw or more, despite their heroism.
What do you mean by "beat"
Dark92CHECKMATE: 'Cause they're all young adults, or at least that's what it seems like
don't forget, Gen 5 also got rid of the need of HM whores.
*beast"
Ponies47 but its fun%
Moe...
Sweetie Belle is still dragging her belly
00,02mips is a great streaming service... except for the ads
!
JUST WASH THEM
Pale_Horse: Exactly :)
hhhnnnggg!!!
I HAVE ARRANGED THESE JEWELS IN AN ASTHETICLY PLEASEING MANNER
You used the dead racoon!
Samsung versus 600 billion dollars
OohShiny: i second this opinion
So who do I have to smack?
Me
Just wash the jewels Rarity, it's not that hard.
11,01Ads and occasional derps.
and make them understand the complexity of Rarity
does anypony else think some of the gems look like Rupees>
Like I said, Gen 5 got everything right except the pokemon, with a few exceptions.
Me
Sooo.... Pick the sapphires out of the glue... :|
dat bounce
God Rarity...could your personality be any more bitchy
Nittany_Discord: no ad block?
Big Mac jumping.
I'd kick Sweetie Bell in the face at this point
how does a pony ride a bike?
is so cute
And isn't gravity so damn inconvenient? I want to float around damnit.
FlutterMEDIC: They are ruppies dear
Rupees rupees everywhere
dat squeak
Its just....god I can not stand her some times
Crippler: two sets of pedals
Nittany, I just found an article with your name written all over it
desu!
00,03I don't think that's healthy...
Ruppies are far as the eye can see
Spademagnes[R]: i still think AJ is worse
Just because your mad, doesn't mean you have to yell...
DerpStar: they're Rupees
Really, if you're going to complain about things you can't change can you do so in a way that's amusing to watch?
11,01CriticKitten: Really?
tSparx Oh, and they're always on vacation, therefore put in a bus for the rest of the series? Seems Legit :)
ok so let me get this straight
Yep. I'll PM you with it. XD
pony is good. :>
Thats what I said FlutterMEDIC...
I wouldent mind rarity so much if she didnt act like a total bitch most of the time
XylemTube: Why?
Did I see the gala dresses?
True Sweetie Belle can get into trouble in this episode but Rarity should not overreact over little things that could be easily redone in a flash.
EACH TIME there's a Rarity episode...people complain about her?
OH SHIIIIIIIIIT
How would I do that?
squeaky voice <3
11,01I hope it's not about EA. The last thing I need is something depressing.
dat ocd
Reikim: It also modified all other pokemon for the worse.
voice crack , drink!
Spademagnes theres a comic about rarity..... It really made me think different about her
Do it in rap battle style.

My sweet Luna! Rupees! That's it! :O Equestria sharing the same world as Hyrule makes SO MUCH SENSE!
FFFFFF rarity

05,15Holy crap that is the color scheme
Suddenly Link shows up.
Ungrateful bitch
I'm half asleep and I've been playing Knytt Stories for so long certain sections of my brain are fuzzing out.
I do that when my mom straights up my room

I am not. Rapping.

Unless anyone wants their ears to bleed via text.

So does Scootaloo have no sister or family? Where are they?
Nittany_Discord: (Rarity: HAPPY!? HAPPY!?)........JOY JOY
We started tonight with one of the worst eps in S2, and finish it up with one of teh best!
Applechip: i derped the speeking
Buytoast: Depends on your extent of "hardcore"
Best?
With nuclear missiles that blow chaos UP
Applechip: spelling
Rarity will teach Celestia to Suck Eggs!
uncouth?
I feel like slaping Rarity half the time the way she acts
Sweetie bot rage
AJIsAwesome: becuase to me she is the most one dimensional. Rarity is at least amusing with her occasional bitchyness.
UMCOOF
dat voice crack!
Sweetie Bot rage is better
Poor Sweetie Belle... :S
00,03What is Scootaloo doing while these events occur? Crying in the clubhouse?!
Double the gasp.
RAWRity: Your opinions are like, really bad. No offense.
Which one is best?
And I love sweetie belle's voice cracks
Kurra We don't need nukes we got a Rainbow Dash
Unnr: isn't it supossed to be the opposite? JK
Also no opinion is bad
Season 3 should have more Scootaloo.
The gasps have been doubled!
meh, I was bored with this Full House-esque episode.
AlienWarhead yesss!
DAT VOICE CRACK
There are no bad opinions, only stupid ones.
yes it is, because i say so
Stupid diva...
XylemTube: I can see why. Well, maybe season 3 will give her more character development.
Scoot-Scootaloo: On random vacation out of Ponyville? Who knows...
Scoot-Scootaloo: stop telling us what you are doning currently
Rarity thinks everything is a war crime
I noticed that in Season 2 There was more CMC episodes.
I'd say Sisterhooves Social and Secret to My Excess are more or less tied for best.
And my opinions are automatically best.
I closed the page when ponies came on.
episode 4 of season 3 is supposibly gonna be a CMC episode
Poor Sweetie Belle :S
And then there are opinions you don't agree with.
Season 3 should have more reveals that the Changelings are related to Flutter Ponies. :P
How do you know?
...
CMC should have their spin-off
I think I've got withdrawal.
I Learned a new word! \o/
BRAAAAAAAARP
Screenshot on EQD
Ffffffff
Now now, PaladinDrakkenwolf
Eeeexactly!
like when MLP finished they should focus on CMC
LOL
IN THE FUTURE
Funny, Lauren Faust thought that too.
Season 3 releases in USA: Season 2 releases in mexico
How does the dictionary not know what uncouth is?
Ah'm proud of you fer bein' uncouth, Applebloom
where was Applejack freckles just there?
LOL at AJ saying EEEEEXACTLY

cachi01|phone: he is obviously trolling
I hate that cat
At least Party of One isn't on.
Opal is badass
Rarity does all her chores herself...

Eeerectin' an applecart! *hammer* *hammer*
Also I don't even look at manechat anymore, dunno why, just not interesting.
God you are so ungreatful
05,15or Luna Eclipsed
Fuck you rarity
05,15Or Sonic Rainboom
Scoot-Scootaloo .-. Excuse me for a second..... Im going to shout at a wall for no reason
I can sympathize with Rarity, though she's not handling it very well. I usually have to do things my own way, and accept help very seldom with chores and the like
That's shown up so many times I don't even giggle at the bit where RD gets plot pancaked anymore.
LE has easilly passed Party of One for most played.
05,15or Lesson Zero

we get Luna eclipsed at least once a month.

looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I like Angel bunny

I want to see Putting Your Hoof Down again, because I like it.
And nothing sexual happened.
Spademagnes[R]: Can we just stop with the hate? If you don't like Rarity, that's fine, but a lot of us do, so lay off plz :/
Meanwhile: that metaphor woks so well.
Opal is FAR less of a jerk than Angel is...

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Chrysalis Adopts a Cat!

Raribot
I love the fact that Rarity can be VERY overdramatic.
RosePetal: Still, angel punched fluttershy in the face
Reikim: Thanks for the assault on my mental imaging.
Was there ever an explanation to why the Apple Family dedicated part of their land to raising livestock despite being herbavores
A very merry unbirthday, unsister.
True.

You're welcome.

and with Flarechaser nowhere in sight...
Yes

Kandarihu: I'm guessing because of the fact that if sheep do not have a leader, they will not know what to do. That's what shepards were for.
/me prays S3 ends up like S3 of Moral Orel.
No offense to Bronystate but I'd be worried about catching something.
hey
DerpStar i was speaking spanish :3
I'm disappointed there were no nun jokes in this episode :(

Tovler: oh lord. that would be horrifying.
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh Quebecquois, its like french, only not
Of all ponies what the hell
Rarity's element is generosity
Phase4: maybe we can do a movie night of it some time soon , but with the lotto.. idk
GIVE......IN
and she does not give
I can't hear AJ over how dull she is.
05,15you're worried about catching something from bronystate...but not 4 chan
ironic, doesn't it
Reikim: I like me some crach pairings.
Ew
Unnr, it is french though in a more country folk vocabulary and accent
...
that actually sounds tasty
4chan has razor filled orifices.
Dinky?
Oh hi dinky
fluttercry: well with 4chan, he knew it was a snake when he picked it up
AJ is NOT dull, she's just a gentle talker.
everything has to be about apples
And sparkler
Carrot top!
CrimsonPhoenix: Thats a lot of curses in one sentence :/
It isn't catching something I'm worried about from 4chan, it's losing something.
S3 of MO was good. The rest was garbage.
CrimsonPhoenix: Its actually closer to 16th Century French, with a bit of standard vowel drift.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: That's what season 3 is for/
ohai everypony
what are pigs for?
00,02cratorkid|Toga, nuuuu, first we need some australian films

Dinky!
AppleBloom is scary
Hey

Unnr, are you from France?
One day? we have to stop time!
AJ could read the farm tractor axle overhaul manual to me and I'd be sooooo at ease.

CrimsonPhoenix: Worse, a fan of linguistics

Derpy has a sister?
Should Berry really be doing this?
DINKY!
Good, because I...
If I were to do that to Regulars I'd probably gain IQ.

WHEN DID DERPY GET A SISTER?
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Ok.:)

the side rooms on BMN. What do they count as?
applejack can hold her breath a lot
And personally I think it'd be a nostril.
Applejack can hold her breath in for very long that's why.
note: all the CMC are voiceacted by little girls. awesome sauce :)
I love how every mysterly leaves clues that the viewers can pick up on. In MMMM it was Rarity's eyelash on the painting, and here it was Rarity's eyecolor.
PLOT TWIST

AJ can hold her breath for up to 15 minutes... :) (DIsclaimer: The previous statement may contain Untruth)
Oh god stop with the squeeks, I'm dying here
Kawaii_icybeauti: how else could you make perfect voice cracks?
I guess we'd have to assign two rooms a boob each and the rest are facial.
Mishia, that's awesome. Method acting?
13i..
Sonic Says:..........
Reikim: one would be the third hole. 2 would be hands. 2 would bee ears. 1's the nose.

Oh god that hair
Mishia: I'll go look it off
and then Spike tapes
up*
That fucking hair
Mishia: in the latin dub the only cmc voiced by a little girls is applebloom
AJ is green and Rarity is blue, so perceptive viewers could have known the answer in advance.
Nothing to add Shizu?

It's not dead.
It's done.
Different.
..........no one can destroy the metal :3
dead/done
it's reached the end
So is Michael Jackson done or dead?
same difference
Dead implies done before finish.
/me is bored so will now begin posting random pictures :P
no
The metal will strike you down with a vicious blow :3
Yes
dead is done
No
that's all
Dead is cut short without finish
Because you know you could dig him up right now and prop him up on a stick and no one would notice.
VG Cats is dead.

Luna songs are always good

11,01Phase4: No video links during stream?
00,02that should be escape velocity
11,01:p
00,02Nittany_Discord, :<
00,10how are they overheating in space?
00,02dat orbit
00,02Sumica, no clue
00,02this may take a while
what the hell game is this, I wanna play it!!
Yeah ya think :D
Starting up TF2 now, Shizu.
11,01The casing can overheat or something.
Kurra Kerbals
00,10it's kerbal space program
I'll play for 'bout an hour.
/me contemplates freezing himself until October
00,10more boost
13inb4 we're the only ones playing
00,02this may take quite a while
00,10I have not tryed for a soler escape with the new warp speed yet
Maybe the heat... is... uh, gravitating... to the rocket? Bah, probably not
"wake me up when September ends" if you will
Phase4: Is it possible to get to the sun on this game
00,02sooo slow
00,10then again I dont think I have built a rocket sence .16 either
go into lightspeed!
00,02cow334, yes and no, you'll get to see what happens
00,02Sumica, warp speed?
Phase4: Your going to pull it off
00,02i've gone to the sun with this rocket before
00,10yeah they added 2 zeros to the warp modifier
well it looks like that horribly movie stuff is over
It's all internal heat. The rockets would be insulated very well against the vacuum, but that makes it harder to release the heat in the rocket
Zomm in
00,02Sumica, XD
All right, I'm in TF2
hey how's the astronaut doing?
00,02i should try that for the luilz
Imagine, one day, we'll be ablt to go to the sun.
I'll hop on whatever server you hop to.
00,02lulz'
00,02Kiryu, he's fine
"Tonight Kerbal Bob, we send you on the ultimate mission.
00,10remember the one I had that would take 160 years to exit the system
Its gonna crash into the moon
00,02Sumica, yeah?
A MISSION TO TAKE THE SUM!"
poor luna won't like that

00,10well we did't want to wait for it cause even at max time warp that was forever

Reikim sure i'm tired of building a spawner trap anyway
00,10they plan on adding more systems

how bout some warp speed?
11,01Can't do that with SRBs.
Ich sehe
00,10once you light an SRB it burns till empty
00,02tSparx, nope
11,01Can't even turn them off.
00,02but with ninja skills
00,02you can do what i just did
00,02we are on a solar impact
00,10angle it
What, elongate your crazy-ass orbit?
what u trying to hit phase?

Phase4: Think you have enough tanks?

micheal bay will be proud
00,02Spademagnes[R], might need a few more
Moar powah!

LOL NICE.
saved by the chute
that'd be fun to watch xD
Welp that was a thing
test 2= fail
i was just waiting for one of those gas tanks to come flying back into shot and hit the lander randomly

LOL
wel shiiitttt.
i will say this Phase4...
Well what ever lived there is dead
Jebediah nows when to panic
you seem to have the "oh shi-" function of that rocket down
Whelp, I'm closin' this
aight I'm off to bed I got work early tomorrow
lol
Night everyone who isn't in TFW
*2
i.e. "ABORT ABORT ABORT *parachute*"
MirrorImage: I've always wondered, and does anybody know: how fast does an object have to be going to achieve escape velocity in-atmosphere?
night Paladin!
what did he do wrong thats the question
I mean, an in-atmo orbit, essentially
tSparx - in KSP or in real life?
ICBM READY FOR LAUNCH
Night PaladinDrakkenwolf
LIFT OFF
Here we go again.
and the only problem with an in-atmosphere orbit is that you'd still be hitting air resistence
MirrorImage: I meant real life, but KSP would be fun fact too
which means you'd have to have it perpetually thrusted
LAWl
OH GOD XD
PERFECT NVM
Epic fail XD
/me salutes
*boom*
That rocket third must go, another planet needs him
MirrorImage: Exactly, which I do get essentially means that a jet is in in-atmo orbit, but what's the minimum speed an object can go out without bernouli's (sp) principle?
OH BOY
HERE WE GO
You may need to rebuild most it....
And stay in-atmo orbit, I wonder.
00,02tSparx, escape velocity is abotu 3.5KM/s at 150KM altitude
/me now has a kitty on his lap ^_^
MMMM
Its wobbleing
L!FT 0FF
00,02o i c
LES GO
00,02tower clips one of the rockets
to early
HAHA
I dont like the fact its moving
now LIFT OFF
WELP
WHEEE
XD
win?
Spademagnes[R]: If it didn't wobble, wind could snap it in half; can't be brittle
failed already
Right away this time XDD
Spademagnes[R]: I imagine it's not wobbling on its base, but that the components are wiggling
tSparx - and if it wobbles too much...
that should do it
TIMBERRRRR
And again...
<_<
That rocket third must go, another planet needs him
Alright place your bets, place your bets, were taking all, for or against the rockets succes!!!
LIFT OFF
LES GO
:[
ITS SHAKING
Ooh, better, better!
:O
whooooooooooooooo Phase4 stream!!!
IT SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT
wait for it...
WTF
wait for it...
FWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
At least it's going straighter

That is an INSANE ROCKET
damnnnnnnn

SUCESS
oooo!
Look at that wiggle
whoo, that damn near took out the thrusters
00,02its funny because it works
Haha, dat wobble
*wiggle

W00T!
Wow, that's not stable. And the passenger knows it
Where's it going? lol
PINGAS ROCKET IS GO
SUCESSSSSSSSSSSSS
TheKatPony - somewhere.
It's going to space, the final frontier
pingas XD i remember that
SnooPINGAS usual I see
nice rocket Phase4
TO THE MOON HE GOES
Should that rocket be flexing so much?
damn son
Why does Phase4 have such epic music for his KSP streams? :D
it
it's turning
TOMARROW I'LL...
Yeah, the music always seems to fit...
ITS A ICB<
Heh, part of me wants him to maintain his current trajectory
*ICBM
HAVE A NICE TRIP
TheKatPony: I love it :3
Ram into the planet at maximum velocity
bring a sovenier
as an addendum to my last /me... i have a *silly* kitty on my lap <_<
Assuming it can accelerate fast enough
Me too ^^
As wobbly as that rocket was in the atmosphere, it made it's way out. I guess that means it's more of a self-regulating structure.
who keeps pawing at my jeans
i have to hit the hay. have a nice stream u guys

CS: GO IS AWESOME

oni_link Yay! I have them all ranked, honestly, but that's just because my brain insists on being organized. But even my least favorite of the mane6, Rarity, I love and adore and would bro out with for weeks and I get upset when bad thigns happen to her <3

One of the weirest things about the Internet tis that, often, it's hard to tell how old someone is. So, like, on the Internet, I can totally be friends with people like a third my age, haha, as long as they're relatively intelligent
And not even know it
Phase4: It couldnt even be stable
Unless I think to ask
ooooooo might be failiure
oooo

I have no choice but to re install Firefox then :/
i heard u hate dem ads me too
Canadian_Brony: Nice!
Canadian_Brony: The ship
00,02the reason i keep the rockets on on a low setting is because its too heavy to turn with gyro's
oni_link - pleaes tell me you aren't using internet explorer...
00,02so i rely on thrust vectoring
cow334 no, where will he land?
Asian girl hasn't been bothering me :D
Canadian_Brony: That's awsome... I want D'aww!

I use firefox and I might download google chrome as well
Google Chrome didn't work for me when it came to the stream here :|
tSparx IIRC Scoots had it up during one of his reading.
I use Internet Explorer
why does this song remind me of the Code Lyoko theme...
well worked for me
Well, I can't avoid this. I need Firefox because I need ABP and Chatzilla. IE isn't that bad anymore

it will
Fantastic.
Phase4: Cant you like fast forward or something Kinda like what they do on the sims?
00,02i like how i'm at the moon and havent had to detatch any fuel tanks yet
cow334 instinctively, I will look for Filly RD for d'awww.
00,02i think theres a fuel bug
/me hums dance of the sugarplum faerie
Good night
00,02cow334, not while rotating
I found some for you guys: http://derpy.me/AnKzY
Not gonna lie, I did want it to explode.
Canadian_Brony: Okay
Spademagnes[R]: Night!
night
Night spades!
*target acquired*
cow334: I used to use Nightly/Firefox but the memory leaks and a recent build forced me to un-install. I currently use IE and made it so that it boots in incog mode. But I can't avoid the fact that I NEED ABP

Phase4: aah man well pations is a virchu
cachi01|phone: :|
That's kind of a lot of Derpy.
I know I ask this earlier but the movie we're still going on so I didn't get that many answers but. I'm getting a new computer soon and I can't decide and a laptop or desktop. Which wuld be better?
only 2000 derpys
Ponies47: Desktop.
Ponies47 - for gaming, definitely a desktop
oni_link: ooh oh well it is still all god do right
TOOO THE MOOOOOON
d'aww look at the puppy http://sp7.fotolog.com/photo/7/15/69/ohayou__anime/1224776536550_f.jpg
only get a laptop if you need the portability
*would
lets try 4000 derpys :P
depiesplosion
Dovah: :D
derpiesplosion*
Ponies47 : I'd say a desktop.
13sixth for mvm?
Dovah: HNNNG O GOD MY HEART
Ponies47 - what would be the primary use of the laptop?
Ponies47 get a desktop or an alienware
00,02have 6 tanks of fuel left
Ponies47: Im gonna get a really cheap desktop, you just need to assemble and buy a graphics card but for what you get and the price, ITS SOO WORTH IT
now for a real d'aww
Shizuka - i would, but i'm housesitting for my mother, which means i'm on my old crappy laptop
Ponies47 depends on the purpose, budget, and wether or not you like to play around with it.
MirrorImage: If I'm gonna be play TF2. Then yeah maybe I should
Ponies47: Desktop would be better but I use laptop woot woot it's awesome
ohai Shizuka
I JUST WANT A PC THAT CAN RUN AMNESIA AND TF2
Ponies47 - yeah, definitely a desktop
But still I'm going to be getting desktop soon
PC Y U SO EXPENSIVE
the benefit of a desktop is that when it's time to upgrade, you don't have to replace EVERYTHING
Ok it seems alo0t say desktop...
YES LANDING
It's all about preference, but I really prefer desktops because they're much easier to get behind the hood of
or not
OMG WERE LANDING
I do have to admit Pc are expensive
*alot
My pc is sucky as hell
13they're expensive, but can do waaaaay more than consoles
00,02i accidentally went into orbit
OH NICE XD
Shizuka - indeed, and it's only the initial investment that's expensive
Which, if you know/don't wanna know much about the guts of a computer, then that wouldn't be an advantage.
Shizuka: yup
Phase4: Can you land from orbit?
the next time i "need" a computer, it will either be replacing the graphics card only, or just buying a second one and SLI-ing it
I will most likely be getting a PC
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LO4qcGPBLbs/Twyx68HezFI/AAAAAAAAak0/_o7mHmjgaiU/s1600/110087+-+artist+zlack3r+artist+zlacker+book+crying+filly+sad+twilight_sparkle.png
00,02tSparx, yeah
No. I WILL be getting a PC
00,02you have to
MirrorImage: nice SLI WHOOOO
00,02thing is i was trying to land and accidentally went into orbit
which means my next computer will cost me, at most $500, rather than the $2500 i put into building my current
Ponies47 a desktop is best for gaming, but you can always buy a wireless mouse and keyboard for a laptop. Also, if you ever move from one room to another, laptop. College and university, laptop. If you might want to upgrade in the future, desktop.
00,02when i was on an impact course
Dovah: That one wins
oni_link - bought a GTX670, so it's not like i *need* to SLI it
unless i want to be playing Crisis at about... oh 50,000 x 50,000
tSparx: Yay! :) Give me my prize. Now. :|
I use laptop but it is real high in graphics and can play team fortress two really well
MirrorImage: you made me drool rainbows
s I am all good for now woot woot
4000 derpys could only end well
Dovah: D'awwwwwwww! HE DID IT Dovah wins
Are you gonna hit the moon?
YourLittleDashie: Still don't have a prize...
I want you to hit the moon.
TheKatPony: IN THE FACE
00,02yeah, i think theres a fuel bug
love the music
Just the way I like it.
TheKatPony: I'm pretty sure he actuallyw ants to land on it, but w/e happens does
Phase4 - you sure about that, or do you just have THAT MUCH FUEL?
FPSchicken: Pretty sure it's all been makkon. He's a boss
tSparx : mmm kay
soooooo... when you gonna play slender? :p
00,02no, i'm fairly sure theres a fuel bug
00,02getting way too much efficency out of this rocket
00,02Kiryu, probably never
Kiryu: We're gonna wait until you /leave or /quit
00,02dari plays slender iirc
;P
but i'll never leave :'(
00,02turn faster rocket!
huh
Then Slender will never be played ^^
Kiryu: Now I'm gonna imagine that you're an AI, and that's why you'll never DC
And that's awesome
Why not?
night everypony
Slender is cool
woot woot Phase4 Deadspace pretty much
>_>
Ponies47 another thing to consider is price. It's almost always cheaper to order in parts for a PC and build it yourself, but that requires, well, building it yourself. I'm not saying you have to build it yourself either, but me being a total-hands-on kinda guy, I would build it.
Night Tex!~
g'night texasboykc09
<_<
night teaxsboykc09!
00,02cow334, ?
Night texasboykc09
Canadian_Brony Ponies47 - just don't forget the CPU fan <_<
wait what
Canadian_Brony actually its more expensiv lol
MirrorImage most come standard with the CPU IIRC
MirrorImage: Sounds like you learned that the hard way xP
cachi01|phone - depends on what you're building
Phase4: Well cause you are ....in space and your ship looks like it is out of life? never mind
tSparx - yes, i did
I'm getting this kit and a 5870 @ 2GB http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3859884&Sku=B69-0592&cm_re=Homepage-_-Spot 01c-_-CatId_31_B69-0592
Canadian_Brony - not the Intel i-series processors
AWW SHIT, IS HE GOING FOR THE MOON.
my i7 didn't come with a CPU fan anyways
13two more for mvm?
i7 huh? bigshot :P my dinky laptop has an i3
http://twentypercentcooler.net/data/90/bb/90bb9007cb6abeac8efdd66dd8c9f2e6.jpg?1335486605
Shizuka: Can I join
00,02yes i am trying to land this entire thing
cachi01|phone not always. I have a good graphics card, case, moniter, and power supply. I'm just looking for a 64-bit Vista, RAM, CPU, and hard drive.
OH MY GAWD
Phase4: Haha, you go man :)
tSparx - i basically did a copy/paste build of a test rig i saw floating around for the GTX680
Phase4: Its gonna explode
downgrading parts appropriately, of course
...
I have a Vista, and it sucks.
their test rig was about a $4500 build
00,02i have a backup plan for when it explodes
i managed to shave it down to $2500
TheKatPony: Better then what I have I use windows xp
TheKatPony: can you run 7?
Canadian_Brony i had vista and it sucked
woot woot but i still love it
TheKatPony: Linux is always free :)
7 ultimate is better
00,02linux is awesome
cow334: No way, XP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Vista
Does Linux have Steam? Noob question I know
I know, i need 7
Phase4 Yes it is!
oni_link - inherently, not yet
/me says while running W7
00,02tSparx, /)
but Linux does have Windows emulators, so you can get it in a round-about way
Phase4: (\
00,02tSparx, i'm stuck on windows as well righ tnow
cachi01|phone it had a major update which made it alot better. Also, I actually prefer it now to XP.
tSparx: Windows xo is windows vista
00,02MirrorImage, wine == wine is not an emulator
alright, let me rephrase that
bye and thanks Phase4 !!!!
00,02later oni_link
seeya oni_link
linux has a windows "emulator" (quote-unquote)
oni_link: Steam is planning on supporting it
00,02MirrorImage, its an implimentation of the windows api ontop of linux
13Wine Isn't An Emulator
bye oni_link!
00,02much like how windows is implimented ontop of nt
Bye oni!
/me doesn't use emulators
Bye, oni- nevermind.
Ao oni_link
Canadian_Brony: Same here.
Quick! someone say something stupid!
that'd be like calling any console emulator "not an emulator" because they're simply built on top of Windows or whatnot
Dovah something stupid
13sixth for mvm?
Damn, we're going to the moon.
emulator is a very broad term in that sense
Canadian_Brony: ..... http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/187/591/72502%20-%20Hubble%20caption%20macro%20poor_man%2527s_Wayne_Brady%20twilight_sparkle.png?1318893151
What is it with UNIX-related projects and recursive abbreviations? (what're those called? Like GNU == GNU's not Unix)
00,02i've never landed something this big
00,02tSparx, its fun :P
Oh my gawd
wine is like gnu, horray recursive acronyms!
13because it's funny
Phase4 - at least you've got alot of scrap metal beneath you to cushon the landing of the lander module
is he landing
Phase4 : don't crash.
Phase4: You can do it
00,02MirrorImage, ^
woot woot
00,02this would be easier if i knew where the ground was
/me cheers
00,02the number at the top is lies
woot woot
Phase4 - just remember, when tracking you're altitude, the lunar module is about 120m above the ground
Canadian_Brony: http://www.wallpaperhi.com/thumbnails/detail/20120201/horror%20guns%20hellsing%20alucard%20moon%20evil%20nightmare%20wolf%20vampires%20armor%20hellsing%20ultimate%20swords%20387_www.wallpaperhi.com_56.jpg
Phase4: About 18,000 meters below you
i believe the actual number is 118m
00,02tSparx, its less than that
Let's land this motherfucker.
00,02which is what i meen by 'its lies'
what in the hell is that abomination landing on the moon?
Why not? ^^
How much less? Is it just the 18m tall that your ship is, or is it off by more than that?
hi Buytoast. Phase4 built it, so . ..
Buytoast: Project save luna
00,02tSparx, its anywhere betwene 0 and 15KM altitude
00,02some of the peaks are 18 iirc
Oh I see
I thought it was project troll luna
00,02Buytoast, whats worse is its working
lol
Ship! Fall faster!
cachi01|phone: I guess that to then
00,02oops
I'm wanna see you land!!
00,02accidentally went real slow
Canadian_Brony: If it falls faster it'll kinda 'splode
LANNDDDDD
too much faster*
Phase4 - ping me real quick please
holy fuck it looks like wilf from foster's home fucked a man at legs
wilt
00,02MirrorImage, k
Again, fitting music.....
From what I'm looking at it looks lik it already landed
Buytoast . . . uhh . . .
...just me probaly
I like the original better, to be honest.
cow334: Don't let those scales trick you
A Waltz for Trixie is one of those beautiful melancholic songs
tSparx: lol okay
YEAH!
AJIsAwesome: what compressed folder?
someone ping me again real quick
Why the hell hasn't it landed yet?
MirrorImage pong
How big a RAM hog is Desktop Ponies?
MirrorImage: LOTSA SPAGHETTI!
How far up are we!?!?!
tSparx: +100 MB
GAWD.
AJIsAwesome: Oh that's reasonable
AJIsAwesome: oh that one, did you extract it?
13do we have a sixth for mvm?
I wish . . .
AJIsAwesome: do you have winrar?
TheKatPony: The meter at the top isn't accurate, but it's close enough to give you an idea
i'll go for mvm
Oh, ffs.
He gonna make it woot woot
My god Dark Souls is beautiful ;~;
aint doin nothin else
LAAANNND!!!
...
NNAAAAAOOO!!!
AJIsAwesome: You should be able to right-click the folder and click "Decompress"
cow334 - that assumes that he can actually get it slowed down enough for the whole thing to not accordian on itself
LAND ALREADY.
Jmo: you dare speak of it when I do not have it?! you must die now!
:P
Messing up my eyes, oh my God.
I want amneasia NAAAAO
AJIsAwesome: you should be able to right click it and extract it
Phase4 - you're still good for at least another 2000m
Guys, landing a multi-ton spaceship on a moon from thousands of feet up requires a lot of decelaration and patience. No drag force to slow the ship down, after all, and he wants to be able to take off afterward
AJIsAwesome: If you have iZarc should be able to do that already , too
tSparx - what are you talking about?
This is where the Mars Direct approach works
Why take off? We can live on the moon with Luna.
that's obviously a colony module
All you need to do is send people to the moon
00,02stupid thing is too heavy
MirrorImage: Compressed folders
MirrorImage: Or landing a spaceship
then keep sending supplies until you figure out how to get them back home
00,02stop going up please
lol
Celestia moon banishment program
ooh, dat tilt
Brb.
She sent us all to the moon :(
Who´s remix of For the New Lunar Republic is this? It sounds remixed from Makkon´s
cachi01|phone been there, done that.
"<Phase4> stupid thing is too heavy"
gravity seems to disagree
I believe it is Makkon's remix of Makkon
00,02its powerfull as well
Meta as hell
is it going down now?
IT'S GOING DOWN!!
YYYEEESSSS!
OH MY GOD.
YES.
inb4 luna blasts ship with meteors
LETS DO THIS.
TheKatPony yes?
he did it....
2,500m
WOOOT WOOOT
00,02going sideways a bti fast
00,02hopefully not problem
Canadian_Brony YES.
Canadian_Brony: OH, MY.
Canadian_Brony: Just kidding.:D
Phase4 has secretly always wanted to go down on Luna
Lets not crash now, okay>
/raunchyjokes
tSparx uuuuhhhhh . . . my teenage brain read that wrong.
^
^*
Canadian_Brony: No, your teenage brain read that right. I wanted to make a punny joke :P
Canadian_Brony - given it's 2:30am, that's probably what he meant
Fanfiction is going to keep me up alllll night
WERE GETTING CLOSER.
This mobile IRC is stupid...
tSparx I'm not going to quote it. That wasn't "punny".
dat buffering
Canadian_Brony: I was poking fun at your previous comment.
MirrorImage it's not even midnight here.
buffering....
Canadian_Brony: No, that's true, but it was wordplay
If someone writes hi and then i write hi it wobt send the message
God damn it.
TheKatPony what?
Hai everypony!
cachi01|phone - that's one of the channel settings

Hiya Biglaw!

Phase4 - can't you just jetback back to Kerbos?
Phase4: Can you get home still
MirrorImage uhhh . . .
On the plus side Luna won't go hungry
00,02MirrorImage, not enough fuel
00,02cow334, nope
MirrorImage: I don't think the jetpack can reach escape velocity, even from the moon
00,02tSparx, they can from minmus i think
So.... he's fucked...
00,02but yeah, not the moon

this music doesn't sound promising towards the /concept/ of Phase4 achieving liftoff.
Wow, thats a plane?
note the word /concept/
cs:go is fucking addictive o_O
Yeah, probably the only unfitting song this whole time.
Eulshy I think it is.
00,02not sure hwo far behind stream is
Dat jet
Phase4 you have achieved lift off with your . .. thing.
How to improve our rocket? Stick wongs on it
Mica shoo be doos the sea ponies. :3
Oh god.
TheKatPony yes/
Eulshy why would you stick chinese people on a rocket, that seems cruel and fatal
?
trollghost, aliens need take out too
2 questions regarding minecraft: 1 can someone join my world/server thing and tell me how my first house on survival is and give me some tips 2 how do I make a private server thing :P
but the chinese people would die
I feel like this thing is gonna crash.
Maybe cause everything else did....
Another planet needed those wings
TheKatPony lemme find the perfect pic for that . . .
/me Has still not played Minecraft yet
wether from the external heat or the friction or the g-force or them ripping off the rocket
Canadian_Brony LOL please.
or if they unlikely survived through that, theres freezing, pressure exploding, suffocation, being hit by space debris
Ponies47: :S
so Eulshy i dont see how the benefits outweigh the cons here
Maybe the first brony i've seen that doesn't play Minecraft XD
this is perfect music for the stream
trollghost, it's also a descreet way of lowering earths population so we don't over populate
The music is always perfect....
Dovah: What?
Eulshy chinese people are already only allowed to have 1 kid, give em' a break
-_-
00,02landing time
trollshost, they can have 2
Eulshy thats also an incredibly expensive and inhumane solution
00,02gona switch ti tf2 after this
trollghost, well eventually we will have to kill some people to save the rest
TheKatPony dammit, I found a funny comic about a series of rockets crashing, but I can't find it. :(
Eulshy its 1, if it was 2 they would never reduce the population
Canadian_Brony: Awww :(
Dat TF2

Is it an ant? :o
00,02and you cant stop it
00,02have to restart
Well, shit.
00,02while this is techincally a source engine bug, i blame windows
but I complain about it anyway. D-Link would disconnect while I'm in a TF2 match.
00,02that behviour should not be possible
I blame bush
Phase4: blame apple
^ dat too
tSparx IKR? One lady didn't know we had paved roads.
I didn't do anything to y'all other than respect your cultures!~
I live fairly close to Canada :P
oooh TF2
trollghost, Phase4 is running Wine on Linux
you has 6 people?
I live so close to Canada, I'm practically in it!
tSparx: the iraq war proves that point
00,02Kandarihu, i'm in windows right now
WELL, REALLY NOW.
the actual fulk
Phase4, ah, okay.
trolololo
Ah, yes. tf2
00,02would stream from linux but theres a problem when using compiz
Phase4: do you actually play tf2 on linux wine...
wait, people use Linux?
trollghost: No arguments from me here. I was fairly young when boots hit the ground in Iraq, and even then I was very against it.
Im going to bed..... Night everypony :)
Canadian_Brony: LINUX <3
g'night cachi01|phone
cachi01|phone: night!
00,02trollghost, i tend not too, theres a problem with wine on my install
night cachi01|phone
Greetings nameless pony #1715
00,02when you combine that with the fact that this laptop has optimus then its just easier to use windows
Phase4 There's a problem with wine on every install
00,02i have games that dont run on wine anyway
haha
00,02like kerbal
Phase4: WHY USE WINE TO PLAY GAMES?!?!? why>!?!
I love the pony music in the background LOL
00,02because i dislike windows
00,02i have a plan to replace my native install with a vm
00,02cant quite do it yet
00,02waiting on some things
trollghost: Okay, well a) I didn't do that, b) pretty much every European country helped usout in destroying the native population of the Western Hemisphere.

00,02if anyone is wondering why i'm talking to Honeybadger its because "* Received a CTCP VERSION from Honeybadger"
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT

Phase4: we cannt see the chat. resolution is to low.
00,02um
00,02trollghost, you meen game chat or this window
I can make out the stuff in this window, but only because I know what it's supposed to say anyway
trollghost -_(\ see how well you do as a Battle Engie and forcing yourself into the front lines with a Widowmaker to collect metal and sometimes having to resort to your Short Circuit and Gunslinger.
Phase4 i dont know what i mean, i just dont know
oh damn I didn't know we were getting streamed
>.>
guys I'm out for now
but probably the irc in stream window
So. I listened to a reading of a fanfic called "Cheerilee's Garden" the other night and. If you ever find it take my advice........ DON'T READ IT! O_O
Bye otakon
by take care need to get some sleep
trollghost "easy" is not a word you can use to describe any class in TF2
seeya otakon
Phase4 you only have 4 people, i find that funny
Canadian_Brony: yea thats excactly what i mean
bye otakon!
/me waves bye to all
/me 00,02hugs trollghost
00,02yeah, we need more people
00,02applebloom.ariscop.net
and Canadian_Brony i said easiest
00,02password is ponies
/me hugs Phase4 back... shhh no tears, only dreams now
trollghost in that case, it depends on your opinion. For example, I find it utterly impossible for me to be a Spy.
Off for now! Don't know if I'll be back later. Nighty night jic!
g'night tSparx
goodnight tSparx :)
Canadian_Brony: one of my favorite classes is spy.
Night tSparx
tSparx: Night!
all this TF2 is making me miss it more than ever now.
Computer!
Y U piece of junk?!?
ponies?
I smell a troll...
I smell muffins
im coming Phase4 ;-;... if only it would... load... ;-;
/me Hugs Canadian_Brony
burning muffins . . .
OH CRAP!!
LOL I love trolling in games like this :D
00,02trollghost, too late :(
Wait troll? Where?
00,026 people already
;________________________________;
Didn't you hear the guy raging?
i dont hear anything
THERE.
LOL
Phase4: If I was playing with you the amounts of lag would be much to high. I shouldbe getting a new computer soon and then I can join you in TF2 (I hope) :3
I bunt half a dozen muffins :'(
Awww...
I still have another estimated 18 I can make, though
I think Phase is trolling XD
O RLY
YES RLY
/me throws a burnt muffin at the chat
wtf i have to buy a friggin' tour of duty voucher to play MvM
what the hell!
trollghost that's only for Mann Up Mode
Boot Camp is free
*eats burnt muffin*
Mann Up Mode gives you items if you win, and a Strange Botkiller weapon if you complete a full Tour of Duty, but it's also much more difficult than Boot Camp
!rules
screw it i brought it
and jesus, 295 people in queue for boot camp? no way/
hi pony_213263. The rules can be found here http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
trollghost trust me, the wait will be under 2 minutes.
Hey pony_21...Gone
hopefully to read the rules I linked him
the butt hurt nation attacked. :L
Botkiller Flamethrower? Niiiice
Testing.
Hey AJIsAwesome
AJIsAwesome the chat is just quiet
Ponies47: Hello!
Canadian_Brony: Okay.
^
my god.
I need me a drink in the worst way - cant clear my head enough to sleep
either because everypony went to bed, nopony not talking makes others not talk, or we're all too captivated by the stream
106 people in here, and only like 9 are chatting lol
eeyup
welcome to Bronystate
the stream is hypnotising
Canadian_Brony: It's a mixture of the last two for me.
!lottery
Honeybadger we don't have that
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Yeah, but Tom replied to that command.
who the hay triggered Tom?
oh my god.
What?
What triggered Tom?:S
I don't know LOL
Had a family member pass away yesterday - just collapsed and never regained consciousness - more concerned for my cousins who just lost thier dad
LOL!
Cypresswolf I feel for you.
your laughing at him?
Honeybadger I hope that was because of the stream.
Nah.
Cruel...
So?
thats messed up dude
Cypresswolf: You have my deepest condolences, myfriend. May that family member rest in peace.
Short Circuit can destroy projectiles, including Sticky Bombs, Rockets, and Grenades
It's the internet, he could've made that stuff up.
Badger has a point.
I could say I'm a billionaire.
I could say I'm Canadian.
the gravity of it still hasnt sunk in for me...next week or so is going to be rough
which I am
Well, fuck me.
I used to take IRC seriously until the butt hurt nation attacked.
no thank you
*insert clever joke and/or pun*
That's the spirit.
Well Honeybadger, you're right about that. But this is one of place where people are being honest. I can't guaratee that for everyone, but most of us here are honest in our words.
*of the few places*
mmmm
hello evry pony
scottish-geeky: Hello!

Canadian_Brony: wate thers more than beer hokey and bieng rilly nice
For example, only Newfoundlanders have sex.
and our government doesn't work
Canadian_Brony: lol
Ponies47: what have been up to

luna_pony: I just don't :/
Kammerjunk: I often say g'night to Celestia, because sleeping during the day is one of my many things :)
Yeah, upside down.
tSparx: But wouldn't you say good day to her, then?
Kammerjunk: 'Cause I'm going to bed, and that's just what people say when they're going to bed. *shrug*
Silly people.
Aye
Really?
Rasputin?
back my computer randumly turend of
Russian dance, I like it.
xD
lawl because when Apple Bloom stops the party in the first CMC episode, she literally causes a record scratch
But question: how in the world could Rarity's sister and Applejack's sister have never met before then? (Answer: because it's a kid's cartoon show, shut up tSparx)
Kosaken hey hey hey hebt die Gläser! Natascha ha ha ha du bist schön!
Ugh
Why I here
You are here because you have no choice.
There is no escape from the BronyState.
This is my first time.
I was curious and thought it was movie night.
xD
Must have missed it.
But but
Oh no, not until 9 hours and 20 minutes.
In drunk
And that's eurostream.
It was, and there's a rebroadcast for our European friends in 9 hours
But thats for the Euuuuuuro one.
I don't won't to be here ATM
JRPhone: I'm drunk. Ye don't have an excuse!
Our non-nocturnal European friends
But
So what was the mystery movie? :O
weell i just beat a game of MvM
Hey, I'd have been there for the normal BMN, but then I had a party.
wasnt too hard but still
yea
Klumzeedragon: Yeah but they show the same movies
Klumzeedragon: And all speak English :P

00,02robots aint got nothing on mann's
Well, I wont be in 9 hours is what I was getting at.
xD
00,10lets try a all heavy
engie says "pony up"

Well yeah, he's Texan.
Phase4:
Hey Sumica, what was the mystery movie of movie night?
00,10Mystery science theader
JRPhone: I've shown up here high as hell a few times, and either no one's noticed, or no one cared enough to mention anything.
Sumica: :D and we europeans get a rerun?
Phase4: can i make a music request
MadSurge: In 9 hours! Idk what the first movie and ep was
00,02scottish-geeky-drawl, sure
MadSurge: But the second was Independence Day and Sisterhoove's Social
tSparx: Earlier we just did a on the spot lottery, forgot what the movie names were though
tSparx: thanks for telling me! :)
tSparx: Not sure if mods are going to do a second lottery or just going to use the same movies as earlier
though.
Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqlpHa0pk8E&list=UUEIPN2HA3vol0H5Gm4romHA&index=8&feature=plcp
awesome thanks Phase4
scottish-geeky-drawl: No non-image links during a stream please.
AdamTheDuck: it was to pahes for the music
I just making sure that someone tells me if I'm playing ok
AdamTheDuck: He asked Phase4 first
Up*
Ah ok, then :)
ok then*
scottish-geeky-drawl: That's a good remix - thanks for sharing :)
Dude... Dude... He just ran out.
Cypresswolf: thanks
00,02you guys getting buffering?
Phase4: to warn you some of the songs comeing next is death metal more than likely
Phase4: Yep
Phase4: yes
jup
It's running now.
Phase4: A little
See, I can't imagine thinking of Rarity as anything but generous after Suited For Success. I'm rewatching it right now and I'm just amazed at how willing she is to work her ass off for her friends! (And, really, at how uncharactestically unkind the other five were when presented with the gowns in the first place)
tSparx: becus she saves the best for her self most the time
tSparx: Time to write a letter to Celestia? :P
Ahh, there's no generosity quite like unhealthy generosity.
AdamTheDuck: And of course, there's no insanity quite like T-Sparx insanity.
AdamTheDuck: Or Pinkie insanity. Maybe that's why I love them both: when they go crazy, they go CRAZY
Sumica ded
ahhhh the death metal is playing now :D
Dat taunt
lol
Wy would he do that
:D Is this the Deathclok Pony intro version?
Cypresswolf: almost
dang, it is 5am... why am I still up?
Because sleep is for the weak?
PonyNegZero: My favorite time to go to sleep is during the sunrise
Because no sane pony wants to sleep through Luna's night? Yeah that's it! :)
Cypresswolf: its this youtuber tha does a bunch of meta stuuf of pony a lot death metal but some are like this flok metal and power metal
Cypresswolf: Who would want to sleep through lunas night
woot woot
No sane pony! :)
good answer, probably won't fly with my mother...
If I could, I'd stay up 24 hours a day. There's good in every time of day, and in both our princesses too ;)
Plead insomnia
PonyNegZero: See, that is not a problem I'm used to dealing with anymore. None of my friends' parents care about their sleeping habits
tSparx: I need to care for another 2 days, then I'm free
PonyNegZero: Congratz! Starting college, then?
nah, returning
ugh..hate new updates - everyone's trying to get on and the server cant handle the influx overload
I'm sitting in my dorm right now
Cypresswolf updates to what? you talking about tf2/mvm?
the name of this song is end of sisterhood
"I have no idea, and I don't know whether I should be excited or scared to find out" idk why I haven't worked that quote into casual conversation more often
if some pony need to talk to meh ping me
no its a game about an island, I cant mention it on stream - got a bunch of new art, new locations, new features, artist just updated after 5 months
yes, yes it does
its a puzzle oriented game with....extra features
this sing is butterflys

scottish-geeky-drawl: Not trying to be a grammar jerk, just trying to make sure: is it about discord, or Discord?
tSparx: but those dresses didn't represent them at their fullest! (sarcasm)
tSparx: Lord Discord master of cahos
oh cool must listen!
tSparx: the name of the song is end of order
MadSurge: Wow, that was *way* back in the convo haha.

may Luna master of night wach over you all
cya AdamTheDuck
I fucking HATE people who hack xbox live to win games
Douchebags who do that can die in a fire,
SLOWLY
rage more?
(chill out, it is just a game)
PonyNegZero: Chill out, it's just him raging :P
PonyNegZero: no, gaming is 60% of my social life. People who fuck with my social life are dumbasses.
her/him
tSparx: i'm a him
Pinkies4thWall: Alrighty, just never want to assume :) I think hacking is inexcusable; I've never even understood it. I wouldn't care about winning a match of Tribes (or w/e) if I knew I'd cheated to do it. What makes me feel good about winning games is knowing that my teammates and I were skilled enough to win. Cheating just confuses me :/
I wholeheartedly agree.
Pinkies4thWall: I'm in the same boat, but I won't let a hacker get the best of me.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #418
PonyNegZero: I won, it's just i knew he was hacking
tSparx: only if you're a kid playing a game too hard for you/if the game isn't worth it/if the cheat is funny and you want to just screw around with the game :D
If you're a kid playing a game too hard for you, you should just have fun losing.
Or play another game.
tSparx: yeah :D I already had beaten legitly Doom 2 anyway :D
oh well single-player games are different
losing is the only way to play games
Well, it's bedtime for me. good night, ponies
winning is boring
tSparx: TF2 is really good in that aspect, I never was mad at people for owning me because it's to much fun, unlike Call of Duty :D
Night Pinkies4thWall
Aaaaa
Oh my God... Is that Guile theme in the background? :D
Night Pinkies4thWall!
you're not hurting anyone by cheating then. I usually don't hae fun because I'm skillful in 1p games, I have fun playing it. SO I'll cheat if I want to
dat MadSurge
AdamTheDuck: YES :D
Night Pinkies4thWall
It was strange because I set my ringtone to Guile theme so I thought someone was calling me. :D
AdamTheDuck: :D oops
WAVE FAILED
Do you get a trophy for clearing a round without failing a single wave?
Hey MASF123
Did chat die or is my char derping?
Nope just ded.
Chat died
chat*
You'd think that, with 101 users on the channel, there'd be some convo
Hmm... Usually I would be telling an interesting story/event if chat is this dead but I got no new stories. :/
Is Super-Squeezy all an entire Music Man parody? Somehow I missed this episode
What do you mean music man parody?
Well, the opening song certainly is.
The Music Man, it's a musical
I'm not sure then :/
This song isn't even trying to hide the fact that it's a MM parody haha
00,10the bomb
00,10not the tanks
Sumica: Do you have a sandman for scout if so I'll trade you for it if you want
Phase4: Can I join the game
Hey Buytoast
Yes?
NDAs suck
No, just hey Buytoast
Ah.
I has awesome but tell none I can
Also ninjaing a spot in MvM
:p
Dumorimasoddaa: No no, you should look at it this way: if NDA's didn't exist, you wouldn't know in the first place.
00,02whats with all the metal
X3 now I has 3 nda's
If not more
Well
00,02Dumorimasoddaa, stopped playing :(
Darn
00,02they need to make ksp multiplayer
Phase4: Would you still want to trade for your sandman
I have 2 NDAs but one is in parts cos its about mutipul products
Yeah okay, the rest of Super-Squeezy isn't really a Music Man parody
00,02and then chat ded
Can someone explain to me why "control of the cider business" = "the Apples have to leave Sweet Apple Acres"
wat
ooh Kerbal
Phase4: I'm losing 2-5 minutes when I blink...
00,02PonyNegZero, i recomend sleep
tSparx: because they lost all their apple trees :D
Is this still Phase4?
00,02or an ambulanc
00,02tSparx, yeah
exactly, and sleep it is
MadSurge: Well, hmm, idk, one of the problems with my love of this show (and cartoons in general) is that I actually care about logic, continuity, and self-consistency. I shouldn't care so much here.
Yay Kerbals
tSparx: as long as minimal logic is in effect I care little about that stuff. It's still a cartoon for kids :D
Dat background music
Alright, well, I'm off again. See y'all later!
Bye tSparx
later tSparx
then chat dies :/
that feel when a track gives you goosebumps
00,10uhhhh
00,10timber
08,01morning all
Mornin' Samsa
oops fail tab :D
http://punyhumangames.com/?news=22079 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
morning
anyone playing Guild Wars 2 right now?
DeadpoolDash: Was, decided to take a break.
Nope got better betas :P
00,02this seems totaly safe
it is release now
00,10this is going to be a spectacular fireball
DeadpoolDash: I know.
00,02bet you the outer rockets crush everything as soon as i turn the srb's on
00,10yep
00,02oh wow
character name Kristof Bowen
00,10they will probably rip the outer tanks off the center line
00,02WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe
Mine is: Fluttershy The Tree DeadpoolDash :P
which server?
Darkhaven
Phase4: needs more duct tape
00,02indeed
do you know how to claim the gear from Guild Wars 1?
DeadpoolDash: Mail
is it automatic?
DeadpoolDash: check the top left tab ingame and click on the mail icon.
will have to check
That is going to blow up...
big time
sweet GW2 is completely resizable like the first one
00,02there we go
Phase4: Are you sure about this...?
00,02i'm totaly sure
Then go for it
00,02already have
00,02stream lag
yeah A little for me I think i should just refresh
I think Phase is going by the mantra of: if at first you don't succeed, add more rockets.
00,02or fuel
00,02that can help
And duct tape. :P
Phase4: Now my stream is perfect
00,02lol it goes too fast
woot woot ^^
I just added you adamtheduck
DeadpoolDash: Cool
I'll be right back
DeadpoolDash: It was a pitty I couldn't give my Sylvari yellow/amber skin and pink hair :D
well this is pretty much a character from the original Guild Wars I am playing
Aghhhhhj
Fuck you gws
/me hugs JRP. Oh calm yourself down :P
Carlton pick up ur game
O man im angry
/me calms down
00,02heard something about that
00,02other team was 93 ahead or something at half time
/me wishes he was normal and followed football like every other Australian 6_9
Phase4 gws and st kilda
128 points
00,02fast landing
00,02not enough fuel
Whoa, Phase landing on the moon properly for once? What ever happened to crashing onto Mun? :D
Holla everypony! :)
Hello there GilDash|Gaming
into Mun*
https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/481180_278215775610988_1946450508_n.jpg I made this.
MASF123: Awesome
00,02i like this lander
00,02lolnice mas
00,02MASF123, '
00,02anyone still watcing
00,02?
00,02watching'
00,02derpspell
/me raises his hand :P
Phase4: still here...
00,02Sumica, you there?
Cbf playing anything, just readin' a book.
00,02PonyNegZero, SLEEP :<
o_O
00,10yeah, what's up?
Sleep is for the weak
00,02interesting takeof procedure for this lander
00,02Sumica, watch
Phase4: I'm cool, I'll just... *snore*
00,02not sure how far behind stream is
00,10all them nubs
00,02ikr
00,10looks like the moder might be too small
00,02i think the most efficent way to de-orbin from the mun is gust go up
00,02Sumica, its fine
00,02just takes a while
00,10yeah best way is to wait till facing kerblin and just lift off
00,02seems to be a little heavy
00,02thsi could be bad
00,10try for an orbit
00,02too late for orbit
00,10ah
00,02found kerbin
I have no idea what's going on O.o
00,02ekips, i'm returning from the mun
I LIKE CAKE
00,02Sumica, this lander gives no fucks, slam it in to the ground at 15M/s and it'll just bounce
Bill Kermann doesn't seem to be so happy about that Phase4
00,10lol
We need the expert
Call Bill Nye we need his advice
00,02now i want to see bill nye playing kerbal
00,02and this all ontop of that rocket you guys said would explode :P
I still think it needs more rockets. :P
Such relaxing music to be reading to The Walking Dead lol
00,02oh come on bill
Then suddenly bagpipes
00,02your barely passing 2 g's
00,02stop complaining
anyone know a brony radio station?
08,01i want pizza
00,02Malk, brony radio :P
08,01i always get like this
08,01i have pizza, then i want more pizza
08,01and pizza is the only thing i eat for days
I got to go to my high school graduation today
00,02i'll brb
00,02PonyNegZero, AND Y U NO SLEEP :<
00,02i sware no one here sleeps
Dafuq is sleep.
hallo :)
Does closing your eyes for 15 minutes count Phase4?
such fitting music
/me 08,01licks PonyNegZero's cheek
Phase4: I'm fine, I'm good to go... don't mind that part where I look like crap and take a few days off my expected life length... I'm good
I know this music...where is it from?
Waltz for Trixie
sleep
Morning guys
wooy woot
morning Chrysalis
00,02Malk, no, no it does not
Mornin' Chrysalis
00,02i need another playlist
00,02but i like makkon's music :(
/me gives the entire chat a hug
/me 00,02hugs Chrysalis back
Well I sleep on mondays
thx, EonMaster
Mondays nothing goes on monday thats sleep day
np :)
/me tries to find a music identification software that works with the browser
DaringDerpy you got an android phone?
get SoundHound
no phone
I only have an old blackberry
brb
all the softwares I find want me to hum into the micro...
not what I am looking for
00,02i found more space for rockets
the story of this explosion will be told for generations
time to ghost
and i'm me again
yup phase is going to blow up kerbel headcorders with this ship
/me is pleased with Phase's new rockets. :D
The explosion will black out the sun
00,02this will totaly make it off the ground
definately
Fine Phase4, I'll go to sleep now... It is starting to get light out and I'll be waking up in just a few hours...
no fins?
if it doesnt, just add more rockets
00,02oops
this is madness
O-O
if in doubt
you forgot something ^^
add more rockets
left something behind there? :D
OHHH NO
if not in doubt
add more rockets
oh...this is bad
Whoa :O
Boooom
boom
Fire works :D
00,02PonyNegZero, :( i hope you get enough sleep
Phase4: believe me, I'll be just fine.
good night PonyNegZero
hey guys
00,02night PonyNegZero
hi alexxm
Hello alexxm
night PonyNegZero
how've you been DaringDerpy and AdamTheDuck
00,02what the
good good. busy procrastinating
alexxm: Fine but feeling a bit fat from all my lazyness :3
YAY EXPLOSIONS :D
bang
awesome
o-O
now find the heat builtup ^^
10
00,02it was a staging problem
and still no fins
Phase4 how many more must die
before you are satisfied
you monster
all of them
00,02there may also be other issues
he lives!
DaringDerpy: Who needs fins when you have rockets, lots and lots of rockets.
00,02Chrysalis, bah, i'd use robots if they wern't so bloody expencive
lol
I think I saw your explosions shock wave
he needs new pants
00,02now i have to buy all these parachutes
Dil lives for another test
00,02i may have too much rocket
Good night every one
woot woot ^^
blasphemy!
Phase4 imposibru
NO DON'T SAY THAT Phase4
apply more rockets! that will fix the problem!
NO, bad pony, the only way to fix a rocket problem is more power
the upper stage must have so much velocity that the bottom stage doesn't get near the heat
hm...or the stability thing
00,02come to think of it
00,02i may have put some of the upper srb's on the lower tage
that would explain the effect
00,02ok
00,02the rocket crushed itself
00,02this is new
lower stage ignited first
yes
and again, Dil survives for another run
Is the top half even attached to the bottom?
00,02RD_is_awesome, via a seperator
needs a strong frame structure
auxiliary start boosters on the upper stage
wobbly
The top does look like it is just sitting on the bottom when you get on the launch pad and the wobbles start
no chance
apply struts everywhere
statics problem
00,02i think i simply may have found the physical limit for rocket
it needs an exoskeleton
00,02oh nvm
00,02its working
Haha :D
outrages
cool
still not exploded
give it time derpy
Phase4, pushing the limits one test ta a time
00,02ok
oops
00,02new problem found
I think you will need to give it time to accelerate with regular rocket propeltion before fireing the boosters or it will rip apart
the gods of aerodynamics and tensile stress would kick you in the face for this anyway
Lol what was that Phase4 :P
00,02AdamTheDuck, link from another channel
this stage works
next
the struts fail
all of them
00,02i think this rocket is just chance
00,02only works ~50% of the time
wait...the inner boosters collide with each other during the separation process, right?
00,02its not a bug, its a feature
tanks
:)
redlong finds this unsettling
00,02cant stop the spinning
00,02this is gona get anoying
Poor Kerbal is about to throw up.
00,02on the plus side i got the entire thing into orbit
<3 this song :3
00,02like the look of this rocket
Avast Octavia's Plot :)
a single maneuvering thruster should be enough to stop the spinning
First pony song I ever heard. :)
Same here. And still as good as ever. :)
I think the music is fitting for the successful launch, this was a triumph
the first one I heard was "for the new lunar republic"
still awesome
this was the second or fourth or so
it's almost a year now....
10 months brony ^^
if someone had told me a year ago, I wouldn't have believed it
Actually, the first song I heard was Octavia giggles at the ghosties.
don't know this one
You might want to check it out.
I'm at it
It's very similiar to the Avast Octavia's plot.
Bell Crystals is the name of the song.
00,02^
first mlp thing I ever saw was the ponified Starcraft 2 trailer over a year ago
I don't even know how long am I a brony.
Additional supply depoits requires... FUUUUUU
00,02i time warped a little too long
I could reconstruct it by the date when pony pics started showing up in my dl folder
I'm trying to remember what was the newest S2 episode by the time I started watching FIM.
i know i joined mid April 2011, dont know what date though
the lack of rockets disgusts me
^
april is early
00,02i'm honestly not sure how to add more
00,02its alreay trying to explode on the pad
I'm pretty sure I joined Bronystate during this year.
00,02unless.....
Dat "unless" :D
oh know he is going to do it, que dramatic music
Inb4 evil laugh.
DaringDerpy, yep I joined just before season 1 ended
uh oh
unless is a dangerous wor
My first live episode was Read It And Weep :)
thing episode 23 was the first to come out after I joined
hmm, Phase4 can't you use those support columns to keep it together before liftoff?
00,02Chrysalis, those caused it to explode
00,02plus all the structural points are covered in srb
ah
erm
My 1st live episode was Feeling Pinkie Keen
add more rockts to push it together?
The Derpy reaction video really helped to make Bronystate even more popular :D
the driven stage folds the stage above it together until explosion
It's always fun here when the new episode is streamed.
00,02i need new music
The Derpy reaction during Feeling Pinkie Keen confused me.
00,02someone link me a playlist
I'm looking forward the new ones.
00,02prefferably pony orchestral
I have a pony playlist phase
Malavolent: I hope this laptop can sustain the message spam without freezing :D
I ended up on bronystate because it had less lag than the other stream channels i tested for a few episodes
Iz this the tired part of the night or what?
Phase4: Try this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H91QXNr41FM&list=PL8422F041ADF1F116&feature=plcp
00,02that'll work
most couldn't handle the sudden load
It's ideal background music.
00,02this is just a tower of rocket
But will it BOOM?
5 bits says it wxplodes on takeoff
00,02i'm suprised it doesnt instantly crush the engines
Eat your heart out, NASA.
I wonder how what strength a ddos attack against bronystate must have to be effective
00,02oh my god it has lift
00,02i actually didnt expect this
imposssibruuuuuuuuuuu
00,02^
All aboard the flying bomb.
add more stages!
How come there is only 1 kerbal in?
beautiful
00,02Malavolent, new version
00,02different command module
00,02i'm using the small one
Aww, I miss the middle insane kerbal
I think that is Jeb
This is so awesome it brings tears to my eye. :'(
in the rocket atm
00,02almost crashed the game there
mayday mayday
00,02he survived
This is what would NASA do with unlimited budget.
game cant handle a rocket of that magnitude
jebediah was the pilot
Jebediah is always off his chops
00,02jeb is the only one i could convince to fly it
00,02the others ran screaming
00,02not sure why
look at how happy he is, even when faced with death
00,02oh go
00,02god'
00,02when jeb screams you know something is wrong
00,02oh nvm
00,02he's happy again
00,02looks like it might just achive lift
He's dead already.
00,02there we go
00,02look at all those struts
needs more rockets
would a rarity work?
wheeeeeeee :D
OMG it spins.
00,02theres something i want to try
00,02not sure if this has enough power to do it
just crash it into the moon
No, woona D:
00,02oh damn
00,02launched the wrong way
bonus points if you hit woona but not luna
you have enough to retro burn
00,02well i cant do what i want
00,02lets see if i can remove the escape velocity
00,02on the plus side if i launch the right way i could do what i want to try with this
fast forward
00,02i wonder
What kind of orbit is that?
00,02ohai shana
00,02Malavolent, the up down orbit
hi Phase4
00,02heh
00,02i like how its predicting a mun intercept when to actually encounter it i would need to orbit THROUGH kerbin
Sounds like a plan.
^
Phase4 sounds easy enough
might give kurth a bit of a kiss on the sling shot
the physics engine lets you cut through planets fine
if your going quick enough
00,02i'ma get soo much speed with these little rockets
Next sop: Galiffrey.
00,02hurry up and go faster pls
I wanna see the g-force report on re-entry
00,02RD_is_awesome, thats what i'm going for :P
00,02i actually want to try exploiting kerbins orbit and getting a re-entry speed of > 20KM/s
00,02this will take some time
00,02brb
hello everypony
Hello BronyInstrumental
00,02and back
00,02its still going
chat's quiet today
its morning
actually for me it's afternoon
00,02http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/24/3254422/apple-samsung-trial-verdict
42 minutes into the afternoon
too bad those on the jury all used iphones
hi BronyInstrumental
13:42 here
00,02RoboGerbil, ikr
00,02"the company was found to have infringed the design patent for the iPhone's array of icons across the board."
afternoon
12:43 here
afternoon, DaringDerpy
this was only against the ipad clone, right?
00,02no
00,02apple
00,02has a patent
no it was against the samsung galaxy s
00,02on a grid
i have a samsung galaxy s :S
/me hides his Samsung TV
00,02BronyInstrumental, acording to this its noting but an apple clone
oh boy, apple gets more money
now they can help the world with the new iShit 7
apples going the way of the music industry
00,02yeah, i'm certin something else is going on here
I will never buy an Apple product or apple produce again
randomly chosen citizens decided this?
Tovler: i never have, theyre inferior products to begin with
10 bucks apple payed off the jury
RoboGerbil: /)
00,025.2 KM/s
for the next 2 months at least. Need to save up money for the Wii-U. The iPhone 5 can wait.
00,02Buytoast, i hope they find out if thats true
(\
00,02because its an incredibly evil thing to do
wouldn't surprise me
00,02and would probably kill apple
MORNING everypony
afternoon, Bronysith
Now I feel like selling my iPhone and buying an android :D
00,026KM/s
Mornin' Bronysith
it would be stupid to not buy the jury
/me glomps into Phase4
00,02this'll be fun
the system wants you to do so
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
so which letter are you up to now Phase4?
here come the g-forces, also apple need to stop being cryfags
00,02?
for kerbal names
00,02oh, jeb;s in this one
I would be a cryfag for a billion
lol
00,0251.3G
00,02now i have an idea
LOL, jeb is mince meat
eva during a high G arc :3
I'm too much of a nihilist and fanboy to reject Apple.
I find brand fandom weird
00,02what the
but applefags are so hip and edgy
lol
if you don't buy from apple obviously you're poor and inferior
they are?
OOPS
all i've ever bought from apple was an ipod and that was when i had no phone
00,02k, launching at sunrise
I grew up only on Apple. I'm more of a nostalgiafag than applefag.
00,02i either want to launch at sunrise or sunset
building sense of community on a brand...
00,02note to self: cant leave the rocket standing around
compared to this, bronydom looks highly reasonable
LE COLLAPSE :D
ouchie
00,10use launch braces
/me glomps into Sumica
00,02Sumica, cant
I never used an apple
too expensive for the things it can do
BOOOOOOOOOOOM
wouldn't rejects one though
AND HE LIVED :D
00,02Sumica, i can only attach to the srb's which doesnt really work
00,10plenty of room inside
00,02the center of this craft is more rocket
heheheh, Angry Whopper
Sumica: is that what she said?
00,10quite a desgine flaw
00,10it blows off a section when ejecting the srb's
WHAT
00,02and the lander is unharmed
00,02i can totaly land this thing
Oh god, this game is so hilarious :D
Epic Kerbal Battle~: Phase4 vs Sumica
http://cheezburger.com/6529347584 WANT WANT WANT
hi everyone :)

00,02Finally
00,02oh this is much more successfull
00,02i do have a plan

00,02and hopefully it will work this time
and hello CountDoofus
00,02OH COME ON
00,02stupid fuel lines
Foiled again!
~You spin me right round baby right round~
well it spins
what was that?
you spin me right round
something hit you in midair
It would be so funny if the feed of the astronaut would suddenly get splooged with vomit from all the spinning.
CountDoofus: next update maybe? :D
We can only hope :)
00,02ok, now i fixed the minor fuel bug
00,02that caused explosive instability
00,02we can try again
00,02last time
00,10oh good good this thing is too fast a rocket
00,02:<
00,02that doesnt usualy happen
00,10hey Phase4, I got one doing 3km/s in atmo
00,10it's inerita alowed it to break orbit
00,02XD

PERIOD
00,02Bronysith, XD
spinning towery thing of death?
is GW2 down for anyone else?
00,02this is my plan
well
DeadpoolDash: been trying to log in for over an hour now.
00,02make my orbit really big
time to get ass raped in dark souls
I have been playing for hours now, but got disco'd and cant log back in
00,02have to slow a smidge
00,02nvm, have to speed up
Guess there's been a massive influx of people trying to log in and their servers went "LOLNOPE".
login servers are down
lame
Phase4: http://cheezburger.com/6512727552
00,02or do nothing, its accidentally almost perfect
what is funny is this is the prerelease weekend, imagine what will happen at release
00,02XD
Eh, I'll try again later. Anyone feeling like playing Mann Vs. Machine?
00,02this will take a while
im going to play dark souls
00,02but if it works it will be interesting
there we go
00,02ooooo, looking at that number i might not be able to do it
TIEM TO MURDER ALL THE DEMONS
00,02gona need to build a bigger rocket later
I like your thinking Phase :D
I wonder if I can log into GW1
nope
all the guild wars servers are down too
00,02love how flat the orbit is
00,02somehow
00,02may JUST be able to do this
those stress tests must not have stressed enough
00,02i should totaly be recording this
00,02there we go
lolz
00,02and i'm not trying to hit the sun
Not dropping in to see Celestia, then?
00,02n
00,02no'
00,02trying to go back to kerbin
:)
00,02but in a fun way
00,10this might just be the fastest stock rocket I have ever built Phase4
damn I was having fun too
00,02Sumica, how fast?
00,101km/s by 10km up
00,02holy
00,02you start re-entry by taking off
00,10not enough fule to matain that burn
00,10ran out of fuel by 15km
so Sumica's rocket has a big punch, but doesn't last very long? :3
00,10iniertia took it up to 65 km
00,02k, this is the slow booring bit where we need to wait for it to run out of fuel
00,02and hopefully hit about 3.5KM/s
11,02Night everypony ^-^
00,02night SuperBrony64|Zzz
Sleep tight, SuperBrony64|Zzz
May you dream sweet innocent CMC dreams
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
bye SuperBrony64|Zzz :)
00,02so
00,02i need a bigger rocket
00,02but the principal seems sound
00,02and i can potentialy do what i wan tto
00,02want to'
00,02need a faster time warp
00,02one more orbit then i'm probably gona stop streaming
why am I not surprised that a programm crashes when I set a parameter to "infinity" ?
heh heh heh
what is Phase4 trying to do?
00,02run wordpress on freebsd
00,02well
00,02php is broke
00,02and its not telling me why
Phase4: did you check the php configuration? basedir restrictions for example?
00,02i'm just trying to run phpinfo for now
basedir restrictions still apply there
00,02there we go
00,02php5-script, not php-script
nvm then :)
never used mod_php
morning!
Mornin' Kurra
Hey, what? Have people been streaming all night?? O:
00,02shana, i'm not sure if nsf is using mod_php or php-fpm
well php-fpm would be a seperate process
00,02come to think of it they're probably using fpm which makes this excersize a massive waste of time
ah you're talking about the other host
I hope they're using php-fpm :)
00,02i am annoyed by this
00,02" Fatal error: Unknown: Cannot use output buffering in output buffering display handlers in Unknown on line 0"
00,02wat
00,02error on line 0: somethings broken
Best music to code by in my opinion....
11,02Equestria LA sold out...I wanted to go to it ;~;
00,02scoots needs an episode
00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, :(
Phase4, I agree
Why aren't you sleeping SuperBrony64|Zzz ? :P
GUys
No-one has been sleeping lately AdamTheDuck.
Hey everypony, who's streaming?
I want Oscar Pistorius to guest voice a character on the scoots episode. ;.;
CiderIsForDrinking: Hello and Phase is
11,02AdamTheDuck: Cause I found out that convention sold out before I could get a ticket to it...
meh Equestria Daily is run by Rina-Chan
I thought it was run by Sethisto?
et al?
lolwat
I smell a conspiracy
/me glomps Vivix
Sethisto can't do anything except update what he receive in the mail
/me fiercly hugs Jmo
:3
hi Jmo and Vivix
Hi Lil_B
Hello Lil_B
and there's way too much convention right now
It's the season, afterall
still should be spread
I saw the word Sethisto.
00,02thats enough streaming for me
Did someone mention Trixie and/or dragon porn?
oh lawl
Buytoast: lolwut
If a con was during winter workmonths, it would have poor attendance,
thanks for the stream Phase4
Buytoast, more like Trixie and/or Cinder
thanks for the stream Phase4
Thanks for the explosions Phase4 :P
00,02one day i will figure how to slam kerbals into kerbin at 20KM/s

Hehe, poor kerbals
Phase4 rockets
http://youtu.be/Hu1No6jq-Q4 EileMonty>>>>>>>>Rina-Chan
Don't know either
trying out to make some Hard Rock with a Mega Drive Soundfont XD hope I get something together XD
Hehe
Soundfonts!
I write almost all my stuff in GP5, but since I had to put away my drumkit when I moved here I've found writing drums to be a horrible chore-
Pucker up Vivix
But I miss it Jmo ;__; it was fuun
Build a mini soundproof room then :P
I have no basement ;__;
I'm planning to buy a small elkit, but I can't afford it right now
Dat.
Box.
Recently blew 1800 dollars on a bass cabinet, so rather broke
Holy sweet jesus, are you insane?
Worth it!
My old cabinet was tearing the element cone thingy, so I needed a new one-
/me pokes Vivix
INSAANIITTYY~
;___; I'll have it for yeaaars
I had the old one for 9 years- and this one is better
Vivix I wish I had more money to spend on music, the only reason I stick with my humble little set of Soundfonts VSTs and LMMS is because of it XD
wait not 9 years- 7 years or so
Hehehe, yeah- it's rather expensive for good VSTis and such
I mainly use live instruments, not cheaper to do that though
Hi
Vivix, I like you already
!
Vivix I only use free things atm and tit will stay that way until I get a job after my apprentenship and possible study in some years XD
Thank you?
Hello CCCP
/me hugs CCCP
dat apprentenship
Live instrument>samples
Lil_B: Ah yeah, I've spent years buying cheap stuff , and was able to splurge when I got extra money
Hi AdamTheDuck
I've got..12 guitars and basses <,<
Good afternoon everyone :)
/me hugs Lil_B
Wow Vivix.
hiya CCCP
Hello MLP_Brovakiin
Vivix man XD how old are you if I may ask ?
Most of them cheap, but I love them
23
Hi Vivix
Vivix, can you give me one? :3
I wub them ;__;
No but honestly some of them cost like 100 dollars, 3 of them to be exact-
heavily modified by now though
and I got my first bass for around 150 dollars from my cousin. 92 Fender Mexico precision
Woop meant to adress - I wub them to CrimsonPhoenix , but yeah- you can get some real cheap and real nice telecasters, easy build makes them cheap
Vivix, I was just goofing around
but again you're awesome for that
Hehe
Do you play?
I well....play Violin....quite badly
though I know HOW to play it just not that good
hello :3
Aah, hehe- I always wanted to learn violin-
Hello sonicandmario85
I have one that used to be my sisters, but I can't play it at all
Hi sonicandmario85
hallo sonicandmario85
CrimsonPhoenix I love Violins, and strings in general
Lil_B: My dream orchestral VSTi is that east west orchestra thing- have you seen that?
I Tried to watch FiM with my ten year old cousin, she didn't want to watch it cus she said it was for babies
Aww-
Vivix no, I don't really follow any news of that sort, can you give me a link? (I'm quite interested)
That's a shame. :(
But I think she secretly enjoyed it
power rangers lost galaxy is on right now but im not watching it because i dont feel like it
CCCP: The first stage is denial :3
Lil_B: http://www.soundsonline.com/Symphonic-Orchestra I think, they got differnt versions. They're like--hollywood tier stuff. I want one so bad
Yup lol AdamTheDuck
On demos you hear- crazy good samples
Ello everyone
Ello
Hello Thrackerzod
Hallo Thrackerzod
Haio Thrackerzod
Well, Mann vs Machine was a dud, and GW2 still won't connect... Guess I'll go draw something.
Hi Thrackerzod
Ohai CCCP
Vivix I only have this big free orchcestra Soundfont set and a bunch of otherm soundfonts
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ap44NhGG1rriakmo1_500.jpg
Hello CountDoofus :)
Lil_B: I have some midi stuff that came with my cubase- but that's it. Good orchestra soundfonts and stuff is so hard to come by
/me glomps Vivix
Cuuubaseee
;3
Vivix I wanna buy Cubase in the future too , I heard its the best for orchestral things and flexible to do other things
Oh yeah, I really enjoy it. Wasn't too expensive either- I got the eh Artist version, slightly limited compared to the--unlimited tracks version, but yeah
The unlimited version is intended for tv studios and stuff- so I figured it would be massive overkill for me <,<
Nothing is overkill.
Hehe
I think eh the difference between artist and unlimited is things like- I can have 64 tracks, unlimited can have like- 600
/me not sure
http://youtu.be/Hu1No6jq-Q4
Vivix I still stick too LMMS , I have to get Cubase because LMMS crashes a lot when It trys to load higher quality VSTs
EileMonty is best VA?
EileMonty is best VA
11,02o3o
NO STREAM POST YOUTUBE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ybjtJx74M
Do you run it in linux?
dat SuperBrony64|Zzz
11,02dat meh o.o
Vivix I wanna Switch too Linux soon, but currently I use the Windows version
Ah yeah
It looks pretty nice, ever tried Reaper?
Reeaapeeer
It's 'free' if you use it--for non commercial or something
Vivix I have heard about it, if it really is free for non-commercial use I'll try it
It's like- eh you download the full version, and it asks you everytime if you want to pay
It's eh..the license is you have to pay for commercial and hobby use, so it's a bit iffy.
Well I'm off to sleep. Goodnight everyone. :)
I used it while I was saving for Cubase, which cost-- 350 dollars
Night AdamTheDuck
Goodnigh AdamTheDuck
but yeah off LMMS and Reaper, I don't know who supports VST the best
Vivix I'm still a starter in terms of making music, started last december, right now I'm mkore playing around, figuring Stuff out and everythig, I hope I can get professional stuff once I have a regular income (starting with my new Studia Headset on monday) :)
Studio*
Ah nice, yeah. And yeah buying tons of stuff for start might be abit heavy if you have no steady income
I blew out my monitor speakers, really cheap ones, so I'm stuck between "monitor, or studio headphones"
can't decide-
headphones ftw
Smart Vivix.
/me is so smurt he destroys all speakers he own
Vivix I would use monitors if you are alone, I'm gonna use Headphones because I live with other people and like to work at night
Ah yeah, well I like to work at night too, but- I can't record at night anyway
but--yeah- I have to consider headphones. I while back it was said that it was a bad idea, but- headphones have gotten really good, you know? So- yeah.
I'll get the Sennheisser SP 25-13-SpII
Ah Nice
Sennheiser is a good brand
I freaking love this show :(
sup iam TheKoreanBrony13
I'm going to buy a Sennheiser e906 microphone as soon as I can- thouh I'd probably need speakers or headphones before that
you guys need something to listen to? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZM4Z7W0_M
yeah, I talked to a nice guy at our music store, he said for low budget, he would reccoment Sony 7510 or the famous Audio-Tecnica Model (forgot the name)
but if I really want something that works long and is just incredible for it's price I should use this sennheisser model, and he quite convinced me XD
Hmm- I have to stop by the musicstore and check it out too. I mean, all my mixing is done in mono at the moment <,<
Vivix wut?
well, I only blew out my left speaker. So <,< all I hear is mono
I had these eh I dunno 50 dollar empire speakers. They were really nice until they blew out
Once again, you're a genius Vivix.
;__;
I'm back! Good morining everypony
Mornin'!
So.....no stream ATM
i have wireless headpones that cant get blown out one time i had a video really loud it didnt blow out not even a bit
how you doing Dark92Enigma
Maybe headphones would allow me to- play without having to use such loud speakers too
Did they <----- streamed the Hub last weekend?
I had to make my speakers match up with my bass amp, and after about a month they blew out
blowing out takes quite a while
alexxm i'm fine, thank you
Vivix yeah, he also said that these Headphones can go really high without even distorting, and I tend to make eveything to quiet anyway XD
aah nice, yeah
Phase4: uready?
Vivix btw, do you think we could colab some day? I've never done it and don't quite know how it works, but really wanna do it someday
/me hugs Dark92Enigma
alexxm We were talking about Summerslam earlier this week
i had these for 1 year
/me hugs Lil_B back
Sure, I play kinda alternative pop--and noise / shoegaze stuff, mainly pretty happy stuff atm. Could be fun
Hon
yep we were Dark92Enigma
Oh say, have you heard of Studio ohm? It's an online DAW made for Collabs and internet use
It's- going to be expensive, but atm it's beta so it's not too bad
Vivix I even have it installed
Hi trollghost ^-^
Vivix but not bought
So.....we left at D-Bryan vs Kane
Ah nice, me too. But I haven't used it much. but it works okay with my slow net
Same here
What do you make or like to make?
alexxm D-Bryan vs Kane was an OK match, happy to see the former win again
heh yeah
Vivix I like weird things, I have done orchestral, chiptunes, working on a Music Box like Remix and on a Indian Sounding version of the MLP Intro
YES YES YES YES YES
alexxm and then we had ADR vs Sheamus
Lil_B: Ah nice. I had a huge thing for musicboxes before, they're--eerily beautiful
Dark92Enigma why do they keep on doing that match
Vivix can I send you a preview of the song?
But yeah, we can try working something out. It's always fun to try new things. and sure yeah send away
alexxm Seriously, how many times we were doing the match?
1- At No Way Out
(Ziggler replaced ADR)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZM4Z7W0_M
2- Money In The Bank (Sheamus def. ADR)
3- Summerslam (Sheamus won......with a low blow???)
Yay someone else who watches wrestling
MrUmmmz: /)
Dark92Enigma: (\
Ok, so here's my reaction to Sheamus winning with a low blow.....3....2....1....WHAT THE HELL?
lol I didn't see Summerslam but I heard what happened
Shouldn't the heel play dirty, not the other way around?
Yeah it doesn't make him look good to do that
OK, so Ric Flair was a face, and he played dirty, but that's not the case
Dark92Enigma and the ref missed del rios foot being on the rope thats the one thing the ref usaully catches
Ric Flair is Ric Flair. You can't change that I understand
I honestly wish we streamed more G4 episodes of ponies
Meh
here is a neat vid http://youtu.be/WsqdmqRgrIc
That's Slick Rick, there's no denying he's a legend......
MrUmmmz it's like how eddie gurreo would use the fake chairshot and leave the chair in the other guys hands
^
alexxm: R.I.P. Eddie :')
yep
MrUmmmz: and Eddie Guerrero was a face and he cheated to win.....but IT'S FREAKIN SHEAMUS
He's supossed to win by BRUTE STRENGTH
>Sheamus....
True
Btw R.I.P. Eddie Guerrero....:'(
Eddie was all about lying, cheating, and stealing so he had to do stuff like that.
>_>
Gotta love him for it though :3
No doubt
it's like when they tried to turn him heel by attacking tarji but the fans wouldn't boo him
Lol
Tarjiri was cool
OK, on a further note, in the pre-show....Antonio Cesaro won the US title......finally, it's getting back some prestige
yeah i was just saying they tried to turn eddie heel by doing that MrUmmmz
MrUmmmz: IKR? he can be violent, but he can also be funny
alexxm: I know :3
Yup
Man why is it that Triple H seems weaker nowadays?
and now we have the WWE triple threat match.....Cena (boo) vs Big Show vs CM Punk
yay
CM Punk :3
MrUmmmz: he's near his retirement....hell, he already did
Man Triple H is my favorite though T-T
hey ppl
How ironic.........my HHH figure got a broken arm.....the same left arm
pony_438678: Welcome!
Hallo pony_438678
(it was an accident)

Nothing beats when he went against Undertaker at Wrestlemania. That reason alone I bought the PPV
i heard lesnar vs taker might happen at next years mania
/me Checks Deadpool Dash's video
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN!
MrUmmmz: that match was EPIC
alexxm: It'll be hell in the cell all over again
Dark92Enigma: I know I was on the edge of my seat
Hmm, stream is down, huh?
RAW recently went to where I live this Monday T-T I couldn't go..
MrUmmmz check out this japanese guy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjQilnp-7Q
Dammit next time Save Mart Center is having WWE arriving again whether it's RAW or Smackdown im gonna go
Sumica, you wanted to get into the routine of streaming live HUB every week during Pony time. So here's your wake-up call!
http://youtu.be/4ANC8q87jAo
alexxm: That's awesome
sumi
Kenta Kobashi!
Oh yeah. Mica's George Takei pings!
MrUmmmz search burning hammer it's a move that guy made
Oh my~
Okay lol
NOW IS THE ONLY APPROPRIATE TIME to set off Sumi's Takei pings!
mica
hehe
Sumica WAAAAAAAAAKE UUUUUUP
Sumica: You there?!
everyone constantly ping him. Good idea?
sumi
http://youtu.be/gqJAI93JCz8
Inb4 kicking time
We all get a 20 minute ban ;__;
I have an idea............but. it might be annoying
Calling him by his full name is going to activate his Fluttershy ping.
Vivix: Don't say that :o
Mica
I have another idea.....
What?
Wait for it.......
Sumica TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT
Sumi, this is a test of the Emergency Ponycasting system! If this were an actual emergency, we might be missing a new episode of Season 3
Hehehe
He needs emergency ping of that Spanish Fluttershy Scream
Sumi this is critical
Mica, this is hypothetically criticial
00,10why are you all trying to wake me up?
Because ponies
00,10Do you realy want a pound puppies marathon?
SHOO BE- Oh you're awake
so MrUmmmz what did you think of that move
I didnt say anything
Sumi maybe
Sumica, you wanted to get into the routine of streaming the Hub every weekend, right
alexxm: Brutal

Good morning everypony
Goodmorning Ponies47
Good morning Ponies47!

no stream here
00,02http://www.youtube.com/user/makkon06 i dont understand why theres not more orchestral stuff on the radio
00,02thats a lie actually, electronic music is cheap
00,02i understand perfectly
00,02it still sucks though
00,02this whole go to bed
00,02derp
huh, money to buy myself a present
00,02this whole 'go to bed' plan isnt really working
Hello to everyone that joined that I missed.
Phase4 carefuly
you will end up like SB
^
00,02ikr
WHat happened to SB? O.O
i apologise for my appalling spelling
Ponies47
Is anything streaming right now or does my internet suck?
Ponies47 he NEVER goes to sleep when he tries
00,02i'm staying up to listen to this again http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd9qQiwhP5U
Chrysalis
00,02because is epic music
yeah, hit enter too early by accident
this kicks like a mule with its balls wrapped in duct tape http://youtu.be/TOPElC87NDo
http://youtu.be/TOPElC87NDo
00,02urgj, so tempted to start streaming again
DeadpoolDash that right there is an awesome saying
damn it wrong link
http://youtu.be/WsqdmqRgrIc
Chrysalis: Oh yeah. You know when he says he's really going to bed. He's still awake. He tends to not talk on the IRC but talk on Skype in a group chat the both of us are in :P
correct link
Woot, finally logged into Guild Wars 2!
Phase4: No. Go to bed -_-
Did you get the collector's edition?
Well try atleast Phase4
yeah it is finally updating GW2
00,02why would i sleep when theres rockets i could be playing with
Or wizards
00,02must play through magicka again
00,02not now though
Rainbowlicious - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VMSTA0JFio
Phase4: True. You have a good point. :P
People getting into GW2, eh? :D
yes GW2 is open again
Phase4, one of these days. I just hope it's not going to be a day that I have to be stuck with my old computer.
Yay~
/me set up all five of his characters last night before going to bed.
Keerbaaaal
That terrified me because I'd forgotten I hae the tab open
Yay kerbal :)
Dem Kerbals :P
Yay for Kerbal!
Desktop ponieez galor
00,02i'm trying that misson one last time
00,02except now i have my numbers right
holy mother
Ok Phase4 was streaming when I went to bed. And now he's streaming again. AIn total. How long has he been streaming? O_O
Oh, did y'all pick a server btw? I think I chose Ehmry Bay or sommat. :P
*In
00,02far too long
this rocket is CRAZY
00,02i'ma launch from up here
So are you Vivix >.>
00,02screw you launch pad
I know ;__;
hehe
Like a Boss
/me glomps Vivix
00,02forgot to change the time of day
00,02i need to launch at sunrise
00,02need to remember that restart flight is broken
oh hey whats going on here
Nothing >_>
Thats a big rocket
...
Watching a rocket
00,02fine game, i'll put the struts in
Hahaha
.Nicely done
Who was in charge of that? Werner Von Braun?
Oh shit
lol
It looks like a cargo ship from Cowboy Bebop
anyone else buffering?
derring doo of approval
Me!
boom?
what the ?
What is that?
good 10 billion dollars well spent
Also, at the risk of sounding stupid, how did he get his OC as a desktop pony?
eh someone her animated and drew them for thestreaming mods
so that we can see who streams
Makes sense.
I think- most of them were made in mspaint? or SAI, and then just made into gifs of some kind and imported
teh music
Perfect music sync with the action
loooollll
lets do this
00,02this wasnt exploding earlier
Good luck Phase4!
aw
ALL THE ROCKETS
dinggggg
I have one week to finish my summer work and I'm doing this.
FUUUUUUUUU
00,02stop exploding pls
Houston we have liftoff
/me explodes
This is just a flying fuel refinery you know.
I jsut found the full version "Do You Belive In Magic" the song that played during meet the Pyro while your in Pyro Land. It's awesome :3
00,02i'm only trying to go up
lol...
ooh wow
Awesome!
good job XD
The kerbal was so happy in his last seconds.
This is what would happen if people built their own spaceships
Eeyup ^
I'm old. I know "Do you believe in magic" from those old McDonalds commercials
man I want the fullversion so bad because of this. I can't find my bankcard
Ponies47, about time
I wonder if you could turn this into a weapon?
this is the most ridiculous spaceship design ever, I love it XD
I heard that song in many movies
CrimsonPhoenix: It's a good song. I like it.
OHSHOOT
00,02its still going up
Never said it was horrible
00,02dont worry
It's still going
Hi everypony
Derpy did it, it's her fault^
00,02normally it would have 6 more boosters and power through this
00,02ohai DerpyMuffins
00,02but the boosters in the center kept taking out the rockets
"A-Russian compoonents, A-Amerikan compoonents... ALL MADE IN TAIWAN!" *clang!*
00,02XD
/me 00,02hugs Kurra
:D
I'm in Taiwan right now, FYI
/me hugs wiff X3
CrimsonPhoenix: I know but it appears the orginal song is called "The Lovin' Spoonful" but the version that's in meet the Pyro is a rewriteen version. :P
"There! *clang* Now we can go home!" *clang*
zecora battle theme? =P
Wow, that rocket... it's just a BLOCK of fuel tanks and thrusters, right?
needs moar mass up front
It's working!
don't stop. Believing!
HOLD ON THE THAT FEEELLINGANG!!
to that*
ohshoot :O
That altimeter keeps messing up
That doesn't look good
And the stream is lagging on me.
BBR Breakfest
*BRB
that's baaad, 1st stage gone and it's only like a mile up...
that is some thrust to weight ratio there...
Maybe it's in kilometers?
Kurra but theres alot still left to go
I know.
I have no idea of metric to customary so...
Just, hafta have dat peak impulse, and then maximize time accelerating.
I used to be a rocket scientist you know. |3
it is slowly losing momentum
....a model rocket scientist BUT STILL
=o
Lol
so whats the plan for this one
00,02Kurra, you did model rockets?
seriously, I learned so masively much from assembling a little nine inch rocket with balsa wood, glue, and a cardboard tube. <3
00,02alexxm, get to apoapsis
00,02and turn around
Estes is my dealer. X3
00,02go the other way
GW servs down :(
Doobinz thats why im not playing it for a few weeks
let them actually get the servers right
then play
I experimented with different engines and launched them, and put like a big heavy C engine in this little short rocket and had outta sight flights XD
00,02oooo
00,02this is problematic
CUTE BOMB DETECTED
http://i.imgur.com/Ma3yt.png
00,02i need a delta-v of 10KM/s
There's still 2 more stages I think
00,02i dont have that
I never did D engines, they were big and you had to be like 18 to buy them...
CrimsonPhoenix HNNNNNNG
I would watch that actually
and then THE ASTROCAM
Drop them early I think that may solve your problem
oh gosh that was the pimp rocket to get XD
Okay so it can break the atmosphere, but will it blend?
ohai poner pepple
take a picture of your house from 500 feet up with 110 FILM :D
00,02this wont work
poner pepple?
00,02i dont have enough power in the rocket
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Fillydelphia Radio Post-Con Musician Extravaganza
It'll work is we believe!
Phase4 Add more rockets!
believe in the heart of the rocket
00,02i cant add anymore to this design
00,02i had to REMOVE rockets to stop it exploding
ohai regulars
Pull an Apollo 13 and improvise
00,02what else do i have
mod rockets
regulars :(
change the settings in the ini folder?
er file
man, i need to buy myself somthine shiny
but i dont know what
A mirror is shiny
Buy a gold bar
i hate mirrors
how bout a ball made of mirror?
oh wait, I can't post links here right? non video links? darn.
That's fancy-
i spent an hour this morning covering up the one in my bathroom
Buy a mirror then punch it
hehe
because you know, a wall sized mirror facing the toilet
great idea
yyeaaahh-

GarrettBrony: Wait... What about? BACON PANCAKES? Think about that O_O
mornin brony_swan
00,02oops
Morning brony_swan
Yes. Is it morning in Europe?
that was FAST launch
^^
Well this rocket is escalating quickly

O_O
It's still going up
Ponies47: it exists http://i.ebayimg.com/t/1964-Aunt-Jemima-Pancake-Mix-Ad-Bacon-Strip-Style-/00/%24(KGrHqN,!lEE5KmMVCNkBOZTIF,THQ~~_3.JPG

does the link not work?
00,02GarrettBrony, what browser are you using/

00,02its doing strange stuff to the url
ohh
00,02oh yeah
00,02forgot about that problem
How heavy is that thing?
Phase4, can't it be just the ebayimg?
hey Ponies47 check this s*yay*t out http://bacontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/bacon-apple-pie.jpg
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, thats not the problem
there it goes
00,02its the ! in the url
oh
I've never been to one of the livestreams, the A movie comes first and then what?
what about it?
GarrettBrony: All da epic O_O
Movie A>Pony>Movie B>Pony
Thanks
Why does the top of that engine look like the wheel of a DeLorean?
also an intermission in between first pony and Movie B
?
Movie A being a high budget movie and B being a low one
00,02budget or rating
^^^
or both
XDDDD
00,02we had epic movie as a movie
Got it
which movies will e shown?
00,02it got wmc'd
for more info please read the FAQ
I just wanted to know the order of the movies
00,02a->pony ep->b->pony ep
00,02intermission before b
WMCs are considered C movies
00,02and are never shown again
which movies will be shown today?
Movies so bad they cant show it again
keep in mind we have a six month encore limit to movies
rifftraxes
and 4 week limit to pony eps
D:!
AAAAAAAAA
kaboom
00,02please hold
00,02dont explode
drop dat thrust?
00,02Kurra, cant, i need it
lets do the time warp again
fffffs.
00,02need a lot more than i'm getting
00,02this thing was originaly intended for the mun
"was?"
what's the red bars climbing on the side?
I like moons
00,02never designed for escape velocity
00,02and has no sas
who want chocolate dipped funnel cakes? and ecto cooler. the recipe for ecto cooler that is.
i'll take the funnel cakes :9
You guys are making me so hungry I'm going to get something to eat
those poor kerbils in Space. They're lost up there.
00,02accidentally perfect
HAI GUURLZZ

KERBALS IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCEEEE
um
what is this music
hoshoot
SPAAAAAAAAAACCCEEE!
There is no Euro movie night?

It's familiar

00,02same playlist
"We're gettin' close to gimbal lock Jim!"
"I KNOW ABOUT THE damn gimbal lock!"
oooh Test pony
Ffffs, should have Apollo 13 for a Bronystate movie again.
Sounded very videogamish
look at those DeLorean wheels... X3
we should have from up on poppy hill for a bronystate movie, they sort of owe us :P
00,02there is simply not neough power in most of my rockets
00,02wait
00,02i got it!
What is this game about? :I
space travel
Dragonmatte - SPAAAAAAAACE
00,02rockets
...
SPAAAAAAAAAAACE!
Dad, are you in space?
I wub you alll. in a Fillydelphia sort of way
http://derpibooru.org/47296?scope=scped9b5fc9f32dff8b92abeb932f69f2254934af8de
the engines are holding Phase4. but are you in Phase5 yet of your 10 phase plan?
Dem austronauts xD
astronauts*
Phase4, I read that the ideal composition of a rocket is by mass: 93% fuel, about 6% structure, and 1% astronauts and cargo and things you want to fly up.
00,02that number seems high
indeed - just 1% cargo?
indeed.
00,02surely it should be 0.2% cargo
in the not too distant future next sunday AD
perhaps it changed since the 1990s
Some boston would be nice. More than a feeling
i r back. =|
Good morning! How is everypony today? :)
Mornin' Fisheh_Fish
hai Fisheh_Fish
00,02lagging so hard
Oh I know this song. What is this one Phase4?
the song
Wow. okay. I am just repeating myself now
00,02"For The New Lunar Republic (Fan Music) "
morning everypony ;)
teh dumb is strong with me today
Mornin cratorkid|Toga :)
Thanks Phase4
morning cratorkid|Toga
Mornin everypony
well good morning cratorkid|Toga
morning Fisheh_Fish and Barbetos and thelonepony :)
whats this bein streamed?
looks fun
hmm never heard of it ;)
00,02RAGE
00,02launched the wrong way
MirrorImage: So basically its a game either where you can make a space shuttle. ect or some kind of destructive missle.
intentionally or not, yes
more often not
i need this game :D
00,02well lets see if my quick math was right
there's a free demo, or i think the "Minecraft" version of it is about $15
Math? In rocket science? Who knew?
and by "Minecraft," I'm referring to the development cycle
Back
generally you make a missile rather than a rocket
Phase4: Yay! Rocket science!
So...I guess you could circle for months or years until the shuttle and the moon cross at the same time?
00,02nuuuuuu! i missed it
/me is afk because of home renovation
00,02oh, i know what i did wrong *derp*
whut?
Nyst: What about the astronouts?
/me loks for the release date for Windows 8
*astronauts
is that debree going to collide?
Emil: I think that currently they carry infinite oxygen and food. Also they're called kerbanauts here :)
Hey everypony. If you're someone I know, you probably remember DJVinylScratch101.
00,02MirrorImage, nope
Nyst: Oh, Isee.
hello everypony. is Phase4 still playing kerbal?
Phase4: Also, had you gotten the Orbital Friendship Cannon in orbit?
00,02our poor kerbinaut would eventually colide with kerbin
00,02but meh
I think part of the fun is that it's realistic, but not hyperrealistic.
Dovah: Yep
00,02Emil, i can launch them easy
00,02but hav been clearing my save files due to lag
Phase4: Oh, so no cannon?
so Phase4 whats you goal here?
wait, who is broadcasting?
00,02VioletLynnScraton, i am
phase4 is
ok
00,02then turn around and go backward
Ooh, your debris almost crashed into the sun there!
i see
This music.
Wonderbolts vs Shadowbolts?
wonderbolts win
00,02i want to do this cause it would cause the capsule to hit kerbin with a velocity of over 20KM/s
nuff said
that new lunar republic remix
00,02and i want to see the G-force number from doing that
Phase4: have you ever done a counter-kerbin project?
suprise!
00,02Nyst,
00,02?
Mishia is back!
Yaay!
Who is that oc thats playing games?
hey Mishia
Hey Phase4 could you put on some Blue Danube. AKA that OTHER song from 2001: a space odyssey. da da da da da bum bum bum bum.
phase4
Mishia: Take a guess.
Mishia: phase's
hai Mishia
Phase4: it's where you launch a rocket to have the exact same orbit and speed as Kerbin, but on the other side so it's always behind the sun.
Nyst: That gotta be hard.
00,02it would be
00,02Nyst, nope, dont plan to
you know
00,02it would be just a smidge hard
cool
somtimes i wonder what it would be like without ponies?
;_;
00,02Mishia, terrible
Without My little pony
Mishia: What would be?
hey Phase4 were can I get your desktop poni
Phase4: everything is at first. A lot of the appeal of the game is 'could I do this? let's try and find out'.
Then Lauren Foust would never be offered the show
00,02Nyst, which is what i was doing :P
Mishia, remmeber 2009? D:
/me turns depression into a trabable currency
00,02but the rocket i need is a smidge outside my capabilities
Kurra: I rember 2000-2009. Great shows happened.
but they were all without pony.
;__;
i personally like seing the Kerbals die with a grin on their face
so that's what the world would be like
KND EENE, Fosters,
Emil: xD
so gonna play free kerbal version when I get back :>
GarrettBrony: I loved Knd :3
Mishia Lauren Faust worked on it
Phase4: I'll be honest. The size that rocket would have to be to carry enough fuel makes me very excited.
Anyone watched the orginal Ben 10?
I did
Mishia: Yeah
:) my frist action show
Loved it to tears
Emil: maybe im too used to Sumica streaming this game XD
Mishia it had Tara FREAKING Strong as Ben
Powerpuff Girls FTW.
indeed
GarrettBrony: Mhmmm.
did you watch the ones they made ofter it Mishia?
Mishia: and now its starting to go to crap? i havnt seen it in a long time
00,02Nyst, i need to reach about 3KM/s at 140KM above kerbin, this puts me into escape velocity and i enter a high orbit around the sun
dat BaconMane
Craig McCracken ftw. (Lauren Faust's Husband)
00,02Nyst, when i reach apoapsis, i'm going at ~6KM/s
Mishia: Im pretty disappointed that there making a hwole new series, and changing the animation
00,02so i need a rocket with a delta-v of 12KM/s in that orbit
Dovah: well i watched the frist episode of "Oniverse". However, it gets back into somthing way better then what they fell into
00,02plus a bit more to do correction burns, make sure i actually hit kerbin
KM/s?
GarrettBrony: Yes
Emil: Cartoon Network
0,5ya
00,02Emil, no friction in space, so piloting rockets is all about their momentum
Ben 10
Mishia: huh, i may check it out then
GarrettBrony: I watch boomerang 70% of the time :)
Dovah: the frist episode of Omiverse is on youtube. not great, but warrents a watch
so do i
Phase4: So 4 kilometers per hour is much more than on Earth?
Phase4: *seconds
Mishia: hey I gave mlp a try i can give omniverse a try too
mhhm
00,02Emil, its all relitive
GarrettBrony: Mainly ponies
same here
Phase4: Mhm.
00,02Emil, if i were trying to get to the mun, 4KM/s is insane
The first time you're in space it's really weird. Even when you know the rocket is going in a different direction then it's facing, it's hard to tell -where- it's going with no reference points.
00,02but if i were trying to leave the solar system thats tiny
GarrettBrony: Ikr
Phase4: I see.
GarrettBrony: Gaming and bronystate has pretty much kept me from TV
00,02Nyst, yeah, once you learn the navball though its much easier

Madotsuki pie
she/male?
yes
There is a theory that madotsuki
is a trans?
YeS
CrimsonPhoenix: some think she's a shemale and the game has obscure clues about it
oh
what are those clues?
Thats why she doesnt want to leave her room
I say it's all weird shit
Period
because you gotta think it is her dream
I like the rape theory better
maybe both?
oh and have you guys known about Irisu Syndrome?
Theres a theory that says that playin NASU is causing her nightmares :p

TheKatPony: watch ghost get trolled! hes a racist, texan, anti-sematic, left winged policition guy that does a pod-radio show every friday
Season finale
and for 1 hour every week he does a segment called internet grafiti where he gets trolled for 30 minutes to an hour
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
this is what we should do with buffering: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m359wg32kp1qgcz3so1_500.gif

trollghost: just search on youtube for Ghost's last show,and you will see him saying goodbye and thanking everyone that has listen to him for the last years...
hi i just heard about this website

Hi i!
Hey i, and welcome :)
I actually got to troll him once. It was great.

Feasttalon MLP?
MadSurge: :D and space santa

trollghost, the small scar is from the parchment
trollghost: but he burns her hair
Sergio_Scriptor: and forklift assassination attempts :D
and why didnt doctor whooves have anything to say about her travelling in time?
Trollghost cause she survived a piano falling in her head
While she was in a wheel chair
MadSurge: and Rails ...:)
cachi01|mobile: the paino was made of foam obv
YES
or it was made of darkmatter
Twilight takes a lot of damage XD

Okay. Is there a place you recommend downloading it from? Because frankly, I don't know how to get it ._.
Quick man! Cling tenaciously to my buttocks!!

VioletLynnScraton: You can't stream unless you are a mod so no.

The episodes were Stare master and Hearth's Warming Eve
Hey Lil_B!
Over the hedge <3
VioletLynnScraton: Theres no way to stream otherwise and becoming a mod is hard work and as of now not needed

OVER THE HEDGE!!!!!!
and hi MLP_Brovakiin and Wolfblood92 :) I'm fine, and hello Ponies47

If you feel like a sucker ITS BECAUSE YOU ARE A SUCKER
No idea lol ^^
VioletLynnScraton: you have to overthrow a mod and take his place
:O
bs
:L
That sounds right LOL
VioletLynnScraton: when mods are necessary,they publish in the homepage,and then you can try run to be a mod n:)
I have no idea how that quote sounds in english
I only really talked about this weekend's movies/episodes
ok, thank you sergio
VioletLynnScraton: no problem :)
In spanish its si te sientes como un gusano es porque eres un gusano lol
Sergio_Scriptor: stuck in my head ever since we watched that movie =)
Anyways, i'll be right back
Just so you guys know until the newsletter issue is fixed, the temp way of doing the lotto is that you'll need to be here in the chat. During intermission, they'll open a new lotto room. You go there and they just pick a random person in the chat to pick each movie and pony ep.
Tassadork: hehe :P

Twilight would be pleased
It started
sagas that's where I'm going.
Roman one I think.
Twilight Sparkle*
why do the encyclopedias not have a hardback
Should I start the railings?
Wikipedia before wikipedia!
sagas: Ever been here for when Shizuka's run Rifftrax? These are the same guys. This is what they did before Rifftrax
MST3K is a vaguely old show, but it's a classic, and you should familiarize yourself with it, it's a cultural touchstone.
Star_Shadow: space mutiny
why do the encyclopedias not have a hardback
yay complaining
what is dis fragel rock
Oh they are in rome at the time
What the fraggel?
This scene is sort of sexual
LOL this is so weird...
And they went on to do Rifftrax

Twilight Sparkle would be pleased....with so many books!
I like fruit
JESmith71: Ive seen the Rifftrax here, but never seen this
this sexual is sort of scene
PONYS, you related to PONY?
FRUIT IS GOOD
what the hay i´m watching?
ive seen enough BSDM to see where this is going
Pale Face got the right idea

This is what Rifftrax was when it was good.
http://mst3konline.blogspot.com/
AIHOP
I take it back D-War is only watchable with Rifftrax
I like BDSM enough to know where this is going
Okay, this is going to be good.
Wtf is this PONYS?
she broke a nail, oh the horror!
Mutton
lol PONY and PONYS
Feasttalon: already did that joke
IS IT SAFE?
sagas: Well basically this is the same thing as Rifftrax, except the guys are on camera doing skits before and during breaks in the movie
mutton is yum :D
i dont know
I said like
The horror! The horror!

STARING
Huzzah! The smiles have been tripled!

oum... is it bad that i have never heard of MST3K?
AMAZINGLY IDIOTIC PRODUCTIONS
I can smell the low budget
LOL
Eli YES
Oh, so no need for pony overlay.
:(
Great CGI
This is just....
Silverscreen you will be missed
that all?
Dken2021: i hate the smell of low budget movies in the morning
asd
Reb Brown!
OMG the effects
Eli nothing wrong with not hearing of it
Eli Well, it's a classic, but I must admit it might be before a lot of people's here' times
oh THE CREDITS! THEY COME OUT OF THE SCREEN!
The Imbd rating is 1.9
all scenes in this movie are either stolen or made in an abandoned box factory. in one shot.
3 muscicians?
Dark92Enigma: it's just like 3D :o
/me is the only PONY
low budget at least its not a chick flick
1...2....3......GET ON WITH IT!
ok im just going to the hub on my tv and watch it
galactica
Get on with it!
Battlestar Gallactica?
How much longer?
Isn't that plot part of the Star Trek EU?
Seriously, this is like BronyState: The Movie.
Red Dwarf?
mitamaking: CORRECT!
mitamaking no, Space Mutiny
Is this the original galactica?
XD
STAR WARS
Canadian_Brony: Everybody's dead, Dave.
Oh no
Mutiny
Eli: This is a show done by the guys who went on to do Rifftrax. It's the same thing execpt the guys are on camera
No it's Gattaca
uh oh
mitamaking: They're ripping off Battlestar Galactics
It's a mutiny... IN SPACE :O
yup galactica orinal
you are right emerald
Dark92Enigma: Which was alreay a Star Wars rip off
This reminds me of Logan's Run
I hate peope who talk in the cinema
JESmith71: ...Rifftrax?
Actually this movie was so cheap they ripped off Galactia footage instead of shooting their own stuff
jammerKunk Look on the bright side! Rimmer's dea-ooohhhh, he's a hologram.
mitamaking, BSG wasn't a Star Wars ripoff.
StinkomanFan: No Spoiling the movie, man
I just realised I'm jammerKunk.
UGHHH IVE SEEN BACK TO THE FUCHER
That's better.
PACO RABANI.

/me Battlestar Galactica, this is Space Mutiny........ripoff has landed successfully
11,01Hi Shizuka. Comcast derp again?
Eli: It's something Shizuka shows here sometimes where these three guys make fun of modern movies. This is a show they did before that where they made fun of bad low budget films
Dat technology
What's with the lack of clothes?
Nittany_Discord "Tention"
...How come men are never in the skimpy suits in these stupid things?
Oh here we go :P
13this morning ja
1,11Yep. All Space battle footage is taken from Battlestar Galactica.
ohia Shizuka
Hey Shizuka!
Lack of clother represents superiority
Feasttalon it makes things.... tolerable
JESmith71: They were not all bay, Prince of Space is amazing
they're doing worse comentary than me and my friends while watching movies...
Feasttalon: That's 70's/80's sci-fi.
No really, this is just like BronyState: The Movie.
in the future, all sexy women will wear one piece swimsuits?
Dken2021 Not for me, I like guys and none of them are cute.
well, most women.... good enough!
Not the cylons
Kammerjunk this is Bronystate: The Movie

when I am your emperor, all women's military uniforms will look like this. support me?
too much bufferin
11,01Honestly, I think if someone with enough money set up an ISP with better uptime, similar speeds, and cheaper prices, they could really compete with Comcast in your area.
Silverscreen: (sarcasm)
sup
wait, those ships sorta look battlestar galactica-ish
Kammerjunk IKR? The movie does it for us!
DaringDerpy, why not naked?
and no sueing was done oh cylons i knew it more galactica footage
They're attacking us with a buffer beam!
Yay!
the only good thing about this movie is the space scenes,AND THOSE ARE STOLEN
DaringDerpy Troia's already beat you to that
13guess it's mips today

Man I haven't seen an MST3K episode in a while

ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh
Shizuka You'll be turned into rainbows, everybody will be so happy :D
Mmmm brb.
DaringDerpy, as MMORPG's prove, tinier armor, more defence; Thus naked, indestructible!
Oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god!

Kawaii_icybeauti we were watching MST3K, but then we had a crash

HUZZAH!

Did they get out of the space battle
Surrise buttsecks

Ponies47: Can we still panic if we want to?
oh hey. Its this movie again
Aww.....I missed the pisssed flutterhsy spam
lag!!!!!
"I'll get the manager..."
Pony: That deserves to be a law of physics, really. Amount of defence is inversely proportionate to amount of skin covered by clothing.
swainize: Ponies are after this is over
buffering when will it end
apparently the laser was set to stun
Petrified_Discord: If you wanna fine :P
emerald: try refreshing
emerald: I don't know, I just don't know
BOOM
kaboom
DaringDerpy, not only that, but every movie has shown a perfect example of enemies hitting ONLZ the armored part, thus we can conclude, nakedness will provide us with inavoidable Stormtrooper effect.
Ponies47: Thank you. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Dken2021: "hello we come in peace.Shoot to kill"
Boom
Lol
/me Attention Shizuka, this is D-92-E....refreshing process has been successful

Shizuka do you have a back-up back-up?
MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPS! (Raises hoof)
Kammerjunk: male*

Oh right, it's euro movie night.

The budget of this movie is too high to be streamed

I need to stop digging into the bronystate moderators' history. I find out more online...
Pony: the law of cheap movie narration will be illegal in my empire. period.
Huzzah! The buffering has been doubled!

13we have many backups
13they all suck
11,01And be patient. We'll have MLP after this movie swainize
better than no back-up

Shizuka: :D
Hello LimeV

Alright. Let's hope this can be blamed on mips and not Comcast
next
Haaa

DaringDerpy, you cannot ban TVtropes, Darwin's law will take it's place after that.
Not even loading
13and nope again
horrraaaaaahhhhhh
13so this is comcast
I have player, no movie
Well it's mips because I'm using Chunghua Telecom and it's not working for me
Guess stream doesn't want to be streamed today.
stream down... must... not.... drift back to Darksiders 2....hrrrrggggg
/me Attention Shizuka, refreshing process failed miserably
Minecraft then?
Marvellous Technology
no stream. Anypony up for some Whose Line?
Call me crazy, but I think the stream is disagreeing with the movie choice :P
DaringDerpy, I will prove the probability of this theory by running naked through Nort Korea.
lol Canadian_Brony
I was late in logging out of PSO2. Now I regret logging out now
Everypony don't panic, just go back to watching anime and playing Minecraft
welcome to the 21st century. worldwide cybernet technology
Canadian_Brony: You are in a porno, go
13the stupid cable modem locked on to the bad upstream channel again
Canadian_Brony: Remember that game I came up with?
I like big plots and I cannot lie?
brb
ehmagawd, the boobies!
an excellent idea, Pony. please make us a video ^^
mitamaking why the fuck am I in a porno? I'm 15!
Shizuka, could this be fixed by replacing your modem?
Canadian_Brony: So you are not playing Whose Line
I just usually turn off my modem/router and wait a minute.
Kawaii_icybeauti no, sorry
mitamaking finding a good one
http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
dammit
Canadian_Brony 15 and in a porno? Lucky you
11,01I would do a modem reset right now.
13it could be fixed by the breakup of at&t not causing cable companies to escape the common carrier distinction and cities giving single cable companies exclusive rights to operate in a given area
Canadian_Brony: Not sure which rule I broke
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdl23H_Y9Nk&feature=g-vrec
DaringDerpy, on a second thought, since we are talking about an Empire here, don't mind if I use slave raper for this. It's SCIENCE after all
cable means if a few of your neighbors cause heavy traffic, you have no chance to get a better connection
whose line was my fave show as a child.
Hah, I don't even have the opportunity to use AT&T.
Franchise laws should be struck down.
13resetting
There! Now you have a full ep to watch
At&t was already broken up once and now you want to do it again?
Can we do the irish drinking song?
Yar har
Fiddle dee
The whole point of breaking up Ma Bell was to stop a monopoly. The fact that it resulted in regional monopolies is apalling.
LOL LIMEWIRE!
Pony: not sure if I heard about this before. and...13yo watch this stream with their parents. keep it civilized ^^
Do what you want cause a brony is free
I want some bell peppers and beef
YOU ARE A.BRONY
11,01Sad fact is: there are some markets where only a monopoly can exist.
hi evs
1,11Well, I'm going to continue reading the webcomic until stream's back up.
Stream, why you didn't tell us about it?
Like our goverment?
back owo
cachi01|mobile: Yarr harr, fiddle dee dee?
cachi01|mobile: Keen observation
DaringDerpy, oh you must be new here ^^' sorry, I don't think we have been properly introduced yet... I'll leave that for later
11,01Example could be power companies.
Ima just post Whose Line
I'm going to watch Cowboy Bebop until it's fixed, laters
so be it
im in a apartment
It's like economics class all over again... :P

11,01They did back when I lived in PA.
Kony 2012!! KONY 2012!!!!!
the what now?
Nittany_Discord, that's the real good thing about alternative energy. If the power company is treating their customers unfairly, the sun itself is a good alternative... at least it will be.
dayum people are docuhes today
Kawaii_icybeauti: this might work on a donkey. not on me. :[

Oh no!

/me KHAN: Oh, I've done far worse than give you no cuts. I've hurt you. And I wish to go on hurting you. *the camera zooms on NC looking quite scared* I shall leave you as this movie left me, left all audiences. Marooned in the center of a dead screening. *whispering* Bored out of your mind! Bored out of your mind!
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
Aww, thanks anyway, Shizu.
No Shizuka :'(
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!

It's alright, Shizuka, you tried :)

13sorry
lol Dark92Enigma
sadface
Yeah you gave it your best -hugs Shizuka
13if you can sue comcast out of existence, please do
11,01Blame your local Comcast.
we still love you for what you do :D
It's Ok, Shizuka we still love you
have some Whose Line! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkfu5bWIlc&feature=related
13and sure enough the idiot modem locked on to the fail upstream channel again
So... what happens now?
Well thanks for streaming Shizuka :'(
It's ok Shizuka. All is forgiven :)
(ogod, raw Broccoli is horrible)
11,01Shizuka: Have your parents ever complained to Comcast about their service issues?
And back
13yep
http://www.playlist.com/g/#/home/a/r_03/JkspbAzf1PCqzU29FAGF/
/me hugs Shizuka
I think a large stick beating is in order, Shizu.
i just had time warner cable installed, i hope its better than comcast
Shizuka, in some markets, Comcast is forced compete with other local businesses. I should know. They keep sending me letters begging me to drop my ISP and return to them.
13we get a "well have you tried not having a router in the middle? everything is perfect for us!"
switch provider?
/me throws broccoli at Comcast
11,01Verizon did that to me.
Isn't that the guy from Two and a half men, herb?
11,01I left their ass.
13red_ony: there is no other provider, it's comcast or dialup
Just got back... Stream Down??
Shizuka: oO
13and actually since we killed our landline, it's comcast or bust
Sundaysmile ya sadly
Yep
Sundaysmile: yeah :'(
ah crud
Dialup STILL exists?
11,01And that's the problem with regional monopolies.
13welcome to the world of municipal monopolies
/me gives a muffin to Shizuka. "You've done your best and people are jack-flanks."
13no other cable company is allowed to operate in my city
That's murica for you
Time Warner is the only option for me
Pony some areas are kinda too far for ISPs to set up
/me remeber when i had to choose Satalitte or Dialup
My lords... I MUST BE FROM THE FUTURE!
Could be worse guys... coulda happened during S3 of MLP
11,01Comcast has no-one to compete with, so they can be shitty and get away with it because it's either shitty Twin Cities Comcast or nothing.
how can that be legal..here I douzens of providers to chose from
Oh my God, that would be bad
Sundaysmile: True...-knocks n wood-
Sundaysmile I don't wanna think about it
Sundaysmile: that would suck :'(
13just about is
Sundaysmile: You have apoint. But then all of us could tune into the Hub on our TV's. That is if we have the Hub. I do.
EVERYPONY! KNOCK ON WOOD. NAO!
Here's the video i got the joke from : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smvaADKsdzs
so anybody else going to stream something or should i change back to drawing ponies? :)
13of the cable providers in the country, they all agree to not actually compete with each other
Ponies47 I don't have the hub, this is like my ONLY source for new ep airings
13it's collusion, not full on monopoly, which lets them skirt around antitrust
I wish I had Kansas City's Google internet
11,01It wasn't that way in State College. I'm not sure if it's that way in Rock Hill.
I swear, if I had the files and the knowhow (and the time), _I_ could stream this thing.
Sundaysmile: Well this wouldn't happen during an episode premiere because Sumica streams those
13if they were common carriers, we wouldn't have this problem, but they squirmed out of that category when ma bell broke up
Shizuka, I thought that was illegal
plan B?
Plan B.
We need to stream the mods playing monopoly
Plan B is DANCE PARTY!
DaringDerpy: Post youtube. Lots of it.
...Or Mario Party
This is illegal you know
StinkomanFan: Haha, yes
Sonofabitch internet/
click on my playlist....Epic dance party
They both shatter friendships just as well :)
Can another mod take over for Shizuka if this a problem?
cachi01|mobile: I mean't collision of companies who agree not to compete
13trying to see if we have anyone
My local Comcast chapter tried to fight the establishment of EPB-Fi like crazy. They lost the court battle
That's what were waiting for
StinkomanFan: I call iron
Ain't nittany on?

I'm not too effected, but I've seen people in toliets aroudn here.
We need more people able to stream for BS, don't wan't anything like this to happen when S3 starts
So how long have we been buffering? I was out.
Hello s[rinkle
Lets stream season 2 premiere
evrything here is well..except for inflation eating my savings slowly but surely :/
Sprinkle*
tSparx, we died...
tSparx quite a while
The latin premiere!
tSparx: A while ^_^
We should have like backup mods. Not mods, but regulars that can stream.
Oh my
So what we gonna do now
Pony: We are fine with the current amount,
I think we already have enough streamers as is
11,01Let me see how fast these movies download.
Pony: It's kinda pointless to get even more mods
Or a backup just for when Shizuka streams and she has unexpected Comcast problems
time for some gamecube :P
www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Uu0dyH9CU A WADDLE DEE :O
Oh, poor Shiz :/
Gamecube ftw
13we have plenty of streamers, just not many awake at the moment
Shizuka: :D

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Rainbow Dash Plushie Pops Up on Amazon
[I always have a hard time remembering peoples' genders on the Internet, so if I call you a she and I'm wrong gently correct me (if you care)]
Nittany_Discord: If the movies take too long to download, you can still take over and show the episodes at least if you can't get the movies in time?
is there a stream?
RD PLUSIE!!
^^
.
killerpony7733, I appreciate your opinnion, but I do still sort of disagree. I don't see any problem having more suitable streamers, which is the best defence I have for my argument. Nevertheless, I agree the mods are doing pretty damn good jobs, and most of the times there seem to be enough people handling the job.
MaxTheBrony Nittany_Discord setting up, just need to download the movie
Oh no, streaming problems? :(
o.o A plushie that actually looks good.
i want to watch a show
This is actually the vid that I kept asking you guys to find for me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD2KbBQXHk4&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=37&feature=plpp_video

MadSurge: Shizuka had unexpected Comcast problems
13not really unexpected
I'm checking WarezBB for MST3K Space Mutiny
13i don't expect service beyond five minutes of internet per hour anymore
I can offer you this: http://www.synchtube.com/r/EvoKaer#
Shizuka: that's awful!
13thus far in august i believe we've had 50% uptime
13we won't get refunded
Pony: The case is more theres no NEED for more as of now. Everyday has someone streaming, And in some way it should keep like that as it's easier to manage and most streamers/mods won't have to wait for long
Hello peeps
anyways, I'll be watching freakazod while nitt's back

/me remembers watching MST3K on synchtube.
13we pay $75 a month for it
killerpony7733, there is always space for a back up plan.
Shizuka: I'd honestly rather not have internet at all (a horrible fate in itself)
13for 12/4
Shizuka: If that happened to me I'd expect a refund..or sue.. :/
Shizuka 75 for what?
13of which we're getting half uptime
Only two entries on WarezBB for Space Mutiny. Both dead
11,01Looking at almost an hour until the A movie is done.
:(
Pony: Sure maybe they could plan for unexpected events a bit more beforehand avoiding this. But yeah

13movies are Space Mutiny MST3k and Independence Day Rifftrax
20€ (or ~$30) I get 100/10M internet, for the past year, not a single noticable intteruption in service.

Herro Scoot-Scootaloo!
00,03Yep, comcast gas always been a jerk to us x_x
00,03has*
Im feeling good :D , how about you Golakka
heya Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Hallo Scoot-Scootaloo
Been better
How come?
Comcast sells gas now?!
Lol
Yep lol
Hello BronyState. Is there anything streaming this Afternoon
00,03Anyways, what say we pass the time while these kids get it sorted out?
Scoot-Scootaloo I've been doing that with "WHose Lne
Hello, Riders, it appears that there are troubles.
Hello Riders
Heya Riders :)
*Whose Line
Lost my internet again, Girl troubles, the list goes on :D
Technical difficulties
hey Riders
Riders We're trying to get MS3K, ID4 with Rifftrax, and some MLP eps in between on stream
Yeah
Hi riders :) theres a problem with th stream
Scoot-Scootaloo, what do you suppose we do?
Riders: But we're having some problems
hai Riders, was a stream up, but shizu's having problems, so nitt's backup in a few minutes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAJXf8gCZg&feature=relmfu
00,03Hmmm....
Riders: MMMystery and Sisterhooves the MLP eps, I believe
Scoot-Scootaloo: Maybe you could take over and open Vinyl up for requests?
What streamed yesterday?
00,03I would take over, only if I can :S
Riders: This is the European rerun of last night's stream
Riders I think a MST3K and a Rifftrax episode
Riders: Er, y'know, for our European friends, where it's the late afternoon
You know? I never really thought of Comcast being a jerk to me, even when I was using them. Even though I saw all the hate that was being sent their way. Just the whole forging RST packets to slow down my torrents, which they stopped after getting caught.
/early evening
tSparx: almost 9 pm, exactly
Still morning here
Gonna play some World of tanks for a tad
MadSurge: Well, it's not like all of Europe's at 9pm haha

Wer hier ist Berliner? [Don't make fun of me for bad grammar, I don't speak Deutsch]
1,11The comic ended mid-2007 when the story arc was completed.
Hey Pikachu
1,11er, mid-2011 I mean

HE ATE ALL THE PENCILS
So with the movie night delayed, maybe that means I'll get to catch the end of ID4 after all.
Pikachu, there's nothing playing ATM
Shizuka: CROMARTIE HIGH SCHOOL?! <3
13he... ate... my... pencil... HE ATE IT UP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1d92s77RiQ&feature=relmfu

I always go out for a bit around 5, come back at 7 everynight
tSparx, don't worry, I don't speak Deutsch either
tSparx : oh
Silverscreen, Why are you bringing it up if it ended?
Good thing, since I missed the end of ID4 because my internet derped.
tSparx, but you live in Berlin?
dat pencil, lol
Well, I guess I'll be taking that shower that I was planning on saving for after Space Mutiny
I always had a bad feeling about .swfs
im eating a hambuger :D
How dabuq do you eat all those pencils
Pony Haha, good thing Germans love to learn English :P And no, St. Louis, just curious about the Deutschers in the audience
I need to go to sleep and wake up in 5 hours, see you guys next week.
Good for you ^^
So when Nittany comes back, we'll start where we left off right?
1,11Because it's an interesting story with some decent art (not at first, mind you, but it got pretty good)
CloverMuffins: this one isn't a screamer :)
why can't I hold all those pencils :d

tSparx, D'aww I got my hopes up for nothing, there's also Lil_B and Invi here often.
1,11It does kinda teeter between Safe and Not Safe material, but overall it's pretty much a PG-13 rating.
Ok, if you excuse me, i'll be busy getting a hoof rub
so, how is everypony doing? I see a lot of new faces here :)
I missed you guys <3
Shizuka: Freddie Mercury doesn't give a FUCK :D

CloverMuffins then click on my youtube links when I post them.
/me Is from the Midwest USA (Wisconsin to be exact :P)
1,11Another webcomic I'm reading is called Dan and Mab's furry adventures. It's much less dramatic, but it's a lot of fun and interesting art. Unlike Concession, the comic's still going right now. which reminds me, gotta see if they updated today...
alrighty then :)
UBOA!!!!!!!
yay
tSparx, but, ja, ich bin ein Berliner.

MadSurge: why'
MadSurge My Little Gamer? Is that a new thing on CoD?

Colt of Duty is a ripoff of Stallionfield
Not trying to get mad here, but can someone tell me what/if those two letters stand for instead of just telling me it's awesome?
DWEERRSHSJ
/me Bangs his head to the beat of the song he is listening to
CloverMuffins: because he keeps repeating "MLG this, MLG that" :D
yes @ Major
Colt of Duty....
tSparx: ib is the entire name of the game. It's a jrpg classic graphic styled horror game
tSparx the name of your character is Ib
TheKatPony: Lawl.

Major: bug Sumica about that
Battlefoal 3
Ib is a 9 years old girl
oh look. I still have Bronystate tab open
Oh shes 9?
I didn't think Ib looked all that fun, but it is pretty popular and free
Yes
CloverMuffins: stay for the company, please :)
Mmmm ok
Vivix: cachi01|mobile Thanks. Sorry, haha, I was like, "I'll probably recognize it if you tell me what it stands for, don't make me run my already taxed browser any harder " :P
Foalout?

Ponies47, yes, but you're not alone.
CloverMuffins: I'm not good with RTS anyway :D
Ponies47 I haven't either.
Ponies47: Maybe...
Ponies47 i havent either
Ponies47: Yes. I wouldn't call myself a Whovian, but it's a touchstone, it's worth knowing a bit about it, and (and) you might like it, maybe a lot. I like it a little :)
Ponies47 i've only seen the first episode
so, is there a stream?
MadSurge: well I, on the other hand, had been playing Starcraft since 1998 ;) still suck at it xD but still love it

misfit elf
Oh no the fuzz!
hey

trollghost: basically, they're sitting through the movie, and telling the jokes to make it FUNNY!
Railing death incoming.
LOL
I am so lost XD
Dem railings!
True Capatalist radio trolls amuse me
What's there to understand? It's MUTINY!
Hahahahhhehhehehehehahahahhahah
Keep climbing on the chuckie Cheese playground.
Bronysith I would like to, but my current computer doesn't play Steam games.
this movie's soundtrack is quite worthy of having three composers
Dken2021: I actually just kinda started looking at the stream. well, at the point where I asked 'what are we watching' and it was this movie already, so did not see any skits :p
:\
fffs I KNOW WHAT RIFFTRAX ARE, i want to know what the MOVIE is, and where there was also a clip from MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE
i wonder if rifftrax did the room?
VioletLynnScraton: is ghost on air again?

Canadian_Brony: get a new computer then, a gaming pc to be exact

hey sonicrainboomer259
THE RAILINGS......THEY DID NOTHING
ouchie
starburst
RAILING DEATH
Not a smart move.
worst "fall" ever
railings there, yet they did nothing
@DaringDerpy I'm not Sure
How is he bleeding from the mouth?
Guess you could say they needed more railings.
my plot bleats lie a sheep
:3
Suddenly Willy Wonka's garden.
trollghost the movie is Space Mutiny. MST3K puts a short skit in every once in a while around commercial breaks.
ah ok
trollghost: The movie is a ripoff of Battlestar Galactica. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MAKING FUN OF IT
"Listen Lady"
I love you even though we barely know each other.
haha
So much emotion
hes dead. he died
Nittany_Discord: how many times has this happend to you? http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/357e8r/

Every other commercial break has a skit with Mike and the Robots.
Dr. Gary Stu.
Not clicking the link, I crashed last time -_-
Suddenly, dance club.

Suddenly Sexy Scene = SSS

dem hips
1,11...why's she dressed as Princess Lana from Captain N?
THAT PREDICTION WAS RIGHT!
Silverscreen: it was the style back then
1,11I didn't realize it was a Costume Club.
It's totally the 80s Hoolahoops were big that time.
The synth Bass is too much
trollghost: Sorry :(
Silverscreen bad screenwriting?

1,11...

those are some pretty short skirts
Silverscreen: just the style
PONY2, somewhat.
Dayum.

^
You know, for kids?
This is even worse than the zion scene
I'm now freaked out....due to this video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jsywkLaY&feature=related
This music reminds me of the music from Shadowrun SNES.
Man, the night clubs I go to are so boring. No Hulahoops or anything
who said this movie's for kids?
Silverscreen: If you thought White animated people was lame......try this <----
this will be the future if we don't kill obama

I prefer TF2 and Borderlands over CoD and Halo.
I sure do!
I was moving in to my dorm room in college, when I decided to get a cart to help me carry my stuff. When I grabbed one, I was shocked to see a picture of Rainbow Dash on it! When I went to check the other carts they had the other mane 5 on them, even Spike. Today's been a pretty good day, not that I know there are bronies at my college.:)
<.<
MST3K?
Suddenly the group with bad hair are approaching.

hello Rainbow_Glasses
Lol how is this possible.
Never mind.
hey Rainbow_Glasses
Zawan: the moon is flashing straight in my face >_>
A WOMAN?
I think I know why Universal Law forbids them from landing thier ship. The producers don't have footage of the Galactica landing on a planet. So the real evil that Calgon is committing is forcing the SFX team to actually do some decent SFX.
wat happened CCCP ?
ughhhhhhhhh
hai Rainbow_Glasses
Hi Rainbow_Glasses!!!!! :D:D:D:D how are you *hugs*
he swallowed a woman
Stealthy!
