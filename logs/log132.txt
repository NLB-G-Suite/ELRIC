2,14 whoops.
twilight got saved by applejack

Rainbow Dash was always awful.

Pinkie Pie loves danger
Rainbowdash is best pony
wtf this stupid wii add wont leave
Applelight YES!
Silver; Yeah, I dislike RD when she'd being a bitch (same as in Ep.13 for that matter)
2,14 because I felt like she didn't deserve all that praise...after the way she acted
Foals, Pinkie is obviously the best pony.
*she's
dem moans....
Duh.
Luna is best pony
SECRET BUTT FUN
Fluttersparkle = what I see as one of the more likely pairings. Since Twilight would be so aware of Fluttershy's sensitivities. But anyways
Everypony is best pony
My little landslide: bumping is fun
Rarity is the best pony.
DAT INNOCENCE
BITCH
That's a funny way to spell "Luna" Pinkamina
Eh. Give her moar screen time.
Who here just joined from Thunder Bay?
Luna is furniture
Derpy is the best.
I CANT HEAR YOU!
rarity = best pony,she has giant hats and a magic scarf
not even a character
Rarity is best shmallow
Hey, wheres Twilights bag?
Im the Queen of England
Derpy is best at being worst.
0give her time.....
ok so does rainbow need anything from this guy?
SCOOTALOO
Lesbian Carwash is too angry right now
rubbah chickens are awesome
rainbow is awesome at the best of times and awful at the worst of times, there is no middle ground
Here's hoping Luna makes an appearance in the new episode
Wow...Im distracted
Derpy, Sweetie Bell is the best masrhmallow
Pinkie Pie, you're so random!
isnt she uhh...a..pali?
I like Rainbow Dash because she acts really confident and shit, but she really is incredibly worried about what people will think of her. Plus, when push comes to shove, you will not find a more loyal pony.
Apples kill dragons now.
apples are effective against dragons
where did she get the duck thing
CHICKEN DISTRACTION IS BEST DISTRACTION.

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The Ponies constantly refer to Basil (the red dragon) as an animal, indicating a difference in mannerisms between dragon species.
RAINBOW DASH HAS NO FEAR

Ohey it's Smaug!

What I want to know, is Equestria the world, or is Equestria just a nation?
nope.avi
No.
Reptiles shall now get their names from Youtube's auto-transcribe
I guess that's a no
Equestria is whatever the plot demands
Equestria is a 'wide world'
Other than Gummy, of course
Silverscreen: But wait, well... If they refer to him as an animal, why do they try openly speaking and diplomacy and think it might work? lol
Equestria is life.
i want it to be a nation
huzzah for basil

early 1900's reference :D
in before applerarity sleepover shipping
Silly rarity. It's a free mudbath, just like the salon, only outside.
DSNesmith: We do love our ponies. ^ ^
itx 07:10 here
OH boy it looks like I found the right place to be...
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Look Before you Sleep establishes that Applejack plays "Red Oni" to Rarity's "Blue Oni", where as Applejack usually plays "blue Oni" to Rainbow's "Red Oni"
anyone mind sending someone or calling some pegasuses?
PinkaminaDianePie: Same here, sis
07same here
Dog and Pony Show is best episode
Nightmareflare no im not
ITS 1:10 AM OVER HERE
What the fuck is red and blue oni?
Over a Barrel is my favorite.
..
Rainboom
Your cutie mark should've been 3 purple hearts.
SFS is best episode, thank you very much
oni? what? what are you talking about?
I'm sorry but i've never heard of that.
Scootaloo's mom is obviously a hen, not an orange pegasus
12:11
Silverscreen: Hm...
1:11
Winter Wrap Up is best.
Oh come on. This entire episode revolves around Rarity 'Remaking' the bed. and making those adorable sounds as she snuggles the covers.
it fired here in Austin
YOU BROKE MATH
yes.
Tsuki: Lol, eeyup.
Oh....+1...
infinity + 1 = infinity
Cutie Mark Chronicles is good
Scootaloo's mom = Elizabeak
She went there.
Infinity plus infinity!
Best episode is clearly Dog and Pony Show
infinity plus one? oh shit
3Oh, the nostalgia
DON'T USE YOUR FANCY MATHEMATICS
Infinity < Infinity+1
THE SLEEP SONG
NightmareFlare: Problem?
Hooray for overly used southern stereotypes!
nope
Patrtap: You speek truth, yo
1+1=3

mib_9bqs9o: So tempted to post candyvag-detected pic
Only if it had gossamer wings DSNesmith
wtf mine is freezing
Its a simple thing.
MINECRAFT + PONIES = SEX
When I was young I was to busy to make any FREEEEENZ
my favourite pairing is Twi/Dash
Applejack only has eyes for Bloomberg
They are obviously tsundere for each other
2+2=chicken
1+1=11
Scootaloo lawl
Jon: 3 orgasms per individual?
@sosweetandtasty In fact, this episode actually makes me dislike AJ somewhat.
Appledash
MELVIN: kill your family, kill your family
Favorite pairings? o.o
its a trap!
...I more meant letters but...ok.
GIGGTY
SodapopFizz: At first mine was Flutterdash, now it's Flarity
@PinkaminaDianePie i didn't really like her in this. i much prefured her in suited for suckses
She is going to rape them
Twilight? What other pony lives in the library..
ono
Jon: Lol xD
Spike holding the lightning rod
This broadcast is offline. Please check back later.
Spitfire x Madame Leflour is OTP
ITS OK MY TREE IS PROTECTED BY PLOT CONVIENIENCE
@Scootaloo win so much win
Magic lightning rod=spike holding it at the top.
CourtyardDroll: try low quality
I've.. never thought of that actually. >D

AJ is gonna murder
FUSS BUCKET RARITY
no, spike IS the lightning rod
PinkaminaDianePie: I disliked both ponies' stubbornness, but eh
twilights troll door!
Jon: LOL YES
ROFL
nice anon
Twilight has plans.....
SHE LIES
hey, if i gotta wait 8 more hours, I might as well build a giant dick out of cobblestone on SOMETHING
clopclopclop
I'd sleep with a marshmellow
SPIKE IS ON THE ROOF
Bawwwwww
JUST LIKE MY FANFIC!
meanwhile in canterlot
CLOPCLPOCLOP
Twilight:We can read my fanfic!
Spike is away in Royal buisness....... riiiiiiiiiiiight
Twilight.. that was KINDA creepy
(Spike is really the lightning rod)
I.. kind of like them all except Pinkie Pie..
Scootaloo: Call it a dildo instead and I approve >_>
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Applejack and Rarity show off how Dog and Cat owners act accordingly to their pet of choice. Applejack's behavior resembles that of a canine (messy eating/clenliness, jumping into bed) whereas Rarity's character is more feline-esque (picky about details, down to being extremely specific about her sleeping area)
Sleepover by the book
I already said that slurrymoon
spike is in the basement
cobblestone penis would be a good plan
@sosweetandtasty I really enjoyed Rarity's dead panning all throughout this episode.
I love all of them
Book on how to have scret fun
Twilight has a crush on Rarity and AJ
But were afraid to ask
FunFacts rock
How can you dislike Pinkie Pie after the Gilda episode and Party of One?
But....its a dick. Not a dildo =(
awww dont be nasty guys
THREESOME
This is gonna be so GREAT!
Oh god
These facts.
SECRET BUTT FUN!
Silverscreen: ...Hm... So true! Lol, and I'm mostly a cat person
a giant golem's dick
Cool!
ooohhh a threesome
I like them.
Twilight just read some Shipping. Invite Rarity and Applejack over for "Sleepover"
8 hours
owned by hose
ah tripfoalins stole it
i want that book!!!
Silverscreen, they do own a dog (AJ) and a cat =P (Rariy)
Referecne
So is this marathon going to go until Season Two airs?
We're fucked.
@PinkaminaDianePie i see your point
Jon oh, really? sorry for stealing your line
11Ravager: Exactly.
Charity
Scootaloo: Build a dick then, no worries! I just like the other thing, not those. ^_^
IT"S ACID
@MuNova AJ's southern draw was way over done for this episode. That' why I don't care for he that much.
sleepovers for dumbpony's?
"But this mud is IMPORTED!"
slurrymoon its ok.
Now she is dirty
SUPHURIC ACID
whoooo gets the leather saddle furst???
When does the marathon start?
"Mama's coming"
*her
How? Because Pinkie is waaaay too happy all the time. It isn't natural. Now Cupcakes Pinkie on the other hoof, far more sane.
mumma's coming
How much time left for S2 premiere?
Rarity: Umadbro?
YAY!
Wait, so you like dildos but not dicks?
SSSSIIIILLLLLLYYYYY

I'm surprised no one has done a fanfiction about the headless horse
All these smores are making me hungry
Rarity confirmed for OCD

SYMMETRICAL SMORE!
PinkaminaDianePie: I hear ya girl. Maybe they'll do it better in season 2. :)

As I'm reminded in the diamond dog ep, am I the only one that finds it ammusing that Rarity's more insulted at being called a mule than haveing her hindend smacked?
Purdon'.
She just eats everything
"earflop"
11Pardon

Tsuki: I've always liked tsuki as a name, given what it means
@MuNova I hope so. Everytime AJ says land sakes I feel my IQ drop a few points.
...So much aggression...
no cloping silverscreem
Tsuki: Also a part of why I like the name "Luna"
Rarity's kinky Sodapop, she likes it.
Twilight: dem dang friends

SlurryMoon: ....Well, now seems the perfect time for me to say... I love having taco sauce with my tacos.

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The Pony's "curses" all relate to what each pony takes most pride in. Pinkie's mouth, Twilight's magic, Applejack's size, Rarity's Looks, Rainbow Dash's flight, and Fluttershy's softspoken voice.
I never actually noticed this before, but Rainbow Dash's wings seem upside-down.
FLUTTERDOOD

@SuperBrony64: Pinkie can't get Diabeetus because she is the source of all diabeetus
Now I need a trombone.
Hooray for Ponies and Cheetos!
I can't turn on the volume
Great.
How do they balance with only 2 hooves on the ground?
Pinkie Pie is ABOVE Diabetes
Friendship is witchcraft time
I wanna know pinkie's first encounter with parasprites
Pinkie is smartest pony

Is that normal?
inuendo
epic trombone pinky?
Fengor: Her body is the key to the cure!
ima get some sleep so i can actually be awake at 9:00
BUT SHE KNOWS
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Pinkie's diet would actually kill a normal pony, as chocolate and other sweet things are actually poisonous to equines.
DAT OUTFIT!!
rainbowdash always dresses in style
everyone except pinkie holds the idiot ball this ep
0Rainbow Dash is not amused
Pinkie Pie can cuase Diabeetus...yet she is immune to it...Contradiction? That's Pinkie Pie.

Mr. and Mrs. Cake are MURDERERS!
SuperBrony64: which is why we must capture her...for science!

Pinkie's diet would kill a regular PERSON
Not like explaining the problem would really help

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The "Pony Polka" Pinkie plays is the same music played at Pinkie's first party as seen in "Cutie Mark Chronicles." This may be how Pinkie Pie knows about them, as her party music probably drew a herd to her family's rock farm

Right...uh...parade
Aren't you sposed to be god or something?
*ploink* sound effect
I wonder if the visit they're talking about is the one in Ep22
You just know Celestia is the one who set the parasprites loose on ponyville
"Um, Princess? I was wondering, if, uh..."
Fillydelphia.
ahhh yeah...a ... parade... of ... para sprites
Yeah...
Luna: Then I love you. Celestia is enchanting
That hurts.
"How do I get out of this Chickenshit outfit?"
rolled all the parasprites into the next town lol
I'm sorry but that hurts.
FLUTTERSHY YOU SECURE THAT SHIT
oh she knows what they are.
She sent them!
REPART
I did not know Fillydelphia was canon!
i dont think cel can really be a god.
SECURE THAT SHI-
0Pinkie knew they were parasprites, Celestia didn't, your argument is invalid
lol DSN
But I havent studied this week!!
FHILLYDELPHIA WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED
Probably the Parasprite Ball they rolled
dat face
that comic made me lol so hard
Holy fuck 6 hours to go BRONiES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Celestia mentions Fillydelphia, which was what Lauren Faust wanted to Name Ponyville. Executive Meddling forced her to change the name to Ponyville and use Fillydelphia as a cameo name. It's suppose to be a reference to Philladelphia, which is where Faust's family lives.
when dis fuckin show start!?
DSNesmith: best comic this week
cel is sun god
I've learn Pinkie breaks every rule. The end
I guess it's not sunny in philadelphia
DSNesmith: Honestly, didn't really get it.
How do we know that Celestia doesn't know what parasprites are? :P
i think its better not to be fillydelphia
YEEEEEEEAAAAAH
I didn't even know it was an aliens reference until fluttershy said chickenshit
she has no father or mother mentioned anywhere, but a sister? explain.
Silverscreen: DUDE. Nice fact
So Faust lives in Ponyville?
because otherwise every other plot would involve driveby shootings
then I was like LOOOOOOL
She could be lying, she /is/ a troll after all
Fillydelphia = Phildelphia WAT?!
We're all learning so much together.
princess celestia why u no queen!!!!!!!
So will this stream have Season 2?
I learned that a tuba is the only answer.
it is the city of bronyly love
I have a friend who goes to college in Philadelphia
HA
LOL REFERENCE
I must tell him this
Have Tuba will travel
FAUST IS OFFICIALLY IN EQUESTRIA
0well duh
or just start referring to it as fillydelphia
so what you're saying Silverscreen, is that Faust condemned her family to the horrors of a parasprite infestation?
Remember kids you can solve any problem with loud music
epic tuba pony
HAVE TUBA WILL TRAVEL!
Mezkalito, que hora es allá?
Pinkie is better at music than Vinyl, Octavia, and Lyra rolled into one.

Little critters hibernate. Under the snow and ice. We wake up all the sleepy heads. So quietly and nice. We help them gather up their food. Fix their homes below. We welcome back the southern birds. So their families can grow.
It's only at the end that we learn that none of them have their crap together.

Oh my god this episode is the one with one of the best songs in the whole show.
DAT OCD
/me hugs Luna
is this actually going to work in 7 hours?
Just so you know, I timed the lyrics by my computer. Sorry if it wasn't timed for every other pony.
inb4 fail nest
/me fuck it
Incoming OCD...
I love this whole bit. Twilight makes an abomination unto bird's nests and Rarity can't just let it go.
fucking lazy birds
In twilight's defence, the nest she makes resembles an actual bird's nest more than Rarity's
/me hugs Luna
I'll only be working on it all episode
DAT SPIIKE
YAY OCD
Bring it on, x-Scootaloo!
...this will work.
is the stream off air?
inb4 bird outhouse
mib_a45y1b: Yep, have about an hour to spare too. It's about 9.5 hours for entire season.
atrs + crafts = end of winter
lol

EPIC FAIL
/me Scootagoo's Pretender in the face.
...Oh god what.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again. As much as I love everyone else, Kamina is best pony.
U FAIL
Spike is all "wtf is you doin?"
Id use a gas station bathroom before using that thing.
What the fuck.
I'd live in that.
crackeranddip: No colors.
is that.
Nailed it!
I will be the lyric person, please no one else post the lyrics. I do encourage to sing along in the comments though.
Spike is apalled at the horrors Twilight is commiting.
07crackeranddip please leave the colours alone
Because Kamina is best everything, ever/
An OUTHOUSE
Oh you Spike
0fine
an outhouse
...NOT IN THAT WAY. A man can't reference an old Konami game?
lol outhouse
Luna: Try telling that to Rarity and her birds nests :P
There's a reason my hair is compared to a bird's nest. Nests aren't usually very "neat." Rarity is making baskets, not really nests.
hahahaha
Haha. XD
PLOT! PLOT! PLOT RIGHT THAR!
Twilight's sheepish grin is great
..."your creation is only good enough to be shit in"
No Rarity! Don't fix what's not Broken!

Okay, cool.
So were watching the whole thing in one go.

No.

Damn the high quality stream really lags for me
By my calculations, the playlist will end well before the Season 2
Who is the youngest brony here?
end*
ValtheJean and Silverscreen : Eh, I'm cool. Hearing the show while in the kitchen getting whatever is fine, I dont need big breaks tonight. lol
Viral has nowhere NEAR the amount of concentrated manliness.
I'm way better than you twi!!!
....I love how Spike laughs at everything inappropriate
Pinkie gets to write as many words as she wants.
I am two years old.

Kamina was only not made an 'official pony' for balance purposes. The Elements of harmony aren't needed when all Kamina would have to do to beat Nightmare Moon is flex his manly muscles and spout a catchphrase.

"Oh look, the bullies want to talk to you, I'll just leave you alone and ignore their abuse"
Anypony else notice that The Hub ALWAYS shows this episode?

Don't read Cupcakes if you know not what it is, unless ye want to be scarred mentally.

You cannot grasp the true form of Applebloom's cutie mark!
COME ON, GO MINGLE

tripping cutie mark
Cupcakes is ridiculous. Dash is indestructible, EVERYBODY knows that.
FAIL
Cupcakes followed by The Light in the Darkness
Applebloom rolled a 1 on walking.
gasp
I still stand by my stance that the only reason they're pricks like this is because their cutie marks pretty much say "HEY EVERYPONY, MY SPECIAL TALENT IS BEING RICH AND USELESS!"
dat song
oh shit
Noo, I can't watch!
counter troll maneuver, successful
Applebloom dun goofed and screwed herself

Cupcakes really isn't that bad. I thought it was a satire of movies like Saw and Hostel. *shurgs* But I'm a girl-brony so I'm a strange one.
TO THE RESCUE
0so HA
I liked Cupcakes. It was worth reading more for the brony culture than the story itself, though.

Question: when does the new episode start streaming?
THE ILLUMINATI
CUTASTICALLY FANTASTIC
No thats a shitty name.
Okay Here's the plan. Form a secret society. You have 1 minute. Go.
Scootaloo is best CMC
@Fishberry: Howdy :)
a secret society that they tell everybody about
YA
that 70's show?
CourtyardDroll: I vote Apple Bloom, but Sweetie Belle comes sooooooo close
PinkaminaDian: She was Cheerilee's sister in G3, I still say it is now but hasn't been revealed yet.
The freeponies!
This isn't the first time they met! They were huddled together in Ep 1 When Nightmare Moon appeared!!
THE COCK
STONE MASONS?
and off to bed I go...ROLL ON SEASON 2
YAY
THEY JUST HAD TO MAKE A CUPCAKES REFERENCE!
way to fly one over the censors
Secret society, the name of which we yell at the top of our lungs repeatedly
starts streaming at 5PT
Best CMC? Hmmm... Applebloom.
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER THREAD DERAILERS YAY

Guys
DAT ROYAL FLANK
NOW FWF?
Too long; did not listen.
is Luna locked up in a dungeon or something?
she made the world and then got a cutie mark
THE ILLUMINATI WAS A BETTER NAME THAN CMC
Oh fun.
@SuperBrony Well I'd agree with you, save for the fact that Scootaloo is a pegasus and Cherilee is an earth pony.
what's PT?
Blank flank ending
The Light in the Darkness is amazing
FUTURE EP ABOUT HOW CELESTIA AND LUNA GOT THEIR CUTIE MARKS, PLOX
I think i figured out how tia sends the letters back
Most people are idle though.
Making a reference to the Cupcakes story would be the meanest thing that they could possibly do on the show.

Fun Trivia Fact About Ponies: "When not erect, the penis is housed within the prepuce, 50 centimetres (20 in) long and 2.5 to 6 centimetres (0.98 to 2.4 in) in diameter with the distal end 15 to 20 centimetres (5.9 to 7.9 in). When erect, the penis doubles in length and thickness and the glans increases by 3 to 4 times."

Anyone here still remember the massive Science vs Faith arguement when this ep came out?

BUH BYE
this episode could've been so much better if they hadn't lost the point they were trying to make in the middle of making it. luckily i don't go to childrens cartoons to teach me morals so it doesn't bother me
you can't be an atheist if you live in equestria
BAI BAI
FROGS
The fun part is that the episode is neither pro science or pro faith, but both sides see the ep taking the side of the other.

THATS A LIE
0sonic boom lol
Low Quality
WELL TECHINCALLY, she has seen a Rainboom.
Casper: You at http://www.bronystate.net?
yeah twi
exactly rayneJcyro, nobody here can spell her name right
Pinkie didn't know she saw a Rainboom.
0this episode makes more sense to me if Dash explained the rainboom
Pinkie Pie must have been a Pegasus Pony before...
Testing
Okay, low quality works
She just say Joy. Ever Lasting Joy
Thetrollside: Straight up.
Actually, wasn't her back to the window when the rainboom went off? IO thought the sound of it startled her.

Isn't Dash trying to use a visible Mach cone (I can't believe I said that)?

Ok so I can use the chat with an iPod, but can't watch. I'm a sad filly.
0this isn't my hat
I almost hate rarity at the end of this episode :P
yep
Pinkie knows EVERYTHING. She could probably do that spell herself.
I think the Bro Ponies are in a state of straight up denial.
That mach cone was disproved in that youtube physics presentation
Deus Ex Pinkamena
A mach cone appears after breaking the sound barrier (I believe)
For Pony
DAT COMIC
derp
Rainbow Dash does not give a damn about your phsyics.

@Nyst Yeah, but it just seems like the artists tried to use it anyway.

Hi!
ahaha
RARITY IS BUTTERFLY
Now she can fight the Smooze!
big mac eh?
DERPY!
derpy
Someone needs to make a fic of that. Deus Ex with Rainbow Dash losing her wings and getting robotic ones.
0Rainbow Dash is not amused
Derpy can be 5 places at once.
its pnys like those three that make Dash a lez
that spell that rarity is using
HEY! I think we should take a moment to thank Bronystate Theatre for putting on a awesome marathon =)
Derpeh
I like the Big Mac comic
Assertive
Wego: that. would be. amazing.
is the only remains of the flutterponies
Losing wings seem to be something important soon.
I should write that.

Many ponies were killed in the Ponysseum

yes, applause for bronystate

Fluttershy sucks at reassuring.
I love how Rainbow looks here

Hi Everypony

thanks Bronystate
Love the architecture
MY LIFE IS RUINED!!
Kammerjunk, Derpy just spreads her derp to others so that they get too confused.

With the "whatever" look. lol

Yes, thank you Fluttershy. Just what she needed.

Hooray for pressure
I have sworn off ponies until the episode airs.
Celestia... banishes every failure pony.
Return of the flutter pony style!
SUCH CONFIDENCE
Rarity just got better.
omg a flying marshmellow.
RayneJCyro: ;D
dash hardly
SMASHING!
You realize that Rarity is now a pseudo-alicorn
Rari-free used fly
Buttwings
Need... More... Coffee...
0rarity is a rutterfly
I have sworn off ponies until the episode airs.
I think Ponies in general suck at reassuring RayneJCyro. Fluttershy isn't the only one who tells somepony that.
I don't like how the wings are attached so low on her back
A flying bitch you mean....
Dah Balloon!
IT TWILIGHT SPRAPKLES BAWOON
STAY ON TARGET Kammer
oops, forgot to erase part of a comment i was writing earlier
Lol I'm watching the marathon... and just got that I'm listening to music, not to the episodes xD
OMNOMG SO PWETTY
I love the architecture of Cloudsdale
lol at Pinkie Cart Wheel
What
test
A hot air balloon w/out any heat source/
I think if I drink any more caffeine tonight my heart will probably explode.
Someone took Shutterfly
>:I
I hate to sound rude, but the livestream is full, correct?
Im on my second Mega Monster
Slowter, it makes sense because Pinkie Pie.
S'magic Slowter! Questions aren't allowed.
in the rainbow factory, where your fears and horrors come true
I don't think they have. Might be good. You intend to do it?
eh..
0rarity is high
night guys, see ya in 4 hours
Shutterflu: D:
I should probably write down some of these fanfic concepts, but tbh I'm too busy with my Scifi novella to do any fanficcing ATM
catcalling
just one E-can so far. probably do another one in an hour.
lawl
Don't like, ALL pegasi come from Cloudsdale?
Inb4 rainbow hot sauce
they all got wingboners
05applejosh whatever do you mean dear?
haven't cracked my second reg monster yet
lol I used to staying up til 7AM anyway, 2 more hours is easy to endure for S2
Somewhere far below, an unfortunate pony just got a drill to the head.
Still buttwings
OooH! It should be TRIXIE! She's sufficiently magical.
in the rainbow factory, where not a single soul gets through
Jackhammers on clouds?
Hey guys where's 3PO?
Uh... I like the idea, but I have a different fic planned.
And sufficiently vain.
Hmm…if you had the choice (besides being an Alicorn), would you have the power of flight (Pegasus) or power of magic (Unicorn)? (No reason to be an Earth Pony :P)
I'll be running on pur hype
They come from above the clouds apparently, but there are more cities than Cloudsdale
Drill to the head!
pure*
then Darth Vader
Oh hey.
I don't think so, but cloudsdale is pretty much like their capital city.
in the rainbow factory, where your fears and horrors come true
Unicorn.
Pegasus.
@raynejcyro, a darksiders crossover has never been made >:/
We're in a rainbow factory.
Is it me or is Rarity is Icarus?
gj rarity
SuperBrony64; Pegasus all the way.
pegasus
She totally is.
Rarity ruins winter
SuperBrony64, it depends on what I'd do. But most likely Pegasus.
0skittles!
In any case, all weather of the immediate ponyville area comes from there, so it's a pretty important town.
RAINBOW FACTORY IS BEST SONG
I'd go with Pegasus. Magic is cool, but flight is better in my opinion.
Spicy!
nom nom rainbows
Earth Pony for me
yeah
my eyes are trying to close
Taste the Rainbow!
whiny :D
faggot eyes
Man, I need some of that in my kitchen.
0grow a pair!
heh, legato
Keep in mind, Pinkie is the pony who eats hot sauce on cupcakes.
taste the rainbow dash
Depends. Talent specific like these unicorns? I.E. Rarity only being able to do magic related to fashion/gems?
Casually.
kevin
you want a pair of butterfly wings?
oh how orignial
Of course, the best kind of Pony is an Alicorn.
These guys need to be castrated. By bucking.
I'm one of those people that should've been born with wings. I'm more comfortable in the air than on the ground.
then you are girl.
Unicorn all the way. Most wings are the same, but every unicorn gets different magic to match their talents.
but
wings!
Unicorns other than Twilight just get something relating to their specialty, anywya. And maybe levitation for everyone
you can cast your own wings thoug
ow, thats gotta hurt a lot man.
oh yeah SO BORING
inb4 best rarity moment
If your talent is magic or wing casting.
why are all the males asshats
...everypony
Pegasus.
If you have the magical capability, Frostys_Den
Science at work
No, spicy rainbow! Spicy Rainbow, by the way, EXCELLENT band name.
I hate being stuck on the ground sometimes, i really feel like i want to be a pilot
Hat, yeah, but you only get them for 3 Days

Ouch
i already hated rarity
RBD deserves this after SFS
yep mac
0suddenly hammer
Good one guys!
no
This was my first episode.
you cant hate rarity
It was probably very official, taking pictures and stuff, little actual talking or flying in private.
I hated her anyway
I don't hate rarity, but I was not amused with her behavior.
Yeah, I didn't like how they kind of made Rarity a bitch in this episode. But in the rest she's good.
You'd think clouds would be softer
Rainbow Dash <3
cloud punch!
So ...close
but so far.
/me this episode would make me hate her if she didnt laugh earlier!
Dog and Pony Show makes up for it
Wego; True... Didn't really think of that
So..sleepy.
Uh oh, not good
Derpy can be 5 places at once.
Why does nobody bat an eye when they see ANOTHER unicorn with wings out there?
those clouds are dangerous
At that velocity, it would be a lot of force.
