Dat jazz. O, hi Bronystate.

03you might laugh at this
Jazz is awesome

03"Starting out we have an unsuspecting HD DVD drive. It sits calmly as we eye it up."
sagas: yeas show me your moves lol
Invisible Pistols =/
is Ninjazz here?
Evening, all.
03that wording is awesome :P
so, i'm curious, how exactly does one become a bender? born with it? learned ability? natural ability?
I love their invisable guns
jazz hands
Good evening, everyone.
GarrettBrony: nah, he left
Ingwaz: born with it
...........
holding arms like guns
RAWRity: I hope so. I really hope there's a good reason. If it turns out to be commonplace nowadays, then it really breaks things in the universe.

right now
She's like Toph!

I guess she put her Foot down. I am right
/me walks away :3
Dat tunnel
CK|Ded: well, the fact that Korra is surprised about it, and her line about the full moon, suggests it isn't commonplace

WindWhistler: ONIONS?
Sylandest: great!
What I'M worried about is YOung Justice.
RAWRity: Presumably, but I guess we'll find out. In any case, it's a bit vexing. Something feels wrong about the way this new series has been going, and I can't put my finger on what. But something's off.
inb4 it's a....dammit.
sagas: lol yay will ferral
I want Fluttershy, Rarity and Sweetie Belle.
FlareChaser: Yes. Onions.
its a trap!

When is Legend of Korra on TV?
Those mecha...
necroshadow123: That was fucking gold! :D :D
so, with bending, is there some sort of factor that generally determines whether one will be born a bender? family lineage? is it completely random?
Mr. Bubbles
They've not introduced Time Travel into the mix and that...can blow up in their faces real easily.
Irish_Pony: I see we're all having a good time tonight, hehe
Do you like it,Irish_Pony? :)

Korra's Season finale needs to be streamed =/
everyone seems to forget firebenders can breath fire
and i'm back
dis stream just got some streampunk
Why can't platinum be metal-bent?
Welcome back ingwaz
can't metal bend a metal? What?
RAWRity: And if so, HOW did they find this?
Toph
Hmm parents won't be home for 5 to 6 hours. I KNOW! I'll unplug the PC and take it into the lounge and plug it into the tv lol
...Equalist?
WindWhistler: they bend the impurities, not metal itself
or the Wrath of KHAN
IT'S A TRAP! http://derpy.me/nHtPk
Free Art Request OPEN
That pun if horrible~
Wind is OP
assume baldy is an air bender?
robots/
Gamer_Luna: me first !
Sumica: DISTRACTION
Reikim: The supposed logic is that metalbending relies on bending metallic impurities. Of course that annoys me since metal is still a type of earth and should therefore be bendable anyways, but....
inb4 epic...oh wait.
shouldnt he be able to tear some crap up if hes an air bender
?
Big Daddies oh noes

nice hit
why did it stop?
SOOO much steam punk...
Dat airbend
(Just joking)
All the same....I don't seem to recall platinum being "super pure" OR super durable
wow, only seven episodes in and already it's epic
i got a cigarrette add
EPIC
nice use of tech
KO
worked fine for me the first time I did it though so O.o
lololol
I haven't seen much of new Avatar, not sure where this ep fits in
In fact I'm pretty sure it's NOT.
03the release preview?
03the one that just came out yesterday?
any metal can be "pure"
wait...why am i rooting for the bad guys? these benders arent very awesome...
Cypresswolf: it's the halfway point for the first season.
>fire benders, >bend lightning~ Is it me or am I missing out on something?~
hen3ry: DEATH METAL!
Am I the only one who dislikes 3D overlaying 2D cartoons?
although many of them are useless in their pure form
CK|Ded: So then this show said "FUCK LOGIC, we'll have people manipulate the elements."
I know they can, but why don't they do that?~
sagas: I don't.
dragon shouts>bending
sagas: I hate 3D overall
Nyria: lightning is a lot of heat, so maybe thats the logic
Lightning benders have to withstand power levels up to 1.21 jiggawatt
Pajaro: Blaspemous.
03http://i.imgur.com/RW1vf.png
Reikim: Still doesn't explain platinum's ascension to a "super-metal". :P
=/
...
ingwaz: I know that~ I mean why don't they do that here?~!
GarrettBrony: wait, that's just enough power for a flux capacitor
here?~*
Bolin, never change.
Nyria: oh, thought you were asking why they could
CK|Ded: They probably borrowed it from alchemy.
you gonna die
STREET RAT
WindWhistler: It just seems lazy and out of place for the artists to use it
ingwaz: I know I made it sound like that~ And that ! was not meant to be there~
Dat sweet humanized Rarity
Platinum's is a super rare and hard to find element
lol
So anyway, someone complained about lightning-benders? I don't think they actually conduct it.
shes gon get shocked
oh
she gon die
00,03Night y'all!
Rare? Yes. Valuable? Sure. But not because it's super durable.
how bout no.
sagas: I don't like how it looks weird...
inb4 denied.

So...what is that?

No, not lightning bending.
Shock gloves.

HELLO EVERYPONY! :)
Ponies47: hehe :D

Streamer, are you gonna show the new ep too?
Nyria: Nope.avi. I'm gonna try to lay of the caps for a while. :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: XD
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That is too funny. No, really. I am laughing.

Why we still watching this if its over?
FlareChaser: Explain yourself?~
*Hugs Nyria*
FlareChaser: I cannot accept this.
KIDS! USE GRAMMAR!
12 year olds
Twitter dammit.
i love how everyone has anime voices
everyone uses Spongetroll and Korratrolls on scenes of their shows =/
this only makes it harder to get another beer when 1st can is gone :P
some are bad right out of the box unfortunately
I think you have work to do yet to live up to the Legend of Aang, dear Korra writers.
Why are 12 year olds using Twitter?
My Little Avatar: Friendship is Bending
lol
sagas: cause society.
airbenders are breakdancers. :D
Wow, this show really got an animation bump.
/me nuzzles Gamer_Luna "Maybe...I cant make promises...but until then..." kisses <3
My little avatar bending is magic
wait...is the girl supposed to be the avatar? wasnt that the bald kid?
NEW EPISODE TIME~
Your art-fu is strong, but your story-telling needs work yet. :|
Reikim: HUGE budget increase for the new series.

CK|Ded: XD
RAWRity: This is good. I'm liking this.

Earth bending is best bending
Why am I in the legend of korra all of sudden
Kisses Irish_Pony back.I'll miss you.See you soon,my love
Well I got any early night. See ya tomorrow :)
?
Fire bending is ebst bending bro
RAWRity: It's the most...fluid, I would say. Very energetic. Full of movement, and therefore visually interesting.
CK|Ded: You'll live with Naga and you'll LIKE HER
dust bending
FlareChaser: What?
CREEPY CHILD

Kid forgot to turn his swag off
lol
FlareChaser: a hermaphrodite?
DAT FACE
blood bending is best bending
FlareChaser: wait... boy girl? so... octavia is into that? XD
Best bending is bending the element....OF SURPRISE
Irish_Pony: Oh and I wish you luck in your future events~
I CAN BEND! My arm :p
panda: silly panda, im a guy.

03yeah HML, Windows 8 hates me, I even tried in VMWare saying it was Windows 7 and it's giving me the same error
DEMON
...
*shrug*
ingwaz: Ikki
No reactions to Korra's face there?
No, I REALLY should have started watching this show sooner.
:o
03the consumer preview showed up as Win7 anyway o_O
Really?
well thats was japanese
DEMON CHILD BURN IT WITH FIRE
this show got 20% scarier
demon child holy shite
O_O...Im scared now
woah...okay....the crap....THE CRAP
That face was AMAZING.
ingwaz: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?~
kill it with fire
DAT RAGE
CK|Ded: fantastic actually
Nyria: i'm thinking demon child...get the silver bullets?
This guy has class.
First time I saw that face, I was laughing way too hard.
Hydrogen , Helium , Lithium , only the avatar can master all 158 elements!
ingwaz: I was thinking kinky, but yeah I'll get that too~
CK|Ded: the lightning sold it
TrixieMuffin: =/
iron man
He's corrupt and evil. inb4.
I bend Ununoctium.
Fucking Tarlok.
Aurora

Nyria: ~~~~~. ~~~? ~~~~....
Feather was not demodded
i bend aluminum
DUN DUN DUN
I can bend Calcium
foil
And his fucking bullshit.
Nyria: kinky? ...with the demon child?
She still has access
Fuck you Tarlok.
Gunthler: ~~~,`~~~~``~~
I bend sodium.
Tarloc is WORST PONY
:|
FUCK YOU IN YOUR FUCKING FACE.
I bend molybdenum
ingwaz: Just her name~ Inky
TARLOK IS WORSE THAN DIAMOND TIARA
TRUEDAT
TENZEN IS HODGINS
Diamond Tiara is way cooler than Tarlok.
so...if shes the avatar, what happened to the bald kid?
:|
Diamond...Tarloc?
wouldn't it be a great twist if Tarloc was actually a good guy who genuinely wanted the best for the city ?
Biglaw: chapter 17 plz lol
ingwaz: Dead
BUB
ingwaz: died like 80 years ago
I'M THE AVATAR, BITCH
Is that politician Amon?
Bitch Please... Im the Avatar
does this make korra applebloom?
Oh low blow
She forgot a part. Should have been "I'm the Avatar. Bitch."
CK|Ded: wasnt she in the original show though? or no?
That jerk~
Tenzen is Jack Hodgins. :o
Shes the God damn Avatar
ingwaz: No.
/me loves that bitch
OH GODDAMMIT I'M MISSING LOK!
with his conspiracy theories
Howdy y'all!
otakon: lol
wait.....SKY BISON!?
Kyiko: not unril thre is a video of her jumping with her name repeating
otakon: Oh hey there~
Sounds like Aang with fire.
Yep.
hiya Nyria
howdy Everlasting_Joy! how are you?
CupcakeWarrior: what if I told you, I know a Muffin Man?
Sky bison aren't extinct after all.
you're not a failure. you make a good example as to what a failure is
CupcakeWarrior: DAI!
The fact that Korra can't contact her past selves also makes me think the Spirits are up to shenanigans.
otakon: I need you to see something alright ^^
=/
So.........is that Appa's son/daughter?
MuffinWarrior: Wat
SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY
RAWRity: But what about the dreams?
Nyria: okay, pm it too me
otakon: i dont think so
RAWRity: That would be a great twist. Maybe there were issues with the resurrection?
Bring out Aang again
Obviously, if anyone had even bothered to take a look at the access list they would have realised that >_>
CupcakeWarrior: wat
shenanigans
MahBoi777: This "I'm 'fine'" is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
lol
I call shenanigans
Darkts3: okay how ELSE do you explain it?
Korra=Aang
otakon: appa was born alone, lived alone, adn died alone
RAWRity: I sense that there's a great evil in the Spirit World.
SHANANIGANS
MuffinWarrior: I know that youre Flare
CK|Ded: nope. Apparently Aang found a small group of surviving SKy Bison in his travels after the series.
Too bad Roku couldn't contact you, he's more of a badass.
cachi01: whos appa?
/me hugs everyone tight
CupcakeWarrior: ...what the hell, how did you guess that?
cachi01: bullshit, wild Sky Bison could have survived high in the mountains
otakon: Aang found a a bunch of bison after the war
lol
Bye guys, I'm leaving for a week ^_^
/me hugs emangamer back~
Everlasting_Joy: good!:)
ingwaz: one of the best character every

She's still staff here
o.o
HI HO
CK|Ded: sixth*
huh?
=/\
TEAM BOOMERAANG!
/me hugs RaveBrony
lets riide
I could complain about the fart joke...but it makes damn good sense that an Airbender toddler would bend his farts.
For clarification, I would never touch the staff list unless given approval
and I know that Kyu didn't approve of it
nice hotrod
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior
ingwaz: Er, no. There have been hundreds of avatar.
lol: :D
why is her mod status gone

yeah!
now thats a pimped out ride
The Avatarmobile IS rather awesome.
Goddammit I am digging this show
Steampunk swag.
alright fine
Feather
ahh Gotham City
ingwaz: Roku was just the one that came before Aang, and the one we got used to in the prior series. So presumably Aang will show up a lot in this one.
CK|Ded: ...so...guess they just decided to pick a japanese word and make it the name...just happened to pick the word for six
leave me alone.
inb4 it gets wrecked
otakon: I SHOULD HAVE STARTED WATCHING THIS EARLIER
panda: they were gone before i came on
na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na BATMAN!
Is that the british flag on the hood?~
Radios
Your account settings are preventing you from getting automatically op'd
Sylandest: aww :(
Reikim: me too
now why don't you guys lrn2irc because jumping to conclusions
10o.o
panda: GilDash left a few hours ago and Om left about an hour ago
>_>
goddamn Chi Blockers
before*
CK|Ded: i thought aang was supposed to be the last avatar they'd had for a long time?
:O 1st can is empty...darnit, brb
da popo
10but I also auto op'd when I joined before
CK|Ded: THERE WAS A SERIES BEFORE AANGS STORY?
03so I take back what I said about you doing so
I LOVE the music in this scene
because it's drama.. :s
Really, this is the best steampunk I have ever seen ever.
na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Avatar!
ingwaz: no, he was the last AIRBENDER, not the last Avatar
;A;
that was half if myreason to be pissed
so awesome
Feather, you don't have auto-op set on
CAR CHASE CITY
I'm sell passed
pissed
ingwaz: He was frozen in ice for a hundred years, so yeah, that's sort of a long time.
still
ingwaz: he was the last airbender, because he narrowly avoided mass genocide
10I always did
THUNDA
Dat Blues Brothers chase
Damn the soundtrack is amazing~
huh... he can bend lightning
zap zap
otakon: i meant the last one they'd had in awhile, like it had been some time before they had an avatar
WAIT WAIT WAIT
ingwaz: also, Airbenders are coming back into the world slowly but surely
then type /ns set autoop on
the old avatar wouldn't evn have cars, let alone car chases
f*ing autocorrect
did he just bend lightning
10then when drf told me I had been removed, it quit doing so
ingwaz: yeah
inb4 they get arrested for destruction of property
good for him
well, drf made a mistake
good speed avatar go
nice
Darkts3: that was established way back, when we saw him working in the power plant.
03yeah, I thought she removed it
WHEN THERE'S LIGHTNING~
I can't even describe how awesome this is.
owned
Airvending would be useful right now ....
I can
YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS BRINGS ME DOOOOWN~
how about
03apparently we were just talking about it and never actually did
otakon: so...how was the avatar before aang in the show if it had been some time since he died, presumably
we don't talk about this here
darn
Bolin: still useless
don taze me bro!
swag
twilight_sprinkle: eeyup he did, that means he's either pretty damn skilled or Lightning bending is very common place now
Dat scarf of asskicking.
Telsa would be a lightning bender
Lightning is pretty op
ingwaz: spiritually and flashbacks
Reikim: :D
GarrettBrony: :)
since it can kill ppl faster
This fight seems pretty cliche... >_>
otakon: i see
otakon: looks like its just common, cuz now random people can steal bending, bend metal
Gunthler: =/ how?
:'(
ingwaz: The series makes a point of saying that each new avatar receives spiritual guidance from the previous avatar to help them master the elements and keep the balance.
I KNEW IT
Darkts3: because the good guys won. they always do. :|
Go Team Rocket
ah, Team Avatar
it's on now
how do you do that thing where you specifically highlight some one and send them a message, but every one can see it?
That was a huge hint to him being evil~
now they need a smart aleck
get in trouble with the police- VICTORY FACE
Equalists = Communists
Tarlok is WORST FRICKING PONY.
lol
dat totalitarian
CK|Ded: FUCKING RIGHT HE IS.
You know, the more I drink, the more I think I have a tolerance to certain liqours, I can handle at least 9 shots straight whiskey 70 proof 40% alcohol volume, but 3 beers at 4.2% alc content gets me buzzed O_o
this show gives me conflicting feelings. it could probably have a really good story if it took it very seriously. but they try to make it too comedic and play it off it seems
I do not like Tarlok
OH YOU FOOLS
Totalitarianism, yay!
Also, Council is worst council
lol: write the first letters of someones name then hit tab
panda,did you get the link for the 3rd pony in The Element Ponies?
dat smirk
he's EVIL!
Is he a chancellor? Cuz if he is then he's evil.
only gonna create more hate
this guy is a dick
lol that was funny
otakon: YOU BEAT ME TOO IT
lol
TO*
Look at that car hod~
WindWhistler: lol
suuuure everyone is stupid except the good guys, isnt that original
donuts =/
hood*
The way the council always conforms to Tarlok makes me think he's got some kind of control over them.
You think he's a dick NOW?
lol is not the best name to choose
lol
lol just wait.
lol
Gamer_Luna: no I did not :(
oh noes
Twilight_Sparkle^_^: That's always the case...
RAWRity: Blackmail?
fine
and then jealously
burn dat rubber
Cypresswolf: isnt one beer equal to a shot alcohol wise?
now leave me alone
/me lol
hiya RAWRity
Whoops wrong pinger
RAWRity: hint hint
You'll see why RAWRity and I consider him to to be WORST PONY.
As you wish, milady
twilight_sprinkle: That's ALWAYS the case in any show.
ITS A TRAP!
RAWRity: Ooh, this sounds good. Care to explain?
Wait......it's not equalists
o-o
Reikim: you'll see.
huh.
fabulous sarcasm
WindWhistler: which is why its extremely unoriginal
Hey RAWRity! How's it going?
Biglaw: going good.
dat ain't right
that wasn't even in jest lol
It's like he's trying to start a civil war.
OH WAIT
Suddenly it's getting all WWII Germany in here.
Reikim: eeyup
ingwaz: I have no idea, first time I bought beer in a few months, I usually drink whiskey, taking a break of at least a week when the bottle runs dry
dat hat swivel
2Sigh
Reikim: you dont say
brb, turning on Toonami
heya Ran
2Halloo
excuse the drama
Um, no.
oh ya... Toonami
2It's quite alright
oh no
wood bending?
that was partially my fault unfortunately
This is pretty need
Metal.
ingwax: ikr?
OCCUPY
*neat
occupy all the streets
I think we should streem toonami
wtf this doesnt even make any sense
And nobody questions him.
the hell?
Occupy Republic City
hmm...not bad
Reikim: enope
twilight_sprinkle: what doesn't make sense?
Gamer_Luna: plants looks awesome
You'd think you would have at least one police guy saying "Hey, maybe he's insane".
2Things happen sometimes
BULLSHIT!
As they do
Gamer_Luna: hey... do you think you can give me a difinitive color spectrum for each character... its hard to tell from your drawings you know?
NO
stuff about to get serious

this reminds me of ther Communist witch hunts of the 1950s
Tenzin is now a boss.

You tell him!

Herp_Derp: its from a few years back
she sounded like a guy
Lol! :D
Sylandest: is he trying to bring her out of the computer because he has some infatuation with her
I'll still be chat tards :3
The new Lupin III, Karate Kid (2010), and my daddy issues came together to form an overwhelming "nightmare". I can't believe it's only midnight.

FRACTAL
So what's going on here is...a 12 year old is trying to learn how to Turn DATA into DNA.
This kid has no idea what he's talking about.
What the frick is a fractal?
Just don't get bitten
Guys, I found my main vein.
dat nerd
03wtf at this frozen mac and cheese, part of it is still frozen, part of it is stupidly hot
03o_O
RAWRity: exactly :D
yes! Let's make a body from that dna, then overwrite the brain
03never had any of it still be frozen before
11,01CupcakeWarrior: Self-similar shape.
/me cuts his main vein
seen this epsiode
Herp_Derp: I know, I see it too. It's pretty cool when you realize it
mmmhmmm
so...the writers decided to just open a computer tech book, find any terms in the glossary they could,a nd put it in to his lines?
Flesh and Data
RAWRity: He should talk to the Digi-Destined.
Fractal is an Anime from last year
/me bleeds out and dies
11,01Gunthler: cut that out.
Delivery time - 11:59 :) I love it when a plan comes together
Maybe your ramburgers need refreshing

inb4 this goes horribly wrong.
Maid_Discord: i c wat u did thar
hi guys

Hi Iron_Mare
RaveBrony: wat
/me 11,01synths.
so, the only reason they go in to the computer and fight is to protect that one girl... not to save the world or something?
I wonder how blue Jeremy's balls are by now =/
Who's streaming?
03LOL
NO!!!
does anyone still request a pony be drawn on the box when ordering a pizza?
Hamburgers made of random access memory.
WoW crashed!

11,01So, how will this materialization attempt fail?
ingwaz: yep

XANA'S PLAN....is to remind us of "Alone in the Dark: The Video Game!"
Sumica: What episode is this?
THE FIEND
Shizuka: yeah, they synced up the wrong line
i heard a yay
after rodrigo says he can't control how much of a wuss he is
CK|Ded: OH FUCK N0

Tis' in ourselves that we a thus and thus
The worst possible THING
I hope this is the season finale, because then she might actually get reformatted in a dramatic scene.
Our gardeners are our wills, our gardens our bodies
SEE
RAWRity: wait...if the reason theyre still doing this is to keep the girl alive, and they get her out in a later season, WHY ARE THEY STILL DOING IT?
IT'S ALONE IN THE DARK

The School may cave in? ^_^ No School! No School! Lalalalala
and then they all died
official, dog is the avatar
Iago is the biggest troll in all history of trolls
if they have time travelled all this time how many freaking altarnate dimensions have they created?
Shizuka: Her psych issues are, I find, much better presented in the Rebuild.
cachi01|lag: no idea
Alister: dats pretty coo
Although those with magical purple hair because they're the moon are hotter :)
otakon: point is you always tell me it hsa to do with something in the show, but im oits just fanservice
13yeah but it's missing the reason for her issues in rebuild
pfft
when you feel you're sinking fast, when you're cast adrift.
http://nfs.sparknotes.com/othello/page_54.html
makes me lol
"put money in thy purse"
101 dalmations
^
Shizuka: Wait until the third movie. I know I can't wait :)
13having the doll with her means it's not the kyoko-went-insane arc of the original
101 xana
13oh yes
it's just like 2012 that fucking horrible movie
twilight_sprinkle: in THIS case it IS just fanservice as far as I can tell
yay power outage at half way done transfer? just have his torso left
CK|Ded: this is a show where they're trying to use CODING to simulate protein synthesis. Ultrasound not working right is the least of this show's inaccuracies.
otakon: oh ok
whats his name
13yep season 1
Tokens. having more than 1 black person doesn't focus test well.
aluric?
13forest is old style
FlareChaser: Now that I think about it, you put a coat on your OC so you don't have to draw a cutie mark
Should've stayed at Season 1.
Shizuka: I think Kyoko went insane in this one as well. And Asuka carries the doll as some sort of psychotic way of dealing with that.
A:TLA had best fanservice
Lyoka x Tron Fic
Alister: yeah, I still have one though
aelita used surprise butt secks but it failed!
can she fight?
Hows it going, everypony! :)
RAWRity: Obviously they need to follow Hackers rules and just start calling virtualization "penetration"
GOD WHY DO THEY HAVE FOREHEAD CANCER!?
Thank you captain obvious
hi tgl1992!
Hi tgl1992
I find it a great strategy to keep a few dogs & cats around, if they start acting strange or disapear, pay attention, it may mean a natural disaster is about to occur
Pajaro: um, not really
Why do you care?
hrrr, grrrr!
Hi Tgl1992!
that's useless
otakon: Cuz drugs
otakon have you ever seen MST3K the Movie?
CK|Ded: O_o
also Kosoveon, I borrowed King Lear from my school
CK|Ded: and then have Ulrich and Yumi change their names to Crash and Burn
he is indeed, and the fact that he is actually able to trick a popular general into doing a bunch of crazy sh*t is pretty impressive
USE CAT AGILITY
*slowpoke*
dun dun duuuun
GarrettBrony: sadly no
They arent allowed at the beach because whales could get beached on their foreheads
HI EVERYPONY!
13we've gotta cross over to the other side, just ease into death and we'll be there
why did the kids cross the hole?
HI Little_Cloud
nice <3
Iago is a terrible waste of a life xD
meow
AT LEAST TEN MEATERS!?
/me http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100630114703/animebaths/images/f/fb/Katara.png is best fanservice
RAWRity: Sounds good!
OH NO!
Shizuka: dem emo lyrics ^^
although you'll hate edmund by the end of the play lol
meters are now feet
otakon. watch it . IT explains them having large foreheads
those sex noises...
you'll see what I mean
Shizuka: I forget, does death stick after the jump back in time, or not?
Again, dat run animation
panda_: Weren't there for that movie night I assume?
I think
/me dat Katara
10 meters? That's nothing for Master Chief
inb4 kids become pancakes
I already hate him, Kosoveon
*suddenly wants to watch Cloverfield*
Seastallion_of_War: ?
13they never die prior to a reset button
Is there any interesting stuff now?
Seastallion_of_War: goddammit all I forget about that
Seastallion_of_War: She nekkid
he's manipulative like Iago
13they just get insanely close
but he's stuck-up
CK|Ded: I was there for the hackers movie ^^
>dodge
video game logic
>lasers
No?
Shizuka: He meant IF they died
D:
They are all godmodders
FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS: presenting the most badass cross-over ever: http://e621.net/data/1c/69/1c69af41e2919c0a5a1979539987903d.jpg?1338692305
Seastallion_of_War: http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/4/45/Dat_ass.jpg
13IF they died... probably
Shizuka: wait, what would happen if one of them died and then they reset?
and er HML?
13or it might not work
panda_: Dat Katara - http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100630114703/animebaths/images/f/fb/Katara.png
how do you misinterperet a 7 for a 6?
Still no rope burn
the atmosphere looks like a platformer video game
I'm just wondering.
13never happens so we don't know
Are those kits from Metaluna. Their Foreheads are huge!
dunno
Whats funny, I loved watching this show but never got what the plotline was :D
kay
*kids
just annoying though
Seastallion_of_War: odly... not arrousing ^^
Because if it DOESN'T stick with the Time Warp, then this whole scene with Odd is kind of worthless.
They have to rely on Yumi? They're doomed
kid is going to die yumi will die just when aeilita slow mo writes code lyoko
therefore he's less interesting
IMO
erm
Jeremy definatley knows the time warp
Othello lol
03Othello = Reversi :|
panda_: listen to the breathing noises with your eyes closed, itll fix that problem
Gamer_Luna: so just asking , how much time do you think you'll need ? take all the time you need tough
?
Clearly this kid is underleveled. Those guys look like entry-level mooks.
13HUEEEAH
03it's a game...
I never liked Code Lyoko much... *Hides form raging fans*
Dam Flood
yeah Kosoveon
So what would happen if Aelita died in the virtual world?
ah
suddenly not useless?
Little_Cloud: same here
Othello the play>>>>>othello the game
ingwaz: what breathing noises? :o
DRF, they read shakespheres
I've finished Othello
CupcakeWarrior: XANA wins
they dun liek fun
/me hide

panda_: from the stream
/me goes and joins Little_Cloud
CupcakeWarrior: respawn?
13as always, stick with it through season 1, it gets better
several times
also Kosoveon
lolk
Alister,25 more mins :)
WTF IS THIS!?!?!? I WANTED MY LITTLE PONY!
13it's kind of like star trek next generation
ingwaz: xD
those path need more railings
11,01Lyoko has a crap story. That's my main criticism.
Gamer_Luna: cool
Those towers look so much like a tall cigarette
13have to get to where they grow the beard
Look up I, Iago by Nicole Galland
pony_9622: o_o
Odd, gettin' his swag on with the girls.
o.o
Yumi is the most physically capable of the three IRL, and the smartest. So WHY does she suck so bad in Lyoko?
ingwaz: wait... you mean the little girls moaning?
I want MLP! Not this...
Simon: Well, it IS a French series
And Riker's Season 1 plot chin :D
Y U NO LET HER DIE
Shizuka: good analogy, hehe
Shizuka: kid with the freak hair and the fur suit just kind of confuses me
Shizuka, they grow beards?
panda_: yep
And Iago: A Novel by Daniel Snodin
his chin looked like a plot :D
Maid_Discord: No worse than most Western cartoons.
Is this a guy ? LOOK AT HIS CLOTHES !
god damn I want them
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/20726
Those foreheads a freaking me out now DX
ingwaz: O_O no me gusta
IT'S BRONYSTATE NO PONYSTATE! :[
Oh come on! You can climb over that :|
ya, ponies would be nice right about now.
weird my phon keeps up with vid better than my compiuter
*NOT
Maid_Discord: No worse than most anime/manga, for that matter.
brb
MLP! :D
Alister: he's french
hen3ry: French?
idk why everyones complaining about se 1, the eps were great
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/epic-fail-scan-she-help-me-donate-fail.png
Pajaro: YOU NEVER ASK FOR PONIES GODDAMMIT
Cool guys don't look at explosions
Simon: Yes, the series is French
XANA, y u design obvious weak spots?
FUCK YEAH CODE LYOKO
owlicious: -_-
DONT ASK FOR PONIES
13season 2 they get into aelita's backstory and some insteresting situations, season 3 they do a lot of filling in for lyoko's history and even more interesting scenarios
Oshit
hen3ry: I thought it was japan O_o
Hey :Seastallion, to Paintchat?
13season 4 they go to the internet
Also, hi guys
nope
13so there's that :3
I like how those things look like giant head crabs :)
Hi Pinkies4thWall
NEVER ask for ponies!! :D
IT'S BRONYSTATE NOT PONYSTATE! :[
Shizuka: Do they reach 4chan?
^
interwebs?
I like cpde lyoko but it freaks me out sometimes
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/20726 MLP:FIM and aquabats are now one :3
code*
Ponies47, Is that the new slogan?
Shizuka: soo in seson 4 they try to save 4chan and rule34?
wtf why is half of this animation 2d and the other half 3d?
11,01But this show just has a weak story overall.
brb
13cachi01: blow it up actually
13kind of
:O
Head Shot!
11,01And inconsistencies.
these kid
GabeMoist: Nope.avi just saying :$
Couldn't they jump back in time?
WHAT KIND OF MISSION IS THAT
Maid_Discord: sadly I agree, interesting premise but weak story and .....odd animation
Is this guy being voiced by Ashleigh Ball?
Maid_Discord: Meh, true :D and is it maid hour??? O.o
BLOWING THE INTERNET?
brb
Shizuka: then thats probaly why they dont like the se 1s stories that much
11,01RaveBrony: No.
:'(
Maid_Discord: Look, it's a Western cartoon. They almost all suck.
these kids' forhead remind me of Exeter from This Island Earth RaveBrony
Maid_Discord: why cant I love you?
sex noises
no computer girl who i love!! i wont let you!!
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/epic-fail-probably-bad-news-we-could-tell-that-from-the-headline.png
yeah aelita do it
code lyoko fuck studying for finals
RaveBrony: who said it wasnt? :3
KO
13yeah, season 1 is almost entirely, world in jeopardy, one of our heroes is inches from ded, aelita pops the tower at the last possible blink, everything is fine again
MaidChaser: Maid_Discord did :D
O.O
MaidChaser: Its not maid hour :P
4th wall?
Especially I, Iago, Kosoveon
13but they call back to this ep later in the season
5th wall
I want to read it ):
Maid hour for me! :D
/me finally wikis Code Lyoko
Shizuka: and then they lose the reset button
6_9
When I switched back to the stream I heard the boy moan with his eyes closed and biting his lips....
4th wall
03LOL paying for books
ded
that reminds me if i dont study and pass math then i go to summer schools
yeah, this is rather interesting
03want me to find you some pirated pdf?
I know Im not going to watch the 5th season
11,01And then they use time reset that they should have used from the start.
Alister: yaranaika?
Shizuka: yeah... I kinda dont like the first seasons... but it gets much better
o_o
worth it
13but they also have a reason for losing the reset button, which is also good
Maid_Discord: Maid hour?
Once i said when they were livesteaming a MLP/TF2 crossover here i said i don't like TF2 and you alll raged over me D:
xana should just get shitloads of monsters inside the tower and done
what happens if the enemies reach the tower?
RAWRity: Oof. Now that sounds like it might, you know, actually add real drama to this plot.
dat whining
ingwaz: no thank you I don't like chinese food
Maid_Discord: :D
AELITA NOO
OMG
lmfao
yes drf
of course the nerd is in love with the elf
Noooooooo!!!
Why is it bad that Aelita is doing that now?
please do ):
NO!!! COMPUTER GIRL WHO I'VE GROWN FEELINGS FOR!!
DONT DO IT U WONT MEET UR CYBER BOYFRIEND
OH NOES
13there's a prequel during season 3 that shows how the events of the series started
!!!oooooooooN
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/epic-fail-probably-bad-news-reverse-psychology-never-works.jpg
wait...time control?
CupcakeWarrior: because aelita will die
CupcakeWarrior: they'll lose all the data on her Materialization
13aelita was pretty much jeremie's only friend until he met the others
Time rewind. So she's back.
So Aelita is ded? :D
Jump back in time... There was an episode dedicated to that
they can control time?
dundun
:D
Apparently I missed something, what was wrong with reseting that time?
D:
THAT'S NOT HOW DNA WORKS
You still have the hair! ;)
DUNDUNDUN
CLONING
Shizuka: Really? I don't remember that
GAHH
THAT'S NOT HOW PROGRAMMING WORKS
13dammit yumi stop giving away the plot
DUNDUNDUN
i think she used to be alive
Tron
oh, theyre pulling a spock
THAT'S NOT HOW DNA WORKS!!!!!
That's totally how it works
and another alternate dimension was created............
/me aneurysms
Aelita now has glass in her.
XD virtualization...
Hi Saxy
lol
:D
daw
0,14oh hai
then Aelita comes back as a fucking test tube
dat materialization
Yay shes not ded
XD
Shizuka: kinda like twilights only friend was spike until she met others
Ohai SaxyPretender
Dem tears!
oh the pun
13pretty much
puns
these kids' forhead remind me of Exeter from This Island Earth
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
she'll just have to forgotten about the entire time they spent after trying to materialize her
water onyour face
BAD PUN
Dat pose
and that pose...
PUUUUUUNS!
THERE'S McGIVER, THEN THERE'S GOD.......THIS IS McGODIVER!!!!!!!
dat joke and dat pose
That pose O_o
wut is this?
yeah, but thats not how genetics work...
DAFUQ POSE
well, that was almost dramatic
HAHA OUR FRIEND DIED LET'S MAKE PUNS
xD
Dark92Enigma: :D
/me noms
13well, your chromosomes determine your genetic makeup
yay for puns!
Oh hey you almost died and you have no idea whats going on, I AM GONNA MAKE A FUNNY!
RAWRity: THAT WAS A HAIRY SITUATION
Sumica: what now?
RAWRity: Thats not normal?
13if you've got the full set, you could reconstruct everything
yay
GarrettBrony: there probaly super smart that they cant fit anymore infomation :D
Stream Toonami pwease
yay
Shizuka: But DNA =/= being able to rebuild a person.
yay
OK that was better than the earlier episodes....gotta admit....but that's NOT HOW DNA WORKS
hai everypony :3
yay
Sumica: are you even there?
yay
hi Spell-of-Gaming!!
:( yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Hey Spell-of-Gaming :)
Shizuka: memories?
/me glomps Spell-of-Gaming
Hi Spell
Hello there Spell-of-Gaming
YAY
even my melted icecream
Hi o Spell-of-Gaming
hey Spell-of-Gaming
Stream Toonami
yay
YAY
Sumica, yay
yay
Shizuka: There's a lot of other factors that go into creating a person, i.e. how they're raised, environment exposed to, etc
LOUDER
Yay !
First day of school for me is tomorrow. :(
Deadman Wonderland's on!
yay
I need to go. Take care everyone.
13just brush it under the rug of "they use scanners to virtualize into a computer system"
yay
Does anyone remember watching this series a while back?
LOUDEEERRRRRRR
yay
Stream blac stream
sumi is down! HELP!
Simon: YES
Shizuka: Not only decides psyche, but also determines which genes get activated, which express, and which don't.
favorite stream
ok then
WHOAH
DAT WHOA
/me performs CPR on the Unconcios Sumica
Iron_Mare: remember the episode where they constantly jump back in time?
doctor NOOOOOOO
also lol Kosoveon
/me pokes Sumica with a stick
13considering the scanners are essentially teleporters, and maintain spiritual continuity across the transfer, yes given a lock of hair it could reconstruct aelita's state
/me is eating wendy's for dinner tonight
at the end of the play
Good thing the first day of school is a half day. :)
Iago is like
Simon: Eeyup
Shizuka: I'm sorry, compulsive habit. Abusing genetics for plot angers me.
wat happen now
Shizuka: So Chaotic stole Code Lyoko's plot?
I WANT MLP
Please Stream Toonami
Iron_Mare: cool
Man I want some donuts.
Where in the world is Sumica?
"F*** YEAH, I ENGINEERED ALL OF THIS AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHY HAHAHA!"
mmmmmm donuts n toonami
o-o
13corner lyra is amused
crap!
/me slaps pony_9622 with a wet noodle
im missing toonami!
Wait... In this time i can get a donut
3 days till E3 so who is ready!!!
BRB EVERYPONY!!!
wet noodles dont hurt.
oh the darkness show! I love this episode
Oh shit its almost E3
0,14>brother playing Minecraft
That sound sexual RaveBrony
i want to go to e3 ;A;
It's like those old shows that say "Nuclear radiation? IT CAN DO ANYTHING!" Only now it's "Genetics? IT CAN DO ANYTHING!"
0,14>I can't see Toonami
cachi01: EEEEEYUP
E3?!
yay
0,14fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
yes
inb4 everyone complains about E3
she'll take you for a ride on a slow boat to China...
13file it under rule of cool~
Its 2 days till E3 over here.
I lol'd pretty hard
and that's AFTER he gets stabbed multiple times
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/epic-fail-no-room-for-zombies-fail.jpg
SaxyPretender Its on right now
0,14I know ;__;
doesn't he only get stabbed once?
SaxyPretender: I blame Minecraft for your lack of xboxing
Hong Kong has no E3
/me hugs SaxyPretender
CupcakeWarrior: but what if THE 3 gets announceed :O
KINECT
E3? Oh, right, that
and he's like
"I bleed, sir, but not killed" *smirk*
Has never watched Toonami :$
Toonami Aftermath streams toonami 24/7
microsoft rustlin yo jimmies
13since the scanners are, by design, converting your genetics into code, presumably it has many ways of making sure that process doesn't go wrong
go there
I can't say I actually care
They better announce an MLP game at E3
Ponies47: I'm so sorry
Ohai Saxy
Sumica: you afk, I mad
and yes lol
KINECT
and then Othello's all "screw you, I don't care, I want to die anyway"
0,14oh hai GabeMoist
no
yay
Shizuka: dat failsafe
Hi SaxyPretender
KINECT
Oh leave Sumica alone :D
ya
I b4 flamewar about how horrible EA, Capcom, etc are.
Othello tries to stab him
SUCKS
yay
KINECT
lets just watch somting plz
SUCKS
inb4 http://www.lulu.com/shop/fotie-photenhauer/natural-harvest-a-collection-of-semen-based-recipes/paperback/product-20052760.html
Shizuka: Yeah, I'm going to ignore the fact that your genetic code is not all that you are, and file it under Rule of Cool like you said -.-
But Montano disarms him before he can
yay
13a lock of hair is an extreme case, but if the scanners operate on just part of your genetics, plus the magic to keep your spirit going, then it's conceivable that the lock of hair is enough
Yay !
GabeMoist: ni hao
Fun fact
Wait a minut
Ponies47: You've never watch Toonami
And then Iago stabs Emilia
03hm
and runs off
:S
03darn, I can't find it
03the book is too new
03w/e
Shizuka: Oh, we're getting spirit in on this now? All bets are off then.
and when he's brought back
Shizuka is pink, could that mean she is Aelita?
0,14...all this talk of scanners is reminding me of Tron: Legacy
Iago is, I think, the only Shakesperian villain to live to the end of the play
13probably like way way too much redundancy built into the process
quite ironic
yeah
03Shakespeare didn't even exist
kinect sucks, ps move 50/50, wii just YES
03I hate to burst your bubble
03:P
you're a pessamist
:p
6_9:S<3:|:P:'(:(:)<3:O:$
03not really
and one of THOSE I see xD
even if he didn't so what lol
Here, let me save everyone from getting hopes up. Here's this year's E3 in a nutshell....Nintendo: Wii U, Sony: HERE HAVE MOAR 3D, Microsoft: WHY WON'T ANYONE BUY OUR KINECTS?
the plays exist
Shizuka: I know, I know. I'm just emphasizing here that having someone's genetic sequence does not allow you to reconstruct that person.
03I was just saying
neither of the books, drf?
inb4 he can't even spell his own name consistently
13jeremie's operating on the assumption that aelita is a program, so given that, a lock of hair could indeed contain her entire state in DNA
03then again
play enjoy them, everyone's happy
03I just use google
03so can you
03XD
*people
Ponies47: Nothing really. Just that you missed some awesone stuff
back
I, Iago by Nicole Galland and Iago: A Novel by Daniel Snodin?
Pajaro: no emote spam
:p
Koso lolyeah
Shizuka: So her DNA is constantly changing?
I can't find them drf
CK|Ded: xd but dishonored!!! dishonored will be announced
Herp_Derp: /)
I've tried
03hm
03well
ok sorry
0,14Pajaro, watch the emote spam
13possibly
03I tried the first one
tis almost midnight where i am
CK|Ded: nd also the new tomb raidr!
Shizuka: More willing to accept that, then.
03it's on Kindle for $10 LOL
I hope M$ has another Sesame Street game during the press conference.
03so you could read it on your computer
CK|Ded: and gta v!
and luigis mansion 2!
know what, i think we should watch metalocalypse...
oh right gta v
cachi01: So nothing anyone should care about?
hurr no need to apologise :p
Sumica: You bstill alive?
03what the frick
03Searching for: Iago: A Novel Did you mean Iago ah Novel?
guys guess what?
CK|Ded: LUIGIS MANSION 2!
lmfaaaaaaaaao drf
LOL
yay!
what
03well
yay
03my library has both
03but only the books
Herp_Derp: I think that requires Val...whom I have not seen recently, surprisingly.
yaaaaaaaaaay
03not electronic ones
03:/
I has a baconator
CK|Ded: wait that was already announced :l
03sometimes thuey have ebooks
03that are free to library card holders XD
13later on we discover that you need to be prescanned sort of in order to be virtualized... this whole problem breaks down during the transfer from lyoko to earth
LUIGIS MANSION 2? ALL OF MY YES
Ah
Ponies47: Commercials are killing TV.
cachi01: Last year's E3 was sincerely disappointing. There were better games released over the course of the following year than the ones showcased during E3.
/me still refuses to believe that Luigi's Mansion 2 exists.
well I'd love both books
YAY
but I can't find them anywhere
Oh crap, /i need to go study for my finals D:
03Kindle
03:P
CK|Ded: yeah well lets just watch it and see if anypony surprises us
0,14what would make my E3 is Sega re-confirming Anarchy Reigns for the US
and lol bookstores are crap
Reikim: D:
ʸᵃʸ﻿
I don't have a kindle
._.
03LOL BOOKSTORES
Ponies47: Same here. But Toonami was all i watch when I was a kid
03there's a Kindle program for PC I think
CK|Ded: if not get the shtguns
Reikim; I hate commercials :[
13so if that prescan packs in some extra stuff into your genetics (or whatever there is to define YOU it works on), then there you have it
there is
Ohai Phase4
03yeah
and online too
used it a couple times
03but LOL paying for books
I dont watch Tv anymore. The only things I watch is MST3k Ponies. And Anything Streamed on Bronystate
03oh well
decent enough
:P
IMHO, physical books>ebooks, most of the time
03I had to buy one through Google
00,02ohai CupcakeWarrior
ebook pirating ftw
03IMO, movies > books
03but
03yeah
Phase4? Where?
cachi01: I wouldn't expect much, all the same.
Hello Phase4
13not so much that the genetics are always changing, just some part that indicates your state in and out of lyoko, that the scanner can do a ton of error correction on to keep you consistent on both sides
00,02RaveBrony, behind you :P
yeah Kosoveon
SuperBrony64|DOG: will just be happy something's out for Wii U
00,02ohai Twi_Fi

/me 00,02hugs Shizuka
I prefer real books to eboots
I can't wait for Nintendo to confirm for the 3rd E3 in a row that Animal Crossing 3DS is coming.
lmfao drf
13phase~
Shizuka: Well that works a little better. If we get souls or whatever to cover the psychological situation, then we're good.
Phase4: Ahh!! You scared me! D:
03I do that at my school
er

03problem, school?
How to pirate ebooks- 1. Buy ebook, 2 decrypt it, 3. Make 2 PDF, 4. Send
hi Phase4

Shizuka: I just don't like how they abuse the term DNA.
03basically
Ugh the total lack of snack food in my home is disturbing.
/me brushes Phase4's mane
I hope Nintendo announces SSB on the 3DS
03I even have a PDF unlocker
DNA is magic
^
yeah I'm gonna walk around the internet with eboots
:}D
Hello Phase4
03that can get rid of alol thost stupid no-printing restrictions
hen3ry: DNA is science

03well
cachi01: So....brace for disappointment so that you don't get surprised.
03I dunno
03are you worth $10?
00,02Pinkies4thWall, ^_^
hello ?
03let me think
IM SORRY
CK|Ded: i have a ps vita and i dont need AT&t :S
Reikim: We will all be dissapointed when no mlp games are announced
Phase4: good to hear. I'm completely exhausted in every way possible, lol
am I a prostitute? no
silly me I never left
03LOL
That's Bianca
Hi Phase4
Hey hey hey Pajaro :)
Hello Alister.
03if you were, $10 would be really lowballing it
/me hides
cachi01: Do you use their Wi-Fi?
lmfao
00,02ohai
SSB will be on 3DS coinciding with Wii U most likely
or
*hands up*
lowblowing
;D
03let me look up the other one
03I, Iago was $10
aws, you don't need to do that
k thanks
:<
Pajaro: It's ok :)
CupcakeWarrior: Very good point. At least we'll have Fighting is Magic to look forward to
CK|Ded: nopee my ps vita is wifi only not 3g
lmfao Koso
Bianca is lulzy
03that one's $15
03so
Alister: Indeed.
in the 1995 film
yea she is
cachi01: Ah, smart lad. Their 3G is AT&T only.
03$25 total
03for both books
her... boobs
03in electronic format
Alister: Seems to be missing a cutie mark.
I'm only buying a Wii U for SSB, Pokemon, Zelda, and maybe some other games
03I heard boobs, what are we talking about
/me runs
I WILL NOT BE YOUR HOBBY HORSE
Pajaro: Did you read the rules of Bronystate?
Why is that bad CK|Ded?
lmfao
CK|Ded:damn didnt knew that O_O
SSB is the only reason i'd get a Wii U
03no but seriously
03$10 for one, $15 for the other
not only is the statement itself funny, but the pun it invokes is even more so
Pinkies4thWall: you may havent rememberedd, but thats for linking me the story :)
Reikim: I can't draw one so I left it blank . But Gamer_Luna is drawing one with a cutie mark
And Legends of Equestria :D
03HML, can you convert Kindle books to PDF?
CupcakeWarrior: Because AT&T blows just as much as Verizon for equally obvious reasons.
i'll do that right now :S
uh
a sequel of majoras mask is the reason i will get a WII U
*some8
superretroworld: yeah i forgot
depends on DRM type
CK|Ded: Why are they bad?
CupcakeWarrior: And most people would rather not be bound and gagged to one provider.
I swear I had a program which did it
I did do it last year
but I deleted it
lemme find it
I'd only buy a Wii U for Pikmin 3, Rayman Legends, NSMB Mii, Zelda, SSBU… I guess its time to give up Pizza for a while.
cachi01: since when has LoZ done sequels?
yeah Kosoveon
CupcakeWarrior: Hm, let me go open up my phone bill so I can tell you
/me eats BACONATOR
Pinkies4thWall: ajoras mask is a sequel to oot
Gamer_Luna: 404 error :'(
hey does anypony know why stream is not on
ok now that i know.
Sumica: where are you?
Pinkies4thWall: zelda 2 is a zelda sequel
/me 13takes the opportunity to plug yesterday's work

Oh, mica
Alister Kinzsaw

DAT WHOOO SCARED ME
SaxyPretender: I completely forgot about Pikmin 3 :O
CupcakeWarrior: AT&T provides the same service for a hell of a lot more money, and with much more dickish customer service and increasingly harsher restrictions to their phone plans. Thus, most people don't want to stick with them.
Sumica: please wake up
13hey Sumi do your Ric Flair impression!

13oh hello mandy
Sumica: Team Avatar has teh best wheels.
Shizuka: But I dont want to nom your foot D:
and then we meet the most terrifying Teenage Girl EVER.
Tenzin is pretty cool on his own right.
SHAMEFURDISPRAY

Shizuka: Youre right it is Mandy 0.0

RAWRity: He doesn't live up.
13CupcakeWarrior: among a lot of others
I just noticed how much Azula looks like the girl from Jackie Chan
Sumica: I am loving Korra. It's just as good as the original Avatar, and possibly even better.
That explains why she isnt smiling :P
0,14Grey DeLise is up there with Tara Strong in terms of number of voice roles
PFFT this girl doesnt compare to the great and powerful mandy!
The teenage girl Lucy in Elfin Lied was more terrifying *puts up shield*

Tovler: lucy?
/me mind explodeds
Dat reasoning.
i liek lucy

13the way iroh talks later about lightning, they're probably channeling it away from important stuff like the heart and muscles
RAWRity: Lucky
RAWRity: Im not sure if I am going to get tht
RAWRity: I still need to do that
13else at the very least she should be crumpled into a ball when lightning bending :3
cachi01: kids today lol
Shizuka: So...where are they channeling it?
now maby 9 secs back
in the air
13um.... magic? :3
can't you see it
Shizuka: channeling it to the heart and muscles is the best part though
0,14snort

I'll wait to see if B/W 2 will be directly downloadable on the 3DS.

GOOD NIGHT
13but like fire, they bring combustion from nothing
night RustyMeat"
Magic *snort* *snort*
11,01If the lightning ran through their muscles, their bodies would seize up.
Well, the other way to stop the war is to let the Fire Lord win...sooo...
It's Crumbelievable!
Shizuka: I think it might be from the narutal electrons and friction from within the body and fire is from out natural heatt ^^
Well... that was insane and incredibly fun. I just met with a couple of friends... on WoW-- and we three-stormed a trio of old raids for fun. I FINALLY got to see Onyxia. AND got the "we Need More Dots" achieve.
BY CELESTIAS BEARD!
By Celestia's Beard!
Shizuka: it's explained as them channeling their Chi into energy.
and island just pinged again
zuzu is naive
00,10ouch
BEARDS
\\\\\\\\\\\\||
Quick question: if the Fire Lord died, who actually believes that the war would stop?
wow now my computer is now mor syncd past my phone
or not
damn
Whoops. Sorry, kitty on keyboard
THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!
:o
13probably depends on what it grounds to, but their chi could be building up a metric ton of electrons at their fingertips

Shizuka: bolts generally dissipate into ground tho, dont they?
/me liked JC's Avatar because he likes 80s movies.
*Shizuka
what kinds of problems is island having?
CupcakeWarrior: WAT
inb4 Azula's planning something. Oh wait, she's always planning something.
13yeah usually they're grounded by... well... ground
that is making it act funky
03the same problems as usual, random disconnection
CK|Ded: Dogs are better
03I'm not sure
My kitty is my baby
03all I do is pay for it :/
13or a buildup of positrons elsewhere in a cloud
03but I won't be anymore
:O
03once we get it moved over
my baby is my kitty
03I'll just cancel the stupid thing
When I hear the name Avatar. I think of Ultima
positrons wat
Actually, it's said earlier in the series that Firebenders use a "grounded" stance when fighting, and when you break their root stance, it weakens their attacks.
DAFUQ?
CK|Ded: Actually, Im fine with kitties as long as they arent evil
Shizuka: i didnt get that bit about how they dissipate in air
I need to
you do realize positrons are antimatter equivalents of electrons right
Shizuka: or do you mean in the show?
00,10Clearly it's gravitons

Yes! The General who does NOT get it! I OLOVE this one!
13twilight_sprinkle: yeah in the show
Shizuka: oh ok sorry i wasnt watching

Trys to win a war with avatar state, gets destroyed by it.... seems legit.
Giant yen tokens
13the lightning doesn't connect with anything most of the time
Shizuka: When in doubt? It's probably something quantum.
13it's just a bolt into nothing
Shizuka: yeah thats silly
fml
03heh
Shizuka: well... it would be a 1 hit KO if it did...

dat face...
13:3

foreeeeeeeeever! :p
This is the only episode that I ever watched through the first run of the show
So, Casshern Sins has already lost a lot of brony fans. Apparently the main character wants to kill a character named Luna

I had to do the same thing to my hair when I joined ROTC :D
otakon: thats one of the reasons i dislike the show. people are only as smart as the plot wants them to be, not realistic
CupcakeWarrior: two reasons, disguise and cutting ties with the Royal family

twilight_sprinkle: As any conflict progresses, both sides become more and more prone to silly decisions. See: Hitler trying to invade Russia in the middle of WINTER while Great Britain wasn't quite dead yet.

Reikim: if they realized the fire nation knew then they would understand that the fire lord would move to another city and there would be 0 chance, there would be nobody to attack
LOVE cancer
:D
=/
LOL /) Sumica
and Appa is happy
I heard that Skrillex has cancer, is this true?
00,10also you now know why aang dies at 80
why?
DAMN THEY'RE BIGGER THAN APPA
00,10cancer
80?
well, that'S an entrance
DAMN CANCER
Reikim: this is entirely different, hitler was trying to do blitzkrieg, if he waited it wouldnt work
Sumica: testicular cancer
Sumica: not really
here comes the good scene
probabl does
they have tamed the badgers
Sumica: plus, thought he was 70
Sumica: He dies at 66
According to official timelines, he's about 60-some when he dies IIRC
cachi01: oh
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING!?
I Like Sokka's lack of though :D
twilight_sprinkle: Same thing. Look, are you going to call that decision a plothole?
=/
MahBoi777: tired, fine but tired, really shouldn't be on but watcha goin do lol
so much facepalming
NO WAI

That's why.

Spectrum_Rush: Lol good for u
Reikim: um yes? how can you possibly say its not?
Hippie Hug
Reikim: He calls everything in the series a plothole if it isn't immediately explained.
twilight_sprinkle: Hitler's decision?
That flashback thingy in today's Korra might imply that Aang was assassinated.
/me yawns
sokka learned LOVE AND TOLERANCE :D
Reikim: and no amount of discussion is going to change his mind.
inb4 james cameron
Reikim no, i explained why he did it...
twilight_sprinkle: go watch the ending of ME3, THAT should give you something to pick apart
Don't waste your keyboard strokes.
PAUSE?
the hell?
twilight_sprinkle: You fail on knowing what a blitzkrieg is anyway. He had non-agression with Russia. Attacking AT THAT TIME was not necessary and got his troops killed.
No. Sokka learned how to survive insane hippies.
0,14did right channel come on

Cypresswolf|Blind: no idea, technical difficulties it seems
twilight_sprinkle: He blitzkrieg'd Britain, failed to follow through with it, tried it on Russia IN THE WINTER and failed, and the rest is history.
De ja vu
Reikim: i know what blitzkrieg is. stalin was also planning an attack, he couldnt have waited
and then FMA Brotherhood was on

LUNA IS BEST NATION
eh, this doesn't really work
Reikim: As shown at least onec every week on the Military Channel, and once a month on H2.
thats only 2 nations

and Meanwhile would be proud
love this vid
It started off as criticising a show, now it's turned into an analysis of WWII Battcle strategy. I love it.
RAWRity: yeah? do nt make such disgusting claims as to me defending hitler, im only explaining his actions in terms of when he attacked, not reasoning
Does this make us all ban evaders? :P
I guess this was playing when prince-lemon banned me for no reason

twilight_sprinkle: They could have not taken advantage of the eclipse. Then they could have gone through with a much, much longer war, which they probably would have lost. They gambled everything on one chance, however small. Just as Hitler did.

Er, actually, Hitler didn't "have to" attack Stalin in winter. He could have just held the line to prevent Stalin's attack, he CHOSE to advance deep into Siberia during the Russian winter. So yeah, he's still a moron for what he did. >_>

0_o ok just saw a Hot Pocket cm w/ Tobuscus lol
Blue cat people, IIRC.
The second problem is that WoW isn't going 'casual'. It is getting the kinks and bugs out. Think about it, WoW was the first truely MASSIVE Multiplayer game. They are the first to encounter problems that others did not. Them giving blue marks on the map and 'hand holding' as the die hard gamers call it is really them working out kinks to make the game more fun.

Reikim: youre twisting things. they were outmatched, on enemy territory, had 10 minutes, and if they knew it was a trap( which the ysaid they didnt), they would never attack
Oh Hai Science

Reikim: are you kidding me. really, a casino. in the casiono you can lose a small amount if you stop early..
SPACE
Monfang: Well, I am. And when I started playing, (middle of Wrath, didn't have a pc up to the challenge before that) it was STILL easier than what I had been playing on my PS2/Xb9ox360-- Final Fantasy 11 online is HARDCORE.
FlareChaser: Dat impossible task.
I love how Pandora is a moon of Jupiter
urgh yeah
I've passed a few of them god damnit
00,10Sorry FlareChaser you are not AJ
space one of the many frontiers
Jimmy Carter wanted us to use Solar Power, THE FIEND
Reikim: not to mention, like i said, the firelord couldve moved somewhere else and that would be it
03is it worth $10?
03:P
Sumica: Love me please? <3~
lol
xD
D:
03and $15 for the other
Yah
03I can make you PDFs

:o
Reikim: tell me if the firelord was gone, how would they defeat him
03I can't pirate this stupid program
twilight_sprinkle: But every day, people lose hundreds of thousands. Why? Because hope tends to erase common sense.
/me cries
03and it costs $20
xd
03:/
SHOO BE DOO SHOO BEE DOO
And let me ask, Kencolt. Did you have an easier time finding friends in WoW or Final Fantasy?

twilight_sprinkle: That's just the nature of humanity
:D
/me hugs Rain
13Tovler: they did top gun?
Monfang: There's not a single "hardcore " WoW p[layer I ever met that could handle that game. And well, I had an easier time finding friends in FF11, but that's partly because you could NOT LEVEL UP EXCEPT WITH A FULL PARTY.
hiya Rain
0,14...there's a rifftrax of Top GuN?

/me giggles "ohai, Shizuka" :3
Fine, I'll get Shizuka to love me.
Reikim: what hope? he is GONE, they simply dont know where he is!! what do you think, they would risk all fo their men hoping the firelord would forget his keys in the palace adn return during the siege?
13<3
Shizuka: do you love me? :3
<3
twilight_sprinkle: yes.
Well...bed time for me everypony! Good night and behave yourselves! ;) And now i apologize to Shizuka for leaving :(

00,10it dont count if you guys watched the movie 5 time before you riff it
TeamBreezy
13Tovler: oh god i want them to riff twister so much
Right. So let me ask again, Kencolt. Do you think more people played ahd had fun with The original Mario Brothers or with Super Mario Brothers?
bye RaveBrony! take care!
13would make my lifetime

Bye RaveBrony
Shizuka: why haven't they?
00,10they did riff it Shizuka
:P
SaxyPretender: do you love me? :(
Shizuka: lol
And youhad to NOT be a jerk. And you had to deal with the fact that half the time half of your party only spoke Japanese, and the both of you had to learn how to use the auto-translators.
00,10but it was part of the big oscarshow thing they did
Weeblos
XD
twilight_sprinkle: No, not at all. I very much believe that real people, in such a situation, would actually potentially make that decision.
0,14>.>
13aw
oh god.. Matrix Revolution Bot
Shizuka: They constantly make jabs at Twister but they've never done it
And I have no opinion about Mario.
FREEDOM
I'm off too
twilight_sprinkle: The one thing that defies all rational logic - the ONLY thing - is the human mind.
Night everypony
Darkts3: ikr
SaxyPretender: ...wha...why... :'(
hm.. cannibals?
Shizuka: wouldnt you, for example, agree that the part where they attacked the fire nation and were caught by surprise in the trap, even though they knew azula knew their plans, is a huge plot hole
LOL
lol
XD
lol
/me falls out of his chair

That was great

hi VioletGreySha how are you?
How to kill a Navi... SHOOT IT MANY TIMES
Whats so bad about papyrus font?
Reikim: give me a single reason the firelord would return during the siege,
I'm going to sum up everything said over the next two hours: the plot isn't all that great. But the special effects are like SEX mixed with MORE SEX.
hay MahBoi777 iam fine just woke up
13papyrus is just terrible...
13mostly cause it's way overused
link and navi?
wow, that was oodd

VioletGreySha: ah, good lol
0,14...that's what she said
13but it's also like comis sans in that it's just terrible..
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not arguing that. I'm arguing that humans are stupid and make stupid decision.
Shizuka: especially thanks to this movie.
Shizuka: Human Paladins are overused..
Shizuka: COMIC SANS
Shizuka: But I like comic sans
otakon: for example how do they communicate with the Avatars? Radio? Then how can they communicate with them near the tree?
I hope nothing happens to the Deku tree in this movie.
Oh, this... not a movie I'm interested in. WQell, I'm off... dailies and dungeons to do.

twilight_sprinkle: Good god, man, quote IQ statistics one more time and I'm just going to stop. IQ is not the be-all and end-all of intelligence testing, is notoriously flawed, and doesn't reflect someone's tendency towards being emotionally unbalanced.
Reikim: jsut admit its a plothole, a huge one. they probably had it cuz of the writers strike
wher can i watch my little pony ep :3

HELLHOLLE!
wat?
11,02Buy my dog? O.O
Sumica: wait, if the gravity is low wouldn't that mean the average person would be stronger in general?
cute
03I guess that's why it's on version 4 now
<3 cute
11,02But...I already bought him when he was a puppy O~O
What I find funny is, all the special effects and grand visual expanses in this film were already achieved 30 years ago by Studio Ghibli with Nausicaa, and for considerably less money.
03which I can't find for free :/
00,10in thiory
xD
Shizuka: I can inform you, with 100% certainty, that corporate greed is very good at taking crap writers and cranking out sequels out of ANYTHING.
Dogs are the WORST pets ever.
SuperBrony64: you put him in a basket so...
RAWRity: eeyup
11,02:<
0,14>Dogs
Cats are obviously better.
0,14>worst pets ever

Sumica: well, look at the moon
xD
SuperBrony64 you wouldn't ever get rid of... Charlie?
Cats > Dogs
Nausicaa wasn't live action.
:| what wer you saying?
:3
SaxyPretender: WHO SAID THAT?
11,02He was at PetSmart with us and he was buying stuff 3
were*
11,02:3
yeah, I defended this movie.
DeathStar: The dogs name is Charlie
:3
otakon: Iknow, who would say that?
feed him an apple
11,02Biglaw: No :<
Tovler: it's a okay movie, but not fantastic
And I had a bronystate derp
shopping is important for a dog
CupcakeWarrior: i think I'v seen a pic of him before
:3
Tovler: and yet it was still more visually impressive.
11,02Biglaw: Never ;A;
Ferngully, oh god
00,10that is also the thyory as to why every one is bigger there too
Mr.Puppy
Any other pets > Dogs.

11,02FlareChaser: Get a heart :)
0,14I'm jsut looking for some tush
RAWRity: Yeah, but you can't really hope to beat Studio Ghibli. It was a losing battle from the beginning.
0,14later Derpy|Asleep
night Derpy|Asleep!
he got legs! he knows how to use em!
03sigh
It just amuses me that they spent 300 million dollars and 5 years to achieve in live action what animation has been doing for decades with nearly no budget.
lol
xD
LOL
Sumica, lower gravity allows for frailer bones, so the size would stay the same. Higher oxygen concentration allows for larger growth
RAWRity: once again, agreed
SuperBrony64: :'(
d3rb: Lol
And FlareChaser, I did have two cats, but they both died within a year of eachother
I get the feeling Prometheus will seem dated too.
Well, it's already waaaay too late, but good night everypony. Enjoy Shizuka's rifftrax, and these amazing SFX.

GilDash: Oh, nothing that bad. I think I drank too much caffeine. Befoer I left for a recital I was performing at, I drank a cup of coffee. After that, went to McD's and got an iced coffee and had a bunch of colas.
