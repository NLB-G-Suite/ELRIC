I KNEW IT

how do you do that thing where you specifically highlight some one and send them a message, but every one can see it?
That was a huge hint to him being evil~
Equalists = Communists
Tarlok is WORST FRICKING PONY.
lol
dat totalitarian
this show gives me conflicting feelings. it could probably have a really good story if it took it very seriously. but they try to make it too comedic and play it off it seems
I do not like Tarlok
OH YOU FOOLS
Also, Council is worst council
lol: write the first letters of someones name then hit tab
panda,did you get the link for the 3rd pony in The Element Ponies?
dat smirk
he's EVIL!
Is he a chancellor? Cuz if he is then he's evil.
only gonna create more hate
lol
TO*

The way the council always conforms to Tarlok makes me think he's got some kind of control over them.
lol is not the best name to choose
lol
