11,01Why sequels? Money. Why remakes? Money.
Because here in Aus, it's kinda 50/50
11,01Why that reason? Shit economy.
Some people, including myself, can't give two fucks about religion
i dont belong to any religion, but i dont deny their existance

the only religion i cant stand is scientology
11,01Don't get mad about it.

I think ever religion is wrong is and is merely just a believe to help guide people in the right direction with morals and stories.
every
11,01A lot of people are turned away from religion because of extremists that shove their beliefs down other's throats.
11,01Or condemn everyone that doesn't think they way they do.

11,01Exactly.
11,01RAWRity.
I'm not religious myself, but I've seen many of my friends find comfort through faith, and I'd never try to take that away from them.
as long as no one try to shove their religion down my throat you can keep with it

Hello everyone :)
it's was only a couple hours ago, and one of the gunmen is still on the loose.
WOW. That's pretty brutal
Well... damn... that's just fucking senseless.
Even by my standards, I didn't lol.
Ok maybe a bit

but seriously, that's just...awful
:P

DO IT
oh my fuck.
11,01Dunno.
Because no-one cares if a family in Russia get shot. It is about who's the popular cuntry
Not sure I want to know what's going on.
11,01People get shot all of the time in the US as well.
Well, that's a strange event to shoot people at.
11,01I guess it was because it happened at a movie premiere.
11,01A rare event in itself.
Makes sense, I suppose.
thats probably some sick irony
apparently a baby got shot too
That's the point. US is crazy about the gun laws. GUNS KILL PEOPLE NOT THE PEOPLE THEM SELVES. Be like Aus, RESTRICT THE GODDAMN GUNS
11,01K.
lol.
Like, please, don't turn this into some advocacy for gun restriction or something.
11,01People using guns kill people.

But these shootings are constantly happening, and people just go "Well fuck logic" EVERYONE HAVE A GUN
It dosen't make sense
http://www.9news.com/video/9newsonline.aspx -- live feed apparently
:P
hey guys
1984.
11,01We do have gun restrictions in the US.
That sparked the debate on guns, which lead to gun laws
Not very good ones though
Any particular reason why they shot 10 people?
11,01You can't just go to the store and buy a firearm like you buy a bottle of soda.
I know
hey guys
:I
That's one loud PING noise...
I come in, first thing I see: seriously weird remark about soda bottles. Dat Nitt :3
Because surely some states are more lenient on gun laws than others.
Here you need a license even for the puniest gun.
11,01Checkpoints?
11,01They'll set something up.
Something happens for a reason though...
*thoug
*though
dang keyboard
11,01I've never had to stop when I cross a state line.
11,01And I've crossed many state lines.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Colorado
weapon laws varies by state
unless there's an actual gunmen on the loose and near state lines, they generally don't set anything up, simply because most police departments don't have the resources or man power.
lol indeed:|
:I
well alot of people do carry for self protection
which is why you dont hear about mass shootings in Texas very often
Why did they kill 10 people? Did they ask them why, did they get away? Oh wait...Fox News reported this, I guess we'll never get the full story as usual.
And I'll state again: usually shooters gained their guns through illegal means.
actually, at the 1st of July, knives became illegal here
11,01We're more concerned with stupid things. If anyone even whispers "gun control," the conservatives would have a shit fit.
11,01Or anyone.
Knives? Like a Machete?
WOW
See why though
Uh oh popoo
Ello there everypony.
you see, that is why i cannot in good concience live in the UK
uh oh poo poo
I have a firm belief that I shall always be secure in my person, even if that means dealing with the situation in a more... permenent fashion
11,01Bad statement there.
Hmm
we really need to make this a thing about the US now?
I didnt say that I would kill out of anything, but as a last resort
Here it's: let's not spend millions in education, Let's build combat planes noone's gonna use!
11,01We use them.
hmm... It doesn't sound like a healthy dude though if you die from a punch to the face
Actually if you hit someone hard enough, it'll kill them in one shot
Yes I agree...it's getting me depressed too.
Pony time! :)
Assuming you're not a fucking midget
Hah
(But doubt in that, tbh)
I hope not :I
There's always going to be Psycho's it's just a matter of placing laws to stop them
Hey ponies, I'm back from my nothingness
I know I had more d'aww pictures somewhere, but with 130+ tabs, they're hard to find.
I mean.
as for knives, AFAIK, Switchblades and Ballistic knives are illegal, anything else is up to state and local laws, usually by blade length
130 TABS WUT
UR KIDDING ME RIGHT
Seriously, if you're honestly willing to murder a theatre full of innocent people, gun prohibition isn't going to suddenly dissuade you. This isn't about gun restrictions or anything else. It's about 2 sick fucks hurting and killing people.
^
again, it varies by state
than
Eheh, they're criminals, they'll get the guns if they really want them.
Yeah.
How about, actually improve the police? As in less screwing around and more paying attention to guarding safety.
not to mention where I live, Sport Hunting is also prevelant
: D
^_^
^i undestand
Silly throat infections.
No, because Cars aren't designed to kill
Guns are
Guns are made for the military to kill
Guns are made for Hunters to kill
you can shoot NOT to kill you know
But cars can kill. It's been proven.
yes
Guns don't kill people, people kill people with guns.
My point
its not really about guns now
people can kill people with ... really anything
yes
11,01Getting light outside. Time to try and get some sleep.
...I don't know.
But guns are SPECIFICALLY made to kil
Gnight..or day, Nittany_Discord~
And then you get scared when someone KILLS someome with agun'
hahhhahhah
*Nighty night
/me can't breathe
night dude
ye
That sucks
11,01Didn't bother me.
AND I ZOOMED IN. FML.
Prove me wrong.
:D
A person can't really kill 14 people with a toothbrush
Besides, even if we didn't have guns, I'd still have the plasmaquantum phaseblade
LOL
HAHHAHAHAHAHHAH
no
Use blanks
and police
point exactly
Amnesia in Summer Sale? Nonononono.
wow, that is some crazy shit that went down
Is flamethrower considered as a gun?
isnt tear gas a ... restriced material?
Which is the only thing I can afford that I want. :I
/me has went through tear gas training, NOT FUN
in theory its a restricted matrieal
hmm
gas canisters can be bought, maybe not teargas
Hi
Maybe it's because I don't live in America.
umm if it was fully automatic, it would have been illegal anyway
AHAHHAHAHAH
"Go to the movies," they said. "See Batman," they said.
THE PAIN
probably requires a special license required, but that doesn't matter if it was aquired illegally
Whats the mocie gonna be??
WELL SAY SOWWEZZ
Whats the movie does anyone know?
Since they weren't in the same room as the gunman.
Unfortuantely, popcorn is the one thing I don't have that's equipped with some high-tech weapons
"Watch an action movie" they said
I want high-tech popcorn. We really have been lacking on the pop-tech lately.

05need to take my mind of things
We're on the brink of panic.
:)
Its like an Oldschool rpg

FIREBALLS!

THUNDERBOLT

00,02ah
Hey everypony!
00,02Lil_B, lubuntu == lxde right?
00,02has a start menu like thing, should be under network
:)
00,02or you can press alt+f2 and run xchat
Did he just pick up a chest?
Buffer monster.
00,02Lil_B, you might need to run 'sudo apt-get install xchat'
00,02the install bit is important
pony*
00,02Malmortius, Twilight
:(
No one likes rarity it seems
^ thats the best way to go about it i think, all pony is best pony
Inb4 ded
ITS A TRAP
Heh
woo!
Getting killed by slimes? Worst. Possible. Thing. EVER.
"well... we're f*cked..."
zzzz
Going to sleep? REALLY?
I think each pony has a reason to be a persons favourite, there is no wrong answer.
00,02all ponies are best, some are more best than others
>more best
I smiled.
"sudo apt-get install Xchat" and "run Xchat" didn't do anything maybe I should stick with Mint where its preinstalled XD
00,02Texasboykc09, that was the idea ^_^
man
00,02Lil_B, define nothing
We're reading animal farm in Engrish at the moment.
00,02Lil_B, it doesnt say anything
00,02?
00,02it should ask for a password or run apt
I bought 0.
Plus we have 190+ games, I think that'senough
