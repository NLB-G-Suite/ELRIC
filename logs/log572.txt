I wonder if the Minion Translation ap still works when you play this on the DVD
gotta admit, this movie had pretty good music. Not one song came up that I didn't enjoy
Considering who's hating on The Dark Knight Returns, I'm even more interested in this movie now.

1,11The overal consensus I'm finding for Rises seems to be that it's a great movie, but it falls short on being a Batman Sequel for the Nolanverse. People are underwhelmed by how Bane exits the film [not posted here due to spoilers, and I haven't seen it yet...] and admit it's full of plot holes in the story. Many (including myself) Highly doubt it'll top Avengers in the Box office.

I may be wrong but isn't that rather what "he said"?... And who is "he" anyway, and why is he saying random stuff all the time? Maybe he should just sit down and think a little, come up with a decent thought, perhaps an argument on the current state of soceity's understanding of "art" and make a worthwhile statement that will make others join him in an engaging conversation. Wouldn' that be better than just saying random things like

08,01ZOMG
Hahaha
1,11If season 3 is the last season, I can see a sh*tload of bronies coming together to form Ponyville Adventures or something like that...
04Or Rotten Tomatoes
08,01Dark Crystal!
I would give up ponies for that
04Whichever
3oh
08,01\o/
Really?
3that movie
08,01but i'm not sure if it's an A
The Dark Crystal!!!
3I know that one
1,11DARK CRYSTAL?!
REALLY?
1,11Ho shit.
3it's the one with the puppets
Yes
3personally, I hated it
to not have to go out and just watch it here?
Pfft.
08,01it's kind of the spiritual successor to labyrinth
3but let's see what imdb says
Inb4 goddamnit
inb4 it A or B fight!
Dark Crystal is B
dat SuperBrony64
it IS B
it's a cult classic
It sounds like a B. Since I've never heard of it.
...I forgot the actual glass.
00,10good thing we have the longer intermition now for the way we like to debate things eh?
13that is also why i made it twice as long as the previous intermission
It is a B
1,11Staurn: It is totally an A movie. High budget, high gross, lots of people who loved it.
/me is checking Rotten Tomatoes
13so much debate lately over A or B
04Indeed, good thing to have this
13because ponies keep picking bad
08,01Dovahkiin: fair do's
11,01Funny we've never heard of it.
dem bees
11,02What did I miss? O.O
God what was the deal last week?
00,10we?
13richfiles is the user that kept whining about us to EQD... and yet here he is
00,10Speak for your self i love it
A and B need some more defined parameters.
08,01SuperBrony64: Dark Crystal!
I dunno, Dark Crystal seems more like a cult film
Indeed
IshFrustratedPony: it is
No, so much debate over A or B because there is no concrete definition of the two that everyone can agree to.
11,02Dark Crystal?
04Jim Hensen does Tolkien with the movie?
11,02I heard of it
04Interdad
It was not very well known when it was first released
Shizuka, who was doing what?
04Eh, could be our A
00,10ok so while they debate it lets move on
richfiles?
Shizuka why was he whinning ? or about what ?
Mfw it says the name in her post and people still ask...
11,02Doesn't have the muppets in it...
1,11It's Jim Hensen! How can it NOT be an A movie?!
13remember when we first started locking side rooms during the week
05,15Yeah, it's got a big budget it made it's money back and received Decent reviews.
13he was raising all kinds of hell in EQD comments
04Was Labyrinth A?
oh yeah
08,01^
I don't read EQD comments. What was his beef?
13there were other things he would bitch about too but i forget
what's the A B fight over?
well I think that kind of went over like a lead ballon at first anyway
people read EQD comments ?
I haven't gone to EqD in months, so no I don't remember
Tovler: Dark Crystal tonight
13labyrinth was our B just before thanksgiving
Dark Crystal is B, next
You remind me of the babe...wait wrong movie
1,11It qualified for B due to its cult following.
IshFrustratedPony: Labyrinth GREAT MOVIE but still a B
13see ponies, this is why intermission 2.0 is 20 minutes long
04Ah, okay
05,15Dat thinking ahead
Awesome, Gondor is a snowglobe
13to accomodate mod debates like this one!
3this could qualify for both A and B honestly
with DERPY!
1,11Back when we had that as our requirment for B. Not sure if you all changed it or not.
00,10I predict a reroll 132 Littlepip with MLP g1 movie
11,01For B.
G1 movie!
11,01Lol.
3really?
11,02I think you could just leave it as an A Movie choice.
05,15I...think it's elligable again
YES!
3we just watched that
08,01reroll, because it's not eligible yet?
Fuck rerolls, play that!
11,01It's been show before.
no
it's not eligible
13it is sadly eligible
3yeah, we watched that a few months ago I believe
Ah fudge,.#
04:(
plus it's barely an hour
00,10*headdesk*
05,15Oh god no
3didn't we? I remember we did
otakon you're not eligible
05,15NOOOOOO
04We can't reroll?
3it was for some event
08,01actually quite liked the G1 movie
04Like
05,15NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
it doesn't even count AS a movie
04Seriously >_>
0,14guess it stays then
Shaddup we're watching it.
08,01it wasn't bad; it wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't bad
1,11Didn't we watch it right before Season 2?
04Wait
08,01i think i gave it 5/10
no
NO NO NON
8,6we watched smooze around the anniversary didn't we?
NONONONONONONNONONN
04Did the movie have the rainbow of darkness?
GODDAMMIT NO
00,10we also watched it for the oneyear thing
YES. YES.
REROLL AND GET A PROPER MOVIE GODDAMMIT
00,10Smooze
08,01Ghosties: it was the one with the smooze, it hink
11,01Ghosties: No. That's the pilot.
04NO
04NOOOOOOOO
Nein, watch the smooze.
04The pilot was awesome
11,02Soooooo....
I'm tired of SHIT B MOVIES
1,11The MLP MOvie has the smooze
/me cries
11,02What movie we watching :3
I'm ok with it. I've no problem skipping BMN now
Deal w/ it
08,01SuperBrony64: smooze goo
the MLP movie was the only time i won the lottery :3
Meanwhile: if it was octaviaspride you'd have a shit fit.
04You're a rainbow in the dark~
05,15Wait, he's right we did watch it for an event.
11,02This is almost as bad as walking around in the Blockbuster with a two for one coupon and can't decide on the second movie.
That'd be different.
05,15THAT MEANS IT'S INELLIGABLE!
04...really?
04Loophole?
3yeah
08,01wait, which event?
no it wouldn't
11,02Ofc not, it's only for movies played during BMN.
3it was an unofficial stream for something
it would be "Deal w/it" territory
Bronystate 2.0 event?
3I think it had to do with Lulu
Yeah it would, it would've been Octavias_Pride
but SuperBrony64, blockbuster no longer exists
11,02The 6 month rule is for ONLY BMN
13ohhhhh jaja
11,01We watched it during our anniversary I think.
13we did play for luna
NO NO
11,01Or something.
04So was that her movie for the anniversary?
And Octavias_Pride isn't allowed to win anymore by international law of go-screw-yourself.
If the White House's War Room was real, even it wouldn't have the amount of critical debate going on here about movies every week :D
the goddamn rule counts
WE SHOWED IT
13see why i made it longer
11,01Or it was during season finale week.
it doesn't show again
Since Wrek plays movies all the damn time now...
13by now the normal intermission would be over
you know how I knwo?
1,11No Derpy. Muffins aren't an instrument.
3yeah, Nitt's right
08,01but that wasn't BMN, so it doesn't count, surely?
We haven't even decided the first movie yet
Indeed. Really for the best.
3so that was April
00,10inb4 call of hax 40 Me with flash gordon.
bc MY moive was passed over bc it was goddamn shown during an event
08,01or is an executive decision being made?
Good grief
13also regs are special, regs get the youtube version: http://youtu.be/zmBlxzbLj5s
11,016-month rule is for BMN and anniversary week.
3It's a Reroll guys
04I'd say any official stream counts, but that's just me
and that is going in my favs
Yay~
Faved.
so much jimmy rustling
08,01well, you're presumably in charge, Ghosties :P
3it was an event, and it was in fact official
3so, I say reroll
Dat Freaky Fred.
Aww, you so kind, Shizu.
1,11^
yeah damn straight
/me hugs Shizuka "You are awesome"
08,01but... i was kinda looking forward to it...
04I dunno
04I mean...ugh
04Just look at that
Too bad you aren't a girl otakon, then you might get a hug back.
04On the screen
yay~
1,11*looks at Intermission vid* ironic
/me huggles Shizuka
/me shudders
worst part of intermission: watching the mods slowwwwllllllyyyyyyyyyy come to a decision on anything.
Ikr.
RAWRity: lol
I knew I should have skipped the lottery ;-; so much fail.
04As...bad as it is, I say stick with it
So, reroll on A and B?
or just A
Woah that's a full fail, all the way. Double fail, ohmigod
13worry not ponies... i am as frustrated as you
3no Ty, we just went over that
04If it's BMN eligible, then stick with it
and put Dark Crystal as B?
otakon, we've gotten no where
13i am just here to watch reactions und go back to busting street racers
3it's not because we just streamed it a few months ago
1,11But it's not BMN eligible.
this is why shizu had to make the Intermission vid 20 mins
3for an official stream
but seriously Dark Crystal is B.
3it took place of BMN
05hence forth reroll
yes it is
1,11What was the reroll?
RAWRity: Yeah, she said that, like 4 minutes ago.
05,15looks like we might even exhaust this one
what did I miss?
an awesome B
04Ah, then why were we waiting for me?
05lets get goign or well have to extend the itnermission with another 10 minutes
I nominate the mod lottery debates for B Movie
will we ever reach a decision?
3because your'e the boss man
3anyway, let's reroll
fluttercry: Do Dark Crystal as B and just goddamn reroll A
No.
04...soooo
Never.
1,11Reroll. Tell.
04Why wait for me?
GabeMoist: WMC
fluttercry: Dark Crystal B, Reroll A!
0,14GabeMoist, that gets WMC
just. bucking. rerol.
04If it's not eligible for BMN then...
04OH GOD DERPY
There will never be a decision because there aren't enough bloody guidelines.
0,14before we show it
08,01"A and B movies must wait six months before being eligible for vote in the Lottery again; this is noted on our list of past movies."
We are all High Roller
08,01was the non-BMN stream of it on the backlog?
just reroll.
There isn't enough stuff in place to avoid this shit.
00,10yfw I rerolled 5 min ago and you ingnored it
Iz not hard decision.
*Monty Python GET ON WITH IT*
3tell us again Sumi
13which is the spreadsheet, though i haven't been keeping up with our non movie night events on that
not it's not
HELL JUST SWITCH THEM OUT
05i thought you were joking sumi<3
00,10inb4 call of hax 40 Me with flash gordon.
Dark Crystal, B
REROLL A
Shizuka: This is just an idea, but when a third wants to keep, a third wants to reroll and a third is undecided, why not set the roller to binary and basically flip a coin? 1: Keep it, 2: Reroll?
13haaaaaax
13SHIP IT what's our pony eps
05the hAAX
05,15Flash! AHHH HE SAVED EVERYONE OF US
there. we gots a reroll.
08,01...
Why not just figure out the goddamn rules for the movies better.
now lets boogie on down.
8,6ok, now get on with the rolls for pony episodes
13no one agrees
08,01by our rules, if it's not in the backlog, it is eligible
God, why is Civ III music so good.
Shizuka: Do they ever?
wait waht happened?
Flash,ooooooooooooo, master of the universe
So take charge and slap everymod else in the face.
1,11A Movie: Dark Crystal. B Movie: Flash Gordan (ironically, I saw Ted durring my break, which features Flash.)
05,15Every few months we try and decide A and B guidelines...
Shizuka: TAKE CHARGE!
00,10Damn you baconmane with your reroll votes
13oh believe me... i try...
08,01but but ponies!
I think a universal rule of humankind is that humans can never agree.
Right, so it's an eternal slapfest.
well it was worth a shot
You know what, you should let us do it.
GODDAMMIT IF ONLY I WAS A MOD
06Onto pony episodes? c:
0,14Kammerjunk, i disagree
RisingPretender: o u
1,11Onto pony eps
00,10Whiteheart 91 with The Show Stoppers
Seriously, just change the order
otakon: You have more obligations to fulfill than moderating.
oh hey, CMC episode
05btw sumi: was it the 1936, 1980 version or what?
Dark Crystal, B and then reroll A
Meanwhile: like what?
I vote for the same Ep
/me 08,01grumbles and flicks smooze goo at everyone
otakon: Like the fact that you're living with relatives?
So, I missed it, what movies are on for next week?
No offense, obviously, but priorities man.
0,14no one knows,
0,14EspyLacopa
Meanwhile: you're point? I wouldn't mod all the time
04Hey, CMC
04Excellent
otakon: ...sorry. Your*
I was under the impression that mods watched a good number of these movies.
my water bottle is empty :(
EspyLacopa: it's Dark Crystal for A and Flash Gordon for B
00,1077 starflash with Season 2 A friend in deed
after MUCH debate
MUCH debate
and Smile song. good eps.
Knytt... <3
We seriously made it?
0,14fitting slide is fitting
and I didn't win :(
A friend with mead is a friend indeed.
Seriously, we should bring this whole A or B crap in here and let us do it.
I vote this lottery debate for WMC
I tasted mead once. It is brilliant.
08,01yay
GabeMoist: I second this notion.
08,01i love that episode!
If no agreement can be reached, it should be settled by a vote
08,01>.>
I've always been interested in trying mead, but alcohol ain't really my thing.
8,6A Movie: The Dark Crystal - richfiles
8,6B Movie: Flash Gordon - Sumica
8,6Pony 1: The Show Stoppers - Whiteheart
8,6Pony 2: A Friend in Deed - starflash
Kammerjunk I need moar wenches and mead
Goddammit I'm never going to win again.
0,14I prefer resolutions to be done by Thunderdome
Or just take a list of the A movies and figure out an average from their scores.
lol, buffering
I got one win and then I was screwed over because they wanted to go by 31 day months
Really. Why can't you do that?
0,14also, I've never won in my one year of being here ;__;
I'm never going to win at all.
otakon: just have hope. I've won the lottery three times now.
WHO THE HELL GOES BY A 31 DAY MONTH AS A STANDARD!?
I won. . .a copy of Dota2.
08,01awesome
/me 08,01does a little dance
EspyLacopa: isn't that free though?
RisingPretender: I've been here since the third movie night and I have won one pony episode. Don't you dare have the nerve to complain.
04That's it for this week's lotto, everyone!
04Enjoy the last two minutes of intermission
08,01Dovahkiin: i suppose
No idea, Otakon!
0,14but I haven't won anything ;___;
0,14ever ;__;
Meanwhile, you still won something
At least people have stopped picking random movies at imdb's bottom 100 for B.
I do know, however, that I've never really played it.
yeah
First was when I got the free drawing from Wrek, next was pony ep with Sisterhooves Social, and third was B movie for Wicker Man original
3-m?
08,01-m.
1,11-m
you lucky bastard
Where was Gondor when nice job Shizuka?
Quack!
inb4 Meanwhile makes a "Where was Gondor when _________?" joke
you know i like it how it shows the bronystate intermission thing
In the end, from when I did try it. . .I -loathed- the interface it used.
And here I thought 20 minutes wouldn't be enough of an intermission. What with the mods bickering and all.
my childhood had too much asterix for this not to be awesome
/me hugs Shizuka , intermission is awesome
sooo.. did I get this right..the B movie was streamed sometime before..outside the movie night...so without having been voted on like we just did? (/=/voted again) And that is why it is not eligible? Or it might be you just didn't like some pony's movie choice. :(

Hm...sounds like a good line up.
I'm so pumped for Flash Gordon
I WANT TOOT RINGTONE

Hello K_A

damn, i lost my internet :(
this chat just exploded
richfiles: Thank you! I've been pushing DC for months!
otakon dota is free but you need a beta invite right now
/me turns off Mom's cell phone
love flash gordon. awesome movie
moinecraft
it's free
but you need an invite
odd
/me TUrns on his cell phone and sets his ringer to high
Meanwhile: FUCK YEA I'M RIGHT
I'd be pissed if I had voted the first B movie
otakon it still in beta
BTW, yes it is what I would call an A movie. But then my B movie choice was a Sun Ra flick, so my standards for B are probably tougher.
Stupid reroll. I've afraid to pick ambiguous A/B movies because of this new reroll thing.
richfiles: you do realize that DC is a B movie right?
AttacktheAndalite: Yeah, but I was before you. ;P
No prob... Did the survey during the CLOSING CREDITS of the A movie too! :D
Alright, Time's up! Let's do this!
I sure do love buffering
otakon: Wrong.
ahhhhhh :D
leroy?
/me claps because intermission is over

Also, good job on the intermission.

:O
love the intermission
ehm: :$
richfiles did the survey at the LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE
childhood
lawlz
one heck of an intermission. Too entertaining, I had to pay attention and crap!
Would Downfall be an A or B movie? It might be A movie style, but it had a shoestring budget
Pttthhhhht Dark Crystal was a HUGE movie... it is just created differently
goddammit
Um...... what?
This brings back memories... :)
Woah, they actualy found it?
04Welcome to wacky world, nyuck nyuck!
and i already saw this movie... i'll be downloading guild wars
old moooovie time :D
Hello Childhood
WalkerPony89: what is Downfall?
kill me
Heh i like how the ponies sit in front row center
please
is this animated or not animated?
what movie is this?
animated
richfiles: Exactly. A movie doesn't have to be popular to be A.
oh
What... the..
it's animated as far as i can remember
Asterix?
04The wacky twelve tasks
it's based off of a French comic
Ghosties: Three Stooges much? :P
05,15Downfall is the movie about Hitler isn't it?
also goddamn advert decides to pop up AFTER intermission is over >_<
intermission was great
i wanna be a pie!
1976.
oh, asterix
wait, Asterix?
This is gonna be good.
wat is this?
fluttercry it's
i could't read the copy right :(
Dark Crystal has a huge following too!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: do you have any extra keys
asterix and obelix :D
Really, this fudge wouldn't happen if the A and B movies were more defined. Think of all the time you could spend getting drinks during the intermission that wasn't spent on figuring out whether to reroll or not.
learned about that lil fucker in French classes.
sweeeet
fluttercry: Ja.
i been voting that and schlinder list
otakon: You know those "Hitler..." videos with that dramatic scene of Hitler yelling? That's from Downfall. It's a film about... Well, his Downfall
This is my Childhood. Back when most Children Movies were Funny and smart
okay somebody's French
This tiny viking can go eat a dick.
Is this based on that comic?
Realisation?

dat garbage
Ghosties: Same here
BURD
Meanwhile: they would
What is this?
ummmmm
OH COME ON!
What the crap?
From what i remember, the movie is actually mashup of 1 or 2 stories
it's not even in FRENCH!

Ghosties: also French and had a GREAT GODDAMN HBO series

Although the Asterix comics and graphic novels can be found at Barnes and Noble. I saw some of them there today
Ah, I see they must to twelve tasks.
I just want to try to enjoy this movie without my country (which has nothing to do with this movie in any way shape or form) from being constantly bashed and hated on.
Hercules is from Greek mythology, not Roman. The creators of this fukd up
Operatorpony, Zeus turned Hercules a god
Get on the hydra's back
also ceasar's logic is rather retarded here
Ictiv: Shoot.
Kandarihu: what is you're country again?
Calcos323 Hercules is roman
Runtime: 1:18
Herakles is Greek
Well.
they are the same
Thesius from Hades?
I believe that's all accurate.
OohShiny: ...really?
Fluttershy could do them all
just changed name
OohShiny: indeed. Heracles is the Greek name.
I was thinking that watching a French film, you might be reminded of a very specific Spy...
What if some the creatures don't exist?
Kandarihu: dude it's not bashing the US where is it bashing it?
08,01Calcos323: that's not true
00,02oh shit
This sounds like one very long drawn out Red Bull commercial.

I acctually enjoyed this more than Despicable Me

fapplebloom: Gaston

I would make a comment about what they did to the 4th wall, but Tosh showed me why that would be a bad idea

I just couldn't miss this movie.
Dermathil: I don't know about you, but I liked Asterix's Great Battle and Asterix and the Bretons better

I Am A Tree!
AND THEN INJOKE
i missed the movie : (
aaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Leafin the dream
FLUTTERTREE!!
1,11Fluttershy is a tree. The transformation is complete
5/10. Some rather entertaining bits, but the characters were rather unengaging, slapstick was somewhat awkwardly paced and choreographed (though that was more because of the animation limitations at the time), and the story itself had no real stakes or conflict.
Derpy Speaks! She's canon!!
fluttertree
04Dat reference
Ninjashy
SO MUCH INJOKE
Flutter tree is soo cute
00,03And HOLY CRAP my OC is back :D

i used to wonder what friendship could be
how can a tree help?
00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, dats you?
What?
Fluttershy evolves, FLUTTERSHY IS NOW A TREE
The theme is the most shameful part to me, but, IM PROUD TO BE A BRONY DAMNIT!
this was the first episode I think that I watched on bronystate... well... the Site also broke that day :/

otakon: because thats what happens when you sail in intense conditions
well DUH

Hey, Equestria has film? I'm gonna have to show them Lawrence of Arabia!
electricity is now canon?
Scoot-Scootaloo: knew it was you the second i saw its ful animation :D so MLG
kirzstryfe 10% downloaded this will take a while
Movie also got rather repetitive at times. How many times can we watch Asterix and his friend bumble through a supposedly difficult task through dumb luck and brute strength before it gets old? 3 is the answer.
00,03Gimmie dat Fallout!
and 50s wiki movie
11,01Evaporation?
everyone do the electric scootalooo
TECHNOLOGY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
but I mean when and how.
i like all the charcter designs this episode, and so many offically named Ponies!
Tornados and you
Why doesnt Ponyville have plumbing?
they don't just bring it up in buckets, that would be too practical!
Weather. Weather never changes... wait.
00,03Why yes, it is MLG~
i could explain it but you would not understand a single word
RAWRity: you are hard to please you know that?
too much sailing lingo
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, what you downloadin?
TORNADO POWER! The magazine to the Tornado Console
Vault-Pony!
guild wars beta
SpadeMagnes[R]: why should it?
RAWRity: one second I need to find the total number of comics there is.
WHAT 800? THERES NO WAY THAT CAN BE RIGHT!!
otakon: hard to please? perhaps. Bored by monotony? Most definitely
Remember to buy a spot in a vault near you~
00,10suppose i should put your animation on for a bit Scoot-Scootaloo
Spike accidentally the film
spike
RAWRity: ...i wouldve had it sunk
do ho
Fou_Lou: Because it would be sane?
you know, this is all just exposition... and they tricked us into watching it.
dohoho
There were 34 comic books as of 2009
INTERMISSION
00,03Aww yeah!
RAWRity: well what movie did you like the most then?
-_- the sun in equestria is to lazy to evaporate the water
but never ever wonder where ranibws come frm
I'm out. See ya next week BronyState

Thankfully Spike didn't break the stream like the first time
1,11Silly SPike.Intermission was earlier.

Bye Riders!
I mean how do they pump there...buisness

We need a Calvin and Hobbes animated show I think.
TECHNOLOGY?! IN EQUESTRIA?!
00,03Look at that guy buck!
0,14no we don't
So multiply that by the average number of times they beat that in each
WHY NO?
IT'S OVER A THOUSAND!
over 9000?
1000?!?!?!??!?
"Spitfire will be there to be of absolutely no help"
no
Hi everypony!
How about we leave Calvin and Hobbes exactly where they are
0,14because Bill Watterson campaigned hard against it
WHAT ONE THOUSAND? THERES NO WAY THAT CAN BE RIGHT!!!!!
Calvin and Hobbe-- NO
RisingPretender: you don't like Calvin and Hobbes?
WHAT ONE THOUSAND?!
hi VenHur96

I remember it fondly though.

Because if she let Thunderlane leave no one would have gotten sick

herostar_Discorded: kilos
i wanna see the steroid pony fly

Seems legit.
SirGanjalf: It's my favorite nod in the series, excepting the Big Lebowski ponies
00,02"ah choo i'ma train"

god she's so innocent
thats the fakest sneeze ive ever heard
Even her sneeezes are graceful
Even her fake sneezes are grazeful
Does anyone think everyone got sick because of Rainbowdash?
i like the one part. when calvin sat in the toilet, flushed. bathtime done!
I wonder if I could fix up Scoot's animation..
Such wonderful acting!
derpy!!!
tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
lol
Having an idea that I have to refix all animations so far
She's just too graceful
I loved when he went into space mode

I love the set of comics that had her do this with permiante marker.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Well then, that would be a tad bad~

0,14that's Sumica
I liked Spaceman Spiff and Tracer Bullet
how do i make custom models for desktop ponies?
1,11Okay, seriously, Dash was in Flight Camp with Flutters. She should KNOW that Fluttershy isn't a good flyer and has bad confidence from it. :/
she can only do stuff in EMEREGENCIES
Calcos323: did you hear that?
in the return of the harmony part 2, she reached rainbow dash
Dash doesn't care.
otakon: What?
Dovah: Plothole
But Dovahkiin, you're forgetting, Dash is an ass.
:(
8,6hmm?
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/487746_3724507866394_1792563762_n.jpg
she did eventually get back up after the race tho... they both have their marks
luckly for her she didnt go to the rainbow factory
DICKS
dash isnt a very sympathetic pony
Dovahkiin: yeah but Dash is very overconfidant.
she flies better than scootaloo
Dovahkiin, on the other hoof, RD isn't the most empathic pony
SpadeMagnes[R]: watch your mouth
filly kids can hardly ryme
Foals can be cruel... :(
Dovahkiin: ....
dat character development
Dovahkiin: but she can fly as fast as dash, as shown in the discord episodes
Dovahkiin: also I think she dropped out of Flight School later on
otakon said goddamnit, the night is complete.
dat plot
Spectrum_Rush|: again when its urgent
00,03FlutterDash...
RD has matured alot by this ep
RAWRity: ogod
1,11I'm not saying she's being insensitive, I'm saying she's either an idiot or has bad memory.
In other news, my sister just got back from Spain. She bought me a sombrero.
dat face
Spectrum_Rush|: RD was Discorded and FS was angry plus emergency
she didn't said she was gay guys
otakon.literally dropped out
Hey, on the bright side, Fluttershy didn't wound up in Magic Kindergarden.
we need a sonic flutterboom
Scoot-Scootaloo: say is that your OC on the right there? :P
Spectrum_Rush|: well if they kept ALL continutiy then there would be no new conflicts
dat child trauma
Dovah: again plot hole
lol
ogod twilight so cute
in english twilight @_@
otakon: Oh, I know what you mean. Physical and mental strength are two different things. One is fueled by adrenaline, the other isn't. Guess which one.

I'm sure she suffers from anxiety more than "stage fright" she's preformed before.
hrm.
le heartbreak
and then she spoke Badger
HONEY BADGER
Honey badger apparently DOES give a fuck 'bout Fluttershy
1,11Honey badger don't give a shit.

Fluttershy's the best around.
11,01Derpy bunny?

I don't think that was a honey badger.
SirGanjalf: no the first Rocky movie was 70's
she flies really fast in return of the harmony, what's the problem anyway?
Derpy mask y u no have derpy eyes!
EYE OF THE STARE MASTER!
Angel stole RDs hat
therefore, I base it off of that.
GO FLUTTERSHY GO!
Angel actualy being nice to Fluttershy? What shit is this?
it's a honey badger if I say it is.
Hi
Who is the rightmost desktop pony?
yo the best around and nopony ever gonna take u down
You are irrelevant.
I am the Beastmaster
Nyria: Scoot-Scootaloo's OC
EPIC MUSIC TIME
I think Angel is bipolar
dem wing ups
Sucking in the tears like that can't be good for you
seems legit
Angel Bunny really does love fluttershy :$
00,02Nyria, Scoot-Scootaloo
Money shot right there
That tear going back in still creeps me out.
THERES NO EASY WAY OUT! THERE'S NO SHORTCUT HOME!
Phase4: Nyst asked
Suck it up Fluttershy
Too bad he's also a knob.
ROCKY SHOT
did her eye suck up the tear?..
00,02oh
00,02DERP
otakon: Yeah, but it become cliche during 80's
Fluttershy has raised the sun!
YEAH!
00,02Nyst, Scoot-Scootaloo
Angel Bunny is Fluttershy's abusive boyfriend
dat POSE!
00,10dem tab fails
Whats a colt doing there

there is something about a manly scene being set to someting so girly
YEEAAHH!
It's Nyst guys, not Nyria, but thanks for the answers.

look how mad she was
XD
Yes you do
it's like a tea party with rockets
flitter is the worst pony
yaay
We need Kronk here. HE can speak squirrel!
try again!
you kinda sound like you do, Twi.
RAWRity: dat interspecies
PPG Tara Strong reference?
good job fluttershy but you still SUCK
Fluttershy with her ENTOURAGE
Funny thing is Tara voiced Bubbles WHO spoke it
dun dun duN!
highway to the danger zone
Or another one of Tara's characters
...
2.3
over .5
SHE SUCKED UP A BUCKING TEAR!
1,11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Twilight's VO also voiced Bubbles, who COULD speak to squirrels.
:'(
:[
1.21
but wait, what about that time when she caught up to discorded dash, what happened to that
she got 4 times faster!
it's still a 400% improvement
Fluttershy, you nearly quintupled your speed. YOu're fucking awesome.
in less than a week
she got her there
lol irony
tomorrow she'll get 10!
Dovahkiin: think the joke was intentional?
Dang it Spike!
Gonna' take you right in-to the, danger zooone. (love dat song)
4 faster
too much math for the kiddies
not to mention you did it in a single afternoon
STFU Spike!
11,01Go Spike.
Zip it.
GODDAMMIT SPIKE
11,01:p
IshBestPonix, at that time RD was carrying two ponies
twilight is going to kill spike @_@
And this is why Spike is an unlikable character
FUCK OFF SPIKE NOPONY LIKES YOU
Dovahkiin: squeak squeak squeaker squeak squeak squeaken?
Spike is best troll?
Thats an improvement of at least 20%
SPIKE
Fluttershy needs more confidence
Spike always makes things worse
she faster then vavle
Spike has no empathy. It's like he's autistis or something
/me wants to kill spike now
And Spitfire will DO NOTHING
I think spike acts like a little boy, Never really knows how to shut up
/me kills Spike
TheDoctor: Snails in molasses are faster than Valve.
ikr
Spike is just a kid, kids tend to be blunt now knowing the damage they can do.
spike tries to be funny like everyone else
Did you guys see that?
SpadeMagnes[R], Spitfire isn't supposed to do anything
SpadeMagnes[R]: she's only there to observe, not her job.
true
fluttershy is ultra damn fast in return of the harmony really, what happened to that speed?
People are too mean to Spike.
thats a good point
Rookeealding: he's just a baby dragonnnn
FFS, SPITFIRE ISN'T SUPPOSE TO DO ANYTHING! JUST JUDGE!
/me highfives fapplebloom
One background pony had Derpy eyes there
OohShiny: it's called EMERGENCY
Well they were clearly down alot and she just sits there
Am I the only pony in the world that's feels sorry for all the hate on Spike?
Feather Flu? Pony Pox? I smell a future plague episode of MLP
Pegasususus
Spitfire is a lazybones
spitfire!
RAWRity: zombies?
Can't they just push Cloudsdale closer to the ground? It'd probably be a lot easier to do. It's made of clouds. The whole city probably only weighs, like, 10 pounds. :P
Fuck just supervising THEY NEEDED HELP
VenHur96: no but Spike can't keep his mouth shut at times
DERPY
I was thinking more Black Death
04I mean, don't help or anything Spitfire
cutie pox outbreak
Where is your soul fluttershy?
04Lazy, inconsiderate douche bag
This shit is meant to be all important to Cloudsdale and crap, but the Wonderbolt just sits there chewing cud.
If I was sent to supervise and they needed help, I WOULD HELP
1,11Spitfire: I"m just here to supervise. Let them handle it.
RIII COLAAAA
I know right
Pale_Horse: if it isn't high enough they clouds won't stay together.
otakon neither can Rainbow Dash sometimes
would be hella scary actually
Ghosties, it's more of a contest
Spitfire is a ponyville inhabitant. If she helped it wouldn't count.
we find out Cutie Pox is spread by Parasprites
Bleh. >.>
nine
Lazy Spitfire
flying bonbon!
I SAw BONBON wtf
Pale_Horse: Yeah, why don't they take Cloudsdale and PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?
Maybe Spitfire couldn't help because she's not from Ponyville?
If I was supervising I would still help
04But isn't it necessary to get that water up there?
HOLD ON SPIKE!
FLY DUCK FLY!
spitfire "they look like they arent doing good.... yea ill just sit here"
1,11Nyst: at this point, it's not about the record, it's about actually getting the water up there.
LET GO SPIKE
Spitfire is Union, and she dont move without a work order ...
04Soooo if it's looking like they can't do it on their own, shouldn't she forego the rules and help?
steroids pony!!!
Dovahkiin: which makes Spitfire lazy
OohShiny: Staticcloud Bons Away friend of Skyra
o
NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
hello everypony :D
THEY NEED 8.1 GIGAWATTS OF WING POWER!
Dash is now a tree
Dashietree
Fluttershy sounded a bit like a Portal turret here
pout
now RD is a tree
EyeScream
Armor piercing eyees
so 8 sick pegasi makes the difference between the shot at 910+ and 790.
two fluttershys?
Dovahkiin: they haven't failed yet. I'm sure Spitfire and others would come help -after- Rainbow Dash gave up.
dat pout
wow
11,01Why not rely on evaporation?
were is the steriods pony @_@
Ghosties, it is, but they make it a bit of a competition, if it became an emergency, they would use more than just Ponyville
YEAAAAAAAAAAH!
Ghosties, this really isn't an emergency. If they can't get the water to cloudsdale, they will just pick another town.
Yea dont help or anything Spitfire
rainbdrops
they need 8.1 GIGAWATTS OF WINGPOWER.
Here lied RD, she wend down flying
i got baned for a while D:
Exahusted Derpy
people like to pull RD's tail a lot...
nine
raindrops
such care dashie has for the others
*lies*
It might make Ponyville look bad if the Wonderbolts help
YAY THERE HE IS
which means those 8 averaged 15 wingpower... which is just shy of Dash's starting number...
YEEAAAH
Rainbow dash died later that day
it's like some kind of RD trope
If I'm going down, I'm taking all the pegasi with me!
nine
YEAAAAH
00,02Nittany_Discord, because....
Nittany-Discord: Equestria doesn't have that kind of natural weather.

Dont help or anything...
so why is spitfire there again?
just to watch?
00,02Nyst, but it does, everfree forrest
Remember Nittany_Discord? Weather isnt natural there. THEY control it.
04Hasn't every other town already given their water?
IshBestPonix: lol
if you count parasprites as locusts, it would be interesting to see Ponyville deal with the remainder of the Plagues of Egypt
yes
otakon: funny you say that , sine one of the pegasus looks like Doc
IshBestPonix: XD
Ghosties: yes
and then Spitfire did nothing to help, despite this being a god damn necessary part of Equestria's water cycle
Darn drought! XD
Spectrum_Rush|: lol
except for the last one obviously because it would be waaay too dark
11,01BlazeAngel: Pretty awesome.
I think Spitfire is over 20 wing power
+Phase4: But only there.
further proof that the wonderbolts are poop
Hasbro called, they want a Guile's Theme on this scene.
and that is how babby is formed
RAWRity: logic!
as wonderbolts captain and all
God I hate Spitefire
11,01They do have natural weather in that universe.
Ghosties: nope. At least it wasnt mentioned
Supervising or not she should have helped
BUFFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEER
00,02i'm willing to suspend disbelife, i meen we're already asked to accept the ponys can create tornadoes
Do it for the me who believes in you...
where did dat come from?
2.3WP MUTHAFUCKAS
For SHIRE!
True fact, the Wonderbolts are actually pretty crap.
WHY DONT FLUTTERSHIES BIRD FRIENDS HELP!?
Scumbag Spitfire
Then Fluttershy would have learned nothing
if i was in WWII they'd call me Spitfire
FOR NARNIA
1,11I laughed at Angel Bunny.
Pegasus Bon Bon?
Go Fluttershy!
Bronysith: too tiny to do anything
The shit?
and Angel got what he deserved
RAWRity, they make it a competition, if it became an emergency they would probably help
i dislike angel
YEAH
most dislike Angel
00,10nah baby ponies come from two rainbows
VTEC just kicked in yo
and then they all failed and fluttershy killed herself
Now for the awesome mode!

I mean Jiggawats >_<
and then everypony came
ikr, spitfire's apathy could cause cloudsdale a drought
Spitfire was all like "Mother of Celestia..."
oh wait wrong thing
RII COLAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
Anime logic: If you become enraged, you become super strong
Motherofgod.jpg
Of course it was aimed perfectly. Twilight organized the whole thing. :P
spitfire: MOTHER OF CELESTIA
yay derpy flew
YEEEAHHH
There's some serious derping going on here
yay derpy
AND SPITFIRE DID ABOSLUTLEY NOTHING TO HELP
1,11and then Spike was never seen again.
00,10hey that looked like Rain's OC
DERPY!
dat Derpy
go faster!
faster!
11,01Remember to blame a gang of pegasi when there's a major tornado.
thats the power of Pine Sol...
they should make it a "This is necessary for the god damn health and natural welfare of our entire country, let's get this shit done."
see how she's pushed forward when she entered the twister? :) their wingpower is probably faster when theyre inside
RAWRity, it's not like if Ponyville were to not succeed, Equestria would suddenly end, they could just go somewhere else
Wing hoof
But then it turns out they used the lake that Ponyville dumps their waste water

Wasn't my fault.

Am I funny pony?

inb4 Cock
RAWRity, then why wouldn't they have a single task force made up of pegasi from each town to do it each time
Your logic is flawed. Do you want to count every pony in that tornado?

NIght, Dovahkiin
cya Dovahkiin!
bye Dovahkiin sorry to see you go
aka silver!
Evening, all.
GabeMoist: hmmm like a pegolympics?
RAWRity: they're still counting the wingpower capable of being provided by the town. Spitfire participating would make the results irrelevant since it would then account for what both Ponyville + Spitfire can do.
GabeMoist: tradition, most likely.
rest dragon born

Evening, all. I hope we're all having a good night.
too much magic
Dermathil: because knowing Ponyville's wingpower is more important than SUPPLYING WATER AND WEATHER TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
You're acting like the contest was the more important factor.

Reikim: philosophers have had arguments about the mechanics of non-existent universes since the dawn of time

dragons must be genocided or enslaved
only she can read it XD

Dermathil: except the explanations you offer would imply that Equestria's citizens are all idiots.
Friendship is Witchcraft = Best Pony Parody that is not .MOVs
lol

MONTAGE!
so either all of Equestria is stupid, or Spitfire is poop

WE NEED A MONTAGE
Actually
aww poor spike
LOL
Reikim: socrates and plato and the like?
I have a wild crazy theory that could justify EVERYTHING.
Appling HOOK!
Pitchfork sounds rather extreme. It's more like, basically, the country was in need of that stuff for the sake of, you know, normal function. And the gooseberry who could have ensured they didn't like, have a drought or something was sat on her ass in a jumpsuit.
Rawrity: You're implying everyone's an idiot. Bureaucracy is idiotic. Not the citizenry.
no one likes Spike
Nopony likes Spike
Montage made even more awesome
lol
GRAVY

Nopony likes Spike :D

Personally I think the Wonderbolts are good for show and nothing else.

Clubbing Spike

So yeah, I'll stick with my theory that the Wonderbolts are terrible at their jobs.
lol
Sorry, but I always thought these were overrated... They're good, sure
lol alicorn sparkle
Even Twilight hates Spike...
DeceptiShy! Transform!
Spike - element of loneliness

Nittany_Discord: I love you so much

DERP :derpy:
SEems legit.
Sieg hiel
And I feel like you are trying to make it make sense.
Celestia manipulated every single event of that episode to help Fluttershy overcome her fear of failure.
LOL
I guess Spike must of hates himself for everyone hating on him.
Princess Sparkle
:DH:
Dermathil: that is the point
O_O
RAWRity: they're just overrated and overused

I am on a genius streak tonight, gentlemen.
SparklyWaffles yes ^^
Tall thing..
Oh wow...
0,14well, I'm off
It's a tree...
Probably because it seems that whenever I'm in here there are some people whose attitudes IMO looks like they're butthurt 100% of the time.
Fluttershy has at least a dozen words of Dragon Shouts then. :D
Bronysith when will you get the hint that everyone in the whole world just wants you to stop talking? Really, it's remarkable.
Rainbow Dash is so smart..... -.-

Actually, all I don't like is the dubbing and how it makes them... behave.
CapFluttershy: BLEH
Eh, not really. You don't even have to try that hard to troll Derm. He has such a god complex that just about anything sets him off.
I wasn't trolling.
Nittany_Discord: We must now have an unnesscairy swordfight!

too many hats
8,6or have any idea who Abba is
lol
MLP TF2 mode
oh hat scarf
Oh.......

We need more hats!
Maybe a superiority complex, but I'm not a psychologist so don't quote me.
Too many wa wa waas.
kirzstryfe: Sad generation is sad.
Maybe that's a better term.
Not SOS
spider-man can dream...
well spi- oh beat me to it
lol
What is this we're watching? FiW?
HA
yu
Derm's more got the idea that if HE doesn't see issue with it, then NOBODY should.
Vordox: lawl abba is one of those "what were we thinking?" mistakes
rainbow:P
Frankly I think he's a self entitled shitbag, but that's just my opinion.
yep
HURR DURR
I remember Abba - Sweddish sensation of the 90's couldnt go a week in jr high without hearing a song of theirs
The 1978 Japanese concert performance of "If It Wasn't For The Nights" is an awesome song... I still say it needs to be PMVd :$
It's her father!
Spike is the only thing that can't dream.
Yes. Spiders can so dream... They dream of creeping up the noses of other creatures and laying eggs in their brains. :P
Like how some people seem to think that me criticising a movie on here means I think it's awful.
One of those people on the Internet who are convinced wholly and entirely that their opinion is the only valid one. Troll slang: TARGET.

i can't be a mod due to bad Grammar/spelling and other stuff :p

Meanwhile: If you had mad tech skills like Shizu, you'd have a chance at tech mod. If you were artistic like Wrek, you'd have a shot at art mod. I don't think you have either (unless I'm wrong, truly sorry if I am, I'm new here) so that leaves chat mod.
Sweetiebot is the the best pony
i know just teasing you :3

Nittany_Discord: But still, demo is my fav.

Well no pony can pony 4 ponies to pony pony pony pony.

couldnt she just have lenses in her goggles as a wonderbolt?
Very true, but this is thinking application style.

Saxy looks SO STONED
Otakon, have you ever seen The Dark Crystal?
No
Why is Diamond a bitch in any form of media?
yes yes he does
What crossover I'm afraid to ask
involving a bronystate "dude wheres my car"
I know the look of stoned

A bib?

Firelight: it wasnt bad, i enjoyed
Batman

It was fortold!
I rather liked the Sonic Scream power Firelight
otakon: sonic is DEAD. he was replaced by his retarded cousin. the tall skinny green eyed freak
pony_9001: it's Friendship is Witchcraft
:D

BEST SONG
YES! NEW IT!
LOOOL

JESmith71: you get to play as sonic or his retarded cousin
Kenshin: Could have killed everyone in the blink of an eye. Didn't, and is more of a man than most Shonen heroes for it.

The Fun Has been Doubled!
WE NEED AN EXTENDED VERSION
Soul: YEs

holy crap this chat has devolved into something a discussion about something as bad as the bronys
SpadeMagnes[R]: Same here, I hates the whole green eyes arguement.
best song
soul, yes, yes you can
finer arts.
:D
Naruto and Bleach are nothing compared to Kenshin, imo
easily the worst part of FiW is teh songs.
Buytoast: um.....do you know where you are?
smexy
sexual
oh, i know
i cant seem to go to the website
lol nope
otakon: We need extended version of THIS and Pinkie's Brew!
The people who whine about sonic with green eyes need to get off their nostalgia obsessions
Ironic considering the shows in FiM are one of the major draws.
RAWRity: why would you post that :'(
damn right lol
the portals
I get to watch free movies ehre
:|
O_O
go portals

SpadeMagnes[R]: And if they don't...SONIC SMASH!
YES!

WE GOT A TROLL
Impossible. Luna is also Alicorn of sexiness
JESmith71: what?
so pinkie is a satan worshipper? XD
Never mind
I'll post it when we get to the Gypsy bard episode.
Buytoast: Yeye, as long as you behave and not a twat =P
SpadeMagnes[R]: I dont mind but Sonic X is utter crap
This is epic
i was framed
pony_9001: no just a Gypsy
More like the Old Ones worshipper
pinkie is a gypsy pony_9001
Follower of the Smooze
He was another guy who was against Modern Sonic but he's not around no more

RAWRity: how do you not love these songs?
alright, ive seen a couple of these like once, thats it :P
glomp

That voice :D
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yep, thats what im saying. I dont mind modern or classic sonic but that show sucked IMO
GLOUMP!
1000 glomps
Luna is a tree hugger
luna is dexter's long lost sister

Lol!!
XylemTube: and this is news how?

jekyll and hyde!
You should have posted it during Pinkie's Brew. That song is loved.
Bronysith: That's the spoken words of Luna lovers.
cherry
scared scared ducking
CherryJack
otakon: and a few other things i cant mention in chat...
cherryjack
cherry
dat cherryjack
But yeah, Naruto at its best could MAYBE rival the middling arcs in Kenshin, but since its height, Naruto's been way too inconsistent.
can anypony tell me why IE cant display the desktop ponies webpage?
XylemTube: I never doubted that lol
Bronysith: .................. why?
Peewee.
Peewee sack
kiwijack
kiwi
soul: because IE sucks
smexy
kiwisack
I lost track of Naruto after...hmmm...
00,10cause IE sucks
Bleach was, even at its absolute best, just a fun, shallow battle manga
Rat Swagger?
Sumica: beat ya to it
get Firefox
soul: bc IE sucks the biggest amount of ass possible.
Why are the apples censored?
00,10IE has one use.
anything other than that
Soo...Chrome's better?
00,10downloading firefox
Stallion_of_War: Dole joke
neopet!!!
VenHur96: Firefox
Bleach was never really much, mostly because the author wasn't planning at all.
Sumica: lol
spider.
hmm spider :P
The Fun Has Been Doubled!
Pumkin chunking
Censored apples are part of the satire of this episode.
11,01What Sumica said.
It's dead!
Lol
now it's a nonsensical pos with the mangaka essentially throwing ideas at a wall and using what sticks.
http://lolbot.net/pix/21711.jpg
lol jeez, you guys should help the dude with his main concern about the desktop ponies :D
otakon: Firefox's better than Chrome?
it isnt that bad -_-
grape
making fun of the youtube takedowns and stuff liek SOPA, and such.
Does anyone else watch that show where they build catapults and launch pumpkins?
VenHur96: Chrome doesn't like this site too much.
Buy some apples!
Bleach POTENTIALLY could have been good, if the implications of an afterlife and death and resurrection and Hell had been exploited.
Censored Apples.
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
SpadeMagnes[R]: that's Pumpkin Chunkin and it's an event
LAWl
lol
cantalope
man co
Dat censor
any more? xD
Friendship is Witchcraft?
:D
why have I seen these creatures in my nightmares?!?!?
00,10it's more of the new flash dont like crome
eeyup
Unfortunately, in a contemporary Shonen manga, it's not really realistic to expect that.
Umad Bro?
MORE DOTS
i use interenet explorer cuz fire fox keeps freezing when i got on this site
this is gold:D
da song
my internet doesnt like chrome
bob: odd it works fine for me
stupid trolls
why are apples censored exactly? XD
Actually, my Chrome is working just fine with the stream, I'm not kidding.
I liked Ranma let's talk about that
but instead it was basically "BANKAI! GETSUGA TENSHOU! SWORD FIIIIIIGGGHHHHHTTTTSSSSSSS!!!!!1111!!!!!ONE!"
Cencored apples are PART of the joke
Ha! I loved Ranma.
VenHur96: Thats what im using.
Corn on the COb!!!!
pony_9001: Censor jokes
the faults of the children
lol
isint season 3 comming?
awww validated
XD
00,10cause Dole pony_9001
Reikim: Or at least, in something like WSJ, a series that dark and contemplative wouldn't have a shot.
It's done intentionally to make fun of censorship and stupid laws forcing it.
if IE the problem, this is the first time it's done this
BUY SOME APPLES
I like when he took advantage of his condition
Ranma is one of the few long-runner manga that I read all the way through.
Jekyll HYDE!
DANCE PARTY!
mortal kombat FTW
jackle high...
Dat OCtavia
:D
lol
BUY SOME CANTELOPES
If it were running in a less mainstream mag, maybe it would have been different.
RAWRity: I remember they did something...something good, maybe.
ah Ranma
im going to have to go back and watch all these
i did too :C
lol
Luna is best princess
Inu Yasha had potential
Ranma kind of lost momentum a bit at the end, and the ending annoyed the hell out of me, but otherwise I loved it to bits.
like when he did girly contests like ice skating or bikinis or whatever
dat viking pony :3 who was that btw?
space camp
but then i remembered i suck at dancing
but they NEVER GODDAMN ENDED IT IN THE ANIME
11,01I'm not best princess? :p

Bleh, I found inu yasha unintersting from the get go
lol
dead bird
cencored apples
One manga I do hope eventually gets an anime: Nisekoi
Bye BaconMane.
May I ask why someone would build a random statue of NMM in the middle of the everfree forest?
these rymes are killng me @_@
Nisekoi?
candy police + licorice rope
I liked Akane because she wasn't JUST a formulaic Tsundere, unlike Kagome. She was a strong person in her own right, just overshadowed by far greater martial artists, and tries to stand on her own despite that.
Never heard of it.
VAMPIRES
NIght, BaconMane
Vampires are always sexy.
because Pinkie!
exactly
EVen though I hate twilight....
otakon: look it up, really charming and funny romance manga
Not the twilight on the show..
why
the movie..
romance
oh
..............................
SIGh..
good
Reikim: yeah! She was a good character
There's nore vampires in Twilight, s oit's fine Firelight
butt fun jokes
we get it
lol
Silly Butt Fun
lol
well, romantic comedy is more appropriate
Twilight is my 3rd favorite pony.
secret butt fun
that kid is awkward
ALL the butt fun jokes!
There is such a thing as over doing a joke
eh, why not?
not fun butt fun
RAWRity: Nisekoi? Hm. I dunno, romance really isn't up my alley right now. I just looked at the first volume of Future Diary, though, and I was moderately impressed.
<3 russians
D:
butt fun is a euphemism for anal sex
LOL
Only Luna can bring sexy back! :$
:D
00,10and that's the joke SpadeMagnes[R]
lawl DT + SS
Dat pip
Have ya ever read BioMeat?
Family guy drives jokes into the ground
Nah, never heard of it.
Horror manga
wut?
good character growth
Ah, sorry. I don't really do much horror.
ghouls and phantoms?
SpadeMagnes[R]: you dont say
SpadeMagnes[R]: antihumor
I luv luna
What is up with the censored apples?
I prefer suspense as the darker end of what I read.
did she just have smaller wings for a sec there @_@
i could either watch ponies or mario after dark I CHOOSE PONIES
Most touching molestfest
Well, I'm gonna try to go to bed and get up in the morning. Hopefully I'll see you guys then.
Firelight: because Dole
toutching molest fest....
Reikim: i hate gore fics...
Most touching molest fest yet... I C wat U did thar! :$
ARGHAHRAHAHGHARA
Firelight: it was a joke in the begining
Basically, these 2 teens, Raku and Chitoge, hate eachother. Their fathers are the leaders or rival Crime families that are on the verge of war. The fathers, being old friends, decide the only way to stop the bloodshed is to have Raku and Chitoge pretend to be in love, so as to get the 2 factions to call a cease fire
Trippy
dat screen
i could either watch ponies or mario after dark I CHOOSE PONIES
id rather read clop or see r34 pics then read a gore fic Reikim
oni_link: ........oh.... HURR HURR HURR -.-
Molest Fest...seems legit
i could either masturbate or watch ponies I CHOOSE BOTH
Who the hell takes the candy they leave at the statue?
tripy
RAWRity: Interesting. A bit of a mix between the old Romeo/Juliet plot and a tsundere romance.
do any of you know what the name of that viking pony was ? shes a background pony
whats with the hate on spike
fapplebloom eww man
Firelight: yep
The creatures that live in the forest still em?
sandman
00,10play song slow it becomes scary
night my fellow regulars
Well, it deals with the outbreak of a organism known as BioMeat that was originally engineered to be a replacement foodsource and trash disposal. It eats EVERTHING except for glass and metal.
this one
bum bum bum
creepy
sort of, yeah. It's got some great gags though.
mr sand man
O_o
And how long have they been celebrating Nightmare night anyway?
Mr. Sugarpony.
O_O
night Bronysith sleep well.
anyone planning on sleeping tonight?
Oh my god.. *In spikes voice* Woah.. That's creepy.
creepy
dat echo makes it even scarier
man this is kinda creepy and i played amnesia
But my all time fav manga would have to be Angel Densetsu
portals
The old tsundere archetype is starting to wear on me, though. Is it really impossible for a girl and a guy to have a platonic relationship where they mutually jab at each other?
creepy
creepy....
no
TEH PORTAL
Welp, i'm gonna has a good night tonight...
O_O *turns lights off*

Brace yourself, Ponies are coming...
Im off to bed - Good night :)
FANTASY MONTH!!!!!!!!!
cute
star wars han + leia
:D
But for some reason, whenever you see a girl and a guy in manga/anime riffing on each other, you know instinctually they will be paired.
bared midriff a bit too much
otakon: What was the video again? don't ever think i faved it
oni_link: FANTASY MONTH!!!
GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always, may the force be with you all and pierce the heavens with your drills!

killerpony7733: the last one we just watched?
Firelight: we do
I am also really annoyed at the lack of female characters that are capable of standing on their own as characters.
00,10Never. going. to. happen
I'm gonna sing a song for youu!
lol
No means no you idiots
otakon: The one we are watching
4th Wall being Broke.

he said except for spike.mov i heard that one time XD
e
agree with nods no .MOVS.
e
THIS!! YAY!
mods*
It was under EEEEEEEEEE
This is what going to be the original theme, but Hasbro is all like "This song is too epic for television, we need something else, durr hurr!"
mods are asleep
This stream is brought to you by the letter E.
.movs are fun :)
nice finds man
Do the G.A.B.E.N.
O.o
And...yeaah...
On top of that, why can't we have more female leads?
I loved party.mov
bc
You know all the rest...
no! .movs r not fun!
gender stereotypes
EEEEEEEEEEEE
E
Reikim: depends on which kind of manga you're reading
EEEEEEE
E
8,6the .movs require a... unique... sense of humor
EEEEEEEEEE
.Movs are imature and inapropriate and only should be viewed only and inapropiate for kids like yourself.
00,02KSP
Stop spamming...
I like shed.mov just because of the music
00,020.16 WAS RELEASED
it's just awesome
"It's twins, by the way, in case anyone was going to ask...... I'm gonna name them Snoopy and Prickly Pete"
ofc there are stereotypes for a reason
Phase4: What's in the update???
do the . movs anyeays
Shounen titles are going after 12-15 year old guys, wo that's the main character they go with.
Excuse my vulgarity when I say fuck gender stereotypes.

can someone help me? i try to go to desktop ponies website and all it does is load a really long time and then say it cant display the webpage :'(
meanwhile, Shoujo titles generally have female protagonists.
JESmith71: more than likely yes
i need to buy that game T_T
STAY OUT OF MY SHED

I know, but it still irritates me.
and there are some really good shoujo titles out there, Ouran High School Host Club and Skip Beat being 2 I can name off the top of my head
Reikim: we're men watchin ponies. We're all very progressive here
/me notes that counting to 4 in binary results in a rude guesture

NO DERPY?!?! :(
raincloud <3
that was a decent dashie if i say so myself
The reason I love stuff like Madoka and Nanoha is that the female leads were fairly responsible, self-sufficient girls who are capable of being great on their own.
00,10what did they add?
who is this derpy you speak of?
Blast Corps... I could start a new game and play to the moon level in 54 minutes! :)
sensor parody?
Why nanos?
lol , dole
Those things are fucking small
soul: Censor*
Reikim: Read Claymore and Angel Densetsu

Also RAWRity, Ouran was kickass. Haruhi is one of my favourite protagonists, especially that ending scene.

00,10well then I guess you want to stream then Phase4?

Arent Nano's not as powerful as the regular ones?
So, should I get Fallout 3 GotY edition for 5 bucks?
YES
yes
otakon: I'd recommend Ouran pretty highly. It's got pretty good gags, and the ending is incredibly heart-wrenching.
YEEES
SpadeMagnes[R]: they're just music players
YES, YES, YES :)

Reikim: Just keep in mind that when you watch it, the show will outright REFUSE to hold your hand in explaining things. Lots of information is implied, or alluded to, but never outright stated.
vaguely humorous references though

Didnt this get shown at the con?
Do want this game
yes
yep
00,10some great editing in this even though some bits are way too long.
the short version though
SpadeMagnes[R], yeah
Lain's a series that expects you to think in order to understand it.
i'd play this game
Sumica: agreed
RAWRity: Please, I'm sick and tired of shows that treat me like a moron. Bring it on.
Well. Sleep, my nemesis... Anthology II Just. Bucked. You.
