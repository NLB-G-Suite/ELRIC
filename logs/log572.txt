YES!
3we just watched that
08,01reroll, because it's not eligible yet?
Fuck rerolls, play that!
11,01It's been show before.

I'm ok with it. I've no problem skipping BMN now
Deal w/ it
04You're a rainbow in the dark~
05,15Wait, he's right we did watch it for an event.
That'd be different.
05,15THAT MEANS IT'S INELLIGABLE!
04...really?
04Loophole?
3yeah
08,01wait, which event?
no it wouldn't
11,02Ofc not, it's only for movies played during BMN.
3it was an unofficial stream for something
it would be "Deal w/it" territory
11,02The 6 month rule is for ONLY BMN
13ohhhhh jaja
11,01We watched it during our anniversary I think.
13we did play for luna
NO NO
11,01Or something.
04So was that her movie for the anniversary?
the goddamn rule counts
WE SHOWED IT
13see why i made it longer
11,01Or it was during season finale week.
it doesn't show again
13by now the normal intermission would be over
you know how I knwo?
3yeah, Nitt's right
We haven't even decided the first movie yet
3so that was April
bc MY moive was passed over bc it was goddamn shown during an event
08,01or is an executive decision being made?
Good grief
11,016-month rule is for BMN and anniversary week.
3It's a Reroll guys
04I'd say any official stream counts, but that's just me
and that is going in my favs
Yay~
Faved.
3it was an event, and it was in fact official
3so, I say reroll
1,11^
yeah damn straight
08,01but... i was kinda looking forward to it...
04I dunno
04I mean...ugh
04Just look at that

Ikr.
04As...bad as it is, I say stick with it
or just A
13worry not ponies... i am as frustrated as you
3no Ty, we just went over that
04If it's BMN eligible, then stick with it
13i am just here to watch reactions und go back to busting street racers
3it's not because we just streamed it a few months ago
1,11But it's not BMN eligible.
3for an official stream
3it took place of BMN
05hence forth reroll
yes it is
1,11What was the reroll?
05,15looks like we might even exhaust this one
04Ah, then why were we waiting for me?
05lets get goign or well have to extend the itnermission with another 10 minutes
3because your'e the boss man
3anyway, let's reroll

08,01>.>
I've always been interested in trying mead, but alcohol ain't really my thing.
Goddammit I'm never going to win again.
0,14I prefer resolutions to be done by Thunderdome
Or just take a list of the A movies and figure out an average from their scores.
lol, buffering
I got one win and then I was screwed over because they wanted to go by 31 day months
Really. Why can't you do that?
I'm never going to win at all.
I won. . .a copy of Dota2.

aaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Leafin the dream
5/10. Some rather entertaining bits, but the characters were rather unengaging, slapstick was somewhat awkwardly paced and choreographed (though that was more because of the animation limitations at the time), and the story itself had no real stakes or conflict.
Derpy Speaks! She's canon!!

00,03XD
YEAH!
derpy mask @_@
Derpy mask
dat Derpy mask
DAT TRAINING MONTAGE
Fluttershy's the best around.
*80's
she flies really fast in return of the harmony, what's the problem anyway?
Derpy mask y u no have derpy eyes!
Angel stole RDs hat
therefore, I base it off of that.
GO FLUTTERSHY GO!
Hi
yo the best around and nopony ever gonna take u down
I am the Beastmaster
EPIC MUSIC TIME
I think Angel is bipolar
dem wing ups
Sucking in the tears like that can't be good for you
seems legit
Money shot right there
That tear going back in still creeps me out.
THERES NO EASY WAY OUT! THERE'S NO SHORTCUT HOME!
Suck it up Fluttershy
Too bad he's also a knob.
00,02oh
00,02DERP
Fluttershy has raised the sun!
YEAH!
dat POSE!
00,10dem tab fails
awesome pose
YEEAAHH!
YES
look how mad she was
XD
Yes you do
yaay
We need Kronk here. HE can speak squirrel!
try again!
PPG Tara Strong reference?
good job fluttershy but you still SUCK
Fluttershy with her ENTOURAGE
dun dun duN!
Or another one of Tara's characters
...
2.3
over .5
SHE SUCKED UP A BUCKING TEAR!
:'(
1.21
she got 4 times faster!
it's still a 400% improvement
in less than a week
she got her there
lol irony
tomorrow she'll get 10!
Dang it Spike!
4 faster
too much math for the kiddies
not to mention you did it in a single afternoon
STFU Spike!
11,01Go Spike.
GODDAMMIT SPIKE
11,01:p
twilight is going to kill spike @_@
And this is why Spike is an unlikable character
FUCK OFF SPIKE NOPONY LIKES YOU
Thats an improvement of at least 20%
SPIKE
Fluttershy needs more confidence
Spike always makes things worse
she faster then vavle
Spike has no empathy. It's like he's autistis or something
/me wants to kill spike now
/me kills Spike
ikr
Spike is just a kid, kids tend to be blunt now knowing the damage they can do.
Did you guys see that?
People are too mean to Spike.
thats a good point
One background pony had Derpy eyes there
Well they were clearly down alot and she just sits there
Am I the only pony in the world that's feels sorry for all the hate on Spike?
Pegasususus
Can't they just push Cloudsdale closer to the ground? It'd probably be a lot easier to do. It's made of clouds. The whole city probably only weighs, like, 10 pounds. :P
Fuck just supervising THEY NEEDED HELP
DERPY
04Lazy, inconsiderate douche bag
This shit is meant to be all important to Cloudsdale and crap, but the Wonderbolt just sits there chewing cud.
If I was sent to supervise and they needed help, I WOULD HELP
1,11Spitfire: I"m just here to supervise. Let them handle it.
RIII COLAAAA
I know right
would be hella scary actually
Bleh. >.>
nine
If I was supervising I would still help
HOLD ON SPIKE!
LET GO SPIKE
04Soooo if it's looking like they can't do it on their own, shouldn't she forego the rules and help?

It's done intentionally to make fun of censorship and stupid laws forcing it.
if IE the problem, this is the first time it's done this
I like when he took advantage of his condition
Ranma is one of the few long-runner manga that I read all the way through.

Nisekoi?
I liked Akane because she wasn't JUST a formulaic Tsundere, unlike Kagome. She was a strong person in her own right, just overshadowed by far greater martial artists, and tries to stand on her own despite that.
Never heard of it.

gender stereotypes
EEEEEEEEEEEE
EEEEEEE
8,6the .movs require a... unique... sense of humor
EEEEEEEEEE
.Movs are imature and inapropriate and only should be viewed only and inapropiate for kids like yourself.
00,02KSP
Stop spamming...
I like shed.mov just because of the music
00,020.16 WAS RELEASED
it's just awesome
"It's twins, by the way, in case anyone was going to ask...... I'm gonna name them Snoopy and Prickly Pete"
ofc there are stereotypes for a reason
do the . movs anyeays
Shounen titles are going after 12-15 year old guys, wo that's the main character they go with.
Excuse my vulgarity when I say fuck gender stereotypes.
No

00,10I have put on like 2 hours of random videos and taken a nap back before s2 eps
Yeah, as much as I enjoy the Anthology, it doesn't qualify as parody.
Meme counts: THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!
I know that rarity uses X-Ray mod
Give Derpy 46 1
It's more like...a long sequence of meme videos tied together.
Changling!
vaguely humorous references though
Didnt this get shown at the con?
yes
yep
00,10some great editing in this even though some bits are way too long.
Lain's a series that expects you to think in order to understand it.
OVERKILL

lol
XD
STICK TO THE PLAN
LEROY JENKINS!
Another reason I like ponies: it doesn't assume that females are airheaded twits. Even when they're five.
