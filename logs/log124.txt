WotLK, 3.3.5 I think
07Val might like that
2,14 but you don't have working instances though
ohhh
07he wanted a server pre - cata
Why wouldn't instances work? o.o
Of course I've mostly been hoarding cloth and stuffing my bank with frostweave
hey luna?
07yes?
07yep
07and before that a MAREATHON!
07of Season 1
07Amazing quality
07nope
720?
07you can remove it
07Ctrlx the season ep 1 is live streamed from tv
the reason i'm asking is i have a server that i might have record the stream. i believe the hub on our directv is sd.
I think you meen s2 ep no?
07you want to record our stream :o
if that's aight
P:
07Hmmm well I can't stop you
07:)
If you want to copy it, shouldn't you be ctrlc?
.....not like we can stop you =p
/me bricks DashiteAlt
07as long as you mention us :P
07as source ;)
that and i might bounce the stream to others
lolk that's not hard
we probably shouldn't encourage this
whatwith the copyright violation
07nope, but we can't stop him
07it's his choice
yeah, but we shouldn't encourage it is all :P
07we don't encourage it
07we told him, we can't stop him
They joke that I am going for an acheavment of making a pun in every zone and instance.
huh.. i guess i wouldn't know about that
Hecko there
Backstreets back.
hmm.. i'm really not entirely positive
they are?
Hmm?
They wouldn't lie would they?
*headdesk*
i was listening to the ernies.. then i think i heard it or something that just reminded me of it on the TV
hey guys what's the server here? i'm going to add it to my xchat
irc. something.. i hope that helps
2,14 irc.bronychat.net
A move is under way?
"Almost"
07I know that feeling
i decided to pull an all nighter or at least a whiler
2,14 speaking of which, I think it is time for this one to sleep
goodnight val:D
13Goodnight Val!
Night Val
we're merging with ponyirc
don't. ever. sleep.

OK, no one seems to be in that channel yet
that hair is lurking good
darn +N Dx
Evil +N
that's the best pun i could come up with atm
It's the mods trying to keep the common user down!
what's up?
fyi
not sure how we're going to deliberate that
i need an intense amount of interesting to keep me awake
07hmm
/me looks at MeteorVenture and yawns
07lol
/me is totally yawning right this second.
we're keeping the registered nicks but
/me wonders if you are yawning yet.
i haven't yawned yet
we have to handle situations where there's the same name registered twice a a case by case basis
/me yawns in the direction of MeteorVenture again
i am hyperventilating
too much yawn
yawn.. yawn.. i wish i had kirby's epic yarn right about now
inb4 kirby's epic yawn
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy-Pf6oJNRo&feature=related
ok that was an official yawn
it said i would stay up for another 8 hours
according to my forces
damnit, DashiteAlt you made me yawn
depends on the job probably
3.5 hours is long enough that I'd probably take the sleep.
ya probably sleep imo
Anything less than 3 hours and I would skip it.
i can probably squeeze it. if not then i'll stay up
let's give it a shot
gnite/bbl
lol take care!
Or today rather.
yes! i just remembered i could also play kid icarus
Cant compare to Stevan
Topgear
alright thanks
eh?

That Pizza Hut is win
Definitely
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZGINaRUEkU&feature=youtu.be

maybe there's someone with a full-time job taking these ridiculous requests
And ctrix
*ctrlx
lol
DAT SONG

do ponies eat pizza?
yah
you just usually see pastries and apple-things though
Huh?
A fanfic, they are currently having pizza =p
0_o

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVn_f0AYXdM
meant to link this one but it's all good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDynYwhUyoY
oh gosh! i just realized that the ponies could order a pizza and write "stop discord" and pizza hut would probably do it
well.. 2 bucks then
Sure they would have to charge more for that.
it is a SPECIAL request.. doesn't happen ever 1000 years
every*
that'd be 2bits
probably
(they take cash or credit)
pizza pony has suddenly become alot more helpful sounding
inb4 pizza pony is a solve all problems pony as long as you can request it in 28 characters or less
pizza pony... would they have special saddlebags for hte pizzas?
i imagine they'd be pegasi too. to be faster
she probably thought it was a joke and banished herself to season 2
or at least from season 1 after the first part
Would need one of those stay hot bags, I gues would want to make sure it's yah know arodynimic and such
07Freeze
07you here?
LOFN!
07lol
07problem?
someone actually drew a pizza pony
Did you order out for pizza on the moon?
07nah just being busy
07:)
my special request would be "arrive in 10 seconds flat"
challenge accepted
:<
or pizza ball* i guess
omg
not for reheat
cheeze+toppings on inside. wrapped in the crust. then have dippin sauce.
or you could put a bunch in a bowl of sauce and eat them like cereal
nah.. i was thinking the sauce would be in there too
hot pockets all over again
well.. tostino pizza rolls anyway
07yes I did
do ho ho ho

Laptop
Fairly large one

his runs fine though
does it have an ssd?
and does it get hot?
No
It runs pretty cool
then throw it in the garbage cause that's bad for you
amirite guys?

halo 2 reference for you ancient people
halo 1 or bust

Sure
headshots aren't hard in halo though
I just need the password actually
That won't take more than a second though

I can get all the other info on my own
Noticed to you
onyl time i use a controller is for racing games....and.......that;s about it, really
oh hey we were talking about this in here
I thought we were in the other room
lol
and no modding or any of that fun jazz
Yeah :-\
Moddable as all fuck
should we also add irc.ponyirc.com?
no
Exactly
i would hope people would do the same for me when i make games
>no
Correct
Thats when I would say to go for it
Otherwise, buy it for crying out loud!
or if you already own it
I learned my lesson from last time
I swear he was either annoyed or laughing at me

heh, On a Cross and Arrow has updated.
Wuh?!
Presto eh...
I dunno, I expected some other name
How's it going?
just here
hey there
D:
today we might go visit kids with VIH though and play with them. Might. I'm hoping we do!
i have to be at work in 20 minutes D:
bye! xD
Oh man, thats nice!
*IF* you end up going...
yeah

"Naw-aw! You're not going to go play with sick kids and thats final!"
(Because kids)

http://m.fanfiction.net/s/4961847/1/
I'm thinking about doing a live dramatic reading of that story
disregard it's Evangelion
"In Need of Sex"
I was in stitches
Well, that's a nice title
I don't mind Evangelio at all
*n
Got to use that catchphrase at some point
Dr. McDreamy has entered the room!
seriously I read through that story imagining Touji as ManSpike
NOT SURE IF WANT..............
FUCK IT, WANT
it was hilarous
Ok, I see
THAT'S WHEN I FUCKING LOST IT
I just fucking lost it here
Best. Catchphrase. EVER!
this fic is the best thing.
DAT LIVE READING!
DO EET!
MAN BLUSH
Like MAN TEARS
/me sees what's going on and slowly backs away
Pinkie
I found the greatest fic in existence
This fic is great
Well, if you adapt it to pony....
It could be
Humanized Beefspike and Applebloom
lol
Applebloom? Please! Make it Rarity!
Although, that would be too predictable
Actually, leave it at Applebloom.
but Rarity has no freckles
I think I need to give her an 80's makeover...
NO
WAIT
LET'S MAKE IT FLUTTERSHY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO9TGlqXhGs
Technically Twilight fits the most
but I was just cracking up at the thought of Fluttsie doing Laundry
(That and she probably has the lowest self-esteem out of all of the ponies(
But then you'd have to make Angel disappear for a while
also Fluttershy is the easiest name to scramble
And tell me Fluttsie writing "smut" don't crack you up
Fluttershy sometimes looks like she's ready to make Angel "disappear" for good
Ok, thats a good point
STUDYING QUANTUM PHYSICS
Why not Shulterfry?
*scramblinglikeaboss*
Shuetelfry
*shurtelfry
because my tongue would trip on itself every time I try to say that
Another good point
that
and because the actual story does scramble the names very lightly for humorous effect:
NO WAIT
IT SHOULD BE
QP is much tastier, IMO
QP?
Does it have to be apple-themed?
quarter pounder, another hamburger. :P
Whopper Jr?
Well, best hamburger is The Angus, but I'm not sure if that's available everywhere...
Call him Angus then
guys guys
lol actually that'd work pretty well
*DEEPBREATH* yay~!
Oh, ok RP
I'll have to skip the derp eyes, though, not good at painting. :(
:(
:O
hi
bbl
oh okay
Oh my
also guys
let's discuss crack pairings
go
Lets see, in such a relationship, Fluttershy would be a victim
you guys are forgetting something
>Youregoingtoloveme.gif
okay
inb4 /ss/
Oh boy
Give me a moment to think
I'll only be going with Canon, not Fanon here
hey GGgala_
I dunno really
RP, any thoughts?
that reminds me
.............
Why?
no idea
I THINK someone wrote a fic, many people found it diabeetus-tastic, and drew fanart of said couple
O_o???
Leave it to the Fandom
Bbl
Cya

why not?
Look at the eyes. Pure hatred.. EVIL
Pinkie Pie is the goddess of parties. She's not evil.
Wouldnt you be at least a little teensy bit afraid?
i see nothing wrong with that picture at all
(I'm exaggerating)
I might be afraid of whoever it is on the left...
(On a Cross and an Arrow)
Can't keep track of all the OCs :(
Not sure if you would consider them an OC
They are in reality, just a genderswap

<_<
oh there we go
dari: NOPE.tiff
Meh.
why?
Traffic lights.
I finished them.
Fuckwintastic
>traffic light changes live
Awesomez.
no I mean for the main rooms
although yes, a throttled room should be part of our agenda
To stop people from joining locked rooms I'd just make them invite only.
winning
ffffffffff
I can't really implement it before we have the frontend set up.
They only thing I'm still thinking about how to do is message throttling still.
I'm not sure who's working on it.
People get auto-voice on join.
And when they send a message their voice is removed for a couple minutes or something.
Although that does sound like something that'd work
As long as we can turn off voice notifications
Though anyone not using mibbit would still see the messages.
Maybe I could, I'll try
Try to see if there's someway to disable that notification though
http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/243/e/7/profile_solaris_by_trotsworth-d48fbmb.png <-- Nifty

Scrap them all until one remains. then don't do anything till that one's done.
Eh, kinda, I'm keeping two projects.

Speaking of back to the future, did you guys see those Nike shoes going for 75000 dollars?
I saw those
It the same technology as the wire reel in a vacuum cleaner
07don't be shy
I would Luna, but I'm not at home and feel bad to play it at work :p
07aww
07yea I can understand that
07We have our own domain too

07hehehe
Welcome to the goddamn herd.
I was reading on the treehouse forums that people's children don't want to watch this show and run away screaming and crying from it. I thought that this was cool
07Zecora scary?
07Hmmmmm
07nahhhh
No, I think the children are more disturbed by their parents liking the cartoon more than they do

05no spamming decap
Tiny equines that are in my possession
Nice play of words there
I kinda prefer having a playlist, though.
If I got picked, I would choose Howl's Moving Castle
Lol
Yes
Grave of the Fireflies... is a movie that everypony should see once
Orly
if you had the first season as a single film like espy said, would that mean you would tkae out the start/end music?
Yeah.
http://www.veoh.com/watch/v20393415WTQ3bYk3?h1=Howls+Moving+Castle+part+1
Its an anime movie
hm are we unable to connect here using pidgin? :(
and you wouldn't understand it if you hadn't played the games up to the 4th one.
Well,you probably would,but there are quite a few references to the series
And it is implied that people are aten by sharks,wolves and fall to their deaths in it
hey everypony
Hey
/me crashed back to the earth
Try not to stay for to long
Why? what's going on
lol
there is an epidemic, thats whats going on
flesh eating disease
AHH
it's like she's being suspended by her power
and she is awesome
awesome plus awesome equals more awesome
I have a the answers. NO SPOILERS.
I think the people making it are going to put their pony personas somewhere into s2
I think you should take a seat over there
WOAH-OH! LIVIN' ON A PRAYER!
Cant watch you, I'm asleep
hey
*gasp*
Background character maybe
/me watches exclusive clip of season 2
O.o
yeah I meant background, although maybe in season 3 she can race rainbow dash
oh, anyone seen young justice?
o.o
Seriously... hahaha...
there ya go
then luna can be all "you saved me now I'll return the favour" kinda thing
is it possible for them to remake care bears this awesome? I enjoyed that show
lol
carealot is stupis
*stupid
dude, NoHeart
not to mention ColdHeart and DarkHeart
I have no desire to coexist with them
I'm gonna be
You know
Back here.
If you need me, call
They can taste the rainbow
I know someone had a title like that but I can't place it
either comics or some cartoon
can't find but I'm thinking this might have been in Rifts Conversion Book 2: Pantheons of the Megaverse
oooh

05nope
/me sends LordCelstia to the moon
Hades from hercules
/me sends the moon into the sun
No, you cant send me to the moon
you cant explain that
Hades was a great villain.
Well, he just did.
2,14 he had a brilliant voice actor too, hades that is
oh yeah
2,14 see Dari script's post
Not gonna watch, seen too much already.
I want to fully enjoy Episode 1 in all its glory
and I don't mean the kind of Episode 1 that has Jar-Jar in it.
2,14 that being said, ANY link during the BMN stream is prohibited :P
except appropriate picture links, right?
2,14 yes
Is there any special reason for it? (not objecting to it or anything, just curious)
>from yesterday
2,14 mostly because Veemi is lamesauce and we've been sick of it :P
We won't have to reset it every time it goes back up, right?
Oh lawd, I <3 that Rarity dress
2,14 give it time, all shall be revealed soon! mwahahahahaaha!
2,14 Jar Jar does not exist
2,14 period
olololol
2,14 exactly :P
The episode where he pretends to be a Jedi right?
he's too far incorporated at this point, doesn't bother me
no he's the rep of naboo and... oh wait it wasn't obi-wan it was senator organa
I once pointed out that that character which does not exist has a line in Episode 3 to a friend
2,14 episode 3 also does not exist
Eh, I kinda like Episode 2 and 3 =P
2,14 forgive? no
2,14 you don't forgive a murderer when you finally inject the needle
I'm watching thinking "when is ahsoka going to die"
>yfw Episode 4-6 are now all musicals featuring him
2,14 if that happens, I'm burning down Lucas' mansion
Star Wars 3D
lawl
wat? He's been completely replaced now?
Han never shot first, because Greedo didn't shoot.
the only person to shoot still shoots first
You know, there are people out there that have never seen Han shoot first.
Han shot Greedo in cold blood, now that's a T-shirt I'd buy
No, the only person to shoot is the only person to shoot :P
Oh yeah, Han definitely knew Greedo WOULD shoot him if it continued on much longer...
besides, didn't greedo's finger slip on the trigger as he collapsed or something?
Totally justified.
I think guys like Greedo and Chewie were ambiguous and we could have perceived them as being younger
2,14 it's amazing
Cartoon > CGI, but CGI is still good.
I wish they'd come up with slightly different titles to call them by
How about the old Reboot cartoon?
i just want to eat my damn sammich
2,14 sorry, I hated the CGI
ITS A FIREWAAALLLL
2,14 the animation was blocky as shit, the voice actor's were terrible
<3 AndrAIa
2,14 and the writing...god awful
3rd season I believe
the writing is actually pretty good
2,14 I watched a few of the first episodes, then watched a few of the second season
I did not know about this...
2,14 still hated it
I thought there was a CGI movie
Well, at least you gave it a shot.
2,14 :P
I liked that episode that focused on Zero the Hut and his girlfriend
that was great
The CGI movie was basically the first 3 episodes stiched together into a movie.
2,14 despite my flaming egocentric appearance, I do actually treat things with an unbias prespective :P
yeah it was to introduce lolihka
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCcejkpjg <-- Have some leather pants
Val have you seen the Ziro the Hutt episode?
2,14 no, I haven't seen that one
2,14 lol :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wws7mnMewPw&ob=av3e
2,14 that was such an awesome show
It was.
the only thing I disliked about reboot was the whole matrix/boob andraia thing
Heh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al6ssH4vkdY
2,14 though I may be extrapolating farther than I should ;)
My computer must look like a warzone after all these years. :(
they should have built on that concept more
2,14 :P
FUCK YEAH
"Ladies and gentlemen, Megabyte has left the building!"
he's a...villain, let's say that
oh, Enzo's birthday eh Dash
2,14 seriously? people are complaining
Yes
2,14 like...good grief...it had a warning
Megabyte and Hexadecimal.
I bet he's a cyborg pony
teenagers most likely
2,14 .......
same with dot, why did matrix not tap that
also, he has an awesome voice, just a different type of awesome
and then the rest of the season is the ponies goofing around?
2,14 lol
I WAS MAD YOU TURNED MY SIS EVIL
2,14 and the cycle of Celestia-related characters showing up once and never appearing again continues
2,14 careful
2,14 no spoilers
at first i was like -_- but then i was like :D
2,14 I know, but it's my duty to remind everyone
2,14 because the last thing we want is mudwars because someone let something slip
NEVAH!
alicorn doesn't have etymology I understand
2,14 trololololo
of, if you guys want to see an amazing anime, Yakitate Japan, I cried
2,14 but honestly, if you haven't played it yet, then you deserve to have it spoiled
2,14 it's like...such common knowledge
FF7
FF7
i say fuck FF
I learned about it a long time ago. Don't really care. Have no interest in playing it anyway.
Damn you, Val!
2,14 trolololololo
Hey, guys, guys.
2,14 but the older ones are some classics
2,14 I would say give it a try, but hey, to each his own
2,14 though not 7, I hate 7
except of course, for FF6 and 7 and 10 which got sequels
2,14 6 never got a sequel...
or wait I mean FF4 not 6
FF6 got a sequel?
Stream's up.
2,14 7 was only popular because it was a part of the first set of games that were willing to be raunchy
ello all.
*zombies in
lol FF7 was raunchy?
wow, I just downloaded 810 megabytes of the 21 bronycast episodes
Is there any way to refresh the stream with this one? It isn't showing for me.
There's only one spot where there's innuendo, and that's at the wall market
>implying implications
in terms of shockers though, nothing beats FF6 dealing with teen pregnancy
like wtf
FF6 had Opera. And the main villain successfully destroying the world.
2,14 6 was and remains the best FF
...You're sure the stream is up?
I can't seem to get anything from the stream either.
I thought Zeromus also destroyed the world
2,14 yeah dari, I'm not getting any stram
2,14 stream*
/me is at http://bronystate.net/theatre/
*Kefka laugh*
6? I thought it was 3 that did that =p
Oh.
2,14 but come on, Kefka is such a brilliant villain
if you want innuendo, how about KH's whole keyblade thing
2,14 FF4 main villain
Yeah, store-wise FF6 is superior, definitely
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
as opposed to espers found in another dimension?
and the great whale was just the name of the ship, it's not actually a whale
Zeromus = Cthulu
2,14 they're just lazy
:P
2,14 and aside from like, Umaro, all of them were really well done
14 I think.
The end of the world was really awesome in FF6
2,14 not a single one worked
wat?
2,14 really got my hopes up
saving him is easy, you just wait
2,14 nonono
2,14 at the end
omg
2,14 when he commits suicide
I never saw that, did that add that in the PS2 version?
Spoiler:Shadow commits suicide
2,14 it's always there
2,14 not talking about floating continent
oh
2,14 bro....that really sucks
capslock name bitches
2,14 man, they really should have drawn that out more though
2,14 I can still remember when I first noticed Relm could wear Shadow's pendant
or Archer-class at least
?
2,14 it depends on which FF you're talking about
2,14 the one you're refering to Espy is from 5
then i found an audio book
multitasking for the win
:(
uh... I believe it's the 2005 season one.
i was exited too
2,14 Decap: the only thing that stays consistent is the names
assuming = awesomeing
2,14 they are NEVER the same character
we could take the Tsubasa Chronicle approach, that they're all versions of each other in different dimensions
2,14 meh, I don't like that :P
2,14 which is a common misconception
Oh well, there are still 2 good ones for PS3
2,14 nor are Jedi good
Thought the only real carry thought in FF was bigs wedge and sid.
Jedi = Taliban
you can't weigh anything without emotion, it's the foundation of values and morality
2,14 they are considered evil because the factions themselves to not get along
Someone tell me which I should do first. Finish off the first Mass Effect, or start Deus Ex?
2,14 not to the Jedi
Finish
the Jedi are deluding themselves, and history has proven that it's imperfect
2,14 Beginning of the Jedi code: "There is no emotion, there is peace"
2,14 they keep things in order
Jedi are Druids?
2,14 eh...it's a stretch but I'll accept the metaphor
2,14 because druids act out of a divine connection to nature
2,14 which, in itself, is a "love-like" emotion
2,14 that is a much more acceptable metaphor to me
George Lucas butchered the Star Wars with episodes 1, 2 & 3
NNNNOOOO
Still not seeing any stream here.
You blew it up!
I shall not watch that season 2 clip!... Or should I?
I plan on not watching it.
I plan on watching the episode here next Saturday
On one hand I'd really like to watch it as the wait is unbearable, but on other hand I don't want to spoil myself.
/me still sees no stream
Ahhh
Snapz
Also, did the conversation topic magically change from FF to Star Wars while I was checking out Star Wars: The Old Republic? o.o
Look at The Old Republic, now back at me
THE TOPIC IS NOW DIAMONDS!
Diamonds?!
online :3
They are the girl's best friend
/me makes a pickaxe out of diamonds
Neil Peart.
No stream tonight? ----> Haha, time to finish ME1

Mass Effect?
Yes
that reminds me, I haven't finished ME2...
2,14 2012 is just around the corner :P
ME2 was good
2,14 lol
Plan is to go through 1&2 just for the third
I finished it in a day
/me disregards Mass Effect, acquires Battlefield 3~
6Hallo Flootershy~
/me wants a pickaxe made of stars.
2,14 A recommendation:
2,14 that was phenominally well done atmosphere wise
I want Battlefield 3.....
/me is ponypounced~ :3
Hey Fluttershy
lol I got ME2 for PS3, it's already got all the DLC I think :P
/me glomps Fluttershy
2,14 too much Liara
and before you ask, yes I did play ME1 for Xbox 360
/me is glomped, falls over. "Ahhhh...' >>; N-Not today, Grimmmy...
D:
The Arrival.
2,14 lol
oh, anyone else looking forward to Tribes: Ascend?
I'm following Tribes, Firefall and Planetside.
Ive returned from the moon
Yeah the only good thing about Arrival was it's the set up for 3
2,14 I hated arrival
LordCelstia, you're missing a vowel
6Fluttershy, PM please.
2,14 was complete shit, and a waste of my money
huh?
6PC, consoles are. . . below my standards~ ;D
oh u
lol
HEY
.....llllllll
the quiet ones are the evil ones
2,14 lol, that's because ME1's combat system was a joke
>>
<<
I'm not sure that means they were inspired by Demon's Souls. :/
/me [AK-47] AlltheJean
/me glomps Fluttershy
damn it didnt work out
where things could one shot you
/me [AK-74u] DecapKing
/me is glomped yet again, eeps. e-e; "Ahhh...."
/me glomps Silvermane
/me dodges
/me faceplants
Oh Hi Fluttershy
Demon's Souls was released in 2009
or maybe that was for ME3? lol
Uh oh...
6WHATPAYNE THERE ARE JETS! 8DD
ME3? MOAR LIKE ME2.5 AMIRITE?!
6YU AR RITE~
Well, ME2 uses the ME3 engine on PS3
2,14 um...what?
though not for gameplay, just graphically
huh..?
2,14 how can ME2 use ME3's engine...ME3 hasn't even been released...
=_=;
6WhatPayne: Ja~ It was fantastisch!
I return
Graphics engine for ME3 is revamped
elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele!
I played the 360 version of it
HAHAHAHA
...no, Val
ME2 for PS3 was released much later
/me glomps Fluttershy again. "BECAUSE I CAN"
/me gently hugs Fluttershy
/me [AK-47] Silvermane
Hot Wheels! Battle Force 5! Gotta fight together to survive! Never give up, never give in, we're gonna drive, Battle Force Five!
I'm playing it on PS3, it's working fine
Anyone in here have levels of paladin?
Everyone knows that Console ME is worst ME. Doesn't matter if it's on PS3 or 360. :p
Haven't experienced any stuttering, missing content would srsly suck though.
He shot me and then left. :/
/me Respawns
Oh!
A level 6+ paladin can use Remove Disease as a spell-like ability once per week, Fluttershy~
And I was like, huh... Gotta try that.
and that's Ghostbusters
/me begins with random D&D references
PS3 version's graphics are much worse, and the framerate still isn't even close to on 360.
Well, in that case...
NHL12. :) Eee! It's on it's way to me as we speak! :D
/me shouts, "SOUP! The cure for ALL ailments!"
/me [MOON CANNON] DecapKing
i spelled it wrong earlier
i just refreshed th page haha
oh.
nvm...
Anybody wanna be sent to the moon?
it was exclusively for PS3 here for a long time
Oh, right.
and PS3 version is much, much worse
Any Halo fans here? (and I mean the singleplayer not the multiplayer)
RAAAGE! Stop sending me campus jobs!
-thinks about bananas, sticks out her tongue- ...no, sorry...
Halo 3 made me rage a whole lot
ok well good
2,14 it should :P
cause you aint findin any bananas
In fact I am supprised magneto hasent showed up yet.
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
/me launches Fluttershy to the moon
BEEYETCH!
Oh, I don't really mind that. Sure it's problem, but I only play Halo for it's plot.
Aw i feel sorry for Fluttershy
/me is launched to the moon. "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH..." Fluttershy then splats against the surface.
2,14 halo....plot
/me goes and gently carries Fluttershy down back to earth
2,14 aha...haha....ahahaha....AHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAH
-teary eyed now- "Why did... did you launch me in the first place?!"
Cortana, you mean?
/me casts Revenance on Fluttershy
It's round and firm with nice finish
/me and Fluttershy dramatically hufg THE END :D
*hug
Oh!
Solitaire!
2,14 books do not fucking count, period
lol :P
2,14 fucking self-published bastards
I dunno, I thought there was a very good cinematic feel to the Halo games
2,14 Dari, unless you've read the Halo books you can't fucking talk
ROMANTIC IS IT NOT?
2,14 it's appaling
I don't play Halo.
:P
2,14 okay, then don't call me elitist :P
I know a whole lot of people don't like Halo for the same reason I don't like Call of Duty
Not that I'm complaining
EPIC FLUTTERSHY SINGING http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zPQTTE7yE8&feature=related
Wait. Waitwait wait. . .wait.
2,14 I'm only elitist about literature because of how far we've lowered our standards
Halo has a /plot/?
2,14 depends on his works
I really enjoyed The Stand and Insomnia
Are we still talking about Halo?
lol if you like
I like the plot of Halo 1, in a sense.
Yeah. Halo 3 was not as good as Halo 2 nor Halo 1
It is very well paced
and by the time you get to chapter 7 or whatever it is, and The Flood starts coming... wow
2,14 lol, I like you espy :P
I mean that chapter, with the Flood, that was one of the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had
SilverMane.... =-=
I felt high by the time I got to the next chapter
2,14 sorry, but the intensity of action does not equate to plot
yes Fluttershy?
2,14 is* even
SilverMane you are not in the usual rooms... >>;
You don't think pacing is part of a good story, Val? :P
I know Fluttershy. Just taking a break for the moment.
SilverMane: oh....
*everyone
/me hugs Fluttershy.
You really think that's all there is to it, Val?
2,14 the cutscenes were typical action movie shots. There was nothing redeeming about that
I kinda figured that was why the games have remained popular: Multiplayer, wherein you toss a bunch players on a map and they start killing each other.
2,14 Half-Life 2
HL2 is boring. :/
I had much fun playing Counter-Strike back in college on the campus network.
I do prefer Killzone 2&3 to the Halo games though, but the story is atrocious in KZ2
I got through HL2 once. Can't stand playing it again.
Of course, now if I want to play counter-strike I have to actually /pay/ for it.
Offline
k
2,14 lol IKR?
I hate counterstrike.
6Dashite. We need to
but yeah, gameplay is amazing in KZ2&3
I also Hate Halo's, multiplayer.
6COMMAND UND CONQUER!!!
2,14 haven't played 3 yet, but I want to
:D
Highly recommended, much less annoying story, though... that's not saying much.
2,14 yeah, but even if the cutscenes are terribad, the visuals are rather impressive
6And WhatPayne~
How cheap?
I personally liked it more that Halo 3 or Reach.
I dunno, $20?
2,14 yeah
I live in Sweden, though... prices don't always drop as quickly here :(
wish I could import from the US, but 360 is region locked
Amazon.co.uk?
thanks for the tip
That's 82UDS
I think Webhallen has it for around $25ish
the USD is pretty weak right now, though...
Yeah.
But still, come on.
No problem.
I can drop by there next week, awesome.
Was just trying to remember the places that I've heard Swedish people buying from before. :D
And even cheaper when you purchase them avoiding taxes.
lawl, webhallen is where all the gamers go pretty much
600 or 700, depending on where you buy
I think 700 is the "recommended" price, but webhallen doesn't care about that :P
That has taxes included?
Yeah, exactly, webhallen is awesome. :P
yes, with taxes
More important, they have a 2x4GB DDR3 for 435 apparently. >_>
and yeah, that's a lot :P
Oh it's higher than in Finland
30%?! :O
might be 25
Ahoy
we have "only" ~23%
Hello
lol, yes
on games :P
fun
Quiet you...
:P
I hate having to figure out how much it is in taxes when I go shopping in the US
You've shopped in US?
how significant is that?
very significant.
6.2%? O.o
Why not just bump it up to 7%?
It's a nice country, as long as you don't turn on Fox News :P
It's really like 6.24%
..or countless local radio pundit shows
things*
That's stupid. They have reason for doing that?
:P
^
Ok, I see,
And technically Ontario and parts of the maritimes as well since they have HST now, but that only sorta counts.
methinks
HST?
ahhh
this is <10% of wholesale cost.
you pay $5k
O_O
"federal" is such a weird word...
OH shit! It's the feds! Run for it!
I'd imagine that people living near state border wanting to shop adjacent state if their taxes are lower.
People do that, yeah. :P
it took a whie
Oh wow.
i probably talked to 30 people
Exactly.
they dont make it easy :P
Oh no. For those you go to the reservations.
That
For example in newyork state it's like 12 bucks for a pack.
$12 for a pack of smokes? You've got to be shitting me.
Eyup
It's about 6 and change for one here in Florida
Where does government get their tax-income, from different sources, or do the states give a portion of the taxes to government.
Up from 3-something from a few years ago
but I'm guessing that's a fair bit
states receive federal dollars for infrastructure, like highway maintenance
however, they have to agree to certain restraints
i have no idea
its all just customer returns
/me waves
Payroll taxes as well.
GUYS GUYS GUYS
But doesn't that taxing system cause discrepancy between states in public services?
Yes?
Sorry to get off topic, but right when I came back home, I was having such a shit day. Now, I'm feeling pretty good again. :P
(well I heard her mention them)
Listening to pony music and talking here is nice.
mib_40at5v I have "Show Time!"
Just a lot of stress with studies and work, it's pretty overwhelming
mib_40at5v because it's wrong. And I've only got Show Time! as well.
I know RP, ponies also relax me!
also gaming talk and ponies
But wow, it's 5 PM and I hardly got to sit down here
no pony is streaming?
Oh yeah gaming talk can be quite nice even with all the differencing opinions
Yeah I don't mind if people don't like the same games as me.
like I thought Darksiders was awesome
YES
also guys, did you see the spoilery clip on EqD?
(I don't know that, actually)
Oh dammit. I was supposed to be playing ME1
lol
2,14 good grief....not this again
lol
/me is here watching Val do this whole thing ;3
2,14 oiy...
2,14 I never said awful
Good. What'll we do with the C&C thing-y?
2,14 I just...wasn't...very interested...
lol okay, I wasn't here for that
2,14 lol
Yakuza 3?
Vanquish
:P
2,14 lol...I think I'm just going to stop offering my opinion on things
I mean has any dates been set about any games?
2,14 lol, you should see how the other ones went :P
2,14 Deus Ex
and I hear the sequel is really good
2,14 then you (to some degree) are cultured in my eyes :P
2,14 also, it's a prequel
I hear that Deus Ex 2 was shit (invisible wars?)
2,14 not a sequel
2,14 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS INVISIBLE WAR
Oh, okay
6We need to make times for it Payne. .
2,14 IT DOES NOT EXIST
:3
and there was no such thing as Invisible Wars, seriously...
2,14 WE DO NOT MENTION SUCH BLASPHEMY HERE
LOL
LOL DARI
HAHA
/me never played any deus Ex games but respects them still due to DE:HR being made by Eidos Montreal
Yeah, I've never played it.
XP
French Canadian Dev team FTW
Oh, and RDR.
RDR
never played
^ MFW
Right. I'll go be "afk" to play the ME1. Ding me if you need me.
RDR is awesome

I know
only got 10Gb left that are available
Nao.
on my 451 Gb hard drive
RP, consoles aren't as precise and don't have as good hardware
/me 2,14 has a 2Tb drive for his desktop, you jelly?
no
2,14 you should be :P
^
2,14 it is :P
Prove it
Consoles are just as precise, though yeah they might not have the same performance :P
2,14 what...by copying over all my files?
simple!
2,14 one fatal flaw with that
2,14 I'm up at college

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I figured it was HL2 or something like that.
Eh, I already know it's Minesweeper
heyall
/me has 4TB for her desktop, you TwilightJelly?
u jelly?
On my SSD...
Damn, now I'm depressed again.
2,14 was someone asking for me?
I think Silvermane was asking you something.
2,14 you're free to interpret that as you see fit :P
I think I need an injection of pony, stat
2,14 except we're having an entire re-stream of season 1
Wish I could stay up for all of it :(
Take this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrlzkKa6O8
Gonna go home everypony, see you all in a few.
2,14 jooiiiiiiiinnnnnnn usssssssss
Clearly the answer would be neither.
Dash is best pony.
2,14 see ya allis

re-streaming of season 1?
sleep is for the weak

lol we'll see, maybe if I can get enough sleep in before it starts
2,14 le sigh
2,14 yes, I do in all seriousness believe you should stay up with us
its a weekend anyway
I was sticking my tongue out, Val, I was kidding!
are all the episodes coming out on saturday?
2,14 ....
/me 2,14 prepares his trident
lawl
2,14 no kanye, it's only the first episode
Naw just one episode of pony
I know that, i mean future releases
Oh, lawl
and that's why I need caffeine
I dunno, I don't think that all episodes have been scheduled yet
I am sure all of them have not been planed but we know the first 2 have.
First two episodes are on Saturdays
It seems pretty likely that they'll continue that, I think.
xD
Well that's how American politics work, I hear.
not the same kind, though!
have you seen the pics they been posting? looks like raining tea to me.
...wow, you just blew my mind
I'm expecting even more Chocolate Rain jokes when the episode airs. :P
lol
Yeah, probably XD
That's ok. When I first saw the pic, I thought it was raining blood
That would require a diffrent song.
not sure if one could poniefy Slayer.
Yeah. I guess chocolate rain would be in the style of Trollcord
That the name we gonna use?
*shrugs*
I just think it fits

I just saw the season 2 clip on Eqd
I came
Buckets
The only thing I crave is coffeh
Wow.... I was just invited to watch the Season 2 premiere on a projector
You lie
Just saw the season 2 clip
oh lol, NOT live, day after
I might go, then.
HD ponies on projected screen with surround sound? I don't think I can say no to that.
hi
heya
Hi
i get to scare the crap out of people
and at this haunted house it has been known to actually happen
Seems a bit early for Haunted houses to be seting up.
i had an interview for it
...crap, I CAN say no to HD ponies on a projected screen in surround sound... it's a complete S1 marathon first, and it ends in the middle of the night...
rehearsal starts the 22nd
Yeah... and school starts early on Monday...

"I GOT A GREAT DEAL FOR YOU"
'uh... yeah, I actually got 8% somewhere else thanks...'
that's not a deal.
It's an improvement over the 22% they presented me initially :p
lol.
APR?
Anual percent rate I think?
Something like that
Ahh okay
But yeah it's hard to get a good interest rate when you have no credit history
This is my first
But can't always win
yeah... cars are expensive
eyup
I just bought mine out right. but then again KIA's are cheep.
Bummer.
At least around here where public transportation is piss poor
Got a great deal at an end of the year sell.
Yeah, it's all about timing sometimes
lancers are nice.
Shame they stoped making the 3000gt's
Bwahaha
Saw that comeing from the link
Wrong kind of pony though :P
Hmmm
Okay, I watched the clip
I am cursing that I did.
Because now I can wait for Saturday EVEN LESS
I really have to see the voice credits for S1E1
Wait you are pony searching at work?
I watch pony vids during downtime at work...
Well I do to but I use my phone
Depends on if someone's around, for me :P
I am, RP
But with ponies now I'm everywhere haha, I don't want the records to stay around
(I mean I pretty much single-handedly tackle 90+ people with computer issues AND still make about 30% less than people in my position but HEY no slacking)
I would ponify my FB, but I don't use it anymore
Good way to look at it.
:D
Though I recognize for some it might be a bit harder, if their friends and family are kinda crazy.
hi is streaming?
anyway, heading right back out
Crazy as in stupid and intolerant
I'm still surprised how tolerant my friends and parents have taken it
k
Same here, Thunder_Dash... haven't even gotten any snide remarks.
'Cause honestly the one thing that threw me off from using Ubuntu more was lack of a reliable VNC client

I am not typing that in every time.
Find similar ideas, how it's done, etc.
Well, yeah, that you do.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Servers
That's the help page for VNC servers. Not sure which one is best.
I actually really wanted to run ESX server on it, but my processor won't take it and the hours I wasted of my time trying to get it to work were not rewarded
Man the ME moves slowly
I might set up my own computer with a VNC server, actually... Might be able to use it for work.
It's a pain using the computers at work, they're literally from the 90's...
Oh yeah. Yellowish grey.
they were really good at the time, though
...which doesn't help me at all now

when they went from the 386 to the P1 chips.

Well...this is going to be awesome
I can't wait until Saturday now
I'm guessing you watched the clip.
6_9
I told you guys that earlier and I didnt get even the slightest response. >.>
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention
Oh yeah, I heard
MFW years 9 and 10 in UK school system are colts.
I have not, however, watched the clip
Me neither.
/me shrugs
Well, not everyone is a Trekkie :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4FGvMdhG80&feature=related
I WAS right after all. Now... wasn't I?!
Exactly as I said. :P
Floop.
Students in years 9 and 10 in the school system here are colts.
Though that term probably isn't used in most schools.
How old are you at year 10 of school?
Year 10 you are between 14-15
Oh okay
Never heard that term used for jr high.
we ditch the whole 'grade' thing after highschool starts generally. then we do freshman...etc.
School system here goes: Primary school
Years 1-6
Secondary school
Years 7-11
You weird Brits
Elementry, Jr high, High school.
End of compulsary education here.
At the age of 16.
^
Afterwards there's sixth form, which takes place at a secondary school.
Lower sixth - year 12, upper sixth - year 13.
Or college, which only deals with years 12-13 unlike a secondary school.

I'm saying I'd like for her to leave message on my page
you have silly names for things, like bender

/me hugs Fluttershy
Well, quite a lot anyway.
Well hello.
like 'bloody' and 'wanker'
Like gagging.
It's perfectly fine to say in the UK
or 'tosser'
"She was gagging for it"
That would make no sense with the American definition of gagging
You naughty Brit
Wait, a gangbang in America is rape?
07Allis
Yes this conversation would get strange looks in the US?
yeah
O_o
Not nessecarily
well, sort of a kind of rape
but it could mean like a mob of people
Here it just means orgy.
I'm from America and I'm not giving it a strange look
Yes Luna?
I guess it means the same sort of thing
Cause you have context Barry.
hm
Orgies aren't sexual?
yes they are
Where'd I say orgies aren't sexual?
O_o
at least here they are
I make....................
lol
KanyeEast: Bender just means gay.
a lot of...
In my book, rape is simply the unconsentual touching of another's genitalia.
Music.
"He looks like a bender"
[00:23] Well, quite a lot anyway.
I was making a bad joke.
:P
Oh.
wut
XD
:D
Which is why I have the idea,when dealing with partial or full nudity, look but don't touch unless given consent
That is a co0mpletely different philosophy
WOHOO

KanyeEast: favorite part of history?
You can't friggin tell 'cause it all blends anyway...
:o
You did, Nat? :0
It seems fine to me :0
hmm...
I know a lot about the american civil war. And chinese history from about 1700-now
I hate American history. x_x

Ugh. Moping is no way to act.
FIXIN' TIME
I really like the alt one.
yeah trying to get everything ready for saterday

Alt one is now standard, 'cause it's coolest

Silvermane writes them.
0Yes, Treylove.
I'm just getting a statistical analysis for a college paper
..I read one once.. and it ruined part of my perceptions of some ponies.
that reminds me of when a friend of mine asked me to do a dramatic reading of a clopfic
Silvermane is the master of writing them.
Because I have some that a friend of mine asked me to do...starring him
I'm prud of those two, actually
Lol :p
/me pulls SilverMane tightly into her arms, growling.
Herospirit... wow, thanks for the praise, but... i actually don't. I simply RP clop-scenes well.
/me squeaks at the sudden embrace
wait
but I read it anyway
Fluttershy
But you're writing the... thing
that thing thing
rutting day was worse
way worse
Yous trollin
also, guys
I'm all for BDSM but that was too intense
>Fluttershy pulls Silvermane into her ARMS...
LOL. You're going to fit in fine here Trey.

It is like drugs.
Gah.

just trust me that I'm away
@OTPmeter Wrextershy
I don't want to leave you any more than I have to.
WHOA.
._.
I'm Saving that
what's happening!?! i just got here!
too bad those SRW games are Japanese only
tomatoes
Oh.
needless to say
robots, robots everywhere
it is every mecha fanboy's wet dream
and the plots are actually GOOD. Too bad they are in Japanese
still the battle animations are amazing and I know how to play it. It's fun
Hey hero
you'd think TTGL would just sweep everything.
they power their robots with hotbloodedness
Before you sleep, would you like to see Twi's link select cursor?
One frame left, and I'm not changing design atm.
oro?
I'll PM you when I finish the frame
Huh? Sorry? I just got here ;_;
look up, it's not that far
Oh, sure, I'll see it :D
Hero, check 'yer PM.
Saved for future posterity: http://i920.photobucket.com/albums/ad43/herospirit/Wrextershy.png
I don't remember saying whoa.
DANG IT I MISSED SOMETHING
I havent seens haruhi at all
he means if they did a constant loop of the same episode, just animated different
same content, over and over.
its a shipping term
lol
Oh, ok
isnt that kinda normal for a way to fill time in jap anime?
Gintama had a couple episodes like that
not quite, haruhi had literally the same content
for 8 episodes
Kanye: someeeeething like that
Think less Time Lord and more Dimensional Lord, at least according to SRW, which introduced the concept
oh
It was a time loop
I thought it was some sort of repeating the scenes on the same episode
I was stupid enough to watch all 8 episodes.
not repeating episodes
now that'd be weird
nah, literally 8 episodes animated in different ways.
and with slightly different scenes
spike could be like "twilight denwa"
apple bloom would be 'kyon's sister'
applejack denwaaa
Pinkie
^This
I just read the translated light novels, they were pretty good
lol, the only thing I know about Haruhi
is the music "God Knows"
0Haruhi is fine but overrated
which has a fucking awesome guitar solo
and thats it
that series needed 20% more Tsuruya
Counfound these ponies
also
WMG Time
FiM belongs to the SRW OG-verse
Same with Pinkie Pie and Excellen
Ergo it is one of the many OG-verses
also you guys
TO DA MOOOOONAAAAAH http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgvQgHIbF-U
lol
it's an SRPG
.....
Clearly Celestia has had a hand on this
WHY HAVEN'T I PLAYED THIS YET
it's her moon banishment platform
herospirit: go play SRW J
there are like 40 SRW games
O_O
it's a 20-year-old series this year
And inmensely popular
relax herospirit
they aren't sequels
Cool, I'll try'em out
But for now, I sleep
for example, all of the handheld games (barring Z2) are standalone
the main series are as such:
Nighty night, Herospirit
My little tester. <3
Time to sleep.
:3
Night everypony! :3
Z Series: Z, Z2 -Hakai-hen, Z2 - Saisei-hen (to be released), Z3 (announced for PSVita)
the rest of the games are all stand-alone
Not me >.>

Yep, usually 2-3Mb/s
Yeah, that's definitely weird
thats the most dismemberment i have ever seen in a single fighting scene

It was an honest mistake on his part
You can use mIRC all you like, I'm not knocking it.
It's not the be all and end all of IRC clients, though.
I'm using colloquy
/me doesn't really care about which client people use. Just likes slapping people with a large trout
I'm on a copy of mIRC I paid for.
one of those has to go
Not if you're drawing the CMC in their outfits from the talent show

How can that be right? I must of done something to screw up my DNA

Potentially...
Good evening.
or afternoon, whichever.
Got rid of the 30 pounds of random paper printouts my boss left when he got fired
Well, at least that something
Mixed, of course, with invoices, signed purchase orders, and other important things I need to keep
and ouch, that's kind of a pain
Allo, Aloo
Allo*
aloooo
thanks
Hey
in HD 1080
:I
had to download a torrent
do you have a torrent for 1080p?
I just googled "friendship is magic 1080p torrent"
Pretty sure it was the first result I used
btjunkie => blocked here in italy
gotta use TOR
hi.
ahhh
xD
lol I'm guessing not
ohwow... Italy blocks all torrent sites?
eeeeeeyup
thanks to our beloved prime minister
pfffffft
THE idiot
Well, he's a crook, that's for sure...
Cool, where are you moving?
I mean Italy is a nice country, but I could understand not wanting to live there. :P
probably Norwich in the UK
^
it's good if you are a tourist
I <3 the UK
OH
SHIT
I did bring the entire company network down but it works!
trunking?
Eyup
lol I hope you brought it back up again
I have a problem where my wireless clients are on a subnet controlled by a L3 switch, but they can't connect to any assets in the datacenter
Looks like I was doing it wrong it seems
I was never taught much of the advanced networking that we actually use in the real world at school
same here
but i currently use assembly xD
I'm not exactly allergic to low level, but I much prefer high level languages
...until something needs optimized
^
Eyup
I am return
if you use PICs you know why use asm
Look at that, it broke again
stream down?
*why i use asm
stream down, yessir
oh lol, microcontrollers
Yeah, I do understand why you'd use ASM :P
:)
Well, not really because it's not a glass cannon
But I don't want to reconfigure my virtual server
It could mess things up quite a bit though
Yep
By itself it went from trunking to static access
now*
but you know how to fix it?
oh boy here we go
Yup
Going home, see you guys in a few
later!
err, I need to learn to empty my recycle bin more often
101 gigs
and here I was wondering why I only had 20 gigs left
Is it normal for EqD to hit 10M page views in... a month or something like that?
:P
Likely both, I think.
EQD has something like 192k page views per day
EqD has been online for how long?
i don't know
it's baffling how much content there is for them to link to
yes
o_o
sure mostly its fics
but still
posts go as far as may 2011
still looking for something older
pretty sure there's january 2011 posts too
yeah
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/01/news-blog.html
This is likely the oldest post
January 19th
wow
xD
Same here, or well that's when I "joined the herd" anyway
They have aprox. 39.31M pageviews atm
That makes for aprox. 6911 pageviews per hour
since the creation
And it was probably very much lower for the first couple of months...
From the 30M to today
aprox. 16866 pageviews per hour
which is 2.44x more
yeah, I'd say there was an improvement
lol :D
^
heh
Goddamn those creepers scare the bejeezus out of me still
wat
Hello again
xD
ohay Barry
creepers
oh right
never played it
<BOPM> DNSBL -> pmkubaoh!OAXOLW@199.48.147.38 appears in BL zone rbl.efnet.org (TOR exit server) <<<<<< good to know that bopm is still working good
yeah
cool
Oh wow
How many years has it been since I've used an IRC Client?
yeah, though I still have many hours before it is available for download (will be available tonight,but I am gonna give it some extra time to let the servers cool down
Guys?
Guuuuys?
hi
:P
lol
I felt the same way
Alright just making sure. Been a long time since I've had an actual irc client.
hahaha
xD
I'm buying a laptop
Or at least I think I am
specs?
Thinking of the Y470 from Lenovo - i7 quad-core Sandy Bridge, 8 gigs of Ram, Nvidia 550M
About 5 pounds
woah
The screen leaves a lot to be desired sadly, only 1366x768
I have no idea how much a pound is
but the computer seems great
Around 2 pounds in a kilogram
1lb = 2.2kg
oh
Or rather the other way around
:P
Does the Y series have a trackpoint?
Not sure, but I don't care for it
aw, that's my current resolution, you mean meaniepants :(
If it does I'll disable it
mine too
I think it is great
>_>
for a laptop
lol
My reaction is.... Wut.
16:9 needs to die when it comes to laptops.
^wut
Well, can't really help it nowadays
Aspect ratio. 1366x768, 1600x900, 1920x1080
Most screens are going the way of 16:9 instead of 16:10
prefer 16:10, or do you mean you want 4:3?
but why does it need to die?
Because there is little enough vertical screen real estate on laptops as it is and downgrading to 16:9 cuts back on that even more.
On desktops, you can always upsize, use portrait mode or add another monitor. You can't do that with a laptop and still keep it portable.
Hmm, color-wise this client isn't great is it
xchat?
Oh wow, this other Lenovo model has a blu-ray burner
Because people wanted fullscreen movies for their 4:3 CRT TVs.
...
LOL
But thats dumb
But that's the consumer public.
And the other thing is that they advertise the Widescreen as "special feature"
Argh, this is challenging.
It's a VERY nice laptop for the price, but I'm not sure I need all of it.
...though they still cut the sides sometimes to fit 16:9
Well hopefully in future with widescreen tv's that trend dies away.
...and shouldn't be :P
/me trolololol
Nothing makes me more angry than accidentally buying movie that is 4:3 aspect. (At least back in VHS days)
People in mibbit can't connect at all I don't think.
Some minor releases are still available only in 4:3
"chat Closing Link: [109.169.29.95] (CGI:IRC -- Invalid password)"
Adding the mibbit password?
I think they added the wrong password
at mibbit
Ahh.
lemme try something
But somewhy the TV's in my country still show the 4:3 movies.
They do the same on TV here, at least in SD. The HD channels are all in widescreen.
Hmm.
Mibbit works here now it seems.
That sucks :(
I just tested mibbit.
Yeah.
Yeah it does
Is that a server OS or a personal OS
Anybody hoooooome hoooome hoooomeee hommmeee
But Awesomeshy probably gave them the bronychat one too.
:I
That's when you try to connect irc.ponychat.net
Personal
and it is not coming out, technically
Well
but the developer build version is
irc.bronychat.net: Closing Link: [207.192.75.252] (CGI:IRC -- Invalid password)
tell me if that worked
it's still
yeah they have the password wrong at mibbit
=I
And it's the kind of cut off where the first few minutes are in widesceen and you think "oh good, proper aspect this time" but then at the credit sequence it's like "nope back to 4:3"
really? xD
"purchase"
I'll just replace the right one with the wrong one
goodnight fellows it's time for me to sleep
>yfw I know the wrong password
Oh wait.
bye!
uh
It's working now.
DVDs are sped up by 4% here
r u srs
cya
night MeteorVenture
i'm starting to watch Usagi Drop!
yes
Oh yeah the PAL NTSC conversion speeding up...
Dev build is free, if I read right
i'll ask about it later lol
bye!
also keep the embedd at bronychat.net
cya:D
Oh shit, $607? I'm gonna buy like 4 at work
we're not exactly done here yet
Some of them work.
Night MeteorVenture
Others do not.
Hmm
and that just drives me crazy :P
Ahh.
That's annoying.
Awesomeshy: why exactly did you give them bronychat.net too? Seems a bit silly.
I'll probably just do a Virtual boot
and I was half thinking
And then you realize
:(
I'm not denying it either
Why won't mibbit let me in? :(
Because none of our mibbit users (most of them) can join. :/
bad mibbit!
again, pitch. The speed difference is negligible in most movies
is it working now?
It keeps yelling at me about some kind of bad password.
Oh.
:/
Well, at least I have mIRC.
Hiya Val
2,14 hello
when should we be done
Awesomeshy: see #opers
whoa
this is probably why tonight we have only 25 users
Probably.
oh lol
That explains a lot
i was trying to log in before
IRC client strikes again
yep
ChatZilla=BestZilla
where's the real pinkie?
i want some huggin'
No, still not working.
No it's not because the music is pitch higher
also
i saw some pony tf2 crap going on
dari
?
LOL
And pitch change in music is much more noticeable than in speech
suggested playlist
Oh, I guess looking at retail stores is a bad idea since I need to finance this shit
jeez
Yeah.
(wow, i have 10s lag)
2,14 you're such a trooper dari :P
I hope
alright
how about now
sorry, again
this is completely my fault and I apologize
It's still not working.
http://i.imgur.com/3vQgg.png
"What's that? You can buy a japanese DVD from japan and watch it in North America? PREPOSTEROUS"
Hmm
2,14 why is my text highlighted?
"We must punish these hackers"
It opened the channel, but shows no users/topic/anything.
And the connection hasn't shown up for me when I check mIRC.
O_o
because i can't read the text if i don't highlight it
Well, at least you can buy Japanese Blu Rays and play them in the US :P
Improvement!
Even though it thinks it has connected./
D:
ooook
The problem in here is that in most foreign releases are missing one key detail we Scandinavians like
That's called subtitles
Ahh, back to invalid password.
Ok.
Give me a while to do that, the users are getting pretty fed up with being shunted all over the place.
I know.
Pontang: are you on bronychat?
Sorry about all of this.
I don't either but some people do need them
k, I'll do it then
I need to update the server address for this network.
Do iTunes movies have subtitles?
2,14 lol
aw :(
2,14 nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2,14 where to now Dari? :P
Where to?
（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Same network, but because of a merge, irc.ponychat.net
>_<
To mibbit!
（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Again?
ponychan merge?
omg
How scandalous
^
We're adding more servers to support everyone.
It's alright
like...
now?
Oh dear. Again?
Yeah, I'm just switching the mibbit embeds. :<
*sarcasm
ok ppl, time to move
I haven't updated the site yet.
irc.ponychat.net
Hiya Dari.
ponychan doesn't like me
already up?
Hey.
>w>
I'm on it
HEY
i did it
xD
lol
Dari, is Nickserv up?
Yes.
You can only get 35 people per server?
... huh.
Services are up, you can see chanserv.
:P
time for more caffeine injections...
Nickserv isn't responding.
Weird.
Different services.
Not on anope any more.
2,14 though am I still on the color script? :P
2,14 no warning, huzzah!
You won't get a +r anymore.
Hrm.
Oh oh!.
Planning to stay up for long?
Nickserv wasn't posting messages to me in #bronystate is all.
Services usually send you notices anyway.
ok guys, server's up
switch to irc.ponychat.net/6667 #bronystate
probably
how do we switch to that?
That's by preference of the client you are using, not the services.
As that is the standard protocol.
Well
well, i'll keep it for a while xD
hi
Hi
hello
is it mirc?
[](/b24)
or mirc
B-22!
or whatever
It's relatively easy to use.
i use xchat
Mibbit links are updated/
Refresh page?
Xchat is probably one of the best, but I like mIRC the most.
okay, see you guys over there
uh
ohay ponies
Hai
hey all!
welcome back!
uh
Is this the last one?
is this it?
=\
We're moving till the job is done!
Crap crap crap....
okay
i'm trying my hardest not to get spoilered
NNNNOOOOO
2,14 well we're do our best to make sure that doesn't happen kanye
I got in with FlutterBro just fine
is it working
2,14 and dari! SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
It says 'Fluttershy' is already in use
I just had to reregister the nick
Because of spoilers :P
xD
You has spoilered?
2,14 as much as I want to talk about S2, we are making sure that we keep the spoilers in check
mums the word
about those spoilers
whats really to spoil?
Yeah, sorry if you wanted to find that out first hand :(
I spoilerereeded myself
I didn't pick much up from the clip
-earlier today
2,14 even though I agree with you, we want to set this rule now
how do i connect
:p
or something like this
yeah
That's... not really fair. I've been using Fluttershy from the beginning
right?
Available networks are [dalnet, efnet, freenode, hispano, ircnet, moznet, quakenet, serenia, slashnet, solidirc, undernet, webbnet].
TBH that clip just spiked my interest in season 2
ok
I agree mib
must be: irc.ponychat.net
and channel #bronystate
<---
You still use that :P
there should be a button somewhere
that'll work

Hmm...

Damn, I can't add a @ in front of my name. :p

Dari, how did you...?
how's everything working in here
For mirc right?
Copy-paste it.
Oh

I'm crazy sorry guys
i'm looking for the online guide
hey, thats really cool
Why, even.

totally sorry
2,14 inb4 nick spam :P
That ok `Fluttershy?

it still makes me very sad not to be just plain Fluttershy anymore....
Damn, can't use % or & either. :p
Isn't Fluttershy the Streamception FLuttershy?
/me sips tea
`Fluttershy: mane 6 names are reserved for bots

I liked that one
2,14 I'll have to sacrifice someone with my trident in order to appease it
Pontang...?
whats the irc server
LOL
irc.ponychat.net
2,14 HURRAY!
Why not reserve mane 6 and other characters for mods?
irc.ponychat.net
ChanServ doesn't strip control codes.

and I connect via irc.bronychat.net
AGAIN?1
[00:24] ChanServ doesn't strip control codes...? O_o
xD
For the in-channel commands.
:P
2,14 HEY

Perhaps you should try for a slightly different variation on flutterwhatever
like fluttergirl or adorableshy
.... AGAIN.
FlutterSis?
Shush.
No... I'm...
hey you did it
its not working.
this is the LAST time

Aight, 'nuff of that
For the in-channel commands.

Shoo be doo, shoo shoo be do
Why would you include control codes in that?
a fez?
Anyone know how to make an animated gif?
fezzes are cool
Wait.
If nick changing is open... >>
My script always uses colours in #BronyState.
J/K
<<
Hmm
>>
Well
You have to combine the flags or they'll reset I believe.
its not working
2,14 colors are handled by dari's script
i connected to irc.ponychan.net
You can do /cs for all those commands
port 6667
unable to resolve
ok
FlutterSmooze?
/me is still thinking good names
try to delete the 6667
Yeah I know, but the they're for lazy people. :P
You can set any trigger per channel
and connect
the in-channel ones
just let her be fluttershy
^
I got nothin'.
>>;
i have to input a port
Or am I thinking of something else?
Of course there is that. But only if mods are nice
well
6667
:\
its irc.ponychan.net
correct?
no
Huh.
ZeMagics?

Sorry
I'll... just have to live with `Fluttershy...
No. Look at /cs help flags and /cs help template for a much more flexible system.
I was out of ideas anywho
You can use templates like Anope's VOP/SOP/HOP/AOP

But it shouldn't be much of an issue as it is.
GO. LISTEN. NOW.

"Water, ey? Alrighty, comin' right up"
"I heard you were ranting about evil in the town square today"
Well, looks like I'm NOT buying my laptop luls

Hey.

(JOIN US PINKIE.)
I glance suspiciously at the bard. "Can I help you, minstrel?"
Not today, herospirit. Had it been tomorrow, I probably would have :(
remember, hero you overheard them of the evil talk
and you wish to adventure
(Alright.)

/me lives and goes to school in upstate

Kanye: Oh baby.
/invite <nick>
er, /invite <channel> <nick>
I roll my eyes at the bard "Of course, you may prove yourself useful. Hopefully you are handy with a weapon"
;3
The Barkeep disregards the Bard's enthusiasm and says "I'll give you a discount and I really hope you two can get rid of this problem in this town, my customers look as though they want to kill me."
I scrunch my face in thought. "I once beat a crazed hobo with my lute."
the room is only 1silver for you two
both of you have 50s
"...he bit me. It was self defense."
i'd say hand, but ponies don't have those
It's LIVE!

Oh I don't want to live on the moon.

/me loads up the Season 1 playlist in VLC
Feels bad man.
Whats up, Allis?
Didn't get the approval to finance the stupid laptop through the Lenovo website :p
Awww :(
And you can't build a history if you don't have loans :P
/me hugs back
That sucks :(
i got a history by being a cosigner
Yeah. Got mine stolen from inside my room, inside my own home
;~;
aw, g'night
I'm gonna be a bit afk, physics studies and pony eps running in the background.
Night yos
Right RP
Listening to the interview now.
Took long enough to load my friggin' music.
Well, now I can walk around and listen to music.

Oh?
9and SPAAAAAAAACE

0.0
Pontang, this is the mane channel on this network, right?
Yes
:p
9...that's going to be like 35 chapters from now though
It's the network lobby
9since I'm gunning for like 50
/me 9should start writing Chapter 5...
Lol
haha
9yeah
9but still
9I like foreshadowing from really, really early
Most network lobbies are.
=p
9Kamen Rider Wyburn
9Yes, it's one of THOSE fics
Lol
9that said
9it basically plays with a Human/Pony World duality
9it's also a war story
9so it's a two-front war
9gonna write Chapter 5
That may take awhile :P
9or
>_>
I should take note from you guys, really
Oh, it hasn't been updated on EqD yet?
I hardly wrote 3 chapters of my novel, in summarized format
In the last 7 years.
Back to working on cursors...
For me it's the age-old dilemma,
I'm not a good writer, to add on the fact english isn't my first language.
I'd volunteer myself if I wasn't obsessively pursuing other things right now.
Naw, it's alright. Thank you though
But yes I do, but none of my friends are interested in doing it.
Or can, actually give me feedback as most aren't native english speakers themselves
Runs in the family or something.
Haha nice
My family also has some good writers
Actually my grandma's side of the family, most of her siblings have either written books or practice law
i would be a horrible lawyer
I'm a decent writer, as long as I don't have to write about myself
Jayson*
haha
/me likes the part where they all screwed the rules
Anyone who's listened to the interview: "Ya kno"
Screw the money I have rules.
Yeah trollight
Cya everypony
Good night everypony
It's you and best pony
Later guys.
Night Zero

hey, think we can watch a 417 minute movie if I win the lotto?
0What movie?
well... technically it was a mini-series, but it is compiled into a movie format now
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207275/
...
0... oh, that.
0Because
0FUCKING ALUCARD.
0And 'cause ponies are everywhere anyway
Alucard is best Castlevania.

Is this our permanent server?
0ffffffffffffff.
0Fuck transparency. Fuck it all
0Better yet
0The background
0Damn those checkered tiles
That too.

Not that I know of
0Nope.

i would say it's fine
I don't want to watch it, though. :P
That Thiessen interview, however...
That was epic
0I'm still listening <3
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/exclusive-season-2-audio-interview-with.html
Nat: Why?
Oh, for the marathon, right?
/me is watching Season 1 right now
0Dat interview
it's at 7am here
but it plays like 4 times in one day
6AM?
Central here
Hey guys
Ahhh
Hello Rayleonard
i dvr'd it :3
9it's 8AM over there I think
9wasn't it 9AM EST?
0That's about right for every saturday cartoon, ever
9AM Eastern?
For sure? O_O
Nat: Yeah, but PST has it on at 6 AM
i believe they have it back to back too
Androecian: Yeah
AAAAGH dammit I'm going to have to stay up all night.
Worth it though :D
Don't forget about the Season 1 Marathon before the premiere of Season 2 here.
0Well, poor PST children.
I don't think I can stay up for that...
0ALL THE COFFEE
I'll try though, I'm gonna power nap right before the marathon
and then loads of caffeine
Ahh :D
One "A" Movie and one "B" Movie
0Sitting here, focusing on music and drawing without thinking too hard.
This week's "A" movie is Blade Runner, while the "B" movie is *shrugs* My Little Pony: The Movie
0 46 minutes in >.>
0God, I knew this was long, but...
0OH CRAP.

Such an awesome interview
I tried cooking an omelet in my sleep, but then I died...
Seems legit.
0What are feet
0Pro, Nittany, pro.
Stupid lame wireless.
Hmm…what's a Ping timeout?
Already did.
takes too long for hte client to respond
^
lol do wat?
no that's how long it took to timeout
No, that's how long the client hasn't heard back from that nick.
I see...
Then in that case…is this the Krusty Krab?
:33
But I would be doing the same too if I hadn't eaten all day
0Robot, link?

I CAN'T DECIDE!
0D'awwww <3

I like how Angel keeps Fluttershy in check, too :P
But then again, where's the moral in that?
they're learning valuable lessons!
people don't always have common sense.
More people need to watch FiM, clearly!
When you try to please everypony, you end up pleasing no-pony at all.
/me nods
Haha, yup
but it did still turn out to be the best night ever
0At the doughnut shop. >w>
0Ffffffff, I want donuts
Yup, that's a lineup that's gonna be hard to beat

9but it doesn't
9so yes
9I can recommend
?
Really…so…we need to install Ad Blocker?
:P

9well, you could become a mod by filling the mod application form and passing an interview..
There's a form?
9or you could show us some special talent of yours that could help the site somehow
9for modding, there is
I do like modding.
9for streaming S2/graphic design department/other logistics, there isn't
Where's the application?
9lemme get the app
Well…I'm good in Math…is that a special talent?

Very good..
Mexico City.
Oh :P
Yeah, I think it's MST.
I hope I'm not hungover this saturday.
Wouldn't be able to enjoy it as much as I should.
/me hugs Nat~ :3
0^.^
0Yeah. 5.5~ hours of sleep isn't that great anyway
3 is fine
^
0Coffee doesn't actually help...
I would say take little naps throughout the day then.
one powernap
more than one and you would start to crave sleep more
^
yesterday i worked a 12h shift after 24h no sleep
energy driiiiinks~
/me does not drink these energy drinks, and she is working nine hours.
6Good for you Trollight, they can help at times, but also can be just as bad.
Rain``?
smoking, energydrinks/soda, not eating half the time, lack of sleep, and other little things
0... eeh.
Know what's fun? Spinning in one of those spinny chairs :3
i'm behind on my quota....
hmm?
TrollightSparkle, i do that at work all the time
or do wheelchair wheelies around the halls
Lol, i wish I had a desk job to be able to do that at times.. or a job in itself -_-
i work at a nursing home answering phones / watching the doors
lol
nice to know you still visit
of course i do
9>Trixie's favorite pony
9so, Trixie?

and go into interviews with it
nothin much, you?
0I wanna get my mp3 player to work =^=
Nah, don't feel like risking cracking my head open :/
I always listened to my music when I worked in a grocery store, my superiors didn't complain.
But then again, I did go back in the wet coolers and reconsolidate everything :P
