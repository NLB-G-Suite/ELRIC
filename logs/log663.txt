I can only imagine and EMP weapon in this world would be. THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING.
Still don't care.
00,10so seem there is alot of spiders wanting to invest my house
I am not to be taken seriously at any time
not even now
As for Autistic Mode, I'm still not sure but I think it simply means radio silence. Wireless communications are disabled.
why start cutting in the center?
XDDDDDD

I hate bees
Good point Batou
used to be terrified of bee's
I like bees....
Bees are okay.
sure, wear an open jacket and a sports bra
You never know when bugs'll just swarm through the window.
No me gusta bees
Though I've never actually been NEAR a beehive.
I
Fucking
Hate
Bees
Batou looks like he has acromegaly.
Bees really freak me out....
00,10my issue with bugs is directly linked to distance from it
they sting me...
I just realized that.
^^^
I don't mind spiders thought...
Just if they are besides me
I hate sipders
Ranger eyes
Spiders*
Long face, like Abraham Lincoln.
hmmm
everyones watching the same thing?
I'm okay with spiders, but I've been stung by bees before. It's very painful.
maybe
My stance towards bugs is that they are welcome in my house, but if they don't mean me harm, I just send them out of the house without harming them.
Oh look, I found my stun gun.
Wasps are worse
rainbow yep
and they're the worse
Then you are not... you
Ants are meh
00,10togusas face

Speaking of Antz....
13otakon: the unit tracking them is the Umibozu, elite military

We might get a global sooner or later.
speeding in a 5 message per 10 second zone

Rather than society be reset, I honestly wish it could be reformed from where it is now. Because I don't think I'd like to live in a society after such a reset.
That's why I stopped pirating movies. Got sick of dealing with viruses
buy them?
i wa

If we're going to be able to reform society, we need to be able to discuss things civilly.

I'm still a F2P on TF2
OOOO, i should buy some keys on my birthday!
i can never find diamonds for crap
but i have 6 stacks of coal and a compressor
my first day on tekkit i found 20 diamonds...
and i'm too lazy to try strip mining an area yet
I literally found diamonds within an hour
0 diamonds, 11 uraniums
and the mutants
Luckily my valuables were in the chest that exploded
that wasnt*
they had to reset the map after that though xD
"They?"
it was SMP?
Yup
You want the server IP?
nah
k
xD

Damn
broke it with my fists "oh, i must need a wrench"

PICKAXE
I always keep spares of every machine
you'd think you need something a little less... brutal to pick up an engine
and i don't have the spare resources for extra machines yet
Engine? lets hit it with a pointy pickaxe!
I like how he picks up guns even though he won't use them
xD
Sergio, you should really try Tekkit
its complicated but ALOT of fun
Mmm gonna get some breakfast
here sergio
http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit/
if that launcher doesn't work for some reason, make sure you have Java 6 installed
i only had Java 7 on my computer and it was being rather finicky until i got 6
"Looks okay over here. OH MY ... ughh... *thud*"
Sergio, you should try it
I have a server and i could teach you
yes
well, that's 3 stacks of coal mascerated
just another hour to go to get the other 3 stacks done >_<
you need a condenser
i've got this more or less planned out
it's just entirely convoluted over the alt plan of "Find 6 diamonds"
Nano at the minimum
Hey all!
How are you all?
Tekkit
"no way he was alone" XD
no
aw
Hello everyone.
Sergio, it does
yeesh, i heard a spider crawling around outside my house, probably on the roof
climb up there, no spider
walk around the house, SPIDER AMBUSH FROM THE ROOF
you should install Tekkit then try
>_<
I see Deus Ex is up. Who's playing?
our spiders have Health Bars
yo yo fillies
Yes but his is largely for KSP.
which is why i live in Pennsylvania
the most we deal with are Deer, and everyone has guns for that
*wld

o.o.
That's unpleasant. :<
Aww no movies? :<

Nekkid tiem!
It's always nekkid tiem for Dumbldore
Daniel Radcliffe actually talked about reenacting "Mysterious Ticking Noise" for a fund raiser in an interview once.
I don't think it ever came to fruition, but I would pay money for it
I think it would go along pretty good since a lot of Potterheads know it
That would be awesome
Yeah. Both those things.
"I found the source of the ticking. It's a pipe bomb!" "Yaaaaaa--BOOOM"
they just need to happen at a place
And possibly do a livestream of it as well
Voldimort should of totally used some muggle technology. He would of totally won.
I mean think about it.. how hard would it of been for him just to magic a nuke about to explode into Hogwarts?
Oh kay. Now I am glad I was not that author of the Harry Potter books. =\
Coffee gives me strange ideas, that seem to be extremely morbid
I don't think the nuke would work. Muggle objects tend to act wonky around Hogwarts, especially electronics.
Wish I could of been there.
But I have to live in Texas. <<

Its always the unexpected that happens
Episodes as in starwars
I was thinking more like man's philosophical musings but sure that too.
It was the first things I had access to in my home!
posers, idiots, fools and such do not piss me off
such as
I hope there's a horror movie marathon on halloween.
Who's Such?
elitists, anti casuals, and high ontheirself nerds piss me off
That makes me flip all the tables.
Best freaking Horror film I watched
HEres me "i win i got 4 aces" "oh yea, i got 3 pairs"
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
10 fucking thousand dollars
10,000 pesos
Lol
(around 6.5k quid)
10,0
Well have fun with that.
Not like you couldn't build one of equal standing for like half the price but whatever.
Ohh
Okay
oh, that's pesos
Xd
Check the specs
Its awesome
8gb ram, 1tb storage with a 1gb card and an i5
Crappest bit in there is the GPU
well it says it can run skyrim :3
anything can run skyrim
But here's the questionL
Can it run Crysis?
oh fuck
Let me check
Holla everypony! :)
Eyyyy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECx-42Wlho
I've seen that
everyone seen that
^
EVERYONE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtgOEXKh7Q&feature=youtube_gdata_player yes it can run crysis
It amuses me.
In it's time, Crysis was way way to demanding for even the bestest computers back then

we need to get the Exorcist streamed up in here
That would be great. :D
the scariest movie ever
Cabin in the woods would be epic to stream
I found the mid to end hilarious
Exorcist isn't that scary.
saw
>Scariest movie ever
never saw it
>never seen it.
Wat.
hehhehe
It's more creepy than scary, IMO.
Most horror films are only scary with jumpscares
Couldn't agree more.
In fact actually being scared by a horror film is something that only tends to happen when you're 12.
ja
Jumpscares aren't even scary, they're startling.
^
jumpscares are hilarious
Want a really scary movie? Watch The Leprechaun.
Want to watch a scary show?
*Sarcasm Detected*
Something happens that's gross or unsettling and sure maybe you feel weirded out, but very little that appears in a movie actually inspires fear.
^ :D
Fuck that movie.
not jumpscares
How was Mirrors? Has anyone seen it?
It's gonna need 4D to get to that :3
http://imgur.com/r/funny/oiFR1
It's very hard to be genuinely scared by a movie, especially when you're not alone.
ja
the only thing that can actually get you really scared are experiences
That's why 4D (interaction) are best choices
And unless anyone wants to invest in some sort of elaborate prank where we knock someone out put them in a mansion and all hide across the place disguised as zombies that's not likely to occur.
Haven't seen a lot of 4D material lately.
^
Dammit, it's flagged
Goodbye everyone
Oh wow.
/me resents that saying
