I've seen enough hentai to know were this is going
I'm not impressed in what ive seen so far, the price of getting a new console isnt great either

cachi01|phone *Squee* I loved that
hi

cachi01|phone: I love the Chao Garden. :$

I'm glad the new skylanders game is coming out for the wii instead
Gotta make mah chaos fight in karate!
LA LA LA~
the game was only good for the chao garden
nvm
my stick man
Not for me.
I loved everything about the game.
I am too
:[ RAWR
:O
lol
AJIsAwesome|Homework: me too /) though i played a different version
I recentley did a brawl tournament with 3 friends and 28 cpus and I waiting for him to put it up on the youtube, I won with Ike
http://fav.me/d4taahq
yeah fake news is fake
ike is the best'\
Eh, I didn't really bother with Skylanders because I thought the toy thing was a bit gimmicky, and just a way to squeeze money, and I didn't like how Spyro looked
Garrus_Vakarian: Ike is kinda cheap.
Yeah, that pretty much sums it up
dooooooooooooooooodge
gg
11,02gg :)
Not really, He is really slow and has no range,
I can tell you this, the game IS getting an HD release.
nopony got the DBZ abridged reference
yeah obviously spyro is different
However, I don't know when.
DERPY NOOOOOOOO
use IKE
But what I think is that if he didnt end up in the game he never wouldive been revived
i love using lucario
now its gonna get guud
AJIsAwesome|Homework, you mean a port like they did with every other sega game?
Its been over what, 5 years now? I dont think this game is getting a hd remake
When I bought skylanders stuff I only bought it when it was on sale
lucario is also great
espicialy his ranged attacks
where the HD is barely HD
/me My custom player would say: I'm the Nostalgia Critic, i remember it, so you don't have to
Well, I don't mind ports.
but just HR
FUS_RO_yay: Not really, Ike is very slow and has no range attacks, he can easily be beaten by any of the star fox trio or other fast range characters
Meh, fair enuogh
enough*
FINAL DESTINATION!
dayum, derpy is back with a vengeance
Garrus_Vakarian: Touche.
jerkin the gerkin

Ponies47: i don't regret anything :D
FUS_RO_yay: Actually One of my friends was using wolf and I got really salty, It was close but he got greedy and turned his back to get the smash ball, so I sent his ass flying
I don't use the smash ball anymore.
Garrus_Vakarian: Nice.

AJIsAwesome|Homework: I WAS ABOUT.....to do a Zelda reference, one from Link, if you will
FUS_RO_yay: I've played as him before, I just don't like his move pool that much. Probs because I'm used to play as swordsmen.

deal princess celestia
deal with it
kamon derpy
your faithful student
Twilight Sporkle
FUS_RO_yay: He is a good character but I've always been good playing against him, I don't think I've ever lost a match of smash to someone playing as snake.
...
They're just spamming randomizers, heh
I actually used to destroy my brothers with Mario.
...
Dat randomizer
would a twilight sporkle have a cutie mark like silver spoons?
Garrus_Vakarian: Probably because most people who use snake are noobs and dont know how to use him. He has a lot of more potential than what people use him for.
Mario may be an all around character, but once you know how to utilize him he is VERY hard to kill.
damm ad
AJIsAwesome|Homework: i used Mario and Kirby the most........gotta have the game back, i guess i owe Link the respect he deserves......
I miss the Mario Tornado move in this game, though. Too bad they replaced it with.......FLUDD. :|
Uhmmmm......im not going to /b/ again
cachi01|phone: Why would you go there in the first place?
FUS_RO_yay:Yeah because snake is one of those characters that you can't just pick up and be good with like link, you need to perfect his move pool to be effective
Jigglypuff's also a brutal character, only drawback is she's lightweighted so it's easy to knock her out
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjiObmXtuGg
It's an air attack move, but it's not the same. :(
ASoftFluffyThing to be honest.... Idfk
Jigglypuff is the best :D
AJIsAwesome|Homework: correction: i used Kirby, Pikachu and Mario the most, in that order
cachi01|phone: Oh god
Dark92Enigma, you're awesome
LA LA LA
My brother and I used to duke it out with Captain Falcon and Mario. :D
Garrus_Vakarian: Actually, i suck ass with link xD

CrimsonPhoenix: and now you kick him in the nuts?
im usually lucario

FUS_RO_yay: That's weird because I started playing off as link when I had The original smash and I use him up to this day, his move pool is simple but effective

Also guys you all know how we play smash right?
FUS_RO_yay: Yeah that's the problem with some swordsmen they are a bit chunky so you can't really pull off many combos, the only good combo swordsmen is marth.
in thw wii i can play it

Garrus_Vakarian: Im actually decent with Marth
Super Smash bros of course

Garrus_Vakarian: I can usually weasel my way out of situations like that with ike, just go to the way where there are less people and try to land.
I'm still a bit ticked I lost to someone using Ike during a semifinal
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #66
oh, a wallpaper compilation
I also used to master Marth. LOVE the shield breaker.
I liek ike
I always use ike...
CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah I like toon link he's a real balanced character
He's speedy
What am I watching, why are they only using the one move?
and floaty
That's probably the main drawback for me about brawl.
i use either fox or lucario
also there's no balance in Brawl
Dken2021 i was using ike and i lost in the first freaking round of the tournament :/
FUS_RO_yay: Yeah if your playing on a medium sized map but me and my friends prefer final destination and battle ground
Garrus_Vakarian, NO ITEM, FOX ONLY, FINAL DESTINATION
i hate battleground but i like final destination
Only way to play Super Smash Brothers
lawl
11,02lol
i like Pirate Ship
Wombo combo.
CrimsonPhoenix: THATS TEH WAY CHAMPIONS PLAY :[
i forgot that one map where the lava rises up
Garrus_Vakarian, that's the way it should be played
am i the only one that relly likes items? there the only way i can win
anything else is purely hazard and doesn't show any skill
but random luck
We are the champions, we are the champions, no tiem for lozerz, cuz we be teh championz, of teh worllllllddd
CrimsonPhoenix: THIS PONIES GOT THE RIGHT IDEA! :[
CCCP : i like using them when i'm about to die
NewSuperBronyU: Wii huh?

otakon: Yep :<

AJIsAwesome|Homework: ah

/me plays as lucario and fox in ssb
So of course its gonna lag.
Also, I very much wish I had all of the options available in Melee.
I'm also buffering, just when it was getting good
FUS_RO_yay: the WII is a horrible internet gaming systems
out of curiosity how often will a hater come in here and say shit?
You should all see me rage every time I instinctively try to tech and fail.
Tiberium126: Not that much.
Tiberium126, it happens every so often.
Tiberium126: If I were to nail it down to an average, once every 3 weeks? ish.
otakon: I understand that, but SSBB's coding IS terrible, worse than it should be.
Tiberium126: every once in a while. maybe once or wice per a few weeks
If it's 9:00 CST, what time is it PST?
...

Garrus_Vakarian: You don't have to be a child. You just need to have my memories, my nightmares, my- Oh wait, that's Slender Mane's thing. I just want to kill you, that's all. Ok?
Yeah but we usually say bad words

I don't think it's against the rules...
U arrived just in time
13oh it is a troll
Applechip apparently some trolls
Shizuka: yes yes it is
I guess so.
Now, let's not jump to conclusions here

Silver_Spoon: lawl thats great :D
I will never, ever, EVER buy or use a Mac and if sometime in the future I do then I want one of you to hunt me down and give me a good kick in the balls.
happy?
Shizuka nick count is about 9 right now
Silver_Spoon xd
Silver_Spoon: :D
getting close to death threat time, which also happens to be one of my favorite quotes from a game. "I will tear your beating heart from your chest"
13such a delightfully predictable troll
A present from my past self cursing my future self's stupidity.
13almost makes my job easy
You can use /nick to change your username without leaving, pony27210
inb4 kick
wait what now?
13and cue another nick
Dovah what gamr might be that?
I <3 Sacred 2
Shizuka i bet on rainbow this time
sl
wait i need to switch to iris so i can see all the nick changes
damn i lost
inb4 tara
13close but no cigar trix
oooh never played any sacred :(
And now to Gunbuster.
so, pinkie, how about dem nick changes?
Me too. Brb.
i want apple hardware with the software replaced by linux
fun
it's k i don't smoke anyway
Is Apple hardware all that good?
There we go.
13osx is forked from BSD isn't it?
whats happening
so hows the sream
Shizuka, nextstep, microkernel something or other
pony34507, you can use /nick to change your username without logging out
cachi01|phone: nuber 2 is a prequill to number 1 appernetly, never played the first one
pony34507: lol
iirc they use a lot of bsd components
wait what
Fail
As in, /nick fluttershyloves
No stream at the moment? :/
Phase4 and windows game support
13the terminal is posix compliant at least, was pretty sure it's descended from the bsd kernel
Eenope
nope
yeah, just do /nick twilightisbestponi
they actually use bash
nope
wait what?
13that too
NOPE.AVI
infact theres a full gnu environment on the default osx install
13windows why your command prompt suck so much
whos flutterloves?
Or do /nick obvious_troll
13WHY YOU NO IMPROVE AFTER WIN95
"nobody needs command lines"
^
13pony34507: that would be you genius, or should i just ban you for trolling?
Ooh a troll, can I hug it?
Shizuka, they quote powershell as an improvment
oooh a troll, can i kill it?
5$ and you can see it
AdamTheDuck: yes
:'( im sorry ok?
I need Troll fat.
To be fair, the average user has absolutely nothing to do with the command line.
13protip, if you're going to sneak in and out with different nicks, don't use the same username and hostmask every time
13it's a bit of a giveaway
13powershell suuuuuuuuuucks
/me hugs pony34507... Then violently stabs it with a rusty kitchen knife.
Or that.
but its not a command line, its a .net language thats too complicated to function as shell scripts thats also impractical as an actual language
XD
._.
13at least the window itself, it's just cmd.exe plus color
D:
so its a tool for no one
^
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
Shizuka i doubt he/she knows what a hostmask is
Bad.
why what did i do to you
I like AdamTheDuck now, alot
pony34507, welcome to Bronystate :P
erhmaherd lurg truts r mah faverite
Shizuka, its actually SLOWER than cmd.exe
Obvious troll is obvious.
ok
AdamTheDuck, wat
13that too
plus it takes ages to start as it has to load all of .net and jit itself
So MS is too lazy to remove an artifact from ye olden days of computing. I thought their laziness was well-known?
13it's sad when putty is a better command prompt than command prompt
She's known for her "Vorpal blade"
AdamTheDuck lol i love that game
Reikim, they're not lazy, you cant remove text mode, they just havent touched it sence nt 3.5
13i love that book
why is everone so mean to me all i did was wanting to talk about fluttershy:'(
So why haven't they touched this thing that I am assuming is important?
SEEMS LEGIT
13lazy
Exactly.
I like to think that the Vorpal blade is just a regular rusty kitchen knife in her reality...
Shizuka, theres also mintty which works well, but the stdio symantics are broken on windows
Shizuka didnt knew it was a book.
Sacred 2 quote with my own little add on time?
Shizuka doing quizes sounds like fun everytime you connect or just one time ?
pony34507: fluttershy is not welcome here
13those of us that want a powerful command line are already over on a linux or using mintty/cygwin
Aaaand now I'm going to stop being lost and go finish Gunbuster.
This has fluttershy -in- it...: http://fav.me/d5fuoey
its probably less lazy and more buisness descision
13cachi01|phone: Alice in Wonderland?
13no it isn't
the command line tools do exist, batch scripts can be ALMOST as powerfull as bash scripts, but the tools are useless and undocumented
13protip, all the chats are the same during the week
13and unchanged since dos
Hai everypony
Wrong, all the theatres are Spike theatres secretly
yeah
pony34507 it's just a chat room you connect to during BMN and live pony episodes.
Hi, DerpyMuffins
Hey there, DerpyMuffins

All the rooms connect to Bronystate chat (AKA Mane chat)
do i get a cigar now Shizu ?
13mintty doesn't agree with me much.. that or cygwin's bash is just super slow on its own
they have to be implimented in every application
/me 13gives TheGreatAndPowerfulT a magic cigar
Please use /nick, rainbow, so you don't have to log in and out every time.
Yay

I am instant;y happy, thanks streamer
> Throw stuff into space
Shizuka: what do you mean I'll see? I've seen most of SAC and the first movie. The Major is a calm collected confident woman that kicks a lot of ass.
00,10wait some one asked for more ponies
I'm liking this already.
13you'll see
Dester: it's Sumica
Sumica: NO THEY DIDN'T!

Will we?
Sumica i vote for g3.5 scootaloo

I demand moar pastel coloured equines.
Togusa, the mullet cop, has no enhancements other than a cyberbrain for e-communicating.
does anypony else see stream
No one not NO ONE asked for ponies.
never ask for ponies, it ends badly
XD u gonna have a bad.time!
shizuka: why do you keep saying that...?
We'll probably blow ourselves up before then.
^
Reikim, maybe, you'd have to ask a rocket scientist
13captain bulldog!
fat
This would be the logical question.
Wait, someone asked for ponies? :S
dat face
Ponies are not real. Do not spread this blasphamy!
duba 3
Togusa even carries a plain revolver for his weapon.
ugh that's why
Kurra: eeyup he's the most "human" officer of Section 9
homo news reporter
rainbow: you'll be kicked
I like Togusa, he's the most... 'plain' of Section 9.
Shizuka: what? Batou?
watch duba 3. It has the real showz.
why
i mean they recorded the vocals, but all the drums and guitar are done on a computer
im sorry
hewmew
duba 3 is dubya fave channel
13rainbow: grow up, I tire of dealing with you
I want to watch.....but I cant help but be drawn to look at sumis OC dance every now couple of minutes......-lol
otakon you'll be kicked
mfw back and suddenly ghost in the shell. whoohoo!
otakon: rainbow is a troll that is trying to get more kicks/bans than you
finw
Haha XD....love that dance...
no not really i came here for ponies
/me brushie brushie Sumica's hair. :>
Pfft, none can catch up to Otakon's kick count.
Whats the matter rainbow
>Came for ponies
Well there's your problem.
>Ponies
The heck?
rainbow, we stream more than ponies, if you really want pony theres always youtube
BarbetosSMASH: rainbow is troll.
What, ponies?
rainbow: bc your being angsty over the stream it seems. The mods do this for free and on thei own enjoyment as much as our own. You don't give grief to people that do you stuff for free. Also this is BRONYstate NOT Ponystate. We only show ponies during the on season and on friday nights.
rainbow you has youtube.
13so the troll has confirmed he can't read the FAQ
^^^
hello evry pony
^^
Is he a troll or just new and unfamiliar?
Or that he can and can log in with a different name
hiya Scottish-geeky
but reading is soooo 5 years ago..
rainbow, alternatively you can demand ponies, and you will get ponies, think real hard before you do that
Hi, Scottish-geeky :)
Sounds like ban evasion to me
Kandarihu: I think the second
Hey there, Scottish-geeky
hai otakon

Oh hi HoodyNinja :)

I have a feeling this will NOT end well
It doesn't really seem like music to me

What's so bad about that image? :<
weeping_pegasi82: Haunter?
All it takes is a heck load of fire, Meanwhile.
dat kick
yep
AdamTheDuck: shizuka HATES bugs
Those robots are able to stop multiple AP rounds, though it sure isn't a comfortable sensation for the soldiers inside.
Of course I know better, but how can I resist~
AdamTheDuck: Shizu no like spiders
AdamTheDuck: it's just a big(but cute) bug eating a carrot
Ah I see.
headshot
weeping_pegasi82, that's my background!
13I'm sick of people linking disgusting images pretending it's okay.
Dark_Horst didnt knew that...
It's only a bug you big wuss.
so shizuka doesn't like Squishy? :(
Disgusting?
I know what Shizu needs :3
13So I'm just going to start timebanning.
A hug!
Shizuka: only you think it's disgusting, it's just a big bug eating a carrot.
But... Its kind of cute really. =\
/me hugs Shizuka :P
D8
Saxoffender: it is..?
BUT!

I understand haha
13now watch our heroes be badasses
Biggot opinion enforcement ain't nothing new here though.
Shizuka does not like it
SO let's drop it
Guys, calm down. Girls are scared of bugs, it's natural
Whatever.
i am heavy weapons guy
he is hevy wepons guy
Batou = Heavy
That's a poor reason.
GODDAMN!
HEAVY WEAPONS GUY!
activate the sprinklers!
weeping_pegasi82: yeah haunter is my favorite
Shizuka: which episode is that? i feel like i missed a lot
Soldier and Heavy weapons guy
AND THIS..........is my weapon.
Heavy Weapons Guy? WHere?
13this is 25/26
otakon, mini gun
Shizuka: oh sorry, wrong ping^^
Pewpewpewpewpewpew
Oh that thing is a weta?
HoodyNinja You're saying that all girls are scared of bugs when there are many who don't.
Also Soldier is the other heavy
I JUST realized, this is GITS
00,10nice vulcan

Shizuka: oh, okay^^
Males like myself actually have panic attacks from the mere sight of a spider.
man... i missed a LOT
Better than a Vulcan.
DWR is a big girl's blouse anyway.
DashWithRainbows: I was being sarcastically sexist
Umibozu?
I can only imagine and EMP weapon in this world would be. THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING.
well I'm off to go do my one of my fav pass times, Sleep! Goodnight everypony.
Still don't care.
00,10so seem there is alot of spiders wanting to invest my house
I am not to be taken seriously at any time
otakon, they are 60kg or 130pounds
what is this
not even now
Night Dovah
As for Autistic Mode, I'm still not sure but I think it simply means radio silence. Wireless communications are disabled.
Night Dovah
Dester: oh yeah it would wreak havoc
night Dovah
Tiberium126: THUS the heavy weapons bit
Sumica: Do you live in the desert or close to it?
goodnight Dragon
You'll end up with cobweb in the corners like I do Sumi.

WHAT IS THIS
why start cutting in the center?
yay bomb!
oh i c

XDD
WHAT IS THIS
00,10Vegas so yeah ASoftFluffyThing
WTF-BOOOOOOOOOOM!
-lol perfect timing.
HWOOOAGH-BEWM
Dester, EMP weapon in OUR world would be THE...WORST...POSSIBLE...THING!
Lol that background noise
nuthing like the sound of fresh death
Not that I'm compaining, but in a battle, shoudn;t she wear some armour?
an
Sumica: that WOAH was perfectly timed man
dat Carcess
13this could have been exactly what it was
EMP now would be bad, but in that world many people would die, instantly
otakon indeed. /)
Sumica: Aaaah. Hopefully they're not monstorously huge?
Kandarihu just imagine.... No ponies!
Spider Tanks :3
yay Tachikoma's!
00,10they were

:S im very confused what is this
She's so happy to help
Oh god
It's Nevada, ASoftFluffyThing
cachi01|phone, only the real ones would remain
Polydunami: True
13>what were robots like that for
do these people know, they're being taken care of by a tank?
Spider tanks are so cute <3
Dabuq is that robot doing lol
13>completely misses the howitzer on the front
/me likes certain bugs
pinkie crossover
dem tachikomas can carry like 2 rounds of this high yield antitank weapon....
Shizuka: doesn't look like a howitzer with the cover on but it's been removed
It may not look fun but it has a great storyline
/me is scared of all things that are not mammals, including fish
Birds?
HoodyNinja: really?
13no the last thing the chief said was "don't die"
the exception of birds
Freaking HDMI cable is starting to fail :/
Cades: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agl8K5NgXfU&feature=related
13very different orders
http://i.imgur.com/4xEuq.gif
/me will never play horror games
so if i'm following this right, the cheif betrayed them and left them to die?
otakon: really, I hate spiders, fish, and insects
Shizuka: yeah true
"Guys....no pants. That's our plan."
Meanwhile: why
why
Meanwhile: she'll do it
Was that guys so dead that he fell apart?
whats with all the bug images?
Meanwhile: don't tempt her
Meanwhile: NO NOT THE BEES!
13yeah i'm just done
NOPE
Scottish-geeky: Because Spongebob.
Meanwhile: lols
00,10batou logic
NOT THE BEES!
the howetazer
I hate bees
Good point Batou
used to be terrified of bee's
I like bees....
batou logic, made sexy by the masculine reassuring yet tinged with audacity voice.
Bees are okay.
sure, wear an open jacket and a sports bra
You never know when bugs'll just swarm through the window.
No me gusta bees
Though I've never actually been NEAR a beehive.
I
Fucking
Hate
Bees
Batou looks like he has acromegaly.
Bees really freak me out....
00,10my issue with bugs is directly linked to distance from it
they sting me...
I just realized that.
^^^
I've heard some in a couple of trees at my parents house, though. Sounds like a weird buzzing....peace
I don't mind spiders thought...
Just if they are besides me
Kurra: his eyes are proshetic
I hate sipders
Ranger eyes
Ninja Robot Eyes
otakon yah, but look at his nose, ears, and brow, and maybe his chin.
sweet
13they popped out in black mesa
Spiders*
Long face, like Abraham Lincoln.
hmmm
everyones watching the same thing?
I'm okay with spiders, but I've been stung by bees before. It's very painful.
maybe
dat ass
My stance towards bugs is that they are welcome in my house, but if they don't mean me harm, I just send them out of the house without harming them.
I_Never_Asked_for_Th: i agree
Polydunami: bee's don't bother me
Oh look, I found my stun gun.
Wasps are worse
rainbow yep
You know, the idea of being able to manipulate your self with such freedom always deep;ly disturbed me
and ants can all go to hell
ants are useless
Polydunami: now wasp's on the other hand do
and they're the worse
Then you are not... you
Ants are meh
00,10togusas face
can someone tell me what this is
I hope it wasn't in the washer because I found it under some clothes
worst*
rainbow: Japanime
Hornets are bukken sunzafish boss battles
Good luck
*swear
13this episode can be summed up with "you must gather your party before venturing forth"
thats the name?
weeping_pegasi82: fuck that continent
Kurra: Just about.
SHIT
ants hate me
rainbow ghosts inbound
I has hornet infestation here
thanks
How the HELL did they trackt hem that fast?
Hornets are shit compared to ants
weeping_pegasi82, oh i love our ants here
Ants will kill you
I look at them, they stare back at me....
I dont care about ants..... Except there was.one day i accidentaly destroyed a colony....... Fucking ants they caused me a major pain in the feet...
Speaking of Antz....
13otakon: the unit tracking them is the Umibozu, elite military

sneaky man
Shizuka: yeah but still they knew WHERE tehy were going to go?
cachi01|phone: I was completely covered in ant bites for two weeks after my first day at YMCA
13wouldn't match section 9 in cyber warfare, but clearly can match them in tracking them down
cachi01|phone: Aaaah.
Had to go to the hospital

this is a bad infodump!
wonder whot those barcodes contain
what'
Tiberium126: Batou is the big guy
13duhhhhh
:S i feel bad for them
13it's togusa's uhhhhhhhh face
Whos that in the window?
he dead
barcode to confusing
can't be the major
rainbow: it's supposed to be
00,10and now we see togusa's reinactment of "falling down"
How can you die if you are a program?
SHUT UP YOU DAMN BUGS
In teh futcha! Ware errythang is dijitul!
is atoms on?
otakon agreed
Dester: your braincase gets destroyed
ahhh cicadas
Barcodes are there to represent that there's text that any cyborg can read but the animators don't have to type lots of text out.
>_<
otakon: I find it relaxing
Dester: a ghost without a shell quickly loses itself to the degradation of the wild web.
otakon but how is a brain anydifferent that the computer?
cicadas i enjoy
true
HoodyNinja: Agreed.
13is that
Dester: it's still storing it there, if you destroy the container the contents are destroyed as well.
why can't her ghost float about? like a natural intelligence turned ai? like a kind of browser with info?
no
The Chinese Room, errwhere
I guess you just gotta grow up with them, haven't heard one in years.
yes
Long and hard he says.
13long and hard he says
kinda nastolgic
:D
13if you know what togusa means
long and hard? thats what she said
lol
Dohoho
:D
It can be debated that a brain is simply an AI to the nth degree, able to learn for nearly forever
13the VA and the face makes me swear that DA is gouda
Brains are Turing-capable machines right?
13but it's not cause gouda comes up from intelligence iirc
otakon but the idea is essentially cloud computing, no?
STOP WATCHING MORGAN FREEMAN
Is this the real life?
00,10hard to say Shizuka
I think brains pass Turing tests
Is this just fantasy?
besides we see complex patterns form inn open ocean waves, really randomness can build to create insade patterns
An extended period of time or measurement AND tougher difficulty/density? ASTOUNDING!
Dester: yeah but like I said it's hard to keep yourself as a free floating program to keep your personality and memories
Goda's that guy with the f'ed up face righT?
13was trying to squish his face up in my head which made it match even more, but i'm pretty certain at this point in time gouda would be at intelligence
now what
Realistically, I doubt computers will ever match 1/10th of the potential of a human brain
13cause the accident that causes his squishy face is like years ago iirc
otakon I'm not so sure, i mean store you selkf in redundencies in buffers
flutter_spin: We only use 10% of our brainpower, and computers outthink us every second
13hey togusa you're angry and frustrated i know
back
At a time, HoodyNinja
pictured, hugley overrated book
13but that's no reason to litter
who's laughing man?
Shizuka: you know this better than me can you explain why it's hard for a ghost to exist outside of a shell for extended periods of time?
I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes.
what is that animal on the book :S
And then he became the laughing man
13we'll get there otakon
inb4 Togusa gets a ticket fo littering
Batou
Polydunami: How does that affect my argument?
You sly dog
:D
Troll Batou.
:D
Got his gun back
I want some cyber food!
wait what
13just stand out there with a revolver in your hand
nice to see you, dumbo
Isn't it 10% of one's brainpower at a time, HoodyNinja?
herk heeerg
Polydunami: no
13Polydunami: we use 100% of our brains
how did jc denton escape the mega police?
lol
Polydunami: that was disproven
Polydunami that is an OLD myth
We use 100% of our brains.
13%?
That makes us dumber then
yeah we do use 100% of our brains
I know about it being untrue, everypony -_(\
All of our brain is used for all the managing functions of all our existence.
Polydunami: then why oyou bring it up?
Which means its all down hill from here
You're asking the wrong pony, otakon.
if that were the case, we could take out 90% of our brain and still live
00,10it's like the idle system process on your computer
So what happened to the tech guys?
/me like yamcha
anyone else get dizzy after using chats after along time?
Best kinda of cooking
13pretended to sacrifice section 9, even though they have to convince kayabuki to give them funding again
\this sounds like BS he made up on the spot
Dester: sometimes it's from staring at a screen too long
Its time to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT9r_-oHJV0
You can get dizzy just by staring at the computer screen.
:D
Kurra: So, if we got a machine to control our bodily functions for us, we could increase our thinking capacity?
but its so quiet so dunno lol
/me brings up every argued and old notion that's been discussed among groups since ever

nope.
its only chatrooms though, weird
It is recommented to take a 15min break after every 4 hours

I don't know why I love this so much
Polydunami: but he was the one that started it
ah
Yeah. That episode calls for this
13READ A BOOK
The whole idea of a world where one can so easily manipulte oneself is a society where people are far more alike, how, because they see undesirable traits (from the point of the culture/society) and then change themselves to fit that role
13READ A BOOK
13READ A MOTHERBUCKING BOOK
Right then

Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooks!

LOL
Twi loves her books
Well of course
I need to watch those
FEED YO KIDS, FEED YO GODDAMN KIDS

Think it's Raise yo' kids.
flutter_spin: ah that could be it
NO
I WOULDNT
right, it was raise
/me Brushes his goddamn teeth
Raise yo' kids raise yo' kids raise yo' goddamn kids.

Meanwhile: yeah it was actually but that was suckage at best
How would you compare this series to the original GITS?

Speaking of Doctor Who, now that I've got my laptop working again....
I like how motoko thinks
Haha I like the way you think major.
TopHat: Asia is about as f*cked up as the U.S
otakon: I'd get confused with the dice. Like, why in the HELL do you need a 16-sided die?
Motoko is favorite heroine
DOCTOR WHO IS AWESOME ;)
ASoftFluffyThing: What?? -lol
Good evening everypony.

ASoftFluffyThing: dnd is NOT a normal board game

It's just you're average, run of the mill board game

what kind of armour shows cleavage?
ASoftFluffyThing: Put in my family and you get a fight in 10 minutes, my point is D&D has alot more complicated functions and mechanics too it than other board games. Besides, it's not just a board game, it's a Role Playing Game
I mean, really
I used to like chess, until people were all "I nailed you with the X strategy" and I quit.

Seriously why does the man woman get the kick ass heavy armor heavy cannon Gundam?

Chest cannon???
He doesn't have a gender

Can he actually physically feek that?
00,10and the orange guy just went to his split personalty

oh crap, he gone crazy
evil personality!
Or is he just drama-ing it up?
Reminded me of San Francisco Rush when he said What's your name
EVIL PINKIE TOOK OVER HIS BODY
also WHY did she dodge? The head isn't the pilot compartment
00,10he has one of those specal brains too
the gundam people really need to do psychological checks on their pilots
WHO CARES
00,10but he was damaged goods
boy karis
Yeah THAT guy is normal
Also the older model MS' can only run so long
The Gundams have no time limit
NOT EVEN CORRECT MOUTH LIP MOVEMENT
neat
you know, with those calibers, you
00,10they are gonn wear out the pilots
'd think they'de actually damaged by now
ofc
The only way to beat an enemy with superior equipment
:O
Where the video games?
I dont knoe
know
A Gundam is fine too.
Dark_Horst: no the Gundams are amazingly tough not only made out of near indestructable materials but protected by a powerful field of particles that deflect bullets and beams.
otakon: sounds ridiculously op to me
Man this guy does NOT quit
lol
Being made out of Gundanium is pretty crazy.
Dark_Horst: but they take a LONG time to build and take a VAST amount of resources to make.
That's why there are only 3
does anyone know what paintchat is?
Most MS are made out of high grade Titanium, if memory serves.

twilight_sprinkle: never seen it before, but i bet it is. the japanese tend to do that
now to put on some hilarious music in the background
btw whats a g-n particle
B
awesome pron site
GN particles are what power most of the Moble Suits on this series.
DeadpoolDash: lol
Rawket: do they explain it any further than that?
:S woman are you ok?

A slight wall, here.
Unlike standard-flavour particles of the same class, GN Particles are decayed baryons like muons, boson w. particles, and photons. It is responsive to an unspecified machine-producible interactive force, thus exploited by Celestial Being for a variety of uses as part of an electromagnetic stealth measure to disrupt radar, a physical barrier, propellant for GN Verniers, a coat that improves the cutting ability of physical blades, a

Talk to you laters :)

00,10and yes suddnly recaps
is this really important
damn everyone has gundam
that almost sounded like alan rickman
I remember when gundams were rare
00,10it is if you have not watched any eps rainbow
no i dont really find this stuff
Edradicaiton of wars through force. . .sheesh, seems kind of silly.
too much
wars will only truly end when humanity is gone
really
you can only prevent war currently with the threat of war
i want one i can kill go back in time if possible and kill hittler
why can't we all be like canada
rainbow: Paradoxes.
that sounds kinda like snape
whos that va? he sounds a lot like rickman
i thought it was just me
TopHat: We ain't cold enough
they like ponies to but they make shitty plays
for it
like mlp live
kaboooom
so you're saying the only reason canadians are nice is because it's cold?
no one could ever afford to spend the money to build all this shit
it all makes sense now. The hotter the earth gets, the more violent we get
we can blame all the wars on global warming
hair?lolwut
are they bio-mecha now?

the gundams were spies
"Some men just want to watch the world bu- I mean reform."
the daughter is a spy

GET OUT OF THERE OLD GUY!
ONLY YOU KNOW THE TRUTH!
Well technically Gundams don't wear clothes, so I guess so.
damn now THAT is a cannon
this man has been over gasped

this makes you really hate the gundams instead of liking them

AAAAAAAAAAND DED
WHY DO THEY PUT THE PILOT IN THE HEAD DAMMTI!?
SERIOUSLY! PUT THEM IN THE HEAVILY ARMORED CHEAT!
00,10he's not in the head
otakon: The plot demands it?
:'(:(:D
*chest
00,10they are in the chest
The head is a MAJOR weak point
that THIS IS MY FANGS guy sounds like me
lol
:S okay
Sumica: then WHY did it cut to him getting skewered until AFTER the head was pierced?
a head would serve no purpose on any mech
eeyup
unless it's just a observation suite
who is saying yay?
00,10no reason
even then, its a big stupid target
You sissy.
he is porply going to die
DeadpoolDash: well also think of this, if they take out the head thinking you are in it then they aren't aiming at you are they?
yay more funny stuff coming up :)
well
doesnt matter, the main part should be the heavliy armored anyway
00,10but then again it was over kill any way
thats a nice ending
so much murder
00,10cause he got hit with 6 of them in his mech
Sumica: yeah true
ponys en um words

11,02The Next Big Thing is NOT already here...the Wii U hasn't come out yet o-o

11,02Wii U \:D/
Yay more Wii U

YES
Well, no one gets aroused by it, do they?
11,02I might actually get this game o.o
Even though I'm not a big nintendo fan xD
good morning everyone
I mean in-universe :P
Oh hey, OneTrickPony
11,02Haven't really beaten the first one nor played the second ><
Never played the series.
11,02Anypony know if this is like Final Fantasy where the number in the game doesn't matter it all has a unique story?
lol
Come to think of it the only games I really enjoyed on a nintendo platform (DS) were the Professor Layton series
and the guard didnt see the shadow of the tree... why?
I'm sorry to hear that, AdamTheDuck
just saying
like a boss
11,02I like the Professor Layton series as well :D
lol
'where'd he go?'
I mean, Professor Layton is enjoyable, but it's hardly the only enjoyable series of games on a Nintendo platform.
you know
they have muskets... couldnt they just... you know... SHOOT HIM
ugh
video game logic defies me
Yeah, I really only liked the older Pokemon games
:S wat are you two talking about?
NewSuperBronyU: Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney
this is gonna be a good game
Ace Attorney is another enjoyable franchise.
11,02Hmm...this guy is pretty good at playing the game :P
Ryunosuke: only if he's far away... muskets aren't great in hand to hand combat :D
......
11,02Spectrum_Rush: That'll be a cool game :3
lets screw with gorge washington
MadSurge, thats why they have bayonettes right? :)
Polydunami: at least the newer one will be released on the 3DS
Assassins disquise as soldier
11,02"Sir...I think this is the weird guy we were supposed to find and kill"
11,02"Ah...I do believe you are right good chap, shall we walk a few more feet and then attack him?"
11,02"Jolly good."
Rather, soil outside of Japan?
Polydunami: apparently YES!
butt him off the boat
if you are surrounded by 5 or 6 soldiers with bayonettes... you most likely are NOT gonna get away without a few new holes, no matter how much Chuck Norris you think you are :)
Well, I now have reason to purchase a 3DS :3
Also, Ocarina of Time
Polydunami: Ace Attorney 5 will be released out of japan
my friends dad was in a movie with chuck norris
wow, assasins creed got on the wow bandwagon to?
and then wos
wow
11,02Oh lulz, that game came out today
:P
wow is meh
11,02I wonder if there was a midnight launch of it
plz pony vids like ppp
And then we could possibly see a release of the second Investigations game when Ace Attorney 5 becomes popular?
*if
i will say this, wow lets you play with the minimal ammount of brain power :)
11,02Fine, we'll watch ponies

Hallo gold
flutterbrony: You can't watch G2. G2 didn't have a cartoon
Right, I really should go to sleep now.
I'm out of here :)
NewSuperBronyU: can i stream
G2 was a "nice try"
he always does that
yeah it did i watched some yesterday my little pony tales
That's G1
no
G1 had two cartoon series
The first one, and My Little Pony Tales
then watch it them
I watched them both
then
G2 did not exist yet when My Little Pony Tales came out.
what are we doing
So some friends were watching some anime in class and legit wouldn't tell me what it was called. Then I saw them copying it to a pen drive. Swort Art Online.
Is it good, anyone?
:D
im ruining your world with me dubstep
:D :D
;b
:b
I will bass cannon everything you love
XAX: Never heard of it. =/

"Could" being the key word
WUB WURAWWW FTFTFTFTHHHH
Such a wonderful modal verb
Is there a place where its still yesterday?
I don't think so.
I think midnight's already past the International Date Line.
I bet a few hours ago there was one
"Tomorrow never comes"
/me hugs Gold_Demona
so wat now
Ohai there Pearly =D
hey there darlin, ho are you?

flutterbrony: Now we just hang out and chat until a mod decides to stream something.
Now we sit and stare at each other's insanity until one of our heads explode flutterbrony.
flutterbrony: And not bother them about it
Hello Gold_Demona! :$
Hiyo MadSurge. =D
Something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY-03vYYAjA

Bye OneTrickPony
Healty levels of insanity: glue coins on the floor
Ooh! Best of luck to you MadSurge. :)
Jake: With superglue, I hope. :3
Gold_Demona: it's more of a "what can you do, we'll see what job we can find for you" thing though
MadSurge: Ah, I see
Healthy levels of insanity: if someone asks you to do something ask "want fries with that?"
Gold_Demona: sorry for the sudden question, but do you plan on having children?
MadSurge: Nope
Gold_Demona: :P
MadSurge: I don't think I'd make a good mom, and my husband doesn't think he'd make a good dad. So we've unanimously decided not to have kids.
Gold_Demona: fair enough!
Who is %BerryPunch by the way
Gold_Demona: enough big kids in the house amirite?
Jake: it's just a chatbot
MadSurge: Just the two of us and the cats are enough for me. :P
Ah ok
:kickcount MadSurge
Spectrum_Rush: MadSurge has been kicked 0 times
I ser
See
Jake: see, it tells you how many times someone has been kicked
Autocorrect makes more errors then I do
Autocorrect is famous for that. :P
Gold_Demona: good thing my chat doesn't have autocorrect
Mine neither.
And I have Android
I don't have those fancy fandangled smart phone thingies.
And this nice 600+ ping
Holy its down to 200

Maybe that's the one in Harvest Moon on SNES that the hawker thought was a cow. O.O
Oh wait, that was a chicken...
Sell the chicken to him, he says "This cow is now mine."
So maybe it's a duck that thinks it's a chicken that says moo?
.....Did I kill the chat? :S
No. I did.
With a sofa.
In the dining room.
Oh, ok. Phew! I was worried.
scootaloo
Are you sure it wasn't in the kitchen with a candlestick?

Fieryjoker did a top 10 sonic song...

Two songs playing at the same time?
Mega_Milk: Not until about 7:55.....ish
hi guys :)
Ponies47: I meant today period. But yeah. That explains why your up so early.
o3o
Sergio_Scriptor: Sup.
Hi Sergio_Scriptor
ohai, Sergio_Scriptor.
Mega_Milk: I hate getting up early. ;_;
Gold_Demona: No its one song. Dub step is just like that.
Hey Sergio_Scriptor
/me waves too Mega_Milk , Gold_Demona , Ninjazz and Ponies47 :)
Ponies47: -lol I feel bad for you. You have no idea how good it feels to be able to take a cat nap in the middle of the day -lol
Mega_Milk: Pfffft. Naps\
Mega_Milk: But there was an 8-bit pony song playing at the same time.
Mega_Milk: There it is again. Winter Wrap Up. It's not supposed to be there.
i'ma change servers soon
Ponies47: Say what you want. But when I dont have to worry about a ruler rapping against my deak and hearing some old hag screech in my ear to wake up I call that heaven.
theres ninjas on this one
Gold_Demona: Thats a TF2 mod song
ah
stream working good?
Gold_Demona: Whenever a match resets or somepony dominates it plays a little tune.
Phase4: Better than ever.
no sound problems?
Mega_Milk: You have a point. High school teahcers can really be asses sometimes
I see
Phase4: a little bit of distortion, but otherwise good
:3
Phase4: why dont you try a randomizer server ? or a pony themed vs saxton hale :)
Ponies47: Eeyup.
oh forget this is a vs saxton hale :d
only notest now
this makes me think of that doom mod deathmatch
with megaman settings and characters
Celestia! :D
Holy trippy retro graphics, Demoman!
wuts the name of that map?
camping Phase XD
SirGanjalf: What your looking for is the server name not the map.
SirGanjalf: The map is just a regular map modded.
SirGanjalf: possibly " vsh_megaman" ? :\
or something like that
DED
this is going nowhere fast
Phase4: The spy is trolling you -lol And the scout is just running away.
Mega_Milk: dem dead ringer spies :|
Sergio_Scriptor: One is a dead ringer. The other is a cloak.
hmmm
all the pony servers in my faves are empty
Phase4: randomizer server :)
Phase4: Wanna trade?
Sergio_Scriptor, ip?
Mega_Milk, for?
Phase4: one minute

Phase4: Idk -lol il lay out some stuff.
Phase4: See something you like we can barter
:3
Phase4: 216.245.203.66:27015
or 216.245.203.66
Mega_Milk, problem is the only stuff i'm willing to give up is common items :P
-lol ehh thats ok i dont really need anything in return i suppose im retty much set as it is. But I still might have some stuff you could use. And your pretty kool so id be willing to part with it for free :3
not to fond of dethmatch
deathmatch'

Phase4: well most of the randomizer serves are arena,but if you want i can try find one that is not :)

Phase4: ok,gimme a second then :)
Phase4: 193.192.59.114

00,10le sigh, sonyvegas why you so hard

Sergio_Scriptor, port?
I got something caleld Lightworks instead of SonyVegas just to give it a try.
Phase4: well it's a greek server,let me get another :\
Phase4: 109.70.148.176:27150

I guess you could say she took a *sunglasses* leap of faith.
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Or magic, or magnets!
puns..
/me throws tomates at ofna01 "BOOOOOOOOOO"
Puns, puns everywhere
Get off the stage ofna01!

^
Aaand he shot her.

Hello Lil_B

Lil_B: Hello!
/me Glomps Lil_B "HI!"
oi
Hiyo Lil_B
hello Lil_B
dat disarm
/me hugs AdamTheDuck Sergio_Scriptor Emil Ponies47 killerpony7733 Gold_Demona and LightTrooper105 ;)
dat ofna02 o.o
Lil_B: Group hug?
Ahh DICE
How you were great once.
Emil probably :)
My browser crashed, says ofna01 is in use
Before EA killed you.
:P
this was back when EA was not a douch
Bf3 is still good...
or you could be a clone O.O
i enjoy BF3
derp
ofna clone? :O
there
ofna02: prepare for the flame war
ofna02: Me too.
lol
Got it
fixed
AdamTheDuck Well BF3 is okay and all, though yeah BF2 and the any of the ones before was ALOT better
SDtop waling on the Solar Pannels!
killerpony7733, yes. Indeed.
sstream laggy for anyone else?
walking*
Battlefield Heroes?
ofna01: nor for me :\
*not
BF3 did not live up to it's name.
its*
we all have different opnion
AdamTheDuck: Opinions, opinions...
^ yep
LEAP OF FAAAAAAAAITH
i like all the battlefield
to be hones the game that beats cod and BF is TF2 :P
ofna01: See what you did there...
cant wait for bf4
AdamTheDuck Yeah it's okay if you take the time to enjoy it but stand alone in it's core it just can't feel fun like any of the older ones
:3
Too bad there are no haystacks to leap into.
^
/me makes eagle noises
she has to synchronize her viewpoint first Gold
After you synchronize, leap of faith
ofna01: Oh yeah. I forgot
Phase4: ever played the tf2 Mirrors edge maps ? :P
faith be dead
Dafuq is he doing?
lol
killerpony7733, you should see how much it has changed since release...
i used to be good i sware
yer ass
Sergio_Scriptor: nope
lol
Phase4: A bit rusty, eh?
Phase4: if you want or have time i can give you a ip later :)
LEAP OF FAAAITH
AAAH
im gonna do that whenever there's a big jump from now on
AdamTheDuck Oh yeah. It's become quite stale... armored kill is k but all it's about is just showing off their engine and not making the game even more fun
killerpony7733, it was "ok" at launch, but then I just saw the game go downhill every patch since. :/ My opinion anyway.
Watching this almost makes me want to move around.
Gurl
what you doin
Emil: nah you are beter in here watcing bronystate :)
girl
STAHP
AdamTheDuck True in some form. It was actually alot of fun about and around when B2K was around but...the patches afterwards got meh
lol
and then i broke mirrors edge
D:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ouch.
LEAP OF FAAAITH?
killerpony7733, I'm not worried of stability of graphics and whatnot, gameplay was tweaked too much from launch...
lol..
Phase4: You seem to be good at breaking stuff, yes?
:P stupid kick
Emil, yeah
to learn things one must break it first :P
Emil: you kiding ? just look at his kerbal space program rockets :d jk
killerpony7733, one more question... How does a bit of weighed plastic (a foregrip) decrease a firearm's accuracy?
Sergio_Scriptor: that just reinforces our point xD
Sergio_Scriptor: Yeah, that too.
lets try something i've not played yet
NO PHASE
moar mirrors edge
Torchlight?
D:
that reminds me..
AdamTheDuck: It doesn't, it improves it.
Ahh Assassin's Ceed
Creed*
Phase4: remeber whenever you want i can give you the mirrors edge tf2 mode :P
Borderlands?
WE need something either assassins creed or Mirrors Edge
I just started playing that the other day, lol. XD
Emil, explain that to BF3's logic then.
AdamTheDuck Yeah stupid logic. IRL said grip helps a soldier keep his barrel aimmed down and it gets alot better to avoid side to side recoil
Adam
its logic
AdamTheDuck: Well, the foregrip improves accuracy.
its DICE logic
k?
i got 1 game of torchlight
Now I have to go check... Damn it...
ofna01, Dice logic, it just needs to stop there...
anyone wants it?
VALVE TIME
AdamTheDuck I mean for one it should both help improve vertical and horizontal recoil IRL and it's range should be fine
LightTrooper105 Sure
MY birthday is in 6 days
yaaaay
killerpony7733 do I have you on steam?
ofna01: sorry to ask,but how many ? :P
16
ofna01 and how old are you now?
didnt even get a chance to break that one
I'm 15
ofna01: cool :) i make 16 in 22 of november :P
going 16 congratz lol
LightTrooper105 Yeppers but gimme ya steam name cause i got a friends only profile
I turned 18 last sunday
So wooo! :D
oh wait i finished that game
Phase4: can we play KSP?
plz?
:3
ofna01, i cant make thie stream be just ksp
ofna01: dont tempt him :d
you'll get the entire desktop
:(
anyone here got synergy?
Nope.avi
LightTrooper105 What's ya steam?
killerpony7733 my steam name still the same but the pick the one with fily Celestia
Phase4: i usted to have :'(
killerpony7733, that and it gives one better control of where one points the weapon but that can't really be implemented into a game...
might as well try this
Play some New Vegas phase
^
Yes :D
it probably still instadies
i meen skyrim wont start either
:/
bethesda just doesnt like me
if i could stream id stream MOHF my fav game
:/
AdamTheDuck Yeah again stupid logic. But again DICE isn't aimming for realism
Well again how the hell can you make a fully realistic game?
For a game you always have to have some form of unrealistic thing in it
if u could id buy it first no matter how costly
killerpony7733 sent
not game can be real as real life
Phase4: 66.150.121.42 ip for tf2 mirros edge mode if you want :)
that why they are called realistic
killerpony7733, well ArmA is a military simulator
I have Arma 2
Yeah again then the term of realism is a bad term to use. You can say a game with some realistic traits
anypony ever play medal of honor frontline?
LightTrooper105: you mean you have Dayz :P
i HAD the free version Light
but because of DayZ they thinks its a zombie game now..
I have a phobia of zombies
must install more directx
/me shivers
AdamTheDuck Yeah it's what you can call a fairly realistic game in terms of several things but it still like any other game has unrealistic traits
im not going to buy arma 3 cause im waiting for the dayz stand-alone free to play get's relased :)
*arma 2
Sergio_Scriptor I enjoy DayZ but the fact people thinks its a game by its own its just idiotic..
zombies can atttack me all they want i have plenty of guns and ammo
I did like Red Orchestra though, has some realism aspects but still has the video game feel of not being a simulator
/me walks slowly over to ofna01, gargling spit out from his severed jaw and reaches out to grab him
LightTrooper105: well they are planing on making a dayz stand-alone game,but for now,you have to live with the fact that most people that have recently pbought arma 2 bought it for dayz :P
Thunder, thats not god damn funny
LightTrooper105 What sucks too is that ever since it's rise in popularity a metric ton of hackers has invaded the game and it's too common to find the douchebags with full gear killing you alot
GTG now later everypony :(
ofna01: wait, you're serious?
bye Ponies47
I'm serious.
Bye Ponies47
LightTrooper105 And the fact everyone and just about everyone is a paranoid douchenozzle
bye Ponies47 :)
killerpony7733 I know Im an admin on a Arma2 server and now I ban mostly hacker..
killerpony7733: well i guess it's supose to simulate real zombie experience :P
00,10well damit, why is the transscribe audio not working
some people ask me how to play the game and they got it becasue of DayZ
/me grabs a shotgun and stands by ofna01 "okay! no zombies touch this guy!"
Ohai Sumica
00,10oh hi.
LightTrooper105 Yep either it's cause people love making people rage due to how hard the mod is or it's some kid who thinks they are the best
ohai Sumi
Phase4: didnt you finissed this game already ? :|
*finished
Sergio_Scriptor, DLC
AdamTheDuck: ha ok :\
Sergio_Scriptor, this is dlc
Phase4, still going pacifist?
Dat ass
00,10I meen it looks like it should work no? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCSi5h3Fy74
killerpony7733 yeah I know I heard many of them are a pro on DayZ.. and yet they can't even learn how to drive... nor fly
i need a better irc client for steam
Sumica: hum...you are a mod that posted a video link...so...do you ban yourself ? :d
Yay 1 views
Sumica nice quality
00,10I gave my self premition =p
Sumica: :D
Sumica lol at "Yada-yada all rights to those that own them this is just a test run any ways."
00,10and yeah the quality was one issue that made me starting this take so long
00,10but damit why is the transscribe audio not making it funny.
what where you trying to do?
were*
yeah
actually... no
00,10well most the songs dont have that option
sooo bored
oh, so you tried to uoppload one with the option... ok :/
hazard: cheer up LALALALALALAAL and fit like a fidle ready for love i could jump ove tthe beatifull barn,fit like a fidle and ready for love *plays violin in a green stripe suit*
00,10yeah Lil_B
00,10trying to figure out how to get it to do that
I... just said the obvious again didn't I?
now what
you need to get a gun Phase
but i play pascifist
00,10hmmmm, perhaps I did it wrong
phase4_ go sneaky and get gun
00,10they dont have much in the way of how toos
Well, sometimes you can't always be a pacifist Phase
Phase4: dont listen to them,play pacifist :)
If only Wrek were here...
o.o
Jensens sexy and he knows it
Phase4, it's simple, we kill the Batman.
Punch them in the face?
AdamTheDuck, I thought he's always lurking
i think if i wait long enough they'll walk off
Phase, just punch'em in the face
AdamTheDuck: i guess that would be Paci FIST :D god i suck
it won't kill them
http://chzsomuchpun.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-puns-horschach.jpg Mawr puns :3
USE THE BEER
AdamTheDuck: :d
how i wish for my augs back
I need to get over my phobias
ofna01: can i ask what they are ? :\
I'm afraid of zombies and large crowds
I don't like it when people yell either
YES!
ofna01: oh,im afraid of things that dont make any sense :P
GOOD JOB PHASE!
PUNCH
a guard with 2 shot and no ammo
Even though zombies are fictional and can't possibly do anything to you? O_o
I'm afraid it could happen
bugget cut this day
ofna01: like if i saw something that is not supost to be there,or that should not ecist or makes no sense what so ever it scares me :'(
even though its not possible
Oooook
lol, doors
Adam, NO
I do not
AdamTheDuck: well i would like to happen,but then we have no ponies :'(
thinking about stuff like that gives me panic attacks
i'm batman
AdanTheDuck, I like my brains where they are thanks
But then I have a reason to say I read the zombie survival guide from cover to cover :D
then I will have*
squeak squeak squeak
Ok..
/me licks ofna01...
ofna01: sure,want to talk about spiders ? :P
I'm already feeling a panic attack coming on from it
o.O
/me licks Jmo too
not sure if guard stupid or smart
AdamTheDuck: you never licked me :'(
im watching rocky :D
/me curls up in ball and sleeps
he didnt lick me either Sergio_Scriptor
Sergio_Scriptor, Caramel told me not to lick people I don't know :<
oh :'(
Adam you don't know me, quit licking me.
Although I don't really know ofna01 as well xD
Fool of a took.
Adam Jensen, Badass.
or Jmo
00,10.......you know I wonder.
o.o
00,10did they just upload a text fill full of random words
/me licks Sergio_Scriptor anyway xD
HIDE THE BODYS
00,10and they system trys to match them
Sumica, probably :D
maybe..
AdamTheDuck: yay :) i got licked...ewww
00,10FORSCIENCE!
/me copys a snipet of the things sed in chat
Everyone tells me zombies will never exist, but i'm still afraid
Well, war has a way of resetting things. And clearly there are things that really need to be reset in such a way. AdamTheDuck, this doesn't need to involve zombies.
ofna01: dont worry,if they do exist the cold winter would kill them in no time :)
Kandarihu, wow, how did you know I hate today's society? :3
I worry alot
Well hate is a strong word
I'm afraid of 2012 too
Dislike is "better"
/me falls asleep
ok, I think I'm finally Satisfied with my new song XD (it's true what tehy say, don't think about it too muich and it will become good -.-)
ofna01: that is just a fake,the maya calender is just like a normal calendar,it's the end of a cicle but the begining fo a new one,nothing will chnage :)
I hope so
I just now realised im shakeing....
ofna01: calm down dude :d
/me hugs ofna01
hugs make people feel better, don't they? :3
Dat lockdown
I'm just afraid of what COULD happen rather then what IS happening
>wake up
>see Jensen punch somebody
>DickJensen?
AdamTheDuck: of course
ofna01: http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28500000/OMGOSH-so-cute-Twilight-Sparkle-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-28577702-894-894.png this will make you feel beter :)
HNNNNG
ofna01, tomorrow never comes, so stop worrying about the future. Think of the present.
:P
^
Sergio_Scriptor, D'aaaaaawwwwwww :D
AdamTheDuck: :)
Thanks adam, that helps alot
Future's not worth thinking about anyway. Almost never happens like you think it will
Gold_Demona: but that is why we must make an efort so that it may happen :P
WE control our future
^
To an extent
Some things we can control, some are beyond our control
BREAK DAT GLASS STUFF
I prefer to live in the present. I can deal with the present.
AdamTheDuck, how could you say such a thing if you didn't?
one of my dreams is to someday become a mod here on bronystate,and i hope someday i can do it :)
i would stream you guys with so many good tv shows
Sergio, one of my dreams is to stream on BronyState
ofna01: me too :P
Sergio_Scriptor, I dream of that too
I've even got games i would like to play if i ever streamed
Kandarihu: i guess we all do,when a new job for mod here arrives it will be like a war,friendship gets fogoten to see who gets there first :d
Hey, there's a spider on your face! I'll get it! WITH MY FIST!
but i will be super mad if Meanwhile get's the job :|
I need to take karate or something to increase my self-esteem
Hey, there's something on your face! *punches your face* IT WAS PAIN!!!
I have low self-esteem
I MADE YOU A
PIE
ofna01: dont worry that is just a fase :) *hugs*
What flavor is it?
oh boy, what flavor?
PIE FLAVOR
:O
Do you ever get tired of being random?
ofna01: you said you neede to learn karate ? :) http://bum.net/pics/bruce-lee.png
Sergio_Scriptor, ofna01, I hope you have better computers than mine.
Sergio, thats god damn AWESOME
Kandarihu, I'm not sure, you assumed I sort wish society is "reset" which was strange as at times I actually do wish that were the case.
dem kicks
ofna01: me too :|
o.o
Also, morning guys
So many kicks
i just loled at phase4 hack just to go back where he first started

Ninjazz I saw that too
LightTrooper105, looks like we were the victims of a net split or something.

i was just wondering why the other arent talking..
Ikr.

LAGG.
Ohai ASoftFluffyThing
hey ASoftFluffyThing

Tom kicked me?
What is happening ? :\
/me hugs AdamTheDuck and d3rb_
i got kicked for sending 6 messages in 10 seconds....
ROFL
i was just kick because sending 6 messege at 11 sec?
i sent 2 messages...
i did not even send 7 messagesper second :|
Major major lag.
Ohai Phase4
BerryPunch is getting a few kicks
Same Sergio
Ooh, that never happened in the main campaign, didn't it? Getting headshot while hacking?
We might get a global sooner or later.
ok who let derpy in..
speeding in a 5 message per 10 second zone
Kandarihu, nope, i managed to avoid it
thats a kick
Kanda, that's what i would EXPECT a guard to do if he found you hacking....
my perfect score of 0 kicks...ruined :'(
Oh, this guy is busy, i'll shoot him in the face!
What the crap? O_o
you are tainted Sergio_Scriptor
you took away my kick virginity :'(
Someone has gone mad with power
Sergio_Scriptor nothing perfect..
Oh god what Sergio
don't refer to it like that o_O
I got kicked for too many messages when I didn't even send any. O_o
ofna01: :d
Sergio_Scriptor, lolwut :D
Sergio_Scriptor, it sill hurts. T~T

"Open. Shut. Open. Shut. Open. Shut. Op- OW"
does anyone know a site were i can download movies?
mentallyeffedguy: pirate b *censored*
legally? no
^
google it
well i dont really mind being illegal XD
these guys are amazingly ignorant of this door
Rather than society be reset, I honestly wish it could be reformed from where it is now. Because I don't think I'd like to live in a society after such a reset.
mentallyeffedguy: Keep in mind, you risk getting viruses going that route.
Phase4_ - well except for the one that opened it into your face
Kandarihu, depends on the method of "reset" really.
That's why I stopped pirating movies. Got sick of dealing with viruses
Gold_Demona: do you have a better idea then-?
buy them?
i wa
But shall we keep off this pesimisted topick Kandarihu? :S
mentallyeffedguy: Get a netflix account.
topic*
netflix....... never heard of it xD
dvds are crazy cheap these days
mentallyeffedguy: What country are you in?
Gold_Demona: norway
If we're going to be able to reform society, we need to be able to discuss things civilly.
mentallyeffedguy: Ah, well never mind then. :P
d3rb_: i blame blu-ray :P
blu ray is getting cheap too
its awesome
d3rb_: oh cool :)
Gold_Demona: ok
Video Y NO Load?
MURKA!

No ofna. I do too. I'm not very good, but I sing lots here at home while I'm by myself.

i'm on minecraft right now.
it's amazing how much of a waiting game Tekkit can be
ofna01: oh sorry dude :\ i bought the game in 2010 :) got the proof of purchaase hat
Mirror, Pc or xbox?
Mirror, i use Tekkit too! :D
PC, obviously
i can never find diamonds for crap
but i have 6 stacks of coal and a compressor
MirrorImage: you need to dig between the 20-and 30 layers i belive :P
my first day on tekkit i found 20 diamonds...
Yay a stun gun
Sergio_Scriptor - i have
and i'm too lazy to try strip mining an area yet
MirrorImage: and still nothing ? :\
so i'm just going to craft my own diamonds
I literally found diamonds within an hour
MirrorImage: ha ok XD
ofna01 - yeah, that tends to be my luck
ofna01: i think the world record to find diamons is in 3-6 minutes :)
a guy on you tube did it
luckally i have enough solar panels and an electric furnace, so i don't have to worry about using this coal for anything else but moar solar panels
I'm on an online server, so you have to donate to use the rings on it and redmatter shat
Sergio_Scriptor - it's amazing how much surface level URANIUM i find though
But i have full nano armor and dark matter sword
0 diamonds, 11 uraniums
MirrorImage: :D uranium is cool though,the paxel i belive it's called :)
and the mutants
Mirror, i had over 200 uranium, THEN my reactor exploded
eh, at this point what i'm working for is an energy converter, so i can convert all this uranium into more diamonds
probably not going to build a reactor. at least not anytime soon
making a record of finding diamonds in Minecraft is like a record in getting a royal flash in pokert, it's just about the luck -.-
I made a nuclear reactor, it exploded and wiped my island off the map except 1 or 2 buildings
MirrorImage: cool,but im realy waiting is for the doctor who mod :P
Luckily my valuables were in the chest that exploded
that wasnt*
ofna01: should have used ender chest :d if you had one :P
they had to reset the map after that though xD
"They?"
it was SMP?
Yup
You want the server IP?
nah
k
"That computer screen insulted my mother! WARRRGH" *bang bang bang*
xD
DED
MirrorImage: :D
Mirror, Tekkit can be hard
im making a public rollercoaster in it right now, with elevators and jump tracks and stuff
ofna01 - considering i lost 3 redstone engines in the process of getting my workshop layout right, yeah
Damn
broke it with my fists "oh, i must need a wrench"
eenope
PICKAXE
I always keep spares of every machine
ofna01: smart choice :)
you'd think you need something a little less... brutal to pick up an engine
and i don't have the spare resources for extra machines yet
Engine? lets hit it with a pointy pickaxe!
I like how he picks up guns even though he won't use them
xD
ofna01: well that is minecraft logic,the same logic that tells you you can cut a tree with a fish and get gravel and sand with a pickaxe :D
True that
Sergio, you should really try Tekkit
its complicated but ALOT of fun
Mmm gonna get some breakfast
ofna01: i will probably sound like an idiot,but ... what is that ? :P ... sorrry :(
Sergio_Scriptor - think Minecraft meets the Industrial Revolution
MirrorImage: oh cool :)
here sergio
MirrorImage: i need to check it out then
http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit/
I sent him a link to a vid of it Mirror
if that launcher doesn't work for some reason, make sure you have Java 6 installed
i only had Java 7 on my computer and it was being rather finicky until i got 6
it adds al kinds of new ores and items, new armor....
"Looks okay over here. OH MY ... ughh... *thud*"
Nano armor, Bronze armor, Quantum armor, Redmatter and Darkmatter armor....
Phase4, I'm not sure if there is an achievement for Missing Link solely on being a pacifist
tekkit looks fun :) i love the industrial revolution
Sergio, you should try it
There Facory Zero but that's requires you to also not use Praxis kits
I have a server and i could teach you
we need a BronyState Tekkit server, for sure
ofna01: i probably will :P
yes mirror
yes
that reminds me, i need to buy legit Minecraft instead of cracked for my B-Day
if for nothing more than so i don't have to keep wasting redstone building new machines so i can build more new machines after finding more redstone
ofna01: yeah me too :d
AdamTheDuck: meh, its how i want to play
Notch is a cool dude, he's fine with you cracking it as long as you buy it later
Phase4, Cool.
well, that's 3 stacks of coal mascerated
just another hour to go to get the other 3 stacks done >_<
Damn mirror
you need a condenser
that's what i'm working towards
I have like 5 for different stuff xD
can't find the diamonds, so i'm making them!
you got the Obsidian?
i'll make it with water and lava cells
Not bad mirror, not bad.
i've got this more or less planned out
Ya need to work towards some better armor or weapons too
it's just entirely convoluted over the alt plan of "Find 6 diamonds"
Nano at the minimum
i do love how i have my choice of material for making diamond
Hey all!
Hello JunkerKun
Hey there JunkerKun
i can use Obsidian as the core for the diamond
How are you all?
hi JunkerKun :)
JunkerKun: good :P
i could use an Iron Block as the core, requiring 9 bars of iron
or i can use BRICKS. "Oh look, clay in the river!"
MirrorImage: Tekkit?
they make the decision so easy...
Tekkit
"no way he was alone" XD
MirrorImage: Does it work on 1.3.1 already?
no
hiu JunkerKun :)
but there's a launcher that launches 1.2.5 to make it work anyways
JunkerKun I have a question about your nick
Lil_B: Yes?
JunkerKun is it read like Junker - kun? the the japanese "title" kun?
Lil_B: Yup
Mirror, clay is pretty useful
What game is this
Loneblackhoves: Deus Ex 3
aw
ofna01: i will have fun for sure :)
Lil_B: Why?
Loneblackhoves, Deus Ex HR: The Missing Link DLC
Sergio, you should join my server, i will teach you
ofna01: sorry,but my minecraft does not work with multyplayer :'(
Hello everyone.
Hello Meanwhile
Hello Meanwhile :)
Meanwhile: Hi!
Sergio, it does
Ohai Meanwhile
Hey Meanwhile.
yeesh, i heard a spider crawling around outside my house, probably on the roof
my server is cracked so you can join
climb up there, no spider
ofna01: not mine,it crashes all the time :'( sorry
/me hugs Meanwhile and gives him a Pinkie PIe
walk around the house, SPIDER AMBUSH FROM THE ROOF
you should install Tekkit then try
>_<
ofna01: i will :)
JunkerKun nothing really :)
MirrorImage: Damn it. I though you was talking about real life spider =/
I see Deus Ex is up. Who's playing?
Meanwhile, Phase is
Meanwhile: Phase is :P
MirrorImage: That would quite big spider if you heard it in real life
JunkerKun - Australia, mate
Ah, explains the lack of desktop pony.
our spiders have Health Bars
so these guys are into human traficing
yo yo fillies
Meanwhile: Phase has a desktop pony.
Yes but his is largely for KSP.
True..
which is why i live in Pennsylvania
the most we deal with are Deer, and everyone has guns for that
I don't get it, our spiders are not "that" big. :D
But the point is they /can/ get that big.
MirrorImage: Unless deer doesn't come with idea to hunt people. Like in Deer Avenger
*wld
*wild
Mirror has BAWLS OF STEEEEEEL
*glances down* like hell they are
o.o.
Sergio_Scriptor: Well, sadly, the most dangerous animal I've seen was a wild dog
JunkerKun: :D it could have rabies :P
Mirror, you should have a revolver
Go ahead, make mah day
Sergio_Scriptor: Good thing it didn't bite me
JunkerKun: indeed :)
nah, if anything i'd have a shotgun
my house is essentially one big hallways
MirrorImage: A shot with shotgun from a point blank range... mmmmm...
kind of hard to miss at 30ft with a shotgun when you can't move more than 2ft either direction
im also coming here during the week now cause i will no longer be hable to come here on saturday night :'(
That's unpleasant. :<
Sergio_Scriptor: Eh? Why?
Aww no movies? :<
time for movies*
JunkerKun: well first i got in Pony tales RPG session with my brony and pegasis friends,and after that i stream for them movies that thye choosed during the week like in here :P so i got no time to be here on saturday
;'(

Oh eh hem... er

I have weak shins!
Orlly Barb?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l9PuQl3kQ0
Tell me, would you face herobrine after that?
/me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ermp8SQYsjo
Mortal
ofna01: yeah. HeroBrine can be removed with a patch.
umad herobrine?
/me applies Notch to Herobrine's forehead.
I have never been removed, I am behind it all.
http://derpy.me/vc5mQ
I am the reason you fear the night.
I thought Batman was the reason you fear the night.
Yeah yeah. Keep telling your self that. I still see you cry at night and jump when you merely see the update screen.
^
/me makes ground dissapear under Barb
Chat room physics are silly.
But Batman makes everything so much more better.
Gods do not cry, Gods do not BLEED.
really enough with the rp.
Like a nice game of frisbe.
Lol
Oh you, silly ofna01 *gives a cookie*
who's Herobrine? O_O
minecraft
Erm, that wasn't me guys
I am Herobrine
wut
Erm
/me looks at Herobrine
ofna01: Those of us who are using irc clients can see when you change names
^
^^
MEh
Notch: So we know it's you
of course, there's also /whois
Meh, i was bored.
Whats a birthday party? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzPoz2safPI&feature=player_detailpage#t=40s
Stupid link
Oh well
still good video though
I wonder...
http://derpy.me/YolRR
That works
Barbetos|AtWork: Potter Puppet Pals! <3
That explains a lot about Ron honestly
That SINGLE phrase
What phrase?
"Whats a birthday party?"
Yep, Ron in all his loveable glory
That video has my other favorite line from the PPP series. "I don't care about your Grandmotha, I'm Harry Potta!"
Its so fun to just "I don't care about your X, I'm Harry Potter!"
And then I get to naked Dumbldore popping out the the cake and singing
Oh Dumbles, you silly old man~
lol! I forgot about that
Nekkid tiem!
It's always nekkid tiem for Dumbldore
I saw the world premiere for Deathly Hallows when it was being shown in London, I think it was
Daniel Radcliffe actually talked about reenacting "Mysterious Ticking Noise" for a fund raiser in an interview once.
I don't think it ever came to fruition, but I would pay money for it
I think it would go along pretty good since a lot of Potterheads know it
That would be awesome
Yeah. Both those things.
"I found the source of the ticking. It's a pipe bomb!" "Yaaaaaa--BOOOM"
they just need to happen at a place
And possibly do a livestream of it as well
Voldimort should of totally used some muggle technology. He would of totally won.
Lol anyways at the premiere of Deathly Hallows, when Alan Rickman showed up the crowd was chanting "Snape! Snape! Severus Snape!"
I mean think about it.. how hard would it of been for him just to magic a nuke about to explode into Hogwarts?
Oh kay. Now I am glad I was not that author of the Harry Potter books. =\
Coffee gives me strange ideas, that seem to be extremely morbid
I don't think the nuke would work. Muggle objects tend to act wonky around Hogwarts, especially electronics.
True. Thats awesome about Alan Rickman btw XD
Wish I could of been there.
All the cool stuff happens in London.
But I have to live in Texas. <<
I know, right?
I sat there and watched it all. They also streamed it on Youtube on the Harry Potter channel
It was the priemere of DH part 2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8bBziwkrSA
00,10slow render is slow -_-
Hang in there, Sumi.

Dken2021: What? They had this in Charlie?
Woona!
I am fine with this
JunkerKun: youtube Charlie The Unicorn
bell rang. Later everypony!
MadSurge: After encountering a narwhal.
JunkerKun this is what charlie the unicorn is all about
Wait.... Its all.about finding his kidney?
Yep
Someone should make game out of Woona
JunkerKun moonstuck
Didn't they already?
what
Well its not exactly a game.
Ninjazz: Wha?
I mean, it's an /almost/ screamer but it's still a game.
Forgot the name.
cachi01|phone: Nop. it shall be called woona
Oooh yeah woona game
:(
Nightmare fuel
Nigtmare fuel everywhere
It's just a creepy picture of Apple Bloom with deathly whispers.
XDDDD I thought I heard Cowboy Bebop and it was Woona XDDDD
Did they ever do anything like this for Homestuck?
But IMO dreamy rainbow was more scary
Ninjazz u never played.luna game 4 :/
yeeah~
No I didn't and on't plan to, cachi01|phone.
Ninjazz: I hate screamer games D:
Me too
As do I.
i don't even like scry stuff
i just found out theliving tombstone does all the eddsworld backround music
I use head phones on screamer games
ting! :)
But I love horror games.
But I play them wrong all the time. >_<
Ninjazz luna game 4 is mah fave on the series
flutterchu I don't think all of it, only the newer ones as far as I know
Instead of freaking out and huddling in a corner, I run after the damn things.
And its not just a screamer
cachi01|phone, why would you have a favorite?
Ninjazz: Oh, I can totally relate this =3
idk i liek luna games lol
00,10Play FEAR with sound channles backwards and it's a veryboreing game
JunkerKun, hahaha. (\
FEAR? Pffft
Ninjazz: /)
But FEAR had bullet time.
00,10every time you hear a spooky sound you will look the wrong way
Sloooooooowwww moooooootiiioooon.
Lol.
Then you're intentionally doing it wrong.
Its a good shooters. But to be honest. Its not scary
Actually, shouldn't that freak you out more?
Shooter*
lol XD
Shooters and Horror usually don't mix well.
the power of cute
Since you have the power to fight back.
Exactly
Btw. How da fuq did alma got pregnant. She is a bucking ghost xD
>Y
I think that's where Survival Horror picks up.

MadSurge: that's cool i guess... < has no idea what taht is...
I actually have never seen Moonstuck... and I'm still within the first 100 sites of Homestuck XD
who reads it?
Eli: a webcomic
Then Mario came out of a pipe and got angry because Mario woz his buttbuddy and hated ponies so he snapped their necks.
>Do ALL the Sudokus XD
That's why you need a history lesson on the Normans.
hi everypony
So I'l tell you.
hello somepony_else
hi Lil_B
Heya somepony_else
hello MLP_Brovakiin
The first Norman king was William the Conkerer (I think)
He killed old Harold Godwin in the Battle of Hastings and became the ruler of this stupid place.
SCIENCE WOONA
and breviously Harold had a Battle with Vikings at York and they had to wal the whole way to the south coast in 8 days, thus they were really damn tired
Likewise he was a very cruel king and went around invading other places in England to prove he was leader.
it's taht monster from space quest
Eli you mean Galaxy Quest?
Lil_B: oh yeah. same thing
You'll be happy to know thaat one day when he was riding his horse when he fell of and hurt his great gut.

you must not have turned your laptop off
just closed the led
lol, guess so
hey yall
hello
yo trollhunter
whats going on
lol, I can move! http://derpy.me/nTrJK
to shut it off you need to go to start menu and hit turn off computer
Oh... boy have I been doing it wrong
Movables!
a window should pop up hit turn off
So... no hammer?
and it will close everything and shut it down
next time you wanna turn it on hit the power button
Why are you giving someone a tutorial on how to run windows?
BECAUSE HES TURNING THE DAM COMPUTER OFF WRONG
I usually just beat the computer till it turns off
that breaks it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzmtKulJySs&feature=youtube_gdata_player twinkle twinkle little star........
Oh...
I fail to see how pressing a button can cause a physical destruction of a computer
Also, it only affects RAM
I think I need to watch more HowToBasic. He'll show me how.
Gonna need more eggs though
wut?
why? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKq22PkCweI

Heyo Kurra!

Barbetos i think i just had a nerdgasm

Stupid Capcom...
On steam now >3
Capcom aint so stupid. They are making Pheonix wright 5 so. Yay :)
Probably will have over 9000 1st day DLC
I mean. Ace attorney lol.
Barbetos|AtWork did you not know about the fan film?
Nope
And the ending will be its own $100 DLC
Dr_Fumbles silly filly 3DS wont have dlc
If its Capcom, they'll find a way
This Mega Man talk makes me want to get out my DS and play ZX
I hate Megaman X continuity
ah, I like that one, the sequel was...ok
I hate the fact I have to buy a 3DS for new games...
The only megaman for DS i have is that goddamn megaman battle network game :/
Never played that one
Fucking shitty battle system...
BN5?
Yes
I never really played the Z series either, and I have number 4 I think
Some one gave it to me
I think ET is best game
:|
of course it is Dr_Fumbles
lol
:D
Dr_Fumbles it deserves to be the gotc
Lets go to the land fill they are in and sell them at 5 bucks a pop
That was even hard to say :P
Dub them "A collectors must have!"
A suicidals must have
I find it funny they made more cartridges than consoles for that game
Didnt knew that
yea, they though people would probably buy E.T twice
But lets not forget the amazing Bubzy 3D. Better than any Elder Scroll game.
indeed :D
Brb i must punish myself for saying that
quite
For those of you who don't know what Bubzy is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAlr5raV2U&feature=plcp
what could possibly go wrong?

Well, guess I'll be going for now. I'll Be back later.

I too have a normal keyboard still, but I stopped playing 4 years ago and I really only need a small one now for composing, my old keyboard is just too biug :(
/me kidnaps Lil_B
NOOOO00000ooooo.......
/me kidnaps alexxm while kidnapping Lil_B
kidnapception
Lil_B why all the fuss
hellau people
Those extra 18 keys on my keyboard are brilliant
So so useful for WoW
alexxm I got kidnapped :(
/me kidnapps Serenity while kidnapping alexxm while kidnapping Lil_B
isn't it fun Lil_B
OH GOD AHH
Ooh, I like your Lorry
alexxm I have no problem with it, I'm just horrible at responing to stuff like this XD
But how did I racecar fit in there :/
/me kidnapping the word kidnap
how are you?
I don't need programmable keys or an extra small display on my keyboard, I just want it to bee compakt and workjing :)
Now we cant say -------
My bottom 6 keys are my totem keys :)
:)
4 totems + totem recall and place
And hi arnoldschvartznegger
/me wishes he had MoP
Currently can't afford it
I need to buy money
I will give you 10 quid for 100 quid?
and I hope with the time I'll be able to actually use this Midi Keyboard for Composing XD right now the latenc-time between the keyboard and my PC is too hight and my PC is too slow too properly record continuesly
DEAL!
Lil_B: SLower than Shitbox?
El
Serenity can I have spects of El Shitbox?
specs*
Lil_b 256 mb of ram
512 MB ram, 128 Mb with 233 mh/s clock Video card and a 1.3 gh/z pentium 3 dual core
Less than what a calculator from Wolrd war II could do
Inb4 we can play skyrim in WW2 calculators
Was there a character wipe in Planetside 2? Oo
Character wipe?
all my characters are gone and the server are renamed
Serenity ok, mine is better, -.- but recording in a Programm for Composing is eating on my rescources in need moar!
ekips http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/character-wipe-and-server-name-change-09-17-2012.20623/
I'll get a new PC at the end of the year with i7 and 16GB Ram this should last for quite a while than
I7? Wow
Im getting one with i3 or i5
Lil_B: I currently have 12 gb with 2g card and a 6 core i7 :)
cachi01|phone ah thanks
i7 is pretty fucking expensive
Heya im back!
6 core costs a fucking country
someone know on what server Wrek & Co are playing?
On what game?
Their own,
ps2
Planetside
planetside 2
Ah
Yeah what server are they on :)
I have enough games atm
Serenity wow, 2 grafics cards Oo I'll just use one, I have no multi monitor Setup anyway (although that would be nice in the future) but Grafics wise I only need it for gaming anyway XD
Lil_B: No, a 2gb GPU
ekips the servers recently got new names
and Wrek was playing yesterday but he did not say what sever
server. I forgot to ask too
Lil_B how can one not have a multi monitor setup? I can't live without anymore
Barbetos|AtWork that's why I'm asking
I am so glad I have my second monitor now
I know he played on EU2 before
Serenity GPU is the grafics card ... or do you mean a 2 core grafics card?
ekips: Since I'm at a 2200x1600, I don't need 2 monters
Lil_B: GPU is graphics processing unit
GB is the amount of memory it has
ekips try making characters on both eu servers and send friend request to Wrek, assuming he is using that name in game still of course.
that might work
Argh
Wish Bronystate had a Terraria server
Guys i might get a pc with i3, idk what graphic card it has, 1TB memory, 8 GB ram. I wonder if i will be able to play amnesia without lag....
Serenity the Grafics Processing Unit is the Grafics Card
gtg cya
cachi01|phone: 1TB memory, jesus, what planet mate?
Lil_B: Yes.
ekips: Wrek's name on planetside is boksy
cachi01|phone if it's a cheap one, the graphic card will be crap
ekips: just kidding, it is Wrek
cya
:p
If it's cheap, it won't even be GPU
Serenity so we did talk about the same thing all along!
Yes :3
ekips well. Its an HP i think it costs like 12,000 pesos
NO.
Mexican pesos
Don't buy HP
I cant remembe if it was dell or HP
aw ok cya
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Simple PMV: The Fray: Absolute / Show Me How To Lie: A Great and Powerful Trixie Tribute / Glitter And Be Gay / Between Fairytales and Happy Endings
HP are reliable as a wooden banana
Lol
I've had 3, and all have had motherboard failures at some point
Lil_B: I was in that bunch :P
Serenity :P
But I hate starting again, that's the thing
Serenity but satarting again is fun :(
For me, starting again is a slug on some curry soup
And my dad says it might be a mac......... I DONT WANT A MAC!
cachi01|phone: Okay, if it's mac, hurry up and get that HP :P
cachi01|phone tell him streight all the negative Stuff about Macs XD
Its made by apple why would i use that :S
oh! Mega_Milk! You are actually here?
seems that Wrek has to be online, sent him a friend request on all 3 servers, all failed >.>
Lil_B i already told him but he keeps saying macs are the best computers :/
cachi01|phone: Tell him to shut the fuck up, and say, PC's are best. Hands, cables, hooves paws whatever limbs down.
cachi01|phone make a list of all of his Pro arguments and I will make a List to make a Contra argument for eacvh and every one :)
lol
Howdy y'all!
hey there Everlasting_Joy
how are things Everlasting_Joy
I wanna play a game, but NFC what to play.
NFC?
No fucking clue
Lil_B and alexxm: Decent. Just waiting for the next school-related thing to blow in and ruin my day to be honest.
Oh i found the pc im.going to get :)
I'd say get a laptop
13,000 pesos
cachi01|phone: Ooh! What kind?
Serenity got 30 games on my desk, 60 on Steam... I have nothing to play!
Lil_B: Been there.
https://www.tienda.telmex.com/shell/download/fstore/liquidfusion/shell_files/TiendaTelmex/images/1038015_gde.jpg
Lil_B: 90+ on desktop, over 200.
:)
I wasnt my new PC to finally play games at max settings >:(
Everlasting_Joy dell :)
want*
I can piss everything :3
cachi01|phone: Cool.
Such an upgrade over El shitbox, hehe
I feel like playing Minecraft I'm that bored
yeah im getting this one :) it has an i5 processor. 1.5 TB hard driveand 6 gb ram
Yes, I actually just said that.
I like ANNO 2070, looks gorgous, amazing real orchestra Sounbdtrack, nice thought out Gameplay, nice futuristic Design of Buiuildings... have to play on lowest settings and it still lags when Stuff get's more komplex -.-
and dark Souls I somehow can't play at all
http://youtu.be/_vuzRY-3vnY
ahh dark souls, the game of the year of 2011
cachi01|phone: What is this machine going to be used for primarily?
gaming.of course
cachi01|phone: get urself a custom built gaming pc
for gaming whis is quite enough actually, about midrange atm
Bronysith my dad doesnt want to get a custom :/
cachi01|phone: Is this going to be a laptop or home PC?
Home pc
I'll probably buy everything on alternate.de and assemble it myself with the help of someone
We were going.to get an alienware but they are expensive
alienware is the apple of gaming pcs
expensive as hell
alienware, a gamers frind
friend*
and not as good as other stuff
i know....... But atleast they run every game
I just want a pc that can handle every game. Because i bought garrys mod like 1 year ago and i havent been able to play it :/
cachi01|phone oh... OH... please... get a cuzstom PC... it's gonna cheaper than an Alienware>.< (exyept if you really REALLY want the nice look
^
Alienwares look very beautiful :3
cachi01|phone tehy do, but they< are WAY too expensive for what they do
I still have 3 months to search for a pc.
Or to get my dad to pay for a custom built one
;
Lil_B: my sisters boyfriend have one that costed him 23k kroner
Btw guys whats the best graphic card?
one that costs a shitload
arnoldschvartznegger 23k kroner? in which country do you life?
my graphics card cost me 500$
Lil_B: norway
Bronysith holy shit
Bronysith will an nvidia graphics card be cool enough to run tf2, portal 2, amnesia, and almost everything at almost 60 fps?
cachi01|phone rule for grafics crads: Buy the best one you can efford: they are in such a huge variaty that you will always look at the one thats just a little bit more expensive and say to yourself (oh, just 20$ more for better performance!)
cachi01|phone: im not one to talk to about that
Faaak gettin a pc is hard :I
cachi01|phone Nvidea GTX500 series or of you can effort it, GTX 600 series,
cachi01|phone: It is.
I really have to replace my old pc soon, this one's now nearly 6 years old :O
i got stabbed for reading chronicles of narnia
Lil_B which one is better? Amd or nvidia
ekips: mine was only 2 years old when it broke XD
cachi01|phone yeah, getting a PC is very hard, but every purchase gets harder the higher the costs are :/ buying a car was to date my hardest purchase XD
Lol
cachi01|phone both are good, but as it is right now I'd go with nVidea
d
mine's still working, but begins to loose performance now (and is obviously outdated horribly)
Ok apparently the gtx 590 is the fastest graphics card
cachi01|phone AMD made some mistakes in there prozessors latly and they gonna have a hard time, and after that nvidea will probably cranck up there prices (intel and Nvidea are both overpricxed, but now that AMD is going down both have no competitors :/ )
Lil_B: my first pc was 2k kroner :P
isnt't the gtx 690 the bestest atm?
cachi01|phone for hardware tests I would suggest looking up Toms Hardware Store in the internets!
Im in that site right now l
Lol
ekips probably, I don't think they have started 700 yet :/
the internets were not a single soul gets trough, the internets where you horrors and fears come true
XD
they should, so I can afford a 6xx one Lil_B :D
arnoldschvartznegger do you know how much kronen 1€ is? or the other way around?
Lil_B: ill check brb
/me kidnaps ekips
/me is being kidnapped O.o
arnoldschvartznegger thanks XD I just wanna know how much these 23k in € is you mentioned earlier :)
Ok so a 640 is 100$
I might get a 640
cachi01|phone wait... what?
so whats it like ekips
cachi01|phone I don't think so... I'll check
Lil_B it says the 670 is 380$
Lil_B: 3k euro i think
cachi01|phone: get the best graphics card that you can afford
alexxm: being kidnapped? it's an interesint experience to make I guess
Hello, everypony! How are you all today? :)

Barbetos|AtWork: I'd melt myself, but I'd be fine with it.
To clean the barbetos or... becuase of pinkie hug?
It would be too much happiness for me and I would pass out. :D
I would love to sing a duet with one of the main 6 (Spike would be fine too ^^)

Not sure what to play,

Lets play flip the table
Name something that makes you want to flip a table
Go
lol
Barbetos|AtWork: CoD players :3
Gangnam Style
13stupid people
^ that too
Shizuka: that one
Dammit, shizzy
/me flips Shizuka.
13course stupid people make me want to blow up the world
13why stop at flipping tables
FUUUUU!!
True.
^
Shizuka: flip the table onto a nuke bomb
Shizuka: Because if you blew up the world, I wouldn't be here anymore
if i were to flipp this table, i would be in trouble XD
People who use their tongue to help flick through pages
Plus I would miss New Tricks :C
13that's easy bronysith, you just play with pogo sticks until someone hits the random h-bomb button
Humanity will probably blow itself up at some point anyway.
Shizuka: lold
^
GRR
then commence
VICTORY SCREECH
OLOLOLLOLOLOLO
OLOLOLOLOLOLOL
why u so pissed Shizuka ?
/me flips table with bricks on it at Bronysith
Its always the unexpected that happens
Look. I am fine with the distruction of the world. I ask one thing before you do it though, send out season 1 of MLP FiM and Episodes 4 through 6. Destroy everything else
IF the universe gets anything from the world that should be it.
Episodes as in starwars
Also poser nerds make me want to flip the table "Oh yea i played one game of magic, such a nerd" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I can think of better contributions to the universe than MLP to be perfectly honest.
Meanwhile: electricity?
Meanwhile: Cinderblocks?
I was thinking more like man's philosophical musings but sure that too.
Also, don't forget the cake
Never forget the cake.
Unless you want a certain peacekeeper to throw a thousand grenades at your house.
Meanwhile I know, but we only have so much time and limited space
It was the first things I had access to in my home!
but anyways
BACK TO THE TABLE
posers, idiots, fools and such do not piss me off
People who dont know how to play a game of Texas hold em
such as
I hope there's a horror movie marathon on halloween.
Who's Such?
elitists, anti casuals, and high ontheirself nerds piss me off
Oh.. Hrm... people doing spaghetti stuff in the name of brony-dom.
Meanwhile: Cabin in the woods
YAY IM GETTING THIS PC! =D http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.mx/MLM-407939838-computadora-pc-nvidia-edition-ultimate-ed-series-intel-gamer-_JM#califications
That makes me flip all the tables.
Best freaking Horror film I watched
^^
HEres me "i win i got 4 aces" "oh yea, i got 3 pairs"
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
cachi01|phone: 10 grand?!
10 fucking thousand dollars
WHAT
10,000 pesos
Lol
(around 6.5k quid)
10,0
cachi01|phone wow, a bit pricy there
Well have fun with that.
Not like you couldn't build one of equal standing for like half the price but whatever.
Dken2021 10,000 pesos id like 1000 dollard
Ohh
Okay
cachi01|phone: hahahaha, you troll!
oh, that's pesos
Xd
So around 650 quid
Hmm, for what it is, I've seen worse.
Check the specs
Its awesome
8gb ram, 1tb storage with a 1gb card and an i5
Crappest bit in there is the GPU
well it says it can run skyrim :3
cachi01|phone: You can run Skyrim on 256mb
anything can run skyrim
But here's the questionL
Can it run Crysis?
oh fuck
I hope so
Let me check
Holla everypony! :)
aloha GilDash|Dinner
Eyyyy
hi GilDash|Dinner
hi GilDash :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECx-42Wlho
I've seen that
Crysis is kind of old, I don't think we should use it to judge computers
everyone seen that
^
EVERYONE
Ohai GilDash|Dinner!
What?
I bet you al lthat I haven't seen it, but I won't click it-
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtgOEXKh7Q&feature=youtube_gdata_player yes it can run crysis
Vivix: You don't understand the joke :P
It amuses me.
cachi01|phone: WOAH
Ah it was a joke
What computer are you using!?
Vivix: its called Metro 2033
I ran Metro on pentium 4 6800gtx
In it's time, Crysis was way way to demanding for even the bestest computers back then
I also ran Crysis on pentium 4
Serenity that isnt me lol i just searched for a gameplay of crysis with that graphic.card
So the quote was, if it could run Crysis, it could run anything
i dont have a pc ATM
I think I also ran GTA 4 on pentium 4, games just aren't very good at judging power of computer anymore-
DAT POST
of course the big difference visually is on the gcard
Oh my god, Shizuka. That Demented Cartoon Movie Reference. Why are you so awesome? :$
13took you long enough..
13blah
Shizuka: whats ur fav kind of muffin?
Hm?
Shizuka: I was not at the computer :P
The kind that asks pointless questions.
wow Shizuka you projected your voice through Meanwhile you are good
13favorite muffin

Shizuka is best ventriloquist
And Meanwhile is best Scarface :D
Never seen that movie.
I'm back

Meanwhile: the Batman Scarface
Now lets play a game.
Extreme confused spider is extremely confused. The little bastard just keeps running back and forth on my wall.
Not sure if I should reak out with him or not
Is there any stream?
freak*
Oh right, the dude with the puppet.
Barbetos|AtWork: Leave it, he's keeping those flies out
^
Shizuka: Are you busy atm? :S
leave the spider alone, it's your bro
Oh I did not plan on killing it
^^^
Never seen batman either-
13not particularly
Up for some TF2 of some description?
You should stream Atlas Shrugged.
I just think its acting strange for a spider
It's probably disoriented.
13i really should
stream geometry wars. << >>
Vivix: one of Batman's minor villains is a guy called the Ventriloquist that is bullied around by his puppet Scarface, who's an old style gangster
Aah
Geometry Wars?
Everyone knows the best minor Batman villain is Calendar Man.
anyone here that can do french?!
N.
No.*
Mope
I can do the French guy from the Holy Grail, does the count?
ill keep asking until someone shows up
that*
Je ne parle pas francais excuser moi
Calendar Man is meh

we need to get the Exorcist streamed up in here
That would be great. :D
the scariest movie ever
I'd still like to see Battlestar Galactica being streamed ^^
Cabin in the woods would be epic to stream
I found the mid to end hilarious
Exorcist isn't that scary.
Meanwhile: well i never seen it
^^
saw
>Scariest movie ever
never saw it
>never seen it.
Wat.
hehhehe
Meanwhile: i forgot to add the "supposed" part to it
It's more creepy than scary, IMO.
So are most horror films tbh.
Most horror films are only scary with jumpscares
Couldn't agree more.
In fact actually being scared by a horror film is something that only tends to happen when you're 12.
ja
Jumpscares aren't even scary, they're startling.
^
^^
jumpscares are hilarious
Want a really scary movie? Watch The Leprechaun.
Want to watch a scary show?
*Sarcasm Detected*
Something happens that's gross or unsettling and sure maybe you feel weirded out, but very little that appears in a movie actually inspires fear.
Watch Jersey Shore
or better yet, Leprechaun in Da Hood
^ :D
Fuck that movie.
what we need is a movie that makes u scared for reals
not jumpscares
How was Mirrors? Has anyone seen it?
that gets in your head and makes u legitimately hard for you to sleep at night without a machine gun
Bronysith: Kinda impossible without the film making the people release adrenaline and get the proper feeling they're fucked
It's gonna need 4D to get to that :3
http://imgur.com/r/funny/oiFR1
It's very hard to be genuinely scared by a movie, especially when you're not alone.
ja
^^
the only thing that can actually get you really scared are experiences
That's why 4D (interaction) are best choices
And unless anyone wants to invest in some sort of elaborate prank where we knock someone out put them in a mansion and all hide across the place disguised as zombies that's not likely to occur.
Haven't seen a lot of 4D material lately.
Meanwhile: Sounds like a plan! XD
^
Meanwhile: how about making some guy think hes buried alive?
One day, I'd love to go in a haunted mansion playhouse thingy and open a door to find a http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvGGlySZymE
That's more likely to incite a panic attack and or soiled trousers.

13also notice the headlines can't actually say anything concrete about rearden metal, they're just fearmongering
13i can't wait til part 3 to see what they do with the superweapon
Kurra: It's basically CAPITALISM IS GOOD! The Movie
Shizuka: it's the butter-margarine ware all over again
13(because yes there's a superweapon in atlas shrugged)
Shizuka: toxic titles? :D
btw what movie is this?
AKA BIOSHOCK, ONLY BORING!
^^^^^^^
13bioshock, only actually based on the source
MadSurge, I don't really haet on capitalism, but I *do* keep from swinging gasoline trucks at the hornet's nest, then
ok im back
/me is falling asleep on the keyboard
hiiii
...So... when are the plasmids gonna come in?

StinkomanFan: if only
playin minecraft you guys
Shizuka: what's bioshock supposed to be based on?
minecraft?

this
No fire being thrown out of there hands? At least Crime and Punishment had an Ax murder!
cookin me some iron
13bioshock is loosely based on AS, rapture is an analogy for galt's gulch
ah
13the similarities end there though
Nope, it's all about idiotic politicians and Ayn Rand's author avatar
what's galts gulch now?^^
Michael , I... http://derpy.me/jd4fM
haha
Spectrum_Rush: http://derpy.me/yQdgh
13the premise is that the world's producers are suddenly vanishing
whats this shi
I'm not a fan of that artist'sstyle
sp..... they'r all disappearing to galts gulck, aka rapture?
13sort of
oi
13it's hidden in the rockies, self-sufficient
this movie seems only to be about lawyers.
?
/me goes pick up a filter
Ghost_Nappa:
hello nappa
hii
13bioshock's rapture diverges from the morals of atlas shrugged in that no one in rapture has the slimmest grasp of economics
This is why Bioshock was considered a classic but Ayn Rand's just considered a preachy bitch
we are comparing a book to a game
13because economics is overrated?
Shizuka: literally
i wish we had more smart people in economics
13the problem with rapture is the merchants drive prices up simply because they can (which is what the game wants you to walk away with)
wats this
Hey guys , what are we watching?
yeah wat are we watching
Because the game is fun for everypony but Ayn Rand is dull for everypony
Atlus Shrugged Pt 1
And everyone thinks for themselves, thinking they can go on without cohesion between the various economical parts of the city
13in reality, a price that's too high would drive your market away to competitors
ohai Obsidian
13MadSurge: you've never seen patterns emerge in nature have you..
Shizuka: mmm?
13thing is, if you act in your own self-interest, you're more likely to take action that indirectly benefits others

13rearden is out for himself making his metal, which will make him quite a lot of money
13in the process, people that buy the metal get a damn good product
AJIsAwesome: 3DS friend codes?
Hold on a second.
Shizuka: this movie, however seems more realistic than Richie Rich...in that film, it was said that if the enviroment is safe, the job will be easier, and there will be no mistakes. Did any character did any mistake here?
13the problem with rapture is the merchants driving prices up didn't bother to consider that would start impairing their business
13a competent business will charge you as much as they can but not a penny more, else you'll go somewhere else
My point is, regardless the safety of a job's enviroment, THERE WILL BE MISTAKES, even when not intended
13yep
so what is this movie
I thought the problem was because Ryan forgot to cut off connections to the surface.
13there's probably that too
hii
Shizuka: I mean that everyone in rapture thought they could be capitalists, without considering that they need people to build/repair/clean stuff
13point is bioshock takes an extremely narrow view of "acting in your own self-interest", ignoring the fact that your self-interest includes not dying
llooll
cmon AJ u almost ready?
