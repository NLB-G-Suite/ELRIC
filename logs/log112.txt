Dari, we have figured out how magnets work
if you think that song is amazing just wait till you hear an interview with those guys
Lolwut
they're really dumb
That is not right. This is wrong.
whoa
only 4 peeps?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8D3xnRoSnk
now 5 :P
Hey Daz.
i'm a little : / rite now.
Me kicking everyone.
Clearly I'll have to take a different approach.
Our IRC has changed.
Refresh the page with F5.
ohay guys
Hey.
Now it's just me and ChanServ in the other channel.
Okay, cool
OK,I REFRESHED
and hay Daz, I saw
which truth be told was really bad except for two voices...
RANDOM VID:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPJUBQd-PNM&feature=related
Is this right? Did I refresh the page? :0
Everyone's in the right place now.
Which pics, Daz?
the ones i showed u about Toys R Us with the RD/rainbowflash and FS/daisydreams pics.
Not sure I saw them on EQD...
oh yeah
that was anoying
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXgZkY-OFjE&feature=related
It might be a trap.
That's pretty cool too, Daz
server has changed
No.
o_o
I don't wear hats.
/me looks around
Is it safe now?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL2HafxlRw4&feature=related
You're on the wrong server.
irc.bronyserv.co.cc
Go there.
If you're using mibbit on the site, you still haven't refreshed the page.
I see
good luck with that Daz :P
MAY I-
HI
Alright i've heard enough.You got the job.
No
eeeenope?
because I wasnt here
:)
No.
3So is this where all the awesome comes?
orly?
i just came on right now and i was fine
Refreshing does work.
I know, because I tested it.
I've seen it, his acting was more wooden than the dolls in that episode.
o u

BAM
THERE IT IS
I tried hard refresh, and it didn't work. Probably is highly dependent on browser and version.
probs
Refresh harder.
do a hard refresh AKA reformat
Refresh deeper.
:P
a refresh within a refresh
Some people aren't going to be able to just come right back after a refresh, was my only point.
GUYS
GUYS

Hmm, pony meetup in the UK.
Birmingham.
XD
Been listening to this all day http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFWpr_wkgV8
Go dari
Both are great, I think
All very good songs
I try to listen to Makkon quite a bit
Not sure I've heard any of that
OF COURSE!
Oh yeah.
idk where birmingham is lol
And the chanting
daz?
Through the Eyes of another pony?
eyup solthas =]
Yeah. I like his name.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sonic-rainboom.jpg
Birmingham makes sense for a UK meetup, I guess...
Pony Out!
(Punch Out!)
lol DecapKing
huh no reaction from Dari
(and yes. Oatmealation is totally a word.)
well, solthas, Dari is both a mod, and a techwiz. too bad he's also semiafk.
I don't understand the picture.
That makes me sad... because I'm going to try it anyway. I just need to find where wf.msc is...
Darius, have you heard of a videogame? :P
charecter from Street Fighter
All I know is his theme goes with everything.
I don't play street fighter.
I think they're pretty boring.
I guess you tried every browser you can think of to see if it was browser-related.
Huh?
Tried another browser?
Ok.
Ohey now we're here. Cool

/me tries to brush his molded ponies, but fails
Lawl silly pony
. . . And it says, for the https, by the way, (It says "The server's security certificate is not yet valid!" by the way, which leads me to think that there is something wrong with the certificate validator on my computer, whatever that is.)
(bad grammar there)
05prince-dari
05i think i fixed it
well, solthas, we have a mod in the room, but hey, since when did mods help out nonmods as much as nonmods help nonmods?
A lot.
Daz, the mods help the non-mods they are the most friends with.
DecapKing: 25+ seasons, 6 series
^I rest my case
(series being the seasons of the 20005 comeback)
exactly
wikipasta: "26 (1963–89) plus one TV film (1996) "
damn thats a lot
xD
20,005 lawl
The main character has been portrayed by at least 11 different actors when not counting the non-canonical episodes with other actors
BEAN
hehehe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_8FEjV6pBo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qS0odekuU
If you can name all those actors without using Wikipedia, then I'm impressed.
"4, no, 3
oh, the doctors?
Yep.
not here
He thinks there was a network split.
or something
I suppose.
weird...
I'd prefer to be on Fluttershy :(
Yeah... but how do we get back...
i'd prefer to be on with people I know.
yo
Same here, Daz
it's still not finished, i guess
Yeah, we did.
Ahh
The servers here aren't synced.
Yeah, it's working now.

[20:03] -rainbow-dash.bronyserv.co.cc- (sync) Possible negative TS split at link rainbow-dash.bronyserv.co.cc (1315163021 - 1315163031 = -10)

oh hello there
Now it is.
k
Everyone needs to reregister their nicks of course.
D: can't /server here?
ffs, i cba to open up mIRC
Never tried.
Please don't choose one of the servers.
I do.
why can't I join the other mane6 servers?
But it put me on a split server
Daz: They don't exist
We only have two servers.
Yes.
Not exactly.
>Current Global Users: 31
>Max: 31
I don't think we need 6 servers yet.
yeah Nittany
Not sure our 2 servers can handle 4000+ people.
Hmm.
(just my opinion)
05back
05ok
05so
05prince-dari
And then BOOM
Wish my ISP would allow me to run a server.
Yes?
dari
05its working? :3
But I couldn't hold many people on a 15Mbps connection anyway.
I have an idea
Well, 20
Nittany: but 20 Mbps is rather high
>Can't hold many people on a 15Mbps connection
My upload is 1mbps.
I'm hosting a server.
05shall i join there instead then?
:P
Mine is 3.
that said
Dari
Ok then.
Yeah.
brb
to host the server(s)
That way you and Sathi could stream and not worry about the servers
How are you today man?
There's a reason I'd rather not do that.
05okie
well, it's probably not a good idea
but should push come to shove, we should consider it
yeah, no GR Saturday Night till S2
we'll make up for it that day though
the GL Movies + Mazinkaiser SKL
I'm on fluttershy
hmmm
05im banned :o
Oh yeah IDK if you heard
fluttershy.bronyserv.co.cc ?
Yeah.
but if you have an Android/Windows Mobile/iPhone
but I was moved to dash?
Bye Daz :'<
It's just that S2 preparation has taken all of my free time, which is really sparse
>mfw searching for Eureka 7 on that website gives me BOTH EUReKA and Eureka 7 to watch
bai Daz
http://www.letmewatchthis.ch/watch-5142-Eureka I remember this show being hilarious

And I can control it from anything with a remote terminal.
I also remember this show that I'll need to convince Sathi to stream someday: http://www.letmewatchthis.ch/watch-5117-Chuck
hehehehe lawl Dari
Ooh, Eureka.
*flashes*
Good show when I remember to catch it.
05ok

It's widely used on gaming communities
Zephir: XSplit's propietary broadcaster won't achieve my NewOCD quality and optimizational standards
ohh I see
NewOCD. XD
:P
also keep in mind VHScrCap is basically the standalone, screen capture software used by XSplit
Since the XSplit Company bought Hyemeloff Labs
really? I had no idea :O
6Hallo DecapKing~
Like:Ú\;cµÈÃ
I just suggested it because I have little to no troubles streaming with good quality out of a 1Mpbs upload
also it was just because
I take Adderal
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
05there
oh
I do know that Ritalin fucks one up
my brother had to take it due to ADD
Ritalin didnt work for me at all
05pony?
Which I suppose is the coding that would run the program
lol
wanna know the greatest irony, though?
i acted like i was on crack when i was little lol
i have ADHD

how can you guys enjoy a story like that D:
I can't understand it
I finished 36 chapters of FO:E in like 12 hours
.-.
i read 36 chapters of FO:R in around 6 hours
No you didn't DecapKing. You do not qualify for the element of honesty.
i could though
Yeah...but you wouldn't actually have read it...just skimmed.
I can read that fast.
My damn SAT score is 2160-2300 and I was reading at a college level when I was in 6th grade!
http://miburl.com/VDdMvs Have a comic
i was reading at a collage level in 5th grade
Yeah...sure....

which should be about as long as past sins
i never read harry potter
and i dont kill
i only maim
I read every harry potter book by my self.
i dont like harry potter
Finished the last one in under 14 hours
I think I read Past sins in... 12 hours? I think 10 hours
though I read until 18 and then I read 19-21 when it was out

Earlier today,Pinkamena and Fluttershy tried to murder me.So i was thinking that if i was to get my revenge,i would need some help.ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH PONY TO HELP ME GET MY REVENGE?
Got shit working
13Dang backspace.
/me brohoofs Denied_Existence
hehehehe
I have the best answer to a HW problem in front of me.
And then i bought some T-Virus.
dari
...
13Can we now?
No T-Virus?
Well i have the T-Virus vial.
I thought I did
O_o
Hmm.
13I was told it was down.
You registered it.
13So reregister now?
Yeah.
[01:24] -ChanServ- AOP list for #bronystate:

dari, anything else I need to do or...
Hmm
13Should be good to go now.
O.O
4I was forced to leave #BronyState
4lol
I can unregister the nick anyway.
I see
13Am I good now, Dari?
13Okay, cool.
You can drop a nick if you own it yeah.
4And I'm good as well?
Yeah.
4Alright
I lost ops
woo
...
GGgala, you broke something.
...
Tab fail.
...I did?
[01:31] Tab fail.
13:P
oh, that kind of tab
0...Wha?
I did that
the first time
Coincidentally, I never received an email
Was I supposed to?
Meh, it's because you're identifying when you're already on the channel.
WELP
I have to change a setting in services for you and reboot them.
:P
/me has no idea what's wrong
I'M SORRY OKAY
gtg guys,seeya tomorow
Why?
IT'S UNNATURAL
4Is the script on?
4Oh
It is.
4I guess not
4...???????
Along with all the other mod's names.
4Then why am I not being warned
0It wasn't on earlier today actually.
4But I'm not ops currently
It checks if you have either a mod's name, or if you have ops.
4so
No warning.
4oH
4Oh
4Well
I thought that'd be the best system.
Rather than just one or the other.
/me 4waits for dari to solve Ghosties' problem
/me 10is back
4So
4Dari
I can also give the services pony names if people want.
4any closer to figuring out what's wrong
Nothing's wrong.
4Then
4wat do i do
I just have to change a setting because YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
:P
4*to a tee
4*orders
If I did specify, then you'd be doing it wrong according to my specifications.
:P
4Whatever
4Just fix it
4Please
Default is 20.
I'd say...5
I do.
there was one just now...
Then in 30 seconds it'll appear.
That was at 22 minutes in the hour.
oh
Standard for everything if it can take the strain of S2.
hehehe
/me cheers
oops
I've done that a few times today myself.
Are you keeping the concurrent channel limit to the standard 10, dari?
MFW the standard was 20.
:P
I'll probably change it to 10.
Maybe you're thinking of a different service.
We're using Anope.
More like Eeeenope.
:P
I just realized something. If this room has a user cap, then how would one get to the other rooms during the S2 streamings, assuming that not every room is full, seeing as this page just leads to this one?
Have a high user cap.
Until slots open up.
0But aren't there going to be multiple rooms though?
Maybe, but they can't communicate between each other.
/me loads his revolver with ServerPiercingRounds.
0Off-white? It looks the same as everyone else's to me.
for(i=1; i = # of rooms; i++) {if(usercap = 1) {msg "/join room i}} (pseudocode).
0Sorry if it's actually different.
I can't see it at all unless I highlight it
I don't know if a script could be written to do that.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0Well, time to log in then out again.
I can't tell at all.
It looks exactly the same to me...
Wait are you ALL using mibbit?
Yesh
Well, I am.
Oh fuck
I am using mibbit at the moment.
Time to get out of here, sorry
I don't generally.
...........?
Wait, what's wrong with mibbit?
/me shoots Doku with a ServerPiercing .44 magnum round!
ello
There is nothing wrong with mibbit. I just prefer using a separate client for IRC. More features.
Hey Synros.
Looks like we did.
nice
Oh, it's still posting in the other channel.
we need to get some streamin up in hereh!
07sorry i'm a little too busy tonight
oh well I can wait till House
are we starting S3? or on 2 still?
I think we finished season 2.
PONY MATH:
∆C=(R*c)-ç
R=Amount of RD's Present
c=Coolness constant (aka 120%)
got rid of Mibbit?
Yup
Grad(D)/(eps*mu) + div(v) = I forget.
Was just checking out how to connect to multiple servers at once.
I'm on 4 servers right now for 4 different networks.
And I've done multiple servers for the same network before.
It's not hard.
I'm guessing that you can't do it on mibbit?
07please don't do that
No, it isn't. I just hadn't needed to do it before.
07just connect to the mane.irc url
Oh. Ok.
There really is no need except during network splits.
Which don't last very long.
I've only got one connection to you guys Luna. Connected to a completely different network for something else.
07great, thanks
I apologize if I'm being rude or anything Luna, but do you have any idea when you'll start streaming House tomorrow?
Glad tomorrow's Labor Day. I can watch some House at home.
Still have to grade papers, though.
I really hate the terrain around State College. It kills storms.
Going to get some Asian food, yum
She keeps making low growling noises.
07hmm
She used to never do that.
07she be back
07see?
:3 Da magicks~
She was logging in and out with different name. :p
:)
College
College students don't get labor day off :P
I do.
Man... that's unfortunate.
If I want to take time off.
I get Columbus Day off, though.
I sorta do. I also have tuesday and wednesday off for some weird reason.
US colleges have crappy Fall vacation schedules.
Columbus day off?
Semester doesn't start until the 8th for some weird reason.
I thought that was considered a racist holiday and removed from existence.
It's Labor day, 6 weeks of constant classes, then Thanksgiving break.
I don't mind that much classes in a row
Well, you have to factor in HW.
I ended up needing a fifth year. >_>
I had to take 15 most of the time.
As well as internships each year (my school requires a 140-hour internship for each year you're there).
How many credits do you guys need overall?
It wasn't my academic skills that forced me to have to take an extra year. It was credit screw-ups.
For a bachelors, you need 120
Mathematics
Ooh.
One of the "hard" ones.
OH RIGHT
Labor Day.
No classes.
Forgot 'bout that.
hehehe
Next semester I'm taking Geometry, Senior Seminar: Graph Theory, and Physics II
Yup
Most classes are 3 Credit Hours, while lab sciences are 4 (as well as Calculus)
Hahaha RD flooding the Nyaatorrents chatbox

13Ooooh, that pisses me off a bit...
9awesome
huh
9notify me when it's there
9in order to train ya
cool.
13Because they voiced her in that little project.
13I'm the names creator.
07^bitch? you?
13lol :P
13I MAD!
9something about a person's identity
9being defined by how society treats them
9most of the time, when a "female" identity is imparted into a male subject
07yes?
9then they gave us an example related to our indigenous population
lol, took me a bit
>mfw i got disconnected and lost all my adminz
9one of our Indigenous Tribes over here, the Kunas, have the greatest percentage of male homosexualism, ethnically speaking
9this is due to the matriarchal structure of their society
OH LOOK MAGIC
whoops.
9if the parents never have a female offspring, they tend to raise the youngest male as a "woman", in some ways
OH LOOK MAGIC THIS TIME
9this is due to the fact that women perform vital economic and social tasks in this society
XD
LOL you gave us the censorship mode!
9Panama
/me eyes Polarfire
HOW FAMILIAR
hey, it was an honest mistake.
XD
something about [censored]ake mushrooms
13We kept bitching at eachother. ol
worst wordfilter ever
9so do you
9DOUBLE THE FUN
13Yeah, but I created the name and some of her early traditions.
13Bleh.
Allowing them to do...Anything.
Like RAW commands.
If you get them wrong, you break the server.
It's fun.
9Send them this. http://2.p.s.mfcdn.net/store/manga/891/01-001.0/compressed/krspirits_v01c01p046.jpg

I think just rainbow dash.
for right now.
(I asked earlier)
Mine is Dash.
Wrek's is Fluttershy.
Argh, I feel like I have to create something
Sathi's gunna have Luna.
Instead of just sitting here watching things other people made.
lolwut
>caramel
Y U NO mane6 first?
rainbow dash is stupid
NO U
Because I decided that as a reward for hosting us a server, and wasting electricity money, people should get to decide which pony their server is named after. :P
Lol
10xD
Evenin' everypony.
10evenin':)
How're y'all doing?
07evening
Doing good (but a bit tired)
Heh. I'm doing pretty great
Just listening to some classical pony music
07ohhh I can listen too?
It's on my iPod hun lol
07bah :(
10heh :3
07please do PM me :)
Luna: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DtidBEaQME
Oh
/me could use some music to stay awake
lol
That'll probably put ya to sleep
07oh oh!
07no playlist?
07:(
Actually
I'll make a little download link for ya if I can get it together
07sure
07PM it please
07:)
Everypony's asleep here?
/me 10is /falling/ asleep
07afk / away / sleepy
10I need to get my guitar and play some tunes :<
DONT GO TO SLEEP
Or is it more of a hobby for y'all?
Just one more thing on the pile.
Interview?
I've been feeling happier on the whole, but otherwise it's a bit more of a hobby.
07Actually it has
My answer: I don't know.
Kinda the same with me. Just overall greater happiness and appreciation of the friends I have ;)
It's just a show I like.
It's made me lose a little bit of sleep, but it's not the first thing to do that to me.
9*life
Well, I actually have been posting places more (where I'd have just lurked previously) now that I think about it more but otherwise I'd go with the answer I posted a minute ago.
Things are quite complex for me emotionally.
9but yeah
9well
^ second
Lol.
9not exactly a MORALfag but I try to play nice yeah
Maybe bronyism can help me with my rage issues and introvertedness.
9and I always take other people's feelings into account
I still road rage but that's about it as far as my rage goes.
lol
9because 0r0ch1
I can get easily agitated at things.
Who's he?
Ex: Losing a lot at games. I used to have that under control years ago.
But, again, complications.
alright gonna hit the hay goonight
9also yes I said furfag instead of furry, because "furfag" is the only word that fits him like a glove
Well, a mantra of tolerance can help me tolerate things that irritate me.
9(for the record, I have no problem with furries)
13>comes in and sees furfag...
Eh.
9I wish more people would try that
9that looks fucking amazing
/me 10comes back to dari shouting about people liking things he doesn't like
/me 10scuttles away speedily
I position myself in the middle in this discussion.
Wut?
Yep.
10alos
10also*
Dari hasnt said a thing till now
I haven't been talking...
9here
O_o
9more of them should be like this http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4766915170_7e7b86abe6.jpg
9nah you know me
10you both start with a d, it's called an epic fail typo
10dealwithit :P
9I mention things I don't like but most of the time it's just things that slightly bother me
9it's barely any biggie
13Hey!
Just saiyan.
13Thats Anothrocon!
13*Anthrocon
dari: is there +N on the ircd you used?
Yeah.
13Dem arts.
Meh.
13Uhh, sure. lol
But if you are talking full costumes I find the official stage show ones far more disterbing the the "fursuit" ones.
9I suppose *shrug*
I have to agree.
9I just wish I saw more like this Lionidas
Not sure if something like that would work as well with ponies.
I have a few things that irritate me greatly on both sides of the aisle
9never said it'd work for ponies
9not really, Nittany
9it's just that there are many people in the furry fandom that give it a bad name
10AllisZero it's odd. More people have made the connection between FiM and being homosexual, than being a paedophile. It's odd
10>it's odd x2
10pfft, I can't type tonight
6Here's an idea, let them be whoever they want to be. Don't be hating, because everypony has their good points and their bad points.
10ad that recollection was from my experience*
All fandoms are frowned upon.
It doesn't really matter if it's ponies or sports.
6http://i53.tinypic.com/23lhc42.gif
Football is not a hick thing at all, Odysseus
You'd be surprised how some people view it.
Nascar on the other hand.
Considering that the teams with the most rabid fanbases are all in the North half of the country.
But I say this sort of thing is probably similar to anime fans.
Thought nasscar was viewed as the "hick thing.
(Except Oakland, which isn't really considered "South")
Football can be if you look on sports forums. But yeah, probably not the best comparison.
I did see that CSI ep with furries.
As far as I'm concerned those rules are channel rules, not server rules.
It's as simple as that.
10that was.. interesting
9but yeah
9with a lot of people in the fandom like this http://images.encyclopediadramatica.ch/7/75/Chasevrocket-jack.png
And Illinois
0_o
They don't
Wow. That's....
9it's the most unfortunate fandom on earth
Odysseus: Anything that's not "socially normal", right?
It's that the batshit-crazy ones are loud and memorable, while the sane ones are very quiet
9just on't
9that too
9still
9it's a bit unbalanced.
See HLN
I think I have a post here from someone in the furry community about not wanting their children to go to public schools because their teacher said furry creatures didn't exist, or something like that.
Akin to "my six year old is mature enough to understand Yaoi" I guess huh.
9YEAH
9*yeah
9I feel sorry for the sane fans
this would be a great place to live if it wasn't for all the people.
>_>
9yeah
9luckily
9bronies don't have much in the term of fuckwits
9 0r0ch1 is the closest I've seen
9but that's relatively mild
Religions suffer from extremism as well.
9yeah
9I hate that
Actually, there are older religions.
which is probably whey they are the most extreme.
It's only the most outspoken ones that define us.
Though the various Native American religions may be as old or older.
Scientology!
yeah I was't singaling out any one religion.
There's older ones. Zorastraism (sp?) for example. It may be still in practice.
Zoroastrianism is still in continuous practice
Heheh.
(The reason I was discounting Norse and Kemetic was that they fell out for a long enough time that there were actually zero adherents for multiple generations, though some are going back to the "old ways" as they call them.
/me 10doesn't like to discuss religion
10:<
/me 13doesnt like to either ;)
10;D
It can lead to explosive conversations.
/me agrees.
damn my self defense mechanism to discussions like this, i keep wanting to crack jokes.
I don't mind it as long as it remains civil
On the forum I moderate on, it often does lead to heated debates.
Like the one about variations of the Lord's Prayer
10yeah NT, and a lot of people tend to disagree with me
Well forexample i read that as Ponytheistic for a second.
10so I tend to stay quiet
Well, we have our "extremists"
Because he associated the term with religiously faithful extremists
Like full on "kill the infidels, bomb abortion clinics" types?
We had an Jewish extremist apparently from Israel.
He's perma-banned from the forums now, though.
Isn't it alike though? Can't you think a lot of atheists actually behave like it's their religion?
I'd consider it a religious viewpoint, at minimum
We're on to religion?
And it's perfectly civil.
Yes.
Atheism is fun because in some ways, it is a religion.
It at least has its extremists.
Which surprised me at first.
9we are, Dari
They complain about organized religion but some are very fast to try and shove down their views down everyone's throats, the same thing they accuse religions of trying to do.
9but we're being Civil
9so fret not
9no tables to be flipped here
How dare you call me civil.
>no tables are flipped here
Oh dear.
I get the feeling you shouldn't have said that.
Some don't want to shield their kids from religion.
Some want religious symbols gone from our govt.
It's just stupid.
I actually agree with the latter of those two.

10NT
Makes sense.
13I saw it on EqD and commented. lol
13I'm sticking to cello still :P
13Muddying up the issue~
13XD
/me 10would prefer it to be a bassello
10SPEAKING OF WHICH
Thread derail was good!
It's still totally a Cello
/me facepalms.
CELLO!
Should I have done the AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa thing?
NO YOU ASSFACE DOUBLE-CLOWN, IT'S A CELLO
I finally installed the GreaseMonkey script
9IT'S NEITHER.
10IT IS A BASSELLO
10DEALWITHIT （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
9that might or might not be an equivalent to one of these instruments
Bassxello?
/me 9solved the puzzle!
Just look at it!
10because discussing religion is pointless :P
Just a very large violin.
It's a string instrument!
/me 13plays a cello and violin irl
13Honestly.
13To be honest.
13It was just meant to be close to this or that instrument.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=st9CxveZieg
/me can't play an instrument; dropped out of guitar classes.
13Just look similar to one.
13Yeah, someone tried to explain it and failed. lol
13But the fact of the matter is, it wasn't meant to be a particular stringed instrument. Just look similiar to one.
Night everypony
13Even Jayson said it was a cello, but he didn't really think of it that much.
WOG says Cello, I'm right! Aw yeah!
13It honestly wasn't considered when they put it in there.
13It just had to simply -look- like a certain instrument.
I wish I had that voice
it is kinda smooth is't it.
Mine is lispy
Good voice for radio.
no, should I be?
one of whom it appears is missing...
Therefor, she is actually playing a 6 foot tall violin.
Issue solved.
I wasn't comenting on Sumica's
13As to why its a cello
Actually, of the four orchestral string instruments, the only instrument that is played on the treble clef is the violin
10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RYq-KiKjrM
/me 10can't read music well because he's a lousy musician
10also I vote for the 6 foot violin
13I see now.
They are back up on livestream
13Cello still here. ;)
^ Oh dear
13lol
Finally!
Finally we get a take on Faust!
Octavia's special talent could be playing all stringed instruments
In S2, we get a scene of her playing a beautiful Spanish guitar piece.
woh, 75min of pony bloopers?
13Ugh XD
13And yes
13They discovered some of the flaws, oh no!
You made me think that part four of Allegrezza was out.

10dashite, shit my bad
10I've only just seen that part 3 is out ;3
10but yeah, I liked it xD
Can't wait for more. :D
I'm trying to read fewer incomplete fics
After having a couple that were completely abandoned
I hate it when that happens. :(

07Dat brings back memories...
Wanted to check and see if jumper cables shared a cooldown with the armyknife.
07hahaha
>_>
10some people have crazy hobbies :P
*Yawn*
Dari?
Hm?
Hmm.
Hmm...
Well I like salad quite a lot (salad olivieh is best salad), I like fish (cooked :P), I like rice (not the bland boring kind, tasty saffron rice).
Hmm.
yes, yes....
this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_Olivier
Doesn't really look right.
Hmm.
Well not the way I'm used having it.
That's a lot different from the salads I'm used to.
Looks bit more like this when I have it: http://oysterfoodandculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/394560311_b2890fa692-300x252.jpg
Well no, most salads I have aren't like that.
But that's probably my favourite.
:P
07amhg
07amg*
07lol
Good, now I have something to make for you :D
Hahaha,
6Come on guys, there's a total of 24 possible combinations of those words... work harder.
I like fish... I try to eat lots of fruit and veggies to stay healthy... and potatoes are good :D and I like pasta. And chocolate milk. And soda. And caffeine... >_> which leads into coffee....
I'm good with my contribution.
My list is getting progressively unhealthy...
>put chocolate milk in coffee
:P
Have you tried it?
damn that was fast.
INB4 I write a script to do it for me.
did you read my mind?
:P
Owait
I meant INB4

you know this room is now decrepit correct?
PRIVMSG #chan :Message here
XD
this is my message
this is my message
hmm... PRIVMSG doesn't work...
Well it does on mIRC.
Just you can't see messages you post.
Because of the way clients work.
This is my message.
[06:17] <Polarfire> this is my message
[06:19] <Polarfire> this is my message
oh. /msg works
aaaah.
You just can't see it.

Where as when you use privmsg it sends the message just to the server.
Not you.
Which you got because you are the server?
oh.
interesting.
I feel bad.
Since I'm bumming knowledge off of you.
You feel bad why?
I don't understand.
I don't want you to feel bad. :(
I'm bumming knowlege off of you. Asking you a bunch of more than likely annoying questions.
/me is yawning sleepy

Down with mibbit!
eh. you get un-accustomed to it.
and I think there is a way to change the background.
at least there is in my client.

there we go.
:P
07welcome back :)
eh?
07works fine here
you used /whois <nick> ?
MFW that image.
I like it.
/me actually touched his screen. XD
I use the rightclick on the names in the right bar.
Just curious dari
how did you find that?
Searching for a particular package on a forum.
Hey, how's it goin?
Did't even do any thing that time.
I decided that'd probably not be a good idea.
I hosted it briefly to show a couple mods though.
Can mean a lot of things.
you poor, poor mibbitfoals.
If it's happpening a lot to you then it's a problem specific to you, not mIRC.
:P
Doubt that as it worked fine thought the web version =p
Actually I'd probably still be using mibbit if it weren't for one thing.
(well, multiple things now, but only one thing at the time)
>We version
Web*
IE not software.
07Software caused connection abort interesting
hey dari

As in just size, or make and type?

Yeah.

mIRC likes to randomy drop me and is't telling me why.
13Ick
uh-oh
can you do that dari?
I can, but it wouldn't give that quit message.
13lol
get Xchat. it's full of win.
perhaps they just need to get to know eachother. or i have to go in to my router and play around with it.
Pfft, xchat.
:P
you can get plugins for any language you want besides mIRC :P
*scripting language
>no mirc
>complete and utter fail
eh works fein for me.....
lots of handy buttons and such.
.....why can I not connect to my routers page.
Of course the plugins would be handy if I actually knew how to program.

13You guys are cute <3
Move? I'm not sure. Not that keen on the gun laws, but other than that, yeah it's possible.
Pretty likely work could take me there I suppose.
I feel like I am seeing only half of a conversation.
And yeah, lots of computer jobs in the states
13Something tells me we're all too far away to have lunch together <3
Well Dari is right now :(
Hence me paying you to buy lunch for him.
Because we've been going over this for a while.
And I'm determined for my money to get Polarfire lunch.

Being allowed to own one. :P

Besides I like that this one makes links I can click on.
In my experience, at least.
That being said, I'm not pro-firearm.
Xchat does that :P
Also that comic is hilarious XD
Liked one of the comments, "Angry Sax"
Yeah, but guns make it easier to kill people than knives. :P
Mirc makes links... it just doesn't highlight them.
Pretty sure you can make it highlight them.
>touch it anyway
That's weird.
Right click?
No.
They open. :P
:P
>cannot copy file
THE FUCK ARE YOU ONE?!

Except no one sees my host
I noticed that.
13Hmm
Because vhosts.
13hax0rz
(again, in my experience at least)

The file it couldn't copy is 5.3 GB

Which is the only format PS3 recognises.
>_>

You can't.
I'm running the server.

sorry
We all need ponies in our lives.
I must try this
i r back
Welcome back.
mornin' ponies
it's addicting!!!!
wut? lol
what's addicting?
http://ponyvspony.artix.com/ dat
lol oh okay, yeah
it only lacks the derp
Oh dammit now I'm playing it
the title song alone is of ear wig quality.
idk
oh and fight the highest level ones you can. level is equal to the exp gained.
well cya later everyone.
Laters Synros
cya
just have fun
I am
Blue is Pony Gandi at work
power
Really? I was just swinging it
OH SHI-
Again?
POWER
HOUR
They give you pop-tarts too!?!?!!?
6;-; I can't Sprinklesception on this server... yet.
other players but on auto-pilot
You make like... 20 moves in the time it does one.
sad, ain't it
Exactly!
but what's the boss button....does it take me to the "Like a Boss" vid?
bosses are the things you fight to go to next level.
But if this is for kids, then why there is "Saucy Sailor Skirt"?
How many fights do you get per day?
I think Dai needs to get this song for his trololol-a-thons
no clue =p
Is there any ways to maximize profits from victory to level faster?
fight the highest level ones you can.
and make sure you hit that level up button eaach time you can.
some point I should try the pet things.
Pets are good, otherwise blue orbs do nothing...
lol I am facing myself.
lawl
I got the koala just because it's cute, though... but it does help
wait the pets does something?
Yeah, they use the magic points you get from blue combos
I think it depends...
They do different things
"Little Rainbow Lord"
oki yeah pets help stomp fast
and suddenly I only get lvl 1-2 opponents :(
damn just had a 20 yellow combo
wow...
13These Pinkiequest videos from Seattle are awesome. I want to be apart of it, fun. <3
is lvl 5 possible on the first day?
Let's see. I just reached lv4
Morn'n
and I doubt it, Choco_Taco
if you only fight level 5 ponies, that's 50 * 5 = 250 xp
There are no lv5 ponies... I've yet to see one.
time to do the impossible
found a lvl 5
lol
"Starlight Sugar Sprinkles"
Idoubt it, it takes 650 exp just to go from 4-5
right read ahead then answer >_<
lame. . .
I have changed my mind you all get to watch me play this Thursday =p
Level 5 is nothing but old mares tale.
It's the lv5 in the moon.
without the cool 8-bit bgm?
Exactly
Do I still get the "Power of Love"?
lol
Ok you can keep playing past the 50 battles but no exp, just cash.
7888-8022 Friend code.
oh, that's cool anyway.
5149-6E58 that's mine
10268-65BA is mine
10271-DFE1
not sure if it works.
6SOFN
omg, my first lv5
Ahhhh
well that was esay
*easy
also I was wrong, you get exp but no cash.
I tried to friend you all, but it does not seem to work
ahh
I was supposed to be doing something else, but alas PVP
I try to accept friend request, but it just gives me the "I can has error" page
Yeah i linked it yesterday.
reload again, it did the same to me.
I've reloaded several times :(
Ohey,Rainbow Little Lord
Random question....any tips on painting eyes on custom ponies?
use paint? *shrug*
Have fun.
later Sum
lol
hm?
I connect straight to irc://irc.bronyserv.co.cc/Bronystate
Irc fluttershy and RD are the threw domains there. Yesterday we were on RD
pretty sure the "irc" one just redirects you to one of the available servers
Which removes the hassle...
And Rd was available yday but not now
Doesn't really matter which server it is as long as it works, right?
As to why we're on fluttershy and not RD is beyond me. I'm not that good with IRC tbh
Right
Agreed
Oh please. You would not get me watching Finnish FIM with fiery pitchfork.
Heh
ohay Decap
I don't actually know whether the ones from TV (if they actually air them atm) have the option to switch language. I know some broadcasts have that option, but it really depends on from which channel it (would) airs.
Last battle of the day
Phone day? Phone day.
Ohay ponies!

Lurker=Spy?
I like temps between 10 and 20C
anything else is too hot or too cold to me :P

I go to a grammar school, which is slightly different from normal schools.
It's still government funded.
oh, well i go to a public schoo
*school
Just there's an entrance exam, and certain requirements in terms of grades to go there.
There are 3 kinds of tech you can take.
Electronics, resistant materials, or graphics.
but the schools are have amazing programs for music, tech ed, etc
>Get A* in all 3 coursework pieces for French
>Get A in exam
>Get A overall
FUCK THIS
:P
A star?
ohh. yours is an all boys' school, too, right?
I supppose it's the equivalent of A+ for you Americans.
I guess equivalent to A+ in public schools.

...huh?
Dehumidified the air.
oh.
/me is reformed
/me runs deeper into his hidey hole
wait...
/me is free at last! But still stuck down a hole.
Ok.
The problem being that it is only 17 degrees celcius outside
it is NOT a hot day
/me runs back down into the hole
/me jumps down the hole
GAH. What'd you go and do that for?
Celcius, my sworn enemy.

weren't you just fleeing?
It's been 100-105F here in Texas for 3 months.
Dat high pressure.
6YOU LIVE IN TEXAS?!?!? O:
No
The only fucking problem being that I have to put my computer the farthest away from the cold air because SOMEONE doesn't want me to put it in my room. Due to "sleeping" problems. And due to that I can't cool my fking computer
Not all texans are cowboys, just like not all Germans were Nazis
/me giggles
Been to northern Texas. Quite the place.

I think this should be taking place in silvershipper @_@
oh?
That or RP
There you go, nittany
Thank you.

I feel all toasty warm
Think of the children GGgala

Magic!!!
Hey.

/me is recording this for PlayColt.
.....
Ze Magiks!
I makes them!
/me is erasing this from his memory
/me runs back down in the hole
Don't go to silvershipper herospirit, whatever you do.
/me uses dig
All the talking that goes into the dramatic recording is drying enough. Doing AJ's accent on top, though?
0_o they are getting pretty into it in there...
Nope.avi
wat goin on?
Son,WHY DO YOU HATE ME?
~You wouldn't be in there otherwise~
...wat?
oh okay
Fuck is a substance?
Yes.
'cause I have 3 lbs of son of a bitch I would like to trade.
And some damn.
If somebody had told me in january that I would be watching sexual pony RP, I would have punched them out.
/me heads off to terraria
Lol, herospirit left.
couldn't take all the raep, i suppose.
That was sexual?
I suppose that depends?
I feel like making a quote database for this site now.
Or channel.
And yes, do that.
....wat?
Never built a website before, though. Off to tutorial books!
Or network
Oh ok.
We could still have our own.
Don't remember the url, it was on EQD anyway
There's a pony version of bash.org? It seems like the name would be ponybash.org or something
Okay, 3 sections of Witch of the Westmareland done
Not many people even got the point, seemingly...
The majority of those are show quotes.
There's like one actual IRC quote
Set it up for IRC as well.
Read up.
Well, nothing important I hope
fuck, I read that as "Ponified Doom" and got somewhat excited...
lawl, me too, RP
I did as well.

Welcome back Dari
Thanks
ONLY 3 MORE CHAPTERS!
I have some issues with the stream...
Such as?
Freezing every few seconds, then skipping to proper place
caruso can only act one emotion, and that's the emotion of being awesome
Stream is fine for me
Stream seems fine here.
not looking all the time, but it seems to work mostly fine
I think sometimes this happens to us in EU
My stream is fine.
Ok, there goes my theory out the window... :/
for whatever reason if you saturate you upstream bandwidth it can cause the stream to skip.
that was odd
got terminated there...
same
Same here.
Terminated?
Suddenly bunch of you went "Software caused connection abort"
Oh. Same for me, I think.
...But earlier.

IKR
07but i'm back now!
This is bold
This is not.
Wait...
That was really odd.

I thought it was a celebration of the longest day of the year.
it should be
MFW everyone is in bold, Dashite's two messages weren't in bold.

Anyway, I came in while GGgala was raping him.
15... wat
11There was rape
11So much rape
wow, the reaction
11And accusations of rape
me too
(Pega is my canon father)
Good news everyone!
DARNIT
You just read that in Dr. Farnsworth's voice?
dawwww
i was the only one that laugh at him
15DEM, keep going
i used to have that song
must redownload
And then I learned Pega raped RD, then tried to blame her for abandoning me, which of course I didn't believe since me and RD are both the element of loyalty.
15uh... huh...
thanks Luna for giving me something to do for a few hours
Shit*
Yeah!
07Your welcome

5don't you mean sjut?
11...RS?
Luna, how much House do we have left in total?
5what stories?
before Bones
15he may have meant me
07lots ;)
fffff
5oh...my gosh
10Bones is amazing
5we are herdmind

11EcafFooh
5FoHoeFac!
15tally-ho?
15ah yes
11Please tell me you said tally-ho at some point
15so, this event, a friend of mine put up most of my fee in exchange for playing the beastman 'pet' that she acquired two events ago. It was originally just an item that I had npc'd, but we made it a full character with real player stats and upgradability
/me walks over and explodes
DAT BACKGROUND
You have the same wallpaper as me.
WHY AM I HERE?
Because only you can break the veil of silence that has descended upon us
15His name was Grout, but Maka, her character, named him Mortimer which he took a liking to.
Back to paper grading. Gotta finish them all!
hmmmmmmm
nope.avi
BEST SONG
/me loves 'Art of the Dress' sung by 3rd-best pony.
5so like an exchange student?
/me glomps luna from above.
15heh, perhaps.
/me shoots DecapKing
I simply cannot do the decision of which one of the mane-6 is better/worse than others
15it's not illegal to sell beastmen as they are not citizens
And thats how equestria was made.
/me needs to eventually DL the songs from Vol. 2
5what do beastmen look like?
11Just like worms. They are not citizens.
15pretty much
15Naturally, they are mostly sterile
15never heard of nor seen one
10WhatPayne Rarity and Fluttershy and Applejack genuinely irritate me for some reason haha
5I would imagine it would be hard for them to squeeze icing for cakes
5such a troubled people
15anywho
Not me, at first some came stronger through than others, but each and every one has grown on
0And now, math...?
07:)
0IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
10lol:D
10they suck
10Pinkie_Pie don't let them get me D:
5I thought you were an owned man?
cause it looks like a lot of code
07that was me screwing up :D
0Nuuuuuuuuu
15since slavery is technically illegal. She'd let me go if I wanted to leave
Fluttershy is best pony
The end.
10Ziltoid is just misguided
10don't mind him
0Once sentience is thrown in the mix, I view characters as humans.
LOLNO
15so it was made to appear
However outside mane-6 the best pony...
ill just stay out of this argument by hiding behind Luna
15but it's hazy on whether beastmen are under the terms of intelligent beings or not
...is Luna
15chances are, he won't be called a slave, but he's obedient to her at the very least.
10How can you not see that D:
15so when raymond offers me the job, I slowly backed off from him, looking nervous.
I have the solution for you
0You're both wrong and silly.
@pony Best Pony
6 Best Pony is 14Silver S15poon
Apple Fritter close second tho
/me 13wonders just how much Silver's way of wanting to get dominated and 'bestial fury' plays out in these rp's :P
Worship it
0The best outside of the mane six is Nurse Redheart
interesting pick
10-all- of them? Oh well
best non mane 6 pony is cyclops pony
0O ye gods...
0I have to fight the Queen of Metal
/me 15would never even CONSIDER sexual relations with maka nor her player.
/me 13wasn't insinuating that >.>

0inorite
My remix made it to EqD
Awesome!
Yup
10Flutteryay sick D:
10Which is yours?
10Oh nice
I hope we hear a story from her. ;)
And I got in with Chain Algorithm too!
But which non mane 6 pony I absolutely don't like?
Hopefully, I'll have my first fanfic ever finished by the end of the month
Snails and Snips
I'd be further along in my fanfic if I didn't get sick yesterday...
15they explained using metaphors, along the lines of 'women spread their legs, women don't say no, you can get a room with a man or woman for the night' etc
Cousin's wedding reception
15to which he would reply
15That sound like hard way to stand
15and
I had to make the joke
15and I said "that sound silly, blanket do that"
0It went over my head
/me drop-kicks veil, breaking it into a thousand pieces
0Did you mean about her?
15they gave up trying then
15later on, another person more bluntly said that a brothel is a place where you can pay to get people to have sex with you
11What kind of beast-man were you again?
15I told them "Ooooohhh, that make much more sense. Why they not say that before? ... why have sex in broth though? waste of food"
15I was a fox
5okay, that last line you're just /trying/ to be difficult :P
15i was trying to maintain his youthful innocence and inability to grasp the Common langauge.
/me throws it over the #bunker entrance
15i had everyone laughing at me and my innocence constantly.
15later on, Raymond said he'd like to toss my salad as a different metaphor, and I told him i'm not a plant
5did he not learn the first time? >.>
5hehe, I know
11You sure can act innocent :P
15it wasn't innocence, it was ignorance of the innuendo
11semantics
15wasn't always easy
Daris gonna Dari
Haters gonna Hate
/me gonna explode
15when she'd turn back, there i was
11Sneaky. Like a fox.
5through?
11Hm. Was there much battle?
15there were many battles, but that was later. this is mostly first and second day
15to apologize for scaring her, I gave her a mug, after which i walked away
15when she looked inside, there was a live mouse.
5haha
5did you know that?
15I concluded that she liked the mouse, because "If bad mouse, she eat. If good mouse, she let go and let make more good mice"
Dari's gunna sleep.
For reals.
nooooooooooooooooooez
agh darnit.
nighty dari
Night.
G'night Dari
5how do you signal when you are speaking out of character? or is it that when you enter the rp area you never break character?
Mods asleep! Post normally!
15Jack is typically considered a hardass, many describe him as a Lawful Evil character
15it's best to never break character though if possible
:>
5how do orcs dress?
15green paint, torn up clothes
5you'd think they would buy from a tailor
15Maka wears cut off, old pants, a torn up vest, and an old, stained shirt
Aw... no vids.

5I'm a LN, pretty much by standards and behavior
5with fair LG tendencies from time to time
15h?
11When RPing that is.
15uh... huh?
5saw that one coming
Lol
15alrighty then
11*you lack
Hey Pinkie
5I like LN because my decisions can still be affected by my own moral standing, but I can always lean upon the rules when I need to
Hey Pinkie
Echo, echo
:P
15standard cop is a LN person, law first, justice is a different department
5yeah
Reading Fanfiction
XD
15ah, I'd say fuck the mission, it can wait for a few minutes
11Cleric if available. RPing is weird.
its quiet
Yes, I've been doing work
15it's much easier to RP in a setting where you are doing everything you want to do
...and reading fanfiction :P
5see, there's a fine line between rationale and zealotry
too quiet
15you see and feel every swing, conversations are between real people, and everyone is only one person
Lol

13Prince-Dari, is the channel password viewable by admins?
>mfw there's a MLP:FiM Teamliquid thread
13Or other owners
I'm on the verge of creating one in GameFront.
The channel password is encrypted under the settings I've chosen, as are all passwords of registered nicks, etc.
Not even I can view them.
13I see
I'd likely die, though.
We're not a very active forum.
Hey, Odysseus?

07oh i dont own it :(

15we vary between 5 and 20
07Best friends ever!
15when active, we are normally around 9 or 10
9Ah ok, I get it

7NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
hope you're not a REALLY slow typer

too many chats open at once
and if you are copy/paste
/me heads explodes
07So when does the story start"?
wait
do i get to hurt ponies?
15chances are there won't be on tonight
No
15more often than not, it is a shipping RP between Silvermane and MirthTinker, occasionally a fanfic is written, and various characters come and go through out
15Mmmm?

I'm not sure you want to hear the kind of stories that get told in here Luna. XD
YOU KNOW IT!
13Mhm..
Oh yeah
7nah, ADHD means hyperactivity is included. Probably ADD.
13My main concern is that I tried to change it to something else

15ADHD means either or
7oh?

7Changes nothing to my acute knowledge of the subject
4but i do have ADHD
15^
7eh...
15i have a light-ship starring Silvermane and Rainbow Dash, slightly humorous..
15(all the stories I have either starred me or are disturbingly cloppy)
ya
4how else would they be Silvermane?
15there is also a very good comedic shipper involving silvermane and rarity
Been a long time since I played a shooter that had a superweapon.
15What would be the best website to use for my recreational email?
I haven't played it that far yet.
6Goodnight everypony~ :3

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXHyu5-6NCM
3MirthTinker, if you want we can work on that Trixie encounter later on.
This is the download link: http://www.mediafire.com/?0926uucchod6crk
It is?
indubitably
Alright, goognight everypony
I'm listening to it now
Night everypony
it's my favorite because of it's relatively simple music
but conveys that this is going to be a pretty hard battle
i'll be whistling that all night
10(if you want to comment, feel free)
oh
just got to 4:17
the best part
/me 10A few hours, and two slice of cold pizza later, I find myself in the kitchen with her. She's working on preparing food for tomorrow, as apparently it's an important day. Hopefully I can get a peek at her calender before she asks me about it.
10oops
7(???)
/me 10 Of course, that didn't last long. Nothing against them, but her brother was too aggressive about me being a follower of Celestia, rather than Horos. I mean, I'd convert if it really mattered, but not until we were married or seomthing. Not that it really mattered, I forgot one important factor.
4(carefully?)
/me 10Naturally, I was intrigued by the date offer. After all, she was one of the most beautiful fillies I had seen in years, and that was saying something. I mean, after my fling with that silver-haired, blue bodied Unicorn, i thought it was all downhill, but DAMN if I didn't find myself a looker.
/me 10I did the proper thing, and walked back up to her. I tried to introduce myself, but she said she already knew my name, Pizza Pony. Bucking tabloids... I corrected her, and she introduced herself.
10(lol silly Razyn)
4all ihave to say is
Hi
4bow chicka wow wow?
hello
13Herospirit, I stopped watching
13But I went a registered on their forums with the name Pinkie Pie
13It wasnt taken
13XD
/me 10A multi-colored blur slammed into my side, sending me sprawling. Right into the trash.
/me 10Honestly, the shocking part for me wasn't that it was Dash, or that she had found me. It was that she was a SHE.
10(wow, no comments? I'm surprised)
4( :O )
4(theres a comment)
15Woooow XD
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1mu_ueRfzU
4(i figured it out somewhat)
4(i have a couple of ideas)
10(basically, Derpy said that Silver's girlfriend let her in.)
/me wants pie
4(i figured something like that, or she was stalking him)
13"Woooow"
13That sounded to much like my friend Aaron Stuber..
13=.=

/me 10I stuffed a pillow in her mouth and bodily tossed her through a window. Fortunately, (I guess), it was open.
/me 10 I found myself standing before the matress, the pillow looking like the sexiest thing in the world. I lifted my gaze to my mare. Okay, maybe the second sexiest. With a knowing look, she unceremoniously shoved me onto the matress.

10so did you guys enjoy it?
10later DecapKing

>_>
13yeah, I enjoyed it (the parts I was here for)
13hehe, it's soooo not me there, I'm demure...and sophisticated
but yeah, kinda sucks that there is no possibility for a non-online play
like, playing offline without the possibility of interchanging items with online play
13afk for a bit :P
10okay Tinkerbelle.
Blizzard could easily separate offline and online play characters, but they don't want to.

oh boy
that is one fic I'll totally avoid now
Ever since I saw a comic about pinkie having diabets I've been hating these diseases t_t
I really suggest you read it.
wait
is it good or bad?!
It's good.
It's not like Bittersweet.
you see, I have barely read any fics
let me see... I think I read 5 or 6 up till today
:P
Well, the thing is disgusting and all
but after a few weeks, when you think about it, the writer is really fucking good

I've never tried actively messing with a dream. My dreams are awesome enough as they are.
24/7 Toonami.
Well, a few other things, but mostly Toonami.

ugh, they're playing Home Movies right now
Night.
for a minute there i read that as home alone movies
i wasn't sure why that was a totally bad thing
>_>
I dun believe it.
:DDDDDDDDD
Okay, sleep time.
guys
Don't you think that is overkill :P
It's after 11:30 on the west coast, that's why.
East coast.
eh. Chat's usually active at this time.
What's today's topic?
ponies.
I wish I had a monocle now....
Ponies. Ponies everywhere.
Why is it always ponies with you people?
er, yeah
I'm bad at geography, apparently
anyway, sleep, for reals
pfft. Sleep is for the weak.
No, sleep is for the week
school?
Huge load.....small plate
Tuesday isn't normally that busy
pretty much a rare cluster?
I just have school.
Yup
I only have 13 credit hours this semester (and next semester)
Huh, I'm going to have 14 hours of classes.
Although that's only lectures...
Only 9-11 hours next semester though.
Well, I only need 53 more to graduate, and being on track means I'm done May 2013
Since I have to do yearly internships at this school for 3 academic credit hours apiece, I only have to take 47 more credit hours of courses.
I need 3.0 credits. If I applied to overload I could get that all in this semester, but they don't offer all the classes I want this semester.
Of course, I also need to stay full time, as it's not a commutable distance from my house, and campus living is reserved for full-time students (full time is 12 Credit Hours)
My school isn't fond of internships. :/
Full time is 3.5 credits over a full year.
Conceivably, if I were to add one-to-two more classes per semester, I could be done fall of 2012
But nah
My school does have problems. Too many professors from when it opened that are still there.
And...depending on the professors...that could be spot on and awesome, or downright painful.
If we're on the same train of tought.
thought*
Canadia.
:D
Oh, crap.
I just thought of something.
:D
Bachelors is 120 credit hours
My Little Pony: Majora's Mask
And Luna get a hold of it.
Yeah, we don't measure things in credit hours.
Our classes aren't set up like that.
And then there's lab sciences, where you get a lab as well as lecture for 4 CH, or just Calculus, which is 4 CH due to needing 4 hours per week for the course
College is college.
(When I took my Calc sequence it was MWThF or MTWF
Except calc III, which I took at night, and was TTh, 2 hours each day.
Sometimes.
And Stats, 3 hours per week, 9:30 - 11 Tuesday, Thursday
On the other hand, next semester I have Web Application Development which is 4 hours per week. 4-6 Monday, 5-7 Wednesday.
Because I hate being rushed for breakfast.
I think I'm off tomorrow.
Labor day.
I need to have, bare minimum, 45 minutes to eat and enjoy my breakfast
That was today here
Yeah
College students don't generally get it off.
You guys don't have Labor Day, you have Labour Day :P
Well, Labor day fot the Tuesday/Thursday classes.
:p
<_<
(I actually like some Queen's English spellings, like grey and defence)
Maneovres is just plain weird, though.
Maneuvers?
It's got a weird spelling in Britain
Aha.
manoeuvre
Yeah
And you actually eat breakfast? :O
Where you just can't take a break, and there's not enough hours in the day to do anything worthwhile.
I generally take the extra sleep time over breakfast.
/me prefers the US version because it's one syllable less
Aluminium*
?*
Marzai: In the US, it's Aluminum
I know that. I'm a U.S. kid
:D
Anyway, I need my 6 hours of sleep
I'd need to wake up too early if I wanted to eat breakfast.
I need at least 90 minutes of awake time before I can eat anything.
I can get up at 6:30, shower, dress, and head to the dining hall
As long as I don't start reading any ponyfics.... >.>
:p

i dunno, but we also have three that aren't just us, for a total of 13 XD
I have 15 >_>
hmm... dari is afk?
dari's in 15 >_>
but two of them are mod channels
aww, but dari never sleeps at a reasonable hour!
it's only 5:30am there!
eh?
(i tire out unexpectedly too, remember? XD)
oh.
I am a little sleepy today. but I have homework.
I might just get up early tomorrow and do it.
okay that gives us an hour :D
:D
if only mai waifu was here also
yeah, i was hoping he'd be too
I think they want commercial reliability before season 2 starts.
and netsplits everyone
weird. streamers must be busy.
Someone is buying commercial servers/space soon. They are switching to that.

actually I don't think its a mod that's doing it.

lol, nice
maybe someday we get something official
it's just the music and the near constant 1-up sfx
i kinda thought it would actually be bloopers, too, not animation misses and things that weren't defined properly in the show bible.
Well, isn't that just one kind of blooper?
9 times out of 10, it's kind of forced
well, i mean it is then either forced or it's something that happens during voice recording

you beat me to it, HotCocoa… :-/
because some people don't want to play games?
Nashy: I never said all OS's were equal, I just said OS wars are pointless because there's nothing that can't be done on any OS. That doesn't mean it doesn't take effort, and that all OS's have their strengths and weaknesses.

Sorry, guys

I hate recursive acronyms.

The developers clearly suck at naming.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAURaLmgMWo
Hi
YEAH
now guess
which episodes did i download?
All of them.
ALL OF THEM?
you are both wrong!
Allllllll the episodes. All of them.
i downloaded:
dowload ALL the episodes!
griffon the brush off
and
Swarm of the century
and
wait, let me check
download ALL the episodes?
and the zacora one
why?
BECAUSE
they all have awesome pinkie moments
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cJSke77GPc&feature=related
Amazing that people actually paid to watch Transformers.
yeah no kidding
The first MIGHT be excusable.
dude
ill cut you
I saw it for free though.
Hi
Good lunch
Lol
XD
but ill cut nashy and iks
Right.
i watch it for the cars
i saw it 4 (!) times, and there -is-nothing-you-can-do-about-it
Hello there everypony!
No accounting for taste.
Was making muffins...I blame Pinkie for it.
that reminds me, I should probably eat something...
it's TheSonicRainboom :O
Haro RP
and if yes, which one?
like the one rainbow dash did which got him killed?
...you mean her?
And I'm not getting it because it's already an outdated piece of hardware :p
Droid Bionic
oh gosh, yeah
even though i know shes a she
thats the power of the first impression
I think it like this. Mane 6 = girls
lol not nearly as outdated as my phone, though
i still think they're genderless
99% girls
everyone in equestria is female unless otherwise specified
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MY4nNdetOdp0lssuFjrIm6356lflFBrFlWheF21XgSg/edit?hl=ro
I've never assumed the wrong gender for any ponies.
Colts = males, have a more square face
Oh, man, mine either. It's a first gen droid phone, it was low-end at the time they released it
Yo, dari
mine too... I want one that's 2.0 at least
The thing is that next month they're releasing phones with 50% stronger specs than the Bionic
SOMANYPONIES
Snips and Snails don't.
D_D
...
Damn.
?
i dont think they all have scare faces
*square
Pinkie brainwashed me with her songs D:
lol
Guess because Snips/Snails haven't gone through puberty or something.
the same happened to me, sonicrainbooom
well, some faces are ambiguous
I'm dropping Verizon too as soon as I can, I get horrible reception around here
just look at the wonderbolt poster in ep..1, i think
yeah... though I never spend that kind of money on a phone either way, lol
And throw parties to solve any problem.
Yeeeeah I never did either, but I was ready to if it means having something worthwhile for two years
Par-TAY!
You just eat 'em!
you do the poney pockey
official fanon? now you're confusing me...
Default assumption among the fans
Or Colgate/Romana
...not again.
THIS IS ALL HER FAULT
rainbow dash is gonna pay...
You gotta do the cooking by the book
Step 2: Play with wings
Step 3: Bitcher wings
i'd tie them down first
Is it that time for Pinkamena's Law?
Step 4: Snap Wing Bone and rips it off
Is it bad I caught myself saying "Good evening, gentlemen" in Joker's voice twice already today?
i hate the fanfic
weren't those names used by the animators, or something? the pac-man names, I mean...
:3c
kill yourself
It doesn't look PG to me...
I hate all fanfics
I just skipped it with "That's not Pinkie. Pinkie wouldn't do that."
I mean REALLY tame.
And tadah, no power.
Infact you can't convince me that a single good fanfic exists
I spent more time laughing at the organ puns.
Except maybe that 48 some chapter Earthbound fanfic
i like them both
The puns were the best part.
and therefore a fanfic, no?
Haha
I like the show-accurate fanfics.
Hi all
and i dont intent too
Well, I liked "Tough Love".
And I mean "all" as in everyone
as in, gore and shipping
I'm honored anyway. Haro Barry
Nashy, it was about Rainbow Dash failing her Wonderbolts tryout
ohay Barry
Oh, no shipping?
How are you, AiZ?
and you, RP
I'm not into that kind of things..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyQlryTt-0
[13:08:11] <Nashy> I like the show-accurate fanfics.
No such thing
that's exactly why I don't read fanfics
User_7233: that always scares the shit out of me
lol
Actually, there are a few.
because there might be something in it that you enjoy?
Fanfiction is all about imagination
Meh.
I find it insanely hard to believe that there are fans out there with the ability to stay show-accurate, in character, and on par with the show's writers.
>imagination
I don't know why I end up reading the ones under 'Sad' more than 'Normal'
>write in an already established universe with already established characters
:P
honestly, saying things like "i haven't ever read a single fanfic because they're all bad", i just stupid
I like crossovers
could be worse, fever's starting to die down i think. kinda hard to tell when you're on antipyretics, though. how u Barry?
i dont think they are all bad
Fanfics by default are bad though
*is, not i
i just dont care for them
Dang, sick?
and i really dont want to read shipping or something..
shipiping is cute
nah, i dont want to read them at all
din't forget the Metro 2033 one
whats the point?
I havn't read a single pony fic nor do I intend to
don't*
because "shipping" applies to anything
same as psychickid
shipping is wierd, it has nothing to do with boats.
hm, there might be ship ships
oh gob
Written by a 12 yearold girl
I had to wash my eyes out with bleach
well, 'm gonna go to #Study since there's a lot of FF hate here
i don't hate ff
Think they were all pretty close to the show.
EEYYUUUP
i think there was one
i'm really not sure, though
as in twilight the books/movies
Hey, i'm not saying you can't dislike fanfics. Just saying you could be surprised.
/paraspite
Has he/she read all fanfics?
someone link poor 7233 to Episode 3, 4, or 16
I dislike fanfics that don't stay close to the show.
no, he means like... racist against fanfics
i suppose there's nothing wrong with disliking the concept of fanfics
Thought it was average, not good.
not at all, but it's still fun :P
And that is was lacking in some areas a lot.
>missing my point
I have to ask him for his reasoning as to why they're all bad.
Psychic, you could always heed Pinkie's advice
I can't remember.
yes, there are worse, but you know, don't like, don't read, which i'm sure you do
"Oatmeal? Are you craz-"
I havn't read a fanfic in...
6-7 years at least
Go for A Shower of Stars
Sturgeon's Law
Again, mostly due to reading the ones that seriously screwed with my head
hmmm, might be time for some ponies
90% of everything is crap
Yeah, they all have RD
then how can you know you dislike FiM fanfics?
@ponytimemeter It
Because it's left me with a permanent impression that all fanfics by their very nature are bad.
94%
exactly
whether or not something is "good" can be both ob/subjective
good enough for me
that's only prejudice then
bad meaning poorly written? stupid in concept?
Of course it's prejudice.
Both, actually
Good is subjective.
:P
Man I hate making these decisions
Why are we singing pinkie pie songs again
no story is good, though, if all of the characters are mutilated (figuratively) and the actual writing sucks
I don't know, just felt like it.
Why aren't we singing Pinkie Pie songs?
What's more cost-effective, have our director of marketing with an old laptop that could give at any moment and just buy an extra battery
But Granny Pie said to me that wasn't way to deal with fears at aaaaaaalll
Or spend $2300 on a replacement
She said Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
and snortle at the clopfics?
chortle at the clopfics*
i do something else to the clopfics
I'm over the depression that those fanfics sent me into
Oh, you cad
!clop
I... IGNORE DEM. lols
Damn, I forgot the lyrics.
But I just can't pull myself to read fics anymore
if fanfics send you into depressions, you're probably taking them too seriously.
I was like 13-14
The group of Best Young Fliers sidefics had a distressing bit in it.
I was a retarded kid
let the kid be; he had his life-changing moment and he lives well nough without fanfics lol
depends on how old, and how much it's holding him back
kid meaning PsychicKid, then lol
>CMC fic
>nothx
if only I could make those decisions at work... we might not be in such a financial mess
Luna watching CMC was A Year to the Day.
Which was also good.
computers from the 90's... just... wonderful
Luna watching CMC was adorable
PsychicKid, whenever someone writes Rarity with excessive italics I want to strangle the author
I hope there's more Luna in season 2
and more Trixie
/me DAAAAAAARLING.
it has been confirmed
Rarity's voice actress is brilliant
yea I read that interview
for months
@Xiagu *guitarsolo*
I hope season 2 is as good as season 1
This isn't whining, THIS is whining!
NMM's voice was amazing though.
Rofl, wow
Or was it "I'm not whining, i'm complaining."
all 3 seconds of it!
TheSonicRainboom, both
All two lines!
Sniffle* I missed you too
It's 4 years old, not a bad machine considering how old it is
Substitute Harmony is wonderfully messed up.
well she was only banished to the moon for a thousand years
they're two different entities by canon
I wouldn't exactly call that getitng away with it lol
You have a point there.
Maybe I should write a fanfic
Luna and Celestia after episode 2 -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG50WsGMLYs
But we still have the whole send 2 tickets -> know she has 5 friends dilemma. Help?
write a fanfic about why you hate fanfics :P
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/6169
>_>
But if you write a fanfic, wouldn't you have to do it with eyes closed?
Not exactly a possession, but her transformation was caused by an external force
That's not difficult
Otherwise you'll end up READING a FANFIC!
and why Luna had a similar size but reverted back to little pony mode
Did people get mad about the Pound Puppy thing? Don't see it on the front page anymore.
It's hard to type accurately.
Trufax, johnsey|workmode
I dunno, depending on how hard it would be to transfer everything he needs, replacing it might be a good plan...
Not really.
You'll make a bunch of mistakes that you may not catch, but it's not THAT hard
Get him a netbook. Make him suffer!
Just get someone else to proofread it
AlwaysSunny, I would go with alicorn-status
oh right that's a good point
but Luna is about just as old
...depending on how he handles backups, I guess
Accurately to me is flawless. :G
wtf is that
:G
/me tries to make that face IRL
ohgodwhy
:G
AlwaysSunny, Luna is 1000 years younger at least
1000 years younger?
How do you figure that
The thing about that 12" though is we got a 256 SATA 3 solid state, and even with the 1.6 dual-core, it flies like no tomorrow
PsychicKid, she was trapped in the moon for 1000 years?
stasis on the MOON for 1000 years
She could still age
I think this is one of those details that should just be put in the "It's a cartoon" category lol
the show implied stasis, at least to me
>making assumptions
>implying that it must be correct
:P
I mean it'll need replacing once it spontaneously combusts, but then what's the harm in waiting?
But most "superlongsleeps" tend to have little to no aging
or "It's magic, I ain't gotta explain ****"
Screw logic, I'm an alicorn
you can assume and theorize all you want but in the end it dont mean squat unless you can prove it
rainbow dash
How can you prove something based on a cartoon?
Specualtion: pointless but fun
