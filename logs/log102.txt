6Sexy Naughty Bitchy, eh?
3interior_gummy BUT THAT IS AWESOME
rarity?
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/221.png
6Yes.
6I play it frequently.
6Actually makes the song not suck.
0SirSprinkles, i'd be willing to sit through it if...;)

11Anyone noticed twist's body actually sqeaks?
6inb4 all the Rarity PMVs
6...oh wait
:P
0yay, i trolled well enough to get kicked for not fully breaking the rules
are we going to wach anymore pete and pete
That was amazing
Denied
3Eeeyup
3But I have been trying to keep it more restrained
I see
lol
3Ok, I deserved that for my earlier ones
lol, none of the rules are really that enforced :P
3BUT THAT LAST ONE I DEFEND MY ACTIONS
aaaaaaaand unmute
remute
7yay
i guess i just push the rules
aaaand remute
3interior_gummy Yeah, pushing causes drama
6Don't hate me 'cause I'm such a troll~
We're already on the Rarity bad music PMVs, they'll be the only videos in the related vids tab
3Also, I already have been yelled at once for NOT stopping something
6Wikiwalking vids?
6Sounds like a plan
why does rarity get the worst songs?
Because she's worst pony. Oh snap.
unmute for a second.....wow.....remute
6Because too many people dislike Rarity, when she's awesome.
THERE IS NO WORST PONY
Let me try that noone
7She is awesome
rarity is 2nd best pony
NO DONT!
3Rarity is 5th best pony
agreed
I dont like her overdone dresses, but I like the character herself quite a bit
And her voice.
7everypony equal
Rarity is awesome. She's like a role model for guys...at leas ther personality
Sathi: but pinkie is more equal than the others
lol
i think all of...this kind of 'music' needs to go die
I wouldn't want rarity as my girlfriend, but as a character in the show, she's the best.
6THIS
^ maxaminus
7Tribute :D
hey, anyone ever take a pony personality quiz?
Just because she can be the least favorite doesn't mean she still isn't awesome
