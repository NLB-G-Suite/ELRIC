I remember this show.
LOL DENIED
dawww
0i think we found a worse song than sexy naughty bitchy
lol
close
6Sexy Naughty Bitchy, eh?
3interior_gummy BUT THAT IS AWESOME
rarity?
Wait a minute, this show sucked balls. Why do I remember it so fondly?
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/221.png
There is a rarity PMV with sexy naughty bitchy, isnt there?
6Yes.
6I play it frequently.
6Actually makes the song not suck.
0SirSprinkles, i'd be willing to sit through it if...;)
lol
6Ponies make everything infinitely better.
hehe
well sirsprinkles, ponies mak-...oh god damn it you beat me to it!
Repeat chorus times infinity
0when colbert shouted out to bronies, i couldn't decide which show got 20% cooler
both
Lol
>:|
LOL
0you owe me a gic, sprinkles :P
inb4 kick
/me lays back with popcorn and soda
7Love this song
6I owe nothing to nopony.
7*sings*
yay, mute button
trololololo trololo trololo ohahahahaha
11Anyone noticed twist's body actually sqeaks?
6inb4 all the Rarity PMVs
6...oh wait
3Also, congrats to ValtheJean for calling it
:P
0yay, i trolled well enough to get kicked for not fully breaking the rules
are we going to wach anymore pete and pete
That was amazing
0i honestly have more fun spamming than actually watching the video
what can I say? I'm a psychic! (inb4 did you foresee THIS kick)
3Interior_gummy Did you notice the Drama clause?
Denied
Your kicking finger is often itchy, isnt it?
3Eeeyup
I see
lol
This video makes me think of the pizzpony fic we had in here
3Ok, I deserved that for my earlier ones
lol, none of the rules are really that enforced :P
3BUT THAT LAST ONE I DEFEND MY ACTIONS
Yay it's over
None of the rules have really been broken yet.
aaaaaaaand unmute
Souls have been crushed, but no rules broken.
Oh god damn it trollmods
remute
7yay
i guess i just push the rules
aaaand remute
3interior_gummy Yeah, pushing causes drama
6Don't hate me 'cause I'm such a troll~
We're already on the Rarity bad music PMVs, they'll be the only videos in the related vids tab
So bad Rarity PMVs FOREEEEVER
3Also, I already have been yelled at once for NOT stopping something
Something tells me Sprinkles is considering that.
6Wikiwalking vids?
6Sounds like a plan
why does rarity get the worst songs?
3I mean stopping somebody who was pushing it
Because she's worst pony. Oh snap.
unmute for a second.....wow.....remute
6Because too many people dislike Rarity, when she's awesome.
Sprinkles.. Dont do anything you will regret.. Please reconsider..
THERE IS NO WORST PONY
Let me try that noone
7She is awesome
rarity is 2nd best pony
Oh god
NO DONT!
people who think Rarity is worst pony are too insecure with their manhood :P
Because the world is full of bitches that think, just because they are looking good, that they can sing?
3Rarity is 5th best pony
agreed
I dont like her overdone dresses, but I like the character herself quite a bit
And her voice.
7everypony equal
Rarity is awesome. She's like a role model for guys...at leas ther personality
6Excuse me for my favorite pony not being the ones that people like because they're "OMFG SO AWESOME FOR NO REASON"
Sathi: but pinkie is more equal than the others
lol
i think all of...this kind of 'music' needs to go die
I wouldn't want rarity as my girlfriend, but as a character in the show, she's the best.
ms. pie is a model for parasprites everywhere
Anyone who has worked in a creative field can relate to "Art of the Dress" ... the crap that she goes through, my clients put me through every day.
Nice reference, and it's true
6THIS
^ maxaminus
7Tribute :D
hey, anyone ever take a pony personality quiz?
Just because she can be the least favorite doesn't mean she still isn't awesome

great idea
nope
>implying they don't want to kill him
so this is what neverland ranch looks like...
Yes!
Gollum is Phone
But you wanted whining!

Gollum is best pony
8LOL Odin
JUST KILL THE MOTHERFUCKER
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHIIIIIIINIIIIIIIIING
>implying I didn't think of Rarity for some reason just now.
Andy Serkis = amazing actor
11RANDOM GOLLUM TRIVIA: The Gollum that is briefly glimpsed in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an entirely different creation than the one that appears in this film. It was during the filming of the second movie that Peter Jackson realized that Andy Serkis' physical performance would have to be employed in the digital creation of Gollum.
Lies! We all know Pikachu is best pony
TAKE IT OFF UUSS

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: New Line wanted Peter Jackson to start the film with a prologue done by Cate Blanchett, something that Jackson didn't want to do. Ironically, a year earlier New Line had been opposed to opening The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring with a prologue narrated by Blanchett, something Jackson was in favor of.
pomf=wingboner
yeah
tbh my expectations for the Hobbit aren't very high
DAWWWWW THOSE EYES
spoilers for the hobbit... havent you read the book?
Gollum, destroyed the Ring, even accidentally.
Pomf=wingboner why?
Elky: same here
What about the blue gate?

Pomf is best sound effect.
hobbit movie can't be as awesome as lotr one, the story itself just isn't
Got the black key?
It's so cute.
true
Need to get into Mordor? Straight to the gate.
RainbowDash, I intend to call you "Dashie"
He was essential to the "Fellowship"
hobbit cant possibly beat lotr
I think they'll pander to the audience too much
Peter Jackson is directing it
Dumb Pomf

The Hobbit was a more entertaining read than Rings

Ro ro, ro your han.
Twilight = Gandalf, Shadowfax = Celestia? kinky
TREEBEARD=BLOOMBERG
/me 's pun was bad and should feel bad.

Armoghomaphobia?
Aragorn "Oh, is THAT our advantage, Big Fucking Whoop."
Intermission soon?
lol
Awww, and i thought you said tactical nukes :(
whispering time
this extended version is full of strange long speeches
it been 1 hour only
HE WHAT~!
Then we're screwed
so, gandalf is twilight... who are aragorn, Gimli and Legolas?
/me wants to re-read the books now...
sam went with him? o well now hes safe
the intermission will be when half of the movie will have passed
This pleases Gandalf
Know where Frodo is going, don't know Sam went with him
nope, got a ways to go yet gentlemen
Holy crap, 9 minutes felt like 20
Gimli is RD
Gimli=Dash
Aragorn: Applejack
dat gate
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Applejack, RD, and Rarity in that order
for the sake of appeasing Hipster, I vote Aragorn be RD :P
Well, he's boned.
Legolass is applejack
So who's going to knock?
5imokwiththis.jpg
Leoglas is Rarity, of course.
very good indeed
Gimli: rainbow dash
Draw straws
Aragorn would be Applejack, legolas Rarity, and gimli is rainbow
Legolas is Rarity
who is sam?
Sam will save Frodos ass more than you can count
Dat gate
we're no stranger to mordor...
kabuuuuum
scoots
oh ive been here in doom
That's the Black gate? Pffft, false advertising.
TRIVIA: The miniature of the Black Gates of Mordor was partly made of lead.
Sam is Spike.
Gimli as Rainbow?
the evil TRUMPET BLARES
but then...who is Pinkie?
sam is so applebloom
You know, this reminds me of that old cartoon movie.
Didn't it end around here?
sam is Spike
Sam is Snips
But that gate is grey.
fail-gate is fail
dat music
no wonder nobody simply walks in to moridor.
Lets try simply walk into Mordor
Tom Bombadil is Pinkie
is gollum Pinkie
Sam is spike :P
Holy crap turbochat.
Pinkie is smeahol, gollum is oinkamena
Gollum is Pinky
evil gate is evil
Oh we oh
Sam is Rainbow Dash
the whole trilogy extended ed is about 12 hours
Gollum is owlowiscious
Either that or my chat was lagging behind.
mwahahahaha nightmare moooon
outside of the first film I don't think the extended edition really improved the films
fml
Frodo is Applebloom
Pinkamena
one does not simply march into mord- oh, um, er....
OINKAMENA!
We oooooohhhh.
and pippin is snail?
14Dat architecture
most boring post in morder
OOOOINKAMENA!!!
sam is sweetiebelle
BRRRRRMM
HAAAAAAAA
many are simply marching into mordor.....
And so the seeds of Gandalf's fantasy were sown. Frodo and Sam would become the closest butt buddies ever, and upon their return, Gandalf would welcome them into his chamber, where they would engage in a love most romantic
TRIVIA: The scene where Gandalf calls for his horse and Shadowfax comes galloping across the fields and straight up his master was achieved in the very first take.
CMC + Spike is the hobbits
DAT VUVUZELA
dat vuvuzela
Bah, I keep getting kicked out.
-.-
Trow a rock
then WE'LL DANCE OUR WAY IN TO MORIDOR
And what is Pinkamena's precious?

Mamma went to live in a farm.
Random TRIVIA: The Main Door of Helm's Deep was built so heavily and so well that the real battering ram that was built to knock down the gates failed to do so until the door was weakened.
LOTRivia: When writing the book, JRR Tolkien took inspiration from World War 1. He spoke to a mother who had lost her son, the son being a soldier in the war having just died. She said to Tolkien, "No parent should have to bury their child." This phrase helped Tolkien create a theme of how bad war is altogether
dude looks like 20 yrs younger lol

Um, yeah sure. I'll have some noodles.

Alternate Joke: MISTER MANDERSON

Legolas obtained Aragorn's Memento

But only as long as they don't look down the cliff, HaysforPonies
It's water, so he's safe
I see a cat! I see a hat! I see a man with a baseball bat!
Aragorn has left the Party.
he still has a chance
intermission/lottery?
Manly tears may or may not have been wept
what a fall
I see a dog! I see a frog! I see a ladder leaning on a log!
Intermision GET!
it's water, so he can return in a DRAMATIC MOMENT
Duskshine and Shad: There's a pause button right there under the stream! *trollface*

MOVIE TRIVIA: When this scene was filmed, they didn't know what exactly happened to Aragorn, it hadn't been filmed, so Gimli is purposely vague
dumb rock
OH MY GOD, A GIANT ROCK!
Spoiler, he reached them there.
he's actually taking a nap, so we decided to shoot these scenes without him
THE ONE WEAKNESS
Dumb rock wall
they were still deciding between a fight in edoras or the one they eventually filmed

Hugo Weaving is a champ
The eye of soron, and I can look at the hell out of you.

Cameo 2: Alan Lee: The Concept Designer can be seen as the Rohan collecting weapons at Helm's Deep (to the left when Aragorn yell's "Then I shall die as one of them!").
Discord is Sauron

I wonder: how would the ring react to those not wanting power?
we do
11Mr. Anderson.
Well, the elves had a good run.
errr
not Alan Lee
hope discord looks like sauron
honestly sauron does nothing he doesnt even seem like a threat
DISCORD IS BLUEBLOOD
god I fail today
11My...name...is...FRODO!
dermathil, Smeagol didn't want power
I'd prefer... what's his name...
but he leveled up
like gandalf
It's the same map from the book.
He voice Bender, Gilgamesh, and The Joker.
the elves are going to Ultuan
I hope Discord acts like Hades.
WE GONNA POKE HIM IN DA EYE!
Agent_Elf. Mr. Baggins
saurans one weakness, clear eyes
I can't remember his name.
gee
Bender was voiced by Fred Tatciscore
DSNesmith: point taken
11lol
Movie Trivia: that wasn't faramir's hand
6Hard and fast
You can't plan properly without those tiny flag things that move around the map
ohhh. some one wrote on the map
I think it was peter jackson's, not so sure on that bit
Sauron's got a bigger presence in the animated movie from the 70s. Can't tell ya about the books, because... I haven't read them yet :(
Nah, it was somebody else... Dimaggio... something like that.
Risk, anybody?
why did they capture Sam and Frodo again?
suddenly, secret cave
Smeagol just the way she likes it
/me slaps General_Hazard
the books are unreadable, tbh
And you need model tanks and those pusher sticks for a good war-room.
Bender is John DiMaggio
SPICE
I have the LotR edition!

Samwise is a spy
Are you a spy?
Hobbits and spies. They all the same
Little orc.

hello metostopholes
Applejack, can you buck some sense into ValtheJean?
He could have dropped it.
means he's dead cause the horn is an heirloom of Gondor
Boromir was awesome.
Also hi Metostopholes.
that's the thing about LOTR (moreso the books)
the writing is so stiff sometimes
and the whole brother thing
abandon quest, re-aquire quest. problem solved
*gasp* What a twist
Don't make me impale you too Duskshine
hmmm...nah
I'll do it!
Okay, so Viggo Mortensen = Aragorn, and Sean Bean = Boromir, right? Dude, Viggo could be Solid Snake and Sean could be Liquid in a Metal Gear Solid movie. Think about it, Hollywood!
suddenly inception scene
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM
didnt he see boromir die?
/me hugs Applejack Finally somepony with a sense of reason :P
Oh hai Boromir expy
really, I wasn't a huge fan of the books
He sure seems sad about his dead brother.

inb4 depressing scene
oh yea i forget
... ah what the hell.
Cameo 3: Dan Hennah: the art director is getting suited up in the armory at Helm's Deep. Look over Aragorn's right shoulder after Legolas says "They're frightened - I can see it in their eyes."
Yeah, once!

WE WANT PONIES WE WANT PONIES!

We are ready to kill and fight, but first lets party and get drunk!
John noble?
11Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you'll live -- at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!!!
What in tarnation?
Is that the actor from Fringe?
Dashie, thats my line.

YOU SUCK AS A DAD
what a dick
Disappointed that Faramir chose rogue class instead of warrior
Kai_kai it's soooo truuueee
I'm sensing a bit of favoritism
why did they cut this scene and not the arwen sex dream?
SOPILER: hE IS A DUCHE
nothing quite like daddy issues.
i want to see him and blueblood meet. i would pay money to see it!
@DSNesmith: Two words: Fan Service
@ applejack- I completely forgot that we already have a drink for you
WELL THE HOBBITS CERTAINLY CAN'T HAVE IT, NOPE
So wizards don't count as men or dwarves? :O
;)
IF YOU WERE MORE LIKE BOROMIR WE WOULDNT BE IN WAR GO TO YOUR ROOM
The ring goes great with my eyes!
Not strong enough.
@ValtheJean >implying liv tyler has fans
OHAI RAINBRODASH!

NO WAY THE HOBBITS HAVE IT
exatly...
Payback time >.>
SOMEONE RESPOND SO THAT I KNOW I'M LOOOOOVED :(
@DSNesmith: She does actually
wizards aren't men in the LOTR mythology
0Ohai RainBroDash
oh god Pinkie_Pie went there
Technically wizards are Eldar
Poor FluxBrony. :(
Flux i love and tolerate you
they ADDED the Arwen sex scenes BECAUSE she was so popular in the first movie
wizard is istari
Istari
Thars noe need to go to rivendell.
Pinkie_Pie, you'd better be throwing him a surprise party down there.
:D

Why is he so mean?
Speaking of Love and Tolerance, why are Bronies watching a movie with this much violence?
11what a douche
BATMAN WHERE ARE YOOOOUUUU
(sorry I'm not paying any attention to the movie)
Worlds Best Bro
brb
so what is his name again? faramir's bro?
Violence is magic.
Amino: Good question
Gandalf,Sauroman and Ragadast
It's violence with a loving intent
11Amino: Because it is fucking epic.
Because we, like most people, enjoy violence at heart.
I have no Idea
Plus it the lord of the rings
Val, you left the basement as a batch of freshly made cupcakes
Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast, Alatar and Palandor
I notice that none of the mods went with Denethor tonight...
@Amino, because we love violence and tolerate...well...violence
Violence is how bronies show love.
It's awesome
were watching it because its a classic amino
Because fighting is magic.
because saurons army is full of hate?
:(
Violence is magic when it's LOTR. xD
@Pinkie_Pie: NOPE
Fighting is Magic
My Little Lord of the Rings: War is Magic
mfw i saw the advert above chat
all problems can be solved with violence?
inb4 smeagol's trust in frodo is totally shattered
i thought magic was violence?
He's going to push him
ITS A TRICK
wait...
My Little Ringbearer: Rings are Magic
because spreading love and tolerance isn't working on Sauron/Saruman's armies
I think wizards are an endangered class in middle earth

Friendship is Mage, but Fighting is also Magic, therefore Fighting is Friendship.
forbidden pool... really?
TO CATCH A FISH
SHOOT HIM DOWN
Gollum poetry
it's no P in the OOL

This is why Gollum is Pinkie
Damn fish
Smeagol, you suck at fishing.
Kill the thing that is catching fish

So what do they do to you if you take a leak in the forbidden pool?

go cry emo kid
ThunderDash no
IMBECILIC, OBESE HALFLINGS!
listen to the fat guy always
so about 7 hours left?
Frodo found some brain cells
why didnt sauron dissapear using the ring
What was the riddle?
thats a nice sword you got there
evidently all it does is make u turn invisible
sauron had power over it
sauron is always invisible so it made him visible
Loose lips sink ships, way to go Frodo
What it does depends on how much power the wearer has.
The difference between Faramir and Boromir.
0yeah, seriously what does the ring do?
Don't forget the mind rape
Ladies and Gentlemen, the TRUE Element of Loyalty
0oh yeah
The ring is a horcrux.
GRAY SQUARE
jizz in my pants
Stoned
it has more powers, but all Frodo can do with it is dissabpear
FluxBrony; oh ok
It possesses people
They did a good job of making the ring incredibly appealing.
inb4 movie totally derails from books
thats what im talking about what does this ring do?
0yeah they did
0I want one
I hear a double echo
yay
Frodo almost went Bilboface there, didn't he?
that music
so awesome
not like its usued to go super saiyan or some shit
Ring leveled up between the Hobbit and LotR
eeeyup DuskShine
we wont know because only sauron can fully use the ring
Is Catholic school the best place to reveal my Bronydom?

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
0well that sucks
yes
fluxbrony, everywhere is best place
And faramirs an idiot to
Yes
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACEE
I think its a bad idea
When Sauron wore the ring, he wasn;t invisible
be a man, I've got pony brushables all over my desktop at Uni
U turn
march music
he didnt use it the right way then hes just a floating eye in a tower
HiE
11Sam: You...jackass.
5FINALLY PART 4!
PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EARTH, Y U ALL DUMB?
The ring is appealing because it calls for epic camera angles and bassy music.
hey hey lady, hey, space!
eerie music was eerie and now bombast
It's because they're humans.

The horse knows the way!
What is this place, filled with bombastic music?
