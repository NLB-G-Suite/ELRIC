Go find it yourselves. ;)
because capitalism
You know, if Rainbow Dash didn't wake up Fluttershy in the last episode...she would have got her cider
not sure

I'm also a night pony!
50!
this was certainly a nice song, but I found "opportunity" to be much catchier
like all the pictures for download?
over summer I literally ended up reversing my sleep schedule to the point I only woke up if the sun wasn't out.
oh 5H03 AM !
/me can't eat because of a terrible decision she made yesterday
Anything gonna play now?

Toast?!
this song is epicer
It was also supposed to be like the Music Man, but with ponies and cider instead of pool and humans and moral panics.
I'm the type of pony that should pony pony
/me loves this song
Uuuugh. Rarity song....

they called it the end of the world
moar rarity songs!
<3
Luna commands no sleep
if Rarity wasn't such a flat character, this song would be cool
wubwubwub
XD
I heard Kenan and Kel!
Rarity has best songs.
*knows all kyrics as well*
eyup
This song is okay... BUT NOT BEST!~
the singer for Rarity is hands down the best singer
the 1980's house music remix is awesome
11,01I didn't really find the last episode anything special until the end.
doing alright
clopclopclopclop
I still think the best songs are dashs

*I'm not touching you....
Yahught!
Rarity seemed 1 dimensional at first but she has come a long way girl
it was cool
;)
It was supposed to go in a different window
my 2 fav background ponies
lol
Twilight and Pinkie Pie needs another song
>.>
Rarity, say you're toast again.
xD
Rarity is fashinable and wants to classy and still wants to impress her freinds and high society at the same time, not a flat character
It pleases me.
They've made several, but they're too expensive :(
hahaha
We TOTALLY believe you
...
Well other than that
Yes
This is a pretty good song
rarity was certainly flat at the start of season 1, but she's really grown
derpy song

i think that Applejack really deserves a song
MUST BE DONE
Feel free to ignore me; I'm auditing.

Keanan and Kel, I think
I remember seeing the set for this show on a Nickelodeon Studios tour.
aw, of course it starts lagging :(
kids would get the reference to penn and teller?
^
Judging by the 'Nick' icon, and location, with the use of the font of the text, this show is pretty old.
1994

remember the comment about cider sales keeping the farm afloat during the winter?
you can create matter
And then, they got smaller at the wrong time and, instead of the asteroid hitting the school, it hits Earth's ocean, causing many tidal waves and drowning half the populace.

We've already been to saturn. you jelly nasa?
then the sun leftovers hit earth and we all die from radiation
And thus we killed a bunch of peaceful aliens that was inside the asteroid spaceship
Its too bad, that all of this is just a virtual reality...
