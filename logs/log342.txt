Nobody say it
Fluttershy is funny~
Just a hop, skip, and a jump
And Fluttershy imitates the somewhat rare Fainting Goat. This is a real animal BTW... there's an INternational Fainting Goat association.
Hop skip and jump!
dat flank.yes
why isn't loyalty doing applejack job
lol
05,15Princess_Luna I'm going to be honest with you. We don't care what your rules are. You're in bronystate, you follow the bronystate rules
I think Rarity's the retarded one.... losing 35 games of tic tac toe?

nosferatu
Nostalgia!

My god jim, we're in the wrong franchise!
Nostalgica Luna
Fluttershy must of used FUS RO yay!
Either way is fine with me.

It's Derpy.
/me waves
APPLETWI!
fun fact:I can't stand rarity.
Rarity's just happy she gets to visit Tom and family

put the flutter in fluttershy!
Jigglysaint not now
they should have used the hot air balloon
she forgot how to until lesson zero
I love ALL the ponies :)
I feel so bad about saying it, but Rarity is probably my least favorite of the mane 6
lol!
I'm slidding@
courage the cowardly dog?
well
... is RD not strong enough to just flying elevator them all to the top one at a time?
da'www
:'(
/me hugs Derpy.

07,01looks like nostalgia won
Rainbow
Derpy is best pony.
Awww, stop picking on Fluttershy.
or could Twi not have ported them?
noooooo
God DAMN, those squeaks make my chest hurt.
I hate Rainbow Dash there.
Y u so dickish?
okay well
I like her even less than applejack.
dat cave'
00,03:D
NO, REALLY. It hurts.
Lyra's a nice girl :)
dun dun DUUUN!
worm sign
damn ads
picking on her?
this is the episode that made me not like rainbow as much as the other ponies
I don't particularly mind Rarity or anypony in particular out of them...
brb, ordering more insulin
"Go look for clues in the smoke!"
Gumri: I know what you mean
How manponies could Twilight Transport?
did you count all the votes? just to be sure...
OK.....I get it...no video links....
But. . .she's one of my favorites
Yo yo yo
Derpy is truly Best Pony. :) *hugs RD_Ashton*
I think it's harder to teleport more than maybe one or two people at once.
Pinkie that is NOT FOOD!
pwny: that would have been TOO EASY
lol
Poor scootaloo
it was only a 10min walk
so cutee
YES IT IS.
maybe I should just keep it to myself
at least i got chicken
I can eat all these apples!
crucial pony activities in progress
Pinkie and rarity are Tank
That's distracting
00,03Poor me...
Who's Derpy? Doncha mean _____
sorry, meant to say how many ponies
oh pinkie.
GOOD FOR YOOUUUUUUU
though its not hate so much as dissaproval
ANYTHING IS FOOD FOR PINKIE PIE
Funky modern art
i never understood that
Scootaloo!!!
AJ is DPS
Hey everypony
HIHOOF : yeah, there is that
Rarity: WTF?
its been weaponized...
yes
paintball apples?
just like I did that blog that Princess Celestia wrote
13hooves made of dark matter..
WHAT are they supposed to do with apples?
Apples vs Dragon seems legit
Ive got a favorite(Twilight Sparkle) but not a least favorite
Hey!
MODERN ART!
Oh you, durger.
Are apples the dragon's one allergy?
yeah
god help us all
First offense, @Fluttershy. Won't happen again. :)
KITTEEEN

:o
my stream is 8 seconds behind....weird
:$
yay
Eat em
Eat em.
Use them as bullets? Like in Donkey Kong 64?
the deadly chicken
Anypony else wonder how Twilight could fix the dam in the mare-do-well episode, but she couldn't fix the mayor's office
Ok, I don't dislike Rarity
at least i got scootaloo
:D!
feed the dragon
Wow...Computer decided to glitch the hell out on me..
I guess the others are healer
eat em
Pinkie's the tank that somehow does lots of damage.
still say Celestia in running shoes should be a new meme
celestia help us all
buy some apples
red+green = yellow + green? ....
Twi is healer
Welcome, then! :)

I agree with Fluttershy here. Would YOU want to be eaten by a dragon?
/me has failed once again :(
Fluttershy LIMIT BREAK!
is it wrong for me to be attracted to Fluttershy?
I'm skeered of dreahgins!
I'm scared of your mom.
animal =/= dragon
ok see you later
some people take this as her shyness, when this is actually a phobia
Anyway.....what I was TRYING to show everypony....is there is a P-Team video...and it is AWESOME.
INDIGNATION
I feel...a bit better now...
"Wah is Fluttershah in mah plot?"
I'm also scared of North Korea
Alright, how is your guys days going?
wait wrong game
IshBestPony: um
then they got cancer and died of second hand smoking the end
But Fluttershy, you have a wonderful talent using FUS RO DAH!
Go find it yourselves. ;)
spike isn't a full grown eat a pony in one bite dragon
because capitalism
You know, if Rainbow Dash didn't wake up Fluttershy in the last episode...she would have got her cider
not sure
nice to meet you too Haku
TOY_PON3 well, Pumpkin pie is a unicorn.
Evening.
mines ok
dat logic
FUS RO yay!
Is this being streamed straight from an iTunes rip? I think the madVR renderer with chroma upscaling set to SoftCubic-100 would improve the picture a bit.
horny
Yeah, he has scales!
IshBestPony: Invisible Fluttershy much?
yet.
hypotheticaly of course
good point...
1,3depends on your adblock and the stream server
Pierce the heavens!

I've been wondering Haku, just what is SWAG?
See! ONE MOUNTAIN!

HE'S THE LORD
the hobbit was actually a childrens book
BITCH ATTACK COMMENCE

Couldnt Celestia kill the dragon?

0,14Now I ain't saying she's a gemdigger
Greed!
F*CKING COOL
it was intended for children
lolwutt
well this proves species isn't a issue for Rarity
Why would she do that?
is mentioning the .MOV videos in the rules?
OH MY GOD
True lol
i agree pwny, he was able to convey an adventure way better in the hobbit
fuken tease
If only Spike was watching.
Gemme !
i used to think that rarity would take the gold then i took an arrow to the knee
ME GUSTA
element of generosity indeed
lol
OH MY GOD

So close

She wants the dragon's "family jewels"
RARITY

Nope, chuck testa.
Why couldn't she troll the dragon to the moon

"suck it"
I think that they are all equal
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I WATCHED SHED.MOV, I AM NOT AMUSED!!!!

This episode is a big metaphor to smoking in public.
puppy whimer
Defeating dragons through freindship!
>never says anything
Flutterbawss
AnonyPony-EQD: my grandmother too
Agreed!
Ok, Doubled. I'll agree with that.
lesson learned: eat your vegetables
she just made a dragon cry........................................
Derpy: Me neither
big manly tears
hi
creys
Where did she get that hat?
indeed
Fluttershy makes dragons cry
Derpy: HOW!!!!!!!!!?
O.o
i bathe in your tears
Its raining!
Moral of the story: Dont fuk with Fluttershy
she like a soccer mom
What a jerk.
smokeing is cool
couldnt he just...chomp them?
Kencolt: Fluttershy is everyone's mom.
I AM SO SAD! D;
NOBODY MAKES RED DRAGON CRY. :[
It's raining men!

00,03Waith it, Derpy...
SOLRAC IS BEST OC PONY

FLUTTERSHY WINS!
Flutters is a great mother.
They make it to easy for a dirty mind to capitalize on these things...
Damn, I wish I could be as assertive as Fluttershy ._.
She's like a mom mom.
I SMOKE IN PUBLIC BATHROOMS
on an unrelated note, we keep a baby dragon as slave and hostage in ponyville...go or that's how you will end too
FRIENDSHIP!
dragon tears cannot be good for their manes
F;uttershy can make anything and anyone cry.
FINISH HIM
I loved Shed.MOV!!!
Everypony is best pony. I like being called best princess though!
His tears... Umm, they're so delicious!
"pack your things" = "swallow your horde"
10,02They came out with Shed.mov?
EXCEPT FLUTTERSHY
Wait...umbrella hat? Tail twitching?
he left his treasure
/me rages
Leaves without his jewels lol
Dohvakin ain't got nothing on Fluttershy.
Your tears are all the comfort that I need.
Yep!
Yes
...
(I said it once & I'll say it once more) The dragon flew across the sea and settled in a lonely mountain where he rested for several centuries until he was discovered by a band of a dozen dwarfs, a wizard and a hobbit. Whom would later fight over its treasure.
He left his shit!
derpy
Equestria needs to center their attention to Science.
derpy!

It seriously cheered me the fuq up : D!
derpy!

I heard Kenan and Kel!
Rarity has best songs.
*knows all kyrics as well*
eyup
Every single song Rarity gets its awesome
OHHH this is the sing along version arent they
This song is okay... BUT NOT BEST!~
the singer for Rarity is hands down the best singer
i would be there with a folding chair... a bloody folding chair
Oooh, I love this song! I can actually do a good impression of Rarity with this song! :)
ShadowofBrony708 I mean on Luna's list

BronyCon: Really?
I agree with Discord
YES! BIG MAC FTW

Yahught!
Rarity seemed 1 dimensional at first but she has come a long way girl
Disqord

Rarity, say you're toast again.
xD
tWILIGHT SINGS IN THE gALA SONG
Rarity is fashinable and wants to classy and still wants to impress her freinds and high society at the same time, not a flat character
adult men swarm a little girl's facebook page
It pleases me.
They've made several, but they're too expensive :(
hahaha
We TOTALLY believe you
...
Well other than that
Yes
Ok, QUESTION: Is it normal to catch yourself almost saying "everypony" and other pony phrases in normal every-day life? >.>
This is a pretty good song
AJIsBestPony, your forgetting, the Best Night Ever.

Where's the white guy?
^
You know what show you should play from the 90s?
I miss this show so much.
Judging by the 'Nick' icon, and location, with the use of the font of the text, this show is pretty old.
nicks golden age
1994
Back when rap wasn't all drugs and hoes and shooting your enemies.

Anyway...I feel bad for my grandma cause she wanted STS to do it since she could pay it off over time with her credit card...but they wont do it due to lack of info on the car...so we have to pay up front before we can leave with it
they have their own show.....needs a club to make money?

POnyfan78: Samurai Pizza Cats is a dub of the anime, "Kyatto Ninden Teyandee". However, the group that was to dub it-- Saban-- weren't given any tr4anscripts and almost no plots-- just raw footage. So the producer's just made up dialog from nowhere. The result is one of the funniest shows ever.

They know what they mean... It's from the un aired reproductive episode. :O
I love how that asteroid has a "C" on it.

Ponyfan78: that is a movie that exists, it sucks

Nope.

/me puts on hat and monocle for emangamer
I like bob, bob's quotes are awesome
cousin bob is a genious

;)
Bob says "It better" >:(
jetpacks
Decompression kills them all
Please dont tell me those were bobs last words
wouldn't the kids NOT be the size of the windows?
My God, I hate every character on this show.
I think know where my sister's obession with that name came from now
Wait, but...

I thought this was a pony stream
I thnk cousin Bob died in some awesome, cataclysm.
deus ex machina anyone? lol
Ohfour: ask Shizuka
Gotta be really scary to be in space and miss your target...
Space... vaccuum.... and...
otakon: This is supposed to make sense?
Stupid Carlos.
13meanwhile the tides on earth have been destroyed
And then they died from improper depressurization...
so why the hell are we watching magic school bus?!
TO THE SUN.
this is the first time I see this show
as well as the expensive looking pod
Suddenly the Bus turns into the Majora's mask moon
and u say somehthing like
K_A ofc!
:D
lol?
Exactly.
BOB is best planet
And then Princess Celestia wakes up with a black eye
cause mun
Lop
u mean dead?
it's educational!
except they don't, and the asteroid goes back on it's original course
aren't we all just living space junk when you stop to think about it?
we can't watch pony ALL THE TIME
star trek reference lol
or I'm remembering wrong
FUCK THIS SHOW
did yall see the MLP ep last week?
and then the sun permantely blinded all of them
It is, but they run out of episodes at some point.
Tenure: good one
YES WE CAN!
are they creating mass?
i was about to say that flutty =p
this is very much like a pony show
stuffing?
Shizuka: imagine what happens if you slightly screw the moons orbit :P
its just a button
LOL DEATH JOKE
dem windows
Oh, god, reverse to the moon banishment.
dat pun
Vinco: eeyup
puns
STOP WITH THE PUNS
Shizuka: what did SlurryMoon do?
Open Browser, and it opens BUUTTT A PONY Will answer you
I loved the ending.
Celestia: I gonna send you to the spacebus!!
why would they be stuffing?
food jokes
in space
these kids sure do handle death easily...
GOD DAMMIT CARLOS CAN YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH FOR 1 MINUTE!?
Complex orbital calculation... Leave it to reptile. --trolluna face--
dem puns :)
Ahhh magic schoolbus kill it with fire!
Beam me up scotty
321
that pun was bad and you should feel bad
what did SlurryMoon do?
who writes this garbage
then star wars
scotty more power!
They used to have a segment at the end where the scientifically questionable plot points were explained, but in the Qubo syndication, it was omitted. :\
remember the comment about cider sales keeping the farm afloat during the winter?
you can create matter
And then, they got smaller at the wrong time and, instead of the asteroid hitting the school, it hits Earth's ocean, causing many tidal waves and drowning half the populace.
So much for being educational
sure arnold, why not
Best letter to the princess every.
who was the one who decided to play magic school bus?
ok, I'm wrong
just remember, love and tolerate, this show is out dated but not broken
yay:(
3huh?
WHO CARES
ever*
oh Nasa
And so the sun was DESTROYED
Yeah?
this is wat happens when you make a show ment solly for young childern at school
3otakon what?
YES
this is me, not Math!
and we're the enterprize again
13i am confuse
so wut im asking is
<3 the voice crack on "free"
cause you know, it has to go into the sun XD
The puns have been doubles
im tired and cranky
God damn it Nasa
00,10like nasa could have done a thing
doubled
I just wish they threw Ralph into the abyss
A NAME FOR THE PROGRAMM
Meteor got banished, to the SUUUUN!
07,01dat solar flame
NASA?
do they have a mortgage on the farm or something?
imma go to bed
we have it
poof
NASA is jelly lol
what nasa?
they nave no bills
Would have been funny if they just slingshot the asteroid to the Earth even faster.
Destroy all invaders
Fast moving rock
but no name
NASA SUCKS!:|
SlurryMoon: apparently you did something
goodnight!
woot
Tell them that Carlos did jack shit.
So, I've never been here all night. Does this continue all night?
that asteroid just hit the sun after a few minutes...
hey SlurryMoon :3
It's not becuz you make a show for kids that you don't have to try
awww f**k ansa man
wtf
they've been on hold with NASA for the entire episode
The point isn't to make sense. It is to teach children about SCIENCE
What comes after this?
night everpony
nobody care about you SCIENCE, not even MAGIC
NASA was upstaged by a childrens bus
the are the labor
now the sun will blow up
they probably just wiped out a species last chance of survival
It must be me, but that Asteroid arrived too fast.
the sun can't fuse iron
imma go sleep
BUT WOULDN'T IT JUST ORBIT THE SUN?????
lol
it takes light EIGHT minutes to reach earth
3what?
too many flaws
because fk nasa
93 million miles in about 30 secs.
13yay, the flare caused by the asteroid's destruction will overwhelm the magnetic field!
good night Morty|cant_write
candy OMNOMNOMNOM!
suddenly boxer
we finished that shit off in ten seconds flat
is it over yet
then the sun leftovers hit earth and we all die from radiation
Shizuka: how did SlurryMoon break the tides on earth?
And thus we killed a bunch of peaceful aliens that was inside the asteroid spaceship
Its too bad, that all of this is just a virtual reality...
conservation of matter states that matter can be turned into energy
Haha! It's funny because nasa actually did things then! :D
Science doesn't have to make sense
Meaning it was going about 16c
THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED
national assholes shitting anvils = NASA
Lol awesome troll: Call NASA and when they pick up tell them you fixed the problem..
so how can they lose the farm?
Clark kent was on that asteroid
Captain Liz Picard of the U S S Frizzle Bus
10,02Point of the story: Call Europe to solve our problems instead of rely on the US.
why hasn't Ms. Frizzle been arrested for endangerment of children?
Hmm.
I would slay that lizard and eat his organs.
ooooooooo
I normally cut off around 10 and come back for the episode
I learned absolutely nothing
maby idk
my brain is dead
3I is confuse 9.6
SuperBrony64: indeed

and connections

Every celular phone in the country was destroyed

lol, NASA don't know me
green koala
10,02I is hug you SlurryMoon :3
you are not alone Tao
Meanwhile, inside the asteroid, a peaceful society that was about to brake and visit Earth with the secret to eternal peace and prosperity was destroyed.
Wait, they were in school until night time?
/me hugs SlurryMoon
they put the flaws in on purpose so that the audiance is forced to think about it more, think random pinkie pie
have they been gone all day? and there parents are'nt cncerned
I'm prety sure there are a lot of warrents for her arrest in numerious countries AND planets.
that asteroid was a ship full of aliens who had the secret of life
Who hates this show? raise thy hoof high!
One of the meteors hits their house.
ideas?
Huh.
Sorry I talked about me the whole night :/
13teleportation
wait
THAT MOTHER IS HER FATHER!
she has connections
SuperBrony64: moral of the story: always rely on magic to help solve your problems
That's a really good question.
I always saw a meteor smoking her in the face in that scene
Who needs NASA when you are Canadian....we have.....trees? <.<
13seems legit
Hey, some respect for NASA. :<

Rugrats
THIS school year?

You'd think some parents would oppose extensive field trips.
they beamed down the bus and everyone?
Hoof raised*

animaniacs
This is from back when Dubs didn't give even a single fuck, and just were meant to be as cheesy as possible.
I'm pretty sure that at its time this show was fail, but now this looks just awesome.
rant*
If you said "Being delivered by an armored cat" then you are correct
DEAR LORD PLEASE SPARE US OF FURRIES!!
Alright I installed adblockplus. Let's see if it works.
Sumica: eeyup!

And WHAT THE HELL IS THIS.
This announcer id LOL worthy
A note to remember-- one of the main characters is the narrator. Seriously.
Of course. its a bird.
one long intro
So Much Nostalgia...Anyone here remember "Bump in the Night

TOY_PON3: COMPLETELY different show

RAWRity: More correct, Saba never got scripts and only limited synopses... so they had to make everything up. So they just ran with it.

Good night everypony, see you tomorrow! :) <3
Okay, adblockplus is not working. Advertisement is there..
