At least according to Grant, everything can be solved with remote control and robots. XD

Kari is just in the show for the fanservice
Jamie feels everything can be solved with twine and hinges, that and hydraulic pumps
00,10hell yeah

I used to download simpsons as a kid
curse you america
Oh noo-I wish
00,10Discovery has imposably long ad's
Oh yeah, crazy ads-
dammit whore get of the screen
this is kinda sad... just a tad.
uhh
Sometimes Discovery makes me sad
selling it is
here it's completely illegal
selling, making, drinking, or distributing
00,10selling with out paying taxes is the illegal part
^
the government wants its cut
because EXPLOSIONS
uh oh
Unlicenced production, and health codes
yeah
/me happily pays taxes
and especially, food and alcohol needs to be regulated for the safety of the customers
Yeaah, they used it to eh thin it out, to make more money
reaalllyy unsafe and bad practice
Yep~
00,10well that was expected
00,10two men walk in to a bar one says give me h2o, the othere says give me h2o too.
WHOA.
In our chemistry book they had an example on how people can be fooled into thinking things
00,10yep
they had a warning leaflet, with the full name of H2O (which I can't remember) and all the things, inhaling is deadly, and all the warnings
and said "Please help us band it today!"
ban*
Brilliant demonstration on how people can make uneducated decisions based on propoganda-
Not sure, it was in our school books
Printed..1998 I guess, r94 school reform
00,10brb, feeling snackie
Mm~
What,..was that an ad for?
brb, getting breakfast.
"MAAANLY CAR"

"
if you want to meed them you gotta pay like $6k
they need to go deeper
*rimshot*
trenches in ww1 were deeper
Particularly ROBLOX, which is now full of crap.
in the frontlines
not really
i think you could stand shot from there
uhh
Charge.
The Great War had pretty complex trench systems
Aah, makes sense- they were there for a really long time
WWI was all about trenches
00,10and then the tank
WW1 Games, I want one
tanks and machine guns were the biggest factors in the Great War
Maxim, yeah
and the introduction of airplanes
or the name
ROBLOX used to be popular until it became a toilet full of outdated memes
I didn't think tanks were succesful in ww1 though-
Actually, I mean good
I found Roblox in Newgrounds :3
right
I hate blowing balooons--
uh oh
The bounce hits you harder than the landing.

Cadance and Cadenza are technically the same thing
Midersan™
yeah, I can't stand it-
but is Cadance the right spelling as a word?
Midersan™ is very arigatoful
/me can't grammar
I do call her "Mi amore Cadenza" sometimes just for the giggles :D
Well, the WORD is spelled "Cadence"
try changing it
The name is spelled Cadance
I just think the pronunciation changes too much with the a
I do <3
It's too mainstream
Maybe it's my foreign ears-
Can we discuss on how we pronounce "Giygas" now?
00,10cause I forgot
00,10I only needed to do it once
slash nick
/nick
YODIO
Ok hang on a minute'
You only do it once
Wait do i say nick when changing it back or?
d
Isn't there a muted vowel to smooth the transition? I usually hear Kaydens
Plausible, but not yet confirmed.
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DNS ADDRESSES NOW
No exact results found for Cadance in the dictionaries.
Probably be
Great Costume *snicker*

opinions opinions opinions
I only caught the end, but it sounded really - unenergetic then
I don't think even his accent is the whole fault
It is possible to appreciate someone's talent without actually liking the sound they make.
/me eyes look at stream for a sec
That it is
It's a matter of taste

>Hating on CaramellDansem
Oh shit you just didn't GO there
Fluttershy would never agree to do a caramelldansen vid, she's too shy :D
There's a lot of that in music
What's this song?
not everyone can like everything, its just not possible
U^
If everyone liked everything, there'd be a lot less hate. =/
There would- but there'd probably be less fun on the outskirts of music
AUSTRALIA YEAH!
if you liked everything then that means you'd have to like all the bad too
Is this from that Horrible guy's singing blog?
I mean, I respect and appreciate artists I don't like, and that's enough I guess
unless they're really mean to me or peopel around them, but then noones thinking rationally
PONY CANTINA :D
Dat cantina music. XD

I do have an reddit account, actually.
08,01fine, i won't stream misfits anymore, then.
I am never going to forget that quote.
It was brilliant.

In which the line "RAVING FURIOUS SEX" was all I remember.
08,01though seriously, misfits only had like 2 scenes with boobies
aw i liked misfits

my neighbours are not even walking distance. :P

that would of been fun
08,01not even that
but they wont charge anything on a $10 toy.
You have to fill out customs forms every time you ship out of the country
Saturn "4 Equipment Crew: To set up audio equipment and assist performers with set up"
I declare everything as a $10 toy, it helps it speed through customs.
