Two women were out riding one day when one woman fell off. The other woman rang the emergency services and said: "My friend's fallen off her horse and I think she's DEAD!!!" The operator said: "Okay, First make sure she's dead" The operator hears silence, then a loud gunshot. "Okay I've done that, what next?" asks the woman.

DemoPegono: if youre referring to the age rule, its not a big deal
?
Look at the topic.
DemoPegono wait, you don't have to go, there are plenty of younger bronies here
DemoPegono: its not a big deal, a lot of people here arent 18
I tried to get other video captures, but none of them wanted to work D: so manycam is all I got
Dken2021 Youngest here I think is 14.
DemoPegono: *14
....okay.
Well, that is what most of them say they are...
wait, what is this about an age limit?
im 999 john madden

Domo Fair enough, maybe you'll have to fumble with the settings a bit some time in the future.
:D
Did someone say John Madden?
also I hate moonbase
Domo you tried vhscreencap?
/me flips a table "Berries."
most streamers here use that
So what now?
/me slides DemoPegono a soda.
Sit back, relax, enjoy the stream

These constant curls in Rarity's mane/tail are one of the reasons why I almost never draw Rarity xDD. It's probably because I get reeeeally OCD with hair.
I only recently came back here
But after the struggle, Rarity's always fun to color <3
So I don't remember a whole lot
yes it is <3
11lol its ok I just recently got back on here too haha I dont remember much either
00,03That's why Rarity is a jerk :|
Scoot-Scootaloo: :|

Oh Scooot
Scoot-Scootaloo: But you love Rarity :>
no she's not
Hey, hey Scoot-Scootaloo.

Random fact?

good choice haha
Silver_Soother otherwise, pretty good
Hello Silver_Soother , Im tired as well
Well, I saw a tumbleweed rolling around the forum.
CrimsonPhoenix: I have this ref on hand!~ Needed a ref for her harp thoguh
also playing the lyre telekinetically in an emotionless expression
though*
Random fact, I have a $4000 computer and 6 games on steam.
/me hugs Dken2021 cachi01 thelonepony Domo Canadian_Brony and oni_link|sick
Haven't seen you here in ages
/me returns the hug :D

/me hugs back <3
12Well Im jumping off here guys lol brb in a bit
I'm tired with dealing with drama Canadian_Brony and sorry for being so tired oni_link|sick :(
k
and I needed to see it a little bigger xD;
See you later.
so we have a new streamer?
I like your work Domo :3
howd he get that job?
Good, I like being young.
Through being an awesome artist is my guess.
RoboGerbil eeyup. Domo is part of the Art Team and is doing some drawing for us.
Silver_Soother: I know what youre going through. Drama surrounds me every week. This is where I go to unwind :3
what? free drawings?!?
sure
oni_link|sick: Totally. I couldn't have put it better myself friend.
Silver_Soother: /)
oni_link|sick: /)
Joining SF was one of the best Internet related decisions I have ever made.
Er... I guess (\
00,03Domo is MLG like that <3
id like to see straight mane Zechora
well there's a larger one here http://fav.me/d48yfxm
RoboGerbil: she is not takin requests anymore
Scoot-Scootaloo is MLG
I think her mane's always straight XD
I couldn't do like Domo is drawing... Though, that's probably because I am a novice artist. And I can't call myself an artist without laughing at my own words.
next is luna
:)
zechoras got that dumb mohawk
naw more liek the nightmare night eps
I'm gonna go watch another movie; I'll talk to you guys later
Silver_Soother, do you hate your art to a point where it makes you want to get better?
Aww. Okay.
Also domo I want her to play the Lyra Telekinetically
so how many of you think discord is coming back in the next season
Lyre**
See you later.
CrimsonPhoenix: I hate my art, but others say it is good. I keep trying to get better, but I need real pencils or something more then Crayola pencils.
Silver_Soother, then you're a good artist in my book
crayola is best pencils
CrimsonPhoenix: :) If you say.
Silver_Soother: but you may be better off with an airbrush?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8322/
lol not the bees
08,01what?
RoboGerbil: Airbrush? As I said, I am a novice at art. I don't know anything about it. :(
Domo D:
?
08,01hi RoboGerbil!
So is Domo done?
I kinda wanted her to play it tele....oh nvm it's beautifull
08,01and thelonepony!
08,01and cachi01!
08,01and Domo!
08,01<3
lol he didnt say hi to Canadian_Brony
Damn keyboard
Hello~ And Ohh oAo ok. Do you want me to change it, CrimsonPhoenix?
RoboGerbil *shrugs*
If possible yes
Ok!
I want her to play the lyre with magic
telekinetically
Domo are you going to link the images when you're done?
^
Kinda want that Luna pic
why no sound?
because manycam is a bitch
:(
....wait, I think I remember the sound solution with many cam
cause I don't think manycam has a sound recorder
solution: use better software
^
seems legit
i tried using manycam once
sound input should obviously be stereomix
obviously
eeyup
also, I'm eating baked potatoes at 10pm for no reason
08,01why are Faure's and Durufle's requiems often on CDs together?
08,01that's not the lead-in to a joke
mmm at least its niot 10am
08,01i'm just genuinely perplexed
*sigh* Je ne sais pas quoi faire en ce moment.
do they sound similar?
08,01Canadian_Brony: do you have spotify?
nnope
i dare everyone in this chat to watch this without crying or tearing up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRQLcwhNsKM&feature=related
08,01Canadian_Brony: go find yourself a recording of Faure's Requiem
08,01and listen to it all
REQUIEM FOR A DREAM HAZ BEST SOUNDTRACK
08,01you'll be a better man for it
requiems are bestquiems
storm-wind55: Don't put links to videos in chat during streams if you were so kind.
>Using FFX's opening theme
always expect crying
?
FFX theme is beautiful
storm-wind55, I know that comic
beautifull
anyone else read both cupcakes and rocket to insanity?
i did
Cupcakes is the reason I'm a brony today.
did you feel worse after rocket to insanity?
cuz cupcakes wasnt that bad to me but after rocket, i felt sick
08,01i'm trying to find a recording of Faure's Requiem which has choral direction i agree with
08,01i.e. the choir is directed as i'd conduct them
EmoRarity: same here
kinda but i read rocket to insanity first
rocket to insanity was scarier then cupcakes to me
EmoRarity: cupcakes and the pony.movs
Can we please not digress on the topic of "those" fics?
or the .movs
OH GOD ROCKET TO INSANITY
AP Computer Sciences. Friend gave it to me.
08,01i've never read Rocket to Insanity
Been a faggot since.
Well.
08,01EmoRarity: you're a bassoon?
I'm not looking it up anymroe.
I think that means he doesn't know what to do at the moment, not 100 % sure though haha
Yo sup suckas?
*anymore
11,02EmoRarity: You're a pile of sticks?
ohai HoodyNinja and NewSuperBronyU
rocket... i dunno it just felt worse than cupcakes. maybe cuz cupcakes was waaay over the top but rocket seemed like it really could happen?
ohau NewSuperBronyU :3
All of the above.
Ohai NewSuperBronyU *gives a box of waffles*
ohai*
08,01cachi01: oh! is that the one where dashie reads cupcakes and it makes her insane?
Hi HoodyNinja :3
Along with computer and audio technican.

ohh
Well time for bed. Good night everypony
I was just wondering why he said my name
seeya Ponies47

08,01i'm listening to it on my reference in-ears, and i can hear where they've done a really silly tweak on the level
Thanks for the stream Domo
Night Ponies47
CrimsonPhoenix: Because sometimes people write really good fics?
08,01*levels
night Ponies47 :)
/me 08,01nuzzles ASoftFluffyThing
CrimsonPhoenix because it's critically aclaimed as an amazing work of literature and you find it rater amazing.
heh.. im half way through this past sins fic.. got into it cuz i wanted to know where that Nyx character came from
Ponies47: Night bro
Good night Ponies47 ^^
Canadian_Brony, HoodyNinja it is, alot but....still
Yeah, it said I don't know what to do.
past sins is awsome fanfic
YES!
08,01storm-wind55: i really liked past sins, until abotu half way through
omg... chapter 10... i almost died reading that one
08,01it started to get slightly silly and repetitive
I now have 69 songs on my playlist
Hey Domo do you have a DA by any chance? If so what is it? So I can follow it
08,01i think it's when that other lass took it over
I can't read fan-fics for very long. I get droned out by long lines of text on a computer monitor.
Immaturity level: Internet
i know right
08,01you could tell that the writing style had changed
oh
yeah
Canadian_Brony: thats why theres readings on youtube
storm-wind55, Background Pony is 1000 times better
I'm not really sure what to say, wasnt expected to get a question like that..
00,03Canadian_Brony: That's why I exist! ^_^
Different views for different people.
08,01AJIsAwesome: i *love* fanfic
Did I throw you off?
Just surprised I guess
CHAT-CEPTION
it was a very good fanfic
Oh.
After the Luna request, that will be where I stop the stream for the night.
Its a tough question for me to answer :P
08,01i love comedy fics, sad fics, some OTT gore fics, but i'm a real sucker for sappy romance
I don't really consider myself the owner
can you link that Lyra picture?
Okay.

You have that little house symbol.

Silver_Soother: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/Wayward-Courier
Dammit I can't do any reading because mah computer brokeded ;A;
When was the last time someone got banned from this thing?
RoboGerbil Scoot-Scootaloo yes, but I have a harder time soaking in a story when someone reads it to me.
one that i kinda liked was called twidark
oh gosh yes this one Silver_Soother http://www.fimfiction.net/story/34702/Why-am-I-Pinkie-Pie%3F%21
It was before my time
and Scoot-Scootaloo you exist for the sole purpose of spreading your MLG-ness.
4 Fanfics to read, thanks chat. That should keep me busy. <3
I thought.
00,03<3
Also another one that I enjoy very much Silver_Soother http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22925/Tales-from-Mystika%3A-A-My-Little-Mages-Book
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30083/1 this is a good one
Silver_Soother only 4? Puh-leaze, I've put off reading 15 atleast.

00,03Hope you enjoyed the interview earlier!
Night MLG-Man
Bye, Scoot. :3
its called twidark
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20685/Sunny-Skies-All-Day-Long I love this one
I missed the interview. I blame yardwork.
true to the episode style and Celestia's Shenanigans
CrimsonPhoenix who doesn't love it?
Canadian_Brony, stupid people
true
Or people who just don't like it.
I seem to only be interested in really sad fics right now...
HoodyNinja, Background Pony
Silver_Soother this is a good one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30083/Twidark
seconding CrimsonPhoenix's choice. That's an excellent, short read
Silver_Soother this is a good one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30083/Twidark
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24125/The-Zodiac-Ritual anyone read this one?
Silver_Soother this is a good one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30083/Twidark
CrimsonPhoenix: I should've expected that...
HoodyNinja, BUT
ALL teh fanfics
IT HAS EVERYTHING
Silver_Soother this is a good one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/30083/Twidark
Storm; probably should PM me those instead of spamming in mine chat.
Mostly sad though
storm-wind55 please stop spamming.
lol
I dont know who was banned here
sorry computer was freaking out
g2g everypony cya :) http://oi45.tinypic.com/1hv9t.jpg >_>
storm-wind55 something tells me that you love to read fanfics
its fixed now
Bye, cachi01. :)
seeya cachi01
bye cachi01 :)
catch ya later cachi01
when i cant watch new pony eps i go to the fics
storm-wind55: You've had a busy summer
Silver_Soother: was there a particular genre you preferred?
Any genre, I'm easy going when it comes to stories.
there was one more but i can't remeber the name of it
I seem to be picky as hell...
assuming you know about Fallout: Equestria and moving on...
You know why he/she got banned?
NullRadix: I haven't read that many Fanfics.
who?
I'm going to get a Blackberry: Playbook primarily because I can read fan-fics off fimfiction.net, Google Docs, and the Pony Fiction Vault, which is are my primary sources for fan-fics.
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
Silver_Soother: Fallout: Equestria is one of those "kinda big" things. Might want to look it up if you're looking for an epic
The person you said got banned
Fanfiction? In bronystate? What is this madness
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
CrimsonPhoenix xD
i remeber know it was this one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/52164/Seeing-the-Pattern
NullRadix: Will do friend.
actually, it's more likely than you think
oh, I'm sure some were banned here before
Thats why I said it was before my time
I don't know what the peoples names are
I figured that if you were banned on the forums it would be the same here
On A Cross and Arrow was a medium-sized fic I recall being fun. Twi ports the group to an R63 alternate dimension
oh
08,01NullRadix: i love that one!
08,01Silver_Soother: read Foal in the Basket
08,01<3
(its entirely PG if you're worried about that sort of thing, all in good fun)
So is Domo going to give a link?
She will when she's finished streaming.
storm-wind55, you enjoy dark fic a bit too much
oh hey, Nightmare Night by Glaze and MicTheMicrophone
she sa she'll finish when she's done with Luna
/me needs some wubs...link me some
that, or the orchestrated version by StormWolf
Canadian_Brony, where are you hearing that?
CrimsonPhoenix Domo's listening to it and it popped up on the stream.
oh hey I just noticed now that it's in the stream
Don't cross the streams!
And from the abundance of annotations, I can tell it's the original
wait what?
i know but seeing the patter was a very good fic
Glaze's videos are almost always completely covered in links to remixes
Canadian_Brony, you mean Rainbow Factory?

Okay
that was weird
BLWWWAAAAA *nom*
Canadian_Brony: she is can't you tell?
Canadian_Brony: Yeah we just had her intro
otakon: lawl she isnt
that is exactly what construction looks like
shinji had to use one of asuka's at one point
but seriously thogh what the buck is this
When I read A Game of Thrones, Ned has Ulfrec Stormcloaks voice in my mind.
yeah in ep 8
flutterchu: A masterpiece.
Yep I'm on acid
that bear, is high as fuck
twilight_sprinkle: so... the NGE pic and her intro AND stuff she has on her playlists isn't proof she is?
flutterchu: it's the bear that wassn't
otakon, what you fail to realize, is that Shinji already uses a female plugsuit, because he is the biggest pussy in the series
otakon no, Saxy's playing tricks. J_E_Smith71 we did? I didn't see it.
flutterchu: this is sparta?
kirz|art: but he eventually gets a regular suit, not one with boob plates
so much smoking
and then everyone was smoking
Canadian_Brony: Unless Saxy's playing tricks and using Asuka pics and her intro to screw with us
otakon: since when does shizuka use youtube. also the pic is just a lie
even the bear
Yeah, I'm getting off to shower up and get to bed. And catch this cockroach. Ugh.
kirz|art: can I ask you something?
that's because he's a pussy, not a boob :p
And then talking bears
Smoking in a kid's cartoon; this is old.

twilight_sprinkle: hmmm good point

Buytoast: Evangelion
pandabear: um you're in chat.... you should be able to see it

Canadian_Brony: Intimated?
13and now you know
that the show with the robot chick with the teal hair?
Shizuka: he gets rid of it though but yh
I really want to make it far,this is really the largest camp I joined that is running,good luck to everyone!

SOUR CREAM
that line is a god
flutterchu: Please don't spam that.
dis is good.
Shizuka: sure they could with a long enough line folded on itself over and over
Shizuka: if the line is always connecyed, it can be made by a single unbroken line
line be crashin the party
AJIsAwesome: but that's all that taco says in "inanimate insanity"
a voice that sounded like bad plumbing
13what about those snowflakes then
13or are you all way behind

kirz|art: are ou still complaining about lyra?
this is what happens when you do drugs before math homework
twilight_sprinkle: :D
kirz|art: Lyra` isnt as bad as you think she is
if/when she convinces me she'll never act on the threats she made against the site over the 6 months of ban evading, then I may forgive
kirz|art: She is absolutely as bad as you think she is.
Hey, we never got to hear about the two guys!
kirz|art: oh

Funny thing, Titanic came on TV the other day
Can't we just stare at teh fire?
Or we could watch a video of paint drying.
Is there a Back to the Future rifftrax?
That could be equally fun.

Meanwhile, I've tried that.

Cause it's party time
It's fun when you have imaginary people to talk to

Meanwhile: But... Borderlands 2
plug it in plug it in

Borderlands is a shitty game.

This is the original right?

2nd best pony: OH COME ON!!!!!!!!
Time for the rapping dog
Meanwhile: that's nice ^_^
Meanwhile and i repect that opinion...and my opinion is that your opinion is douchy~
YES!
Blitzwing: parappa the rappa
hmmm a little on the long side
but YES!
Cya everypony, I gtg
DeathStar: You're weird.
the second one is lets see how many reference jokes we can stuff into a game because we can't make any good ones ourself
Bye, DerpyMuffins. :)

13i want to get minecraft pocket on my phone but... apps automatically get paid for by the phone bill, no option to put your own card in .-.
lame
13yeah struck me as odd..
Shizuka: Its not as great as you might think.
that's a stupid -__-
That doesn't look like a diamond...
13it looked like it could be a nice distraction
my phone can play tetris...that is about it
J_E_Smith71: i love google XD
Shizuka: it's tedious just to walk and jump -lol
/me doesn't have a phone
you can still get the demo shizuka
13got used to it pretty quick
Marry him
Shizuka: You can't add a card?
I would
He's bueatiful
And rich
Shizuka: Yeah you are a quick one so im not surprised. -lol
13oni_link: in play store? buying an app adds the cost to the phone bill, doesn't give me an option to put in my own card
:o
ewww an Adam
/me huggles Jmo

hi AdamTheDuck
hiya AdamTheDuck you are in time for Titanic Rifftrax man
ALL DEM HUGS.
I DEMAND MOAR.
hmmm...you would think the Play Store would want to do direct billing and sidestep the cell provider
DOn't be selfish jaymoo. :<
/me hugs Jmo moar .-.
Shizuka, I've had my phone pop up a message about the battery overheating when I've been using the wifi on it all day
DeadPoolDash: enope
Or when it's charging.
/me hugs Jmo
brb guys checking soemthing on LIVE
but I feel so lonely ;_;
but you've got DWR..
/me hugs Jmo
Shizuka: Yeah in the play store. When you go to check out, usually where the price shows up and the payment option is listed, you can tap on it to change how you are going to pay for the app. I pay by card all the time.
but he isn't here.
/me hugs Jmo
13hm..

*make
DeadPoolDash: they sure do. Especially since I cracked its screen >.>
13i'm used to amazon's one click crap on kindle that doesn't give you much chance to say WAIT THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A CLICK
I have yet to use a kindle of any kind. I do everything through my phone or laptop/
So much technology nowadays
my GoPhone works just fine for me, good old pay as i need it, no contracts
Phones
I don't know if I would prefer a Kindle or Nook
Computers
Cars
I love reading
13kindle touch is nice, takes a couple seconds to get used to the refresh rate if i'm fresh off my phone, but i like it a lot
-lol like a mayun
Its weird
ASoftFluffyThing: Same.
alrighty, night all. as always, thanks for the stream Shizuka
13way better for reading in bed than keeping paperbacks folded open
I like folded pages in my books

Im not much for reading. I have yet to find something I can commit to.
Drink a glass of lemonade first. That'll make those bad boys fly -lol

I like that woman
the snake pit

13i've heard the paperwhite has a bit of a bug with the lighting at the bottom, darker spots show through right at the edge
Watching this is making me want to finish playing 999...especially since the sequel comes out on Tuesday...

13i believe it vented the kitchens though
were is sponge bob
Oh dear, is this the famed drawing scene?
Think so.
13they wanted a fourth because the other big boats only had three, but i'm pretty sure they had it vent the kitchens so it wasn't completely useless
13and yes this is the drawing room scene
Use of color? You mean everywhere?

Nuuu, im sleepy x_x
Oh god, get the links ready everyone.

Mega_Milk, well because it was such a clear night and the water was still, the iceberg was hard to see
i have no idea wat they said
stick your tongue out at the iceberg
ASoftFluffyThing: yeah thats true.
damn jews
Mega_Milk, can't see shit in the middle of the ocean in a moonless night with still waters. And it was spring so all the bergs weren't fully melted at the time.
lol whoa
all the jokes in the movie keep sinking
LOL
All the secrets of this movie are behind the picture.
dem rats
It's already started to sink
the iceberg was wearing 3D glasses and was like it's like it's coming right towards me
13the iceberg tried to wave the titanic out of the way but
13well
LOL
13iceberg
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO|
pony
Well, the picture moved instead.
hahahaha
Did he just say pony?
13and he did say pony
first drawn pony
ponies =D
cool
13do not get your hopes up though, this is from 2007 or so
Shizuka: he did
3/4 its size on 3 out of the 4th movie.
guess ill head off too
see you
>says pony, gets batshit crazy
Mega_Milk: also, new moon. And the guy who supposed to get telegraph messages decided to take a nap right when they were trying to warn them of possible icebergs
lol
13also mike has tweeted he isn't a fan of ponies himself but he respects that there's a fandom for it
00,10but if I wanted to see chat and the movie I would just look to the right
stip search
Who pinged me? I'm not leaving?
13after all mst3k wouldn't have escaped the twin cities if not for epic fandom
13ohai sumi~
MadSurge: Or he was on the crapper -lol
00,10psssssst, Shizuka, you movie is not centered
Shizuka: and that's a great way to respect the fandom without being part of it.
Sumica: Sup mica /)
13oh... scrcap failed again....
00,10ohhi
I agree MadSurge
13why didn't ponies tell me earlier >>
finnally
ok OK Fine ..i DID IT ... IIIIIIII Droped the Screeew in the Tunnnna
I thought you knew.....
MadSurge, don't forget that Captain Smith disregarded all the iceberg warnings.
Shizuka: I thought you were doing it on pupose -lol
00,10Tovler did Shizuka
Shizuka: I thought you knew, and I thought you were doing something.
"Oh, icebergs tonight? FULL STEAM AHEAD, I'M UNSINKABLE!"
13><

Shizuka: we thought you were doing something like when you censored that scene :S
13i blame jet lag..
ASoftFluffyThing: dem idiot captains amirite

:( I missed the Inception rifftrax again
13i blame jet lag .-.
thks too funny
over 9000
MadSurge, well he kept disregarding because he wanted to get to NY in the span of two days or as fast as possible. Something along those lines
dammit! Stop with the Cubs jokes! DX
DINKLEBURG........
Shizuka: Flying sucks no matter how you put it. :|
That was one of the issues
oooooooooooooooooooooh shit
penguins and their tuxes are known for slapping
13wasn't too terrible, ears popped more when we were at altitude than on takeoff like they used to
he just got blue shelled
she had a bug on her cheek
ASoftFluffyThing: "hahaha, Icebergs? They're gonna be icecubes! Now let's beat that record!"
put on your stripper cloths
13that and on the flight home we could actually see the ground rather than getting blinded by clouds
And this dude looks like Humphrey Bogart
ok 1 pudding
MadSurge: Iceberg--that'sssss a nice ssssship you have. Ssssshame if something happ--LOLWHOOPS, you hit me.
Thats good Shizu. I hate flying. Im always so uncomfortable
and this is how equestria was made
ASoftFluffyThing: lol

"i'm sorry about dying"
11,02Let's take a disaster and tack on a love story to it.
00,10just wait till friday
NewSuperBronyU: You know all those funn commentss you wanna say during a movie but dont due to tactfulness.
00,10lets take a disaster movie and attach a titanic to it
god dammit
:( There isn't a Rifftrax of 2012
NewSuperBronyU: Rifftrax is those comments.
11,02Mega_Milk: That's a rifftrax?
NewSuperBronyU: eeyup.
00,10lol I have no tact then Mega_Milk
Mega_Milk: minus the "fun"
Sumica: I'm more eager to see movie A :3
11,02So anypony who puts comments to these movies are rifftrax?
Sumica: :P
SB RiffTrax is the same guys that did Mystery Science 3000
11,02So then MST3K is a rifftrax
08,01i should stream the two Titanic cartoons
08,01back to back

00,10cause yeah you know that part where it gets realy quite at the end of resident evil just after they give the girl the cure

AdamTheDuck: Whos the color-swapped fiddle Tavi?

HoodyNinja, probably just an OC

kids drowning in their sleep. wow.
hello evry body sory im late
/me licks Gentelmen-geeky
hi Gentelmen-geeky
00,10if only they made it with 6001 hulls
Ohai :P
whats tradgic is the titanic had a double hull while the great eastern (a ship built MANY years before) had a double hull and survived a much larger impact than the titanic
*test*
/me noms AdamTheDuck
oni_link: better than drowning while awake :I
DERp
titanic had a single hull
hello NocturnalBlade
great eastern had a double
single hulls are a bad idea for large ships
MadSurge: Thats true.
i like his face
Sumica: "Ok kids your gonna go to sleep, for a really really really long time, should you feel a sudden choking sensation, dont worry! Your just dying.
like a sir
00,10Phase4 needs more futurama
XD
Spectrum_Rush: is the only way to die
Sumica, if only they had built it with 1001 hulls!

Sumica: The chalk drawing? -lol
11,02Ship has been sinking for a while now...why hasn't anybody called upon the Sea Ponies yet?!

Black friday stampeded
Another problem, that rudder is MUCH too small for a ship that huge
NewSuperBronyU, ikr
NewSuperBronyU, XD
NewSuperBronyU: they are not believers
NewSuperBronyU, Titanic was "unsinkable", remember?
08,01this
08,01is a terrible film
I think that was way to die #666
?
11,02ASoftFluffyThing: True, so technically the ship isn't sinking, this is just a feature of it.
cg isn't too bad
smelt!
well imo its not terrible, bu pretty dull, yeah

00,10I can stand seeing it again
indeed
13here we go
NewSuperBronyU: For 3 episodes.
13BOIOIOIOIOIOING
YES
NewSuperBronyU, there would also be mechas inbound and everyones breast would be inexplicably large

AdamTheDuck: am i a bad person for laghing at this move but crying at the end of godzilla vs destroyer when godzilla died
If only that ship was nuclear powered :'(
ASoftFluffyThing: -olololol
11,02'Could've gone with the HTC One X while I had the chance...'
00,10it's like slapstick
Poor woman. Imagine witnessing something like that and your only child is on that ship.
Gentelmen-geeky, no, I feel the same way XD
Sumica: pony comedic sociopathy :D
this isnt a bad bit of effect here
NewSuperBronyU: what did you go with instead?
AdamTheDuck: yay see you in hell mate

Panda|Homework: becous your a wizerd

they should make this into an amusment ride, and no. not the blow up one you see at the state fair
13did you ever see that roller coaster video where a rather large woman is slipping out of the seat and getting stuck in the seatbelts? that's it
11,02The ending to this movie really left huge plot holes, they really should make a sequel...wait a minute...
^ XD
00,10yup
NewSuperBronyU wow XD
eeyup
/me has never seen Titanic 2
NewSuperBronyU: XD
Because the more Pandas the better?

NewSuperBronyU, >.> i like plot holes and plot twists >:3
MY LEG
00,10would have been funny as hell if it just stuck like that
I want a Titanic movie told from the perspective of the Iceberg.
Phase4: I was not unfortunately
+400
/me inserts pingball noises
watched here die
00,10and yes the plachinko line came to me
BOING
best quote from that movie "WHERES THE TAPE!?!?!?!?"
oni_link, not unfortunately, you are one of the lucky ones
00,10well before mst3k
All those poor souls will never experience the joys of Spanish Influenza
Phase4: I feel better knowing that .
Tovler: Ikr
hahaha
11,02When's the part where the ship sinks?
my favorite movie quote is "some days you just can't get rid of a bomb"
00,10is he screwing her?
NewSuperBronyU: I think it's coming... MAYBE
That rudder....is so tiny
00,10cause she keeps going oh god oh god again
twilight_sprinkle: ello
ASoftFluffyThing, indeed
ohai Gentelmen-geeky
11,02OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN
Sumica: :D
odd time to have sex
mythbusters tested the sucking thing
ASoftFluffyThing: dont make fun of the boats small rudder, its rude lol
Sumica: she forgot to bite the pillow :S
It was funny when Mythbusters busted the reason why Jack had to die.
turns out it doesnt happen
Arsenal: 1 Liverpool: 0
care for a spot of tea twilight_sprinkle
I never saw the Mythbusters episode of this.
00,10am I the only one that say the reviset of that one Phase4?
Gentelmen-geeky: eh no thanks, im about to go to bed, tea will keep me up~
00,10they found it plausable
Aaaaand it finally sank!
The director was pissed
DeadpoolDash|ME3, why'd Jack have to die.
twilight_sprinkle: ah
Panda: you so derpy
That's a huge swimming pool
Gentelmen-geeky: imma afk for a bit
11,02CALL THE SEA PONIEZ
they said jack had to die cause the wood wouldnt support both of them
twilight_sprinkle: ok
DeathStar >.> I have no idea why...
and you know? if they just hadnt fueled the ship so much,it wouldnt have hit the ice berg
Sumica, iirc the plausable one involved a high density of bubbles, which doesnt apply that much to this
In icy water like that, would peeing actually make a difference?
but that isnt the case
DeathStar: hello
If someone had yelled Adult Swim, they would know to get out of the water.
oni_link, no
Gentelmen-geeky: hello
so jack died needlessly
DeathStar I figured out why I am lagging D:
Ah I see.
how are you mis DeathStar
Just keep swimming
11,02Keep doing that thing that you've been doing since you first got in the water!
call upon the C ponies, when ur in distress!
DeadpoolDash|ME3: there's also the fact that she could have moved over...
/me signals the SOS
thats the point
00,10I saw a pony version of this, blue blood was standing on the door looking down at ratity.
08,01DeathStar! I'm howling at the moon! And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon!
Panda: helpfull as can be ponies simply send as S.O.S
you know two pepol can fit on that door
or if they hit the iceberg dead on with the front of the god damn ship,it would have only hit the first few things and they would have stayed afloat
there was plenty of room for both and wood could of held their mass
DeathStar: nope, we must have a dramatic xcene.
plenty bouyent enough for two but dificult to balance, therefore we give up and let jack drown
smelt, and if Captain had taken heed to the obvious iceberg warnings that he was getting since DAY ONE.
i'm k with that
DeathStar so TAKE YOUR TYRANY AWAY~!!!!
exactly
Panda: >.>
I know at this point his nads have retracted back into him.
making him a woman.
the director got angry and said Jack had to die cause it was in script
When does the narhwall bacon
DeathStar: the sos was not ivented yet thay you uesd a defrent
and DeathStar >.> what?
the people on that boat should have thrown the captain off the ship
The HMS Romney intercepted the distress signal but went meh.
Phase4 at midnight?
Gentelmen-geeky: ... I think the SOS would have been invented...
Tovler, oh god lol
DeathStar: thay didnt ues it back then thay had a mor complceted one
lol
00,10swim back fatty, you can probably hold 10 yourself
Sumica: lol
Gentelmen-geeky: ah I see. well I'm sure the sea ponies of the time would have known about it
Sumica: she holds blubber, she was made for that XD
Sumica: -lol or atleast give a shark some serious artery clogging.
Sumica: fat dose float.....
DeathStar: mor than likely
08,01Panda: mission accomplished

/me randomly thinks of Cornelius Fudge's Political Action Committee
DeadpoolDash|ME3: lol why?

Sumica, trust me, it will
AdamTheDuck: aye

oh right tori is the girl varient
dat datalogger
*shlushies, watevs
00,10no i would not, but it's kinda funny to see the slow motion of his expresion.
Tori is the only useful person in my opinion of the build team
00,10You dont like grant?
Tory is the spelling yeah, can't remember his last name
Grant is fun-
00,10balachie

oni_link, its funny because it didnt happen to me
ah yes Tory Balechi or something yeah
Grant makes robots, therefore is OK
Tory Belleci
Phase4: Indeed XD
Grant wimps out so much and a lot of his ideas are the same ones over and over again
00,10Grant was in battle bots and junkyardwars
It's spelled Belleci
Ooh- I havent seen junk yard wars in yeeaaars
Ah thanks gold
I have him on my tweet- but I always forget
Sumica: ah i remember those shos, used to watch em all the time
everything can be solved by remote control
And robots
00,10loved junkyard wars even though you knew it was running low on ideas
At least according to Grant, everything can be solved with remote control and robots. XD
only so much ya can do with junk
i want one of those
00,10and adam feels all things can be soloved with balistics
Kari is just in the show for the fanservice

Moooo
mythbusters brand
00,10this ep was just an excuse for them to justafy them buying a slaushy machine
Hehe yeah
Sumica, best excuse
Sumica: always worth it
and then the workshop was blue
Sumica: You need an excuse for that?
00,10well if you want to write it off so discovery channle pays for it instead of them
Mmm slushy
lol
Write-offs, aw yeah
Sumica: Ah right, "for science!"
00,10exactly
I often wonder if the discovery channel checks to see what these guys are spending their money on
DeadpoolDash|ME3, i hope so
00,10bandaids and explosives
because it meens they're allowing it
:3
I think they keep a very close watch, that and hteir insurance company
Ninja Grant's turn
00,10notice they moved the rig.
ah yeah, away from the windows
this is dumb, the guys from Ninja Warrior do this shit all the time

Me.
00,10he's not gonna last more then a second
Yo Kencolt
And these people have never seen Ninja Warrior.
still they should have invited some of those guys over for this test
TheRainbowDawn: we must be like the same
00,10yeah
Kencolt: Ninja Warrior is the shit
Can anyone suggest what to do that doesn't fart your brain?
Spell-of-Gaming, programing?
what is the myth they're testing?
TheRainbowDawn x therainbowvortex OTP
How many tvshows with so high contenstant drop off like that are out there?
*rate
I doubt I'll be able to program this week
AdamTheDuck: i dont know what otp means

Vivix: eeyup

DERP
I think it should be obvious
Don't do this at home, never seen one unless youtube or stream
TheRainbowDawn: hey dude are you new here
pony_358516, probably the ones in mythbusters
DeadpoolDash|ME3: the point was to prove that normal people CAN'T.

Canterlot <,<
At the same time?

TheRandomkid321, not yet, i might extend it in the future
I used Hamachi until I found the Hard Reset button of my router.
Multitasking, never let anyone tell you you can't
00,10clown car airbag
Phase4 Okay. I just like small servers with a normal, basic spawnpoint.
00,10want to see it?
laminated glass
Sumica, wait what?
Vivix: um no because in the seesion 2 final she enters cantalot from outside the barriea witch hints she lives eleswhere

Trrreeexeeeeiiihh
all the commercials
I used to download simpsons as a kid
and I used to love watching the ads
Vivix: then you took a pony to the knee?
Oh noo-I wish
00,10Discovery has imposably long ad's
International dating site. Sounds leg-- No, wait, it doesn't. It's a RIDICULOUS idea.
Vivix: I still think Japan has some of the best ones
still a better love story than twilight
Oh yeah, crazy ads-
dammit whore get of the screen
this is kinda sad... just a tad.
internet lovin
Sumica: not on italian cable
fup moonshine
uhh
Sometimes Discovery makes me sad
making moonshine isnt illegal
selling it is
i use to like ponys but then i took a awrow to the kneew now i love ponys AdamTheDuck
True, but there's some limitations to its legality
here it's completely illegal
selling, making, drinking, or distributing
00,10selling with out paying taxes is the illegal part
^
SCIENCE
AdamTheDuck: tou like octavia right
00,10hell they sell moonshine at Lee's liquer here in vegas
therainbowvortex, indeed, sorry I'm playing Killing Floor
the government wants its cut
because EXPLOSIONS
Ryunosuke: In the US? yes, it IS. Making distilled liquor- or nearly any kind-- is illegal unless you pay the tax. And the definition of moonshine is untaxed, unaged whiskey.
uh oh
I don't know why its illegal in Norway, probably same reason Kencolt
Unlicenced production, and health codes
Hey sumica "T.N.T!"
Vivix: Would make sense. Like it or not, the gummint needs taxes to run.
yeah
/me happily pays taxes
AdamTheDuck: hey ill leave u alone then but just one thing ive been wondering for ages is your name yr real one adam
Vivix: And yeah-- no quality control.
and especially, food and alcohol needs to be regulated for the safety of the customers
There was a wave of Methanol moonshine in Norway
people died, and people went blind
Vivix: Same thing in Czech Republic not so long ago.
Vivix: Methanol? OH--- KAAAAYY. That's downright toxic.
Yeaah, they used it to eh thin it out, to make more money
reaalllyy unsafe and bad practice
IM IN A PLASTIC TUBE OF EMOTION
methanol =/= ethanol. Remmber kids - one letter might be a difference between life and death
Yep~
00,10well that was expected
00,10two men walk in to a bar one says give me h2o, the othere says give me h2o too.
AdamTheDuck: oki loki doki
WHOA.
00,10the second guy died
ohoho sumica, u nerd
Sumica: :D
AdamTheDuck: dam it wrong order
In our chemistry book they had an example on how people can be fooled into thinking things
Sumica: didnt you make that joke already
00,10yep
they had a warning leaflet, with the full name of H2O (which I can't remember) and all the things, inhaling is deadly, and all the warnings
and said "Please help us band it today!"
ban*
Brilliant demonstration on how people can make uneducated decisions based on propoganda-
00,10ah the penn and teller thing yeah Vivix?
Vivix: I think Penn&Teller did that
Not sure, it was in our school books
Printed..1998 I guess, r94 school reform
00,10brb, feeling snackie
Mm~
What,..was that an ad for?
brb, getting breakfast.
"MAAANLY CAR"
Twizzlers. A red licorice-like candy with a faint strawberry falavor. HORRIBLE stuff to my mind, Vivix .
lol
these ads
Hehe
haha
gotta love fosters ads
But the one before it, the ups store? I thought they only did shipping-
I'm australian and never heard of taht beer.
really?
sa_Sog yes.
free data tracking
Discord
that actor
therainbowvortex: Discord, and the Nightmare.
and various other 'villains'
Discord and Nightmare--hey yeah those are probably the best example-
Well if you ask me. If there was a pony satan it would be discord
But I see Celestia (and Luna) not so much as "gods" avatars of deity.
yeah Demi-gods or deities
00,10but yeah been having all thses fancy partys at work with like tons of meat and cheese platters
30 minute show... with 15 minutes of ads

that is way you change channels during commercials
00,10so yeah I been liberating the leftovers
Kencolt: i kinda agree when i think about it nightmear is the closet to a fallen angle
heh ever read the fine print on those international dating sites?
Heh, internet dating
"OMG what is that?
"
god they are STILL going on about Bigfoot?
Nightmare could probably be a danger to all ascended alicorns-
00,10Sumi want big boom
if you want to meed them you gotta pay like $6k
RoboGerbil Eeeyup
I used to mock people who online date when I was young
they need to go deeper
*rimshot*
trenches in ww1 were deeper
Particularly ROBLOX, which is now full of crap.
00,10I love how you can see the shock charge
I thouht WW1 trenches were so shallow you had to crouch?
in the frontlines
not really
i think you could stand shot from there
The only trench I remember is from Pink Floyd's The Wall
Vivix: No. In fact, some were as deep as eight feet, and had cruse steps built for the next (usually futile) chrage.
uhh
duh?
Charge.
The Great War had pretty complex trench systems
Aah, makes sense- they were there for a really long time
because the trench contained the blast and it had no where to go :p
WWI was all about trenches
00,10and then the tank
WW1 Games, I want one
Spell-of-Gaming yeah. I miss the old roblox. Back when a game with no moe than a bunch of zombies and a few buildings was really popular. Now the maker has said, and I quote "We believ Roblox will be the prime engine for independant game makers to use from now on" Or something along those lines.
inb4 clown car jokes :)
tanks and machine guns were the biggest factors in the Great War
Maxim, yeah
and the introduction of airplanes
or the name
Guys, was the SCP website made before or after around 2007?
ROBLOX used to be popular until it became a toilet full of outdated memes
I didn't think tanks were succesful in ww1 though-
Actually, I mean good
00,10inbefor wiplash death
I'd think that bounce would make the impact worse.
Spell-of-Gaming for me it was the new games and people. But there are outdated memes all over it... And so much copyrighted material. EXPECIALLY MINECRAFT!
00,10it's not the bound, it's the rebound
I found Roblox in Newgrounds :3
right
Spell-of-Gaing what year?
I hate blowing balooons--
Sumica: ask Spiderman's second love interest
uh oh
The bounce hits you harder than the landing.
Vivix: dat feling behind you ears

Around '08.

Yeah, Cadence is cool. I didn't expect her to be, but--she really turned out nice

I can't for the life of me abide by the official spelling though, since her real name is Cadenza, Cadance just don't make sense, pronunciation or otherwise-

Cadance and Cadenza are technically the same thing

Midersan™
yeah, I can't stand it-
NLR or SE hmm? Well the way I see it (and the way my fanfic i'm writing says it) the NLR is like a rebellion and the SE is a dictatorship.
so Iw rite Cadence
Gold_Demona: only different languages
Hey whos using my username thats Moopy? can you at least just knock it off
MadSurge: Exactly
Mi Amore Cadenza means "My Love Cadance"
I support neither NLR or SE, but there's probably a good fic along those lines ou there I can read
THAT MOOPY IS A SPAI!
but is Cadance the right spelling as a word?
Im not a spy
Vivix: I pronounce it "kaydense"
Midersan™ is very arigatoful
I say Kaydense too, hence Cadence with an e-

There's noone named Moopy on the list.
/me can't grammar
I do call her "Mi amore Cadenza" sometimes just for the giggles :D
Cadance is not a word in English, Cadence is though
well it said Moopy is already in use thats what it said on my screen
Well, the WORD is spelled "Cadence"
try changing it
The name is spelled Cadance
I just think the pronunciation changes too much with the a
Sumica: how do you do that
I sometimes do find all replace in Cadence fics-
Who cares about spelling
I do <3
TheRandomkid321, NLR or SE? I say neither, go for the winning P.A.R.T.Y. http://fav.me/d417vyv
It's too mainstream
Vivix: I honestly don't hear a difference. "Cadance" is pronounced "kay dense" to me. =/
Maybe it's my foreign ears-
Can't wait what mispellings Season 3 will bring :D
00,10good question therainbowvortex, I would recomend asking in #help
Can we discuss on how we pronounce "Giygas" now?
00,10cause I forgot
If I ever wrote Cadence stuff, I would probably abide by standard spelling because- standards are standards, but- I'd personally say cadence
Sumica: lol
00,10I only needed to do it once
So how do i use nick again?
slash nick
/nick
TheRandomkid321, type /ns help

Ok hang on a minute'
You only do it once
thanks for filling my chat AdamTheDuck

Wait do i say nick when changing it back or?

Isn't there a muted vowel to smooth the transition? I usually hear Kaydens

Plausible, but not yet confirmed.
ce, cad(a)-nce\ as a girl’s name is a variant of Cadence (Latin), and the meaning of Cadance is “with rhythm”.Read more at http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Cadance#6RC62DFGmwdWxEpM.99

No exact results found for Cadance in the dictionaries.
Cadenza is an italian word, where the translation is Cadence

Vivix: yep
Cadence is a musical term, IIRC
Vivix: Cadance isn't a word. It's a name based on the word "cadence"

Great Costume *snicker*

I'm sure they had fun, but- their reaction to the critique was kinda <,<

Vivix, ah
time for me to watch the transformers one

What gets me about this is apparently someone actually translated -- as best as could be done-- from Korean to Kingonese.
This will be us in 20 years
after MLP is done
00,10I was under the impresion they made there own lyrics for this
Vivix: COnsidering my age, that's a scary thing to say.
Hehe
Kencolt: its the internet ofc they did, hell they probably coulda done it even 30 years ago
You'll be our overseer

Me too, somehow

I finally stopped humming it, but now here it is again XD

00,10all acording to plan AdamTheDuck
It's Claire Corlett by the way
MadSurge, indeed :3
not Cottril
CrimsonPhoenix: I am terrible at remembering names :|
please don't hide the fact that her dad is goddang Ian James Corlett
SCOOTALOO
What's scary is someone took a YTP type video from the show-- and almost totally redid it in Source. One wonders WHY except to show he COULD.
good SFM
her names spelled Claire Corlett
Probably bored, full of caffeine, and a lonely saturday night
Kencolt: because the GMod models look really good now?
00,10exactly Kencolt
Wel.. Sweetie bells voice actor seems really annoying... and immature... basically all around a big ball of wibbly wobbly hatey watey stuff... bottom line... I don't like her.
TheRandomkid321, well....she IS a kid
i watched this on youtube :D
00,10yes cause she totaly is't 12 and an actriss TheRandomkid321
CrimsonPheonix I don't like kids... No need to point out the irony...
00,10I knida want the map they are useing for this video
I just had an idea... a Comparision video between this and the "original". Might be interewsting to see.
I don't know any of the VA's, so I don't like or dislike any of them
TheRandomkid321: hat to break it to ya , but you are a kid
00,10would be easy enough to make now Kencolt
Sumica she is 12 and made a excrement joke? God am I even the same spe- Must not cause hate

I don't like this video for 2 reasons
tombstone's voice and those creepy looking forward eyes.
trixie and repetitive beat?
PONY DOWN! I REPEAT! GREY PONY DOWN!
I only caught teh end of the audio
oj neeej fan heller
AND NOW WE GO BACK IN TIME
creepy broken pony knees and odd faces
Eeeeeeeeew Engliiiiiiiish
CrimsonPhoenix That's offensive to tombstone.
Its not, really
no it not
TheRandomkid321, I'm sorry but I cannot stand his voice when it comes to singing
when I sing people can openly dislike my voice, its just how taste works
For the record, I don't mind Trixie being hammy or an arrogant stage magician, it's her braggart/jerk attitude that makes me go mad
I like her attitude, but in real life, I'd shun her-
CrimsonPhoenix is it his accent? I persoaly love his singing
I mean he's a cool guy and all but
opinions opinions opinions
I only caught the end, but it sounded really - unenergetic then
I don't think even his accent is the whole fault
It is possible to appreciate someone's talent without actually liking the sound they make.
/me eyes look at stream for a sec
That it is
OH GOD KILL THEM WITH FIRE!
It's a matter of taste
^
>Hating on CaramellDansem
No I mean the ponys. They look distorted
Oh shit you just didn't GO there
I'm the same way with voice actor Sonny Strait. The man's a good voice actor, but I don't like the sound of his voice.
Fluttershy would never agree to do a caramelldansen vid, she's too shy :D
There's a lot of that in music
What's this song?
not everyone can like everything, its just not possible
U^
If everyone liked everything, there'd be a lot less hate. =/
There would- but there'd probably be less fun on the outskirts of music
AUSTRALIA YEAH!
if you liked everything then that means you'd have to like all the bad too
Is this from that Horrible guy's singing blog?
MadSurge, indeed
Gold_Demona, but the worldn't wouldn't be as interesting if there wasn't any conflict :3
I mean, I respect and appreciate artists I don't like, and that's enough I guess
Vivix: This is true
What is this song I must KNOW!
AdamTheDuck: This is also true
unless they're really mean to me or peopel around them, but then noones thinking rationally
PONY CANTINA :D
Dat cantina music. XD
Gold_Demona, oops I mean world wouldn't*
Like example
AdamTheDuck: I knew what you meant. :D
Gold_Demona: but then the world would just be wrong
MadSurge: There's a Vocaloid vid out there, with the Mane six doing a song and dancing. Well, five are. Fluttershy is huddled up in a corner. (Warning, humanised-- Vocaloid can't handle full ponies yet.)
I cannot stand Dubstep and I think it's a step in the wrong way in the music industry

But that is just an opinion.
We all have our views.
Derp!
Oh God hahaha xD

It's a it sad Phase4 has creeper damage off. Turned me off the server. Anyone else have any opinions on this matter?
TheRandomkid321, ehh, he likes to play Minecraft for the building, so be it.
I actually wouldn't mind to be honest
TheRandomkid321, can still kill you though
TheRandomkid321: what deny the loving damage of the creeoer mother

I personally wouldn't want to spend hours building something just to have a creeper up and wreck it. =/
but my door is still intact
00,10it's bad enough his place is gonna blow up when the engiens overheat
AdamTheDuck yeah. I'm one of the people who play it for the constant thrill and sense of adventure.
TheRandomkid321: me too that and the crepers
I've never played Minecraft, but I'd probably play it for the building and not much else.
Yeah, that's why I played it
Gold_Demona That's part of the fun!
I like making things
NewSuperBronyU, go to bread. :P
in Technic I had a stable, with unicorns and pegasi- horses and stuff

AdamTheDuck, but they're normally smaller than me and less numerous
dat Friday Polka
AdamTheDuck: u have 6_9
oh they were good times
my plan was to use obsidian pipe to pick up dropped ore
for when the macerator is full
ok, and I have to go again xD don't know how long this will take
but that broke
AdamTheDuck: Wait... So you named yourself Adam after the first Angel?
Gold_Demona, eeyup :P
That's awesome. XD
I already know the duck part. :3
So yeah, my real name isn't Adam. :P
Nice mashup
so wait what is your first name
It is a mystery 6_9
lol
You could probably find it if you manage to find my Skype :P
But I liked being refered to as Adam
whats your skype name
Uhh... Damnit I keep it on autologin...
And I don't have Skype on my laptop
I might as well retell my "duck" part of the story again to you therainbowvortex :P

Back in the day, back in 'Nam
We were outnumbered 4 to 1

Oh wait, wrong story
AdamTheDuck:

My cat is reminding me that he's "starving" brb. :P
So my class had to watch a documentary at school, a documentary on the Arctic
i gess u just like ducks?
k
It was kind of boring but then the food chain part of the documentary played, and there was this duck
The best duck in the world because it couldn't hunt
it had to scavenge for food
and it started eating old seal flesh
and that was awwwwwwesome
awwwwwsome
Meat eating duck is best duck
and so, the two parts of my name came together, Adam from Evangelion and a duck from an Arctic documentary about scavenging ducks that eat flesh/
back
okay now the hardest part of you name where ever did you get the duck
hallo everypony o.o

Hard high school puts hair on your chest
CRUSH.......KILL......DESTROY.......swag.

Swag used to be a cool word, I mean burglers used to put it on their sacks :(
hahahaha
/me frets for youth, because there is no good way to let them know that after it's done, life gets a lot cooler and better, and even if not, people actually want to help you through life after.
I don't like the word

Yeah
wow
I like the word I hate what's been done to it.

Everlasting_Joy: :D Shadowbolt Dash would be proud
Nahp
From a car?
From a penguin.
Happened to me, no joke, in Las Vegas

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
Honestly.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: :).
And also ends up in bronystate chat

Jmo by that logic four years of my life are just unaccounted for.

Since she teaches... what is it, third graders? I forget
If her name was Quinn she could be a doctor, no?
Maybe she's "The Frizzle" XD

is youtube down for anyone else ?
not for me.
Hey, I got a question about cutie marks please. Are cutie marks reversed on each flank? Eg. I just got a rdash wallet and the cutie mark is reversed from what I normally see on her left flank, but this wallet shows her right flank. Is that a mistake on the wallet manufacturer, or is this actually accurate? http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13341665
tl;dr
that doesn't look right.
pony_064236 I guess so...or you're looking into it too much, either way
Don't know, never paid that much attention to cutie mark placement.
^
also, sup pony_064236

Meanwhile: I got one better, got the direct hit as a random drop during the rounds... and then got another one as the reward
hm...videogames
Spectrum_Rush: Too bad you can't dual wield them really. The crate I picked up between rounds dropped me a strange FAN, which is nice because I've been missing a strange scout weap for a while.

I've been trying to find someone who'll swap my strange botkiller knife for something because I have a regular strange knife already. No luck on that front.

Jmo: Maybe later, no absolute promises though
Domo: unless you're unable to op yourself like you had yesterday

Though I gotta appreciate your sense of humour. :P
Jmo: Pete is my husband's name. O.o
o.o
I promise we didn't talk.
lol
I think I'd know if you did. He doesn't keep secrets. XD
Nor do I for that matter
<.<
The magic of stuff.
Dken2021 and Jmo: Visiting the Smithsonian and seeing the area. You get to have weird wishes when you grew up in africa. :P
Lovely stoof.

Oh Africa, that's something.
SafariMonkey well, enjoy yourself there!

schools gonna throw big pills at me, just got 2 books for one class for this year, contained in total 1500+ pages
pills.
Jmo: Tell that to the metres-long snakes and deadly scorpions I killed
yeah, its a term for very big books
Pffft.
Gold_Demona: Hence my nick
Thems big snakes
Come play with our spiders.
:>
id rather not, i stay away from spiders now for at least a month
I like how some books for classes cost alot and it's just a binder with paper you put in
My attic is full of big ol' spiders that keep crawling into my kitchen through a whole right above the sink.
or at least untill i got that fic out of my mind...
I keep finding drowned spiders when I do dishes. >.>
eww
I love spiders.
I love them when they're outside. I don't want them in my house
Gold_Demona: My record is 5 metres and big enough that you could hold it with 2 hands without your hands touching. But then, no need to brag, most of you never got the chance.

If only ashie-poo was here.
Not sure if adorable or creepy
I'm sure his heart'd blow up.
Yep.
Dat pic
Oh boy... We get some snakes here too, but they're nowhere near that big.
Black racers that like to slip around my house and across my lawn
Meanwhile dont do that
My husband runs them over with the lawnmower. >:3
DOIT MEANWHILE DOIT
Wow Dema, Pete is cruel. ;_;
Hey is there a stream going on? cause i need to go refresh the stream here
Jmo: He hates snakes more than I do
Jmo: http://i.imgur.com/dNu3w.jpg
aren't black racers harmless?
They're just snakes :<
or am I thinking of something else
lol Snow.
I believe so, but we have lots of different snakes here, so there's no way to be sure.
Snow: You saved that?
eeeeyup
Chances are it's a black racer, but it COULD be something else entirely
Pfft.
Poke it with a stick.
:>
lol Jmo
hit it with a whip
The scientific method right there, poke it with a stick.
see if you can tame it
Whip it, whip it good.
Whip it good?
lol
Ninja'd
Yup
Brad_ >.>
Meanwhile has the idea.
so is there a stream?
Don't think so.
The stream is a lie.
Oh we got so many snakes in our house if we weren't careful, but we had tiles so they couldn't move
:P
What is this "stream" of which you speak? >.>
you know what this chat needs
MORE STREAMERS
A defibrillator?
I thought it needed more sand
to prevent these fibrillations?
i think he ment litterbox sand
(fibrillations are unsynchronised contractions)
dont use your fancy words on me!
^
MORE SAND? We're surrounded by sand!
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/Px4Rv.png
Snow: that's why I wrote that last bit
hehehe
Too bad you don't work the same way Spectrum_Rush :P
Though now I realise that may just have been more fancy words to some
Yeah XD
are we batteling with fancy words now?
i got a mindblowing thought for you all
what if we are all dreaming this life?
Then I'm having a crap dream.
Jake: I was just explaining my metaphor
whos brad again?
tzhem why am i lucid dreaming
Oh look there is ashie-poo.
Nope

Snow, I have a horrible memory. Also, I havent really worked on it because my vectoring programs are messing up.
but applejack is #6
I look nothing like clint Eastwood.
Noone can resist the clint
*resists*
=P
read that as "noone can resist the clit."
...
^
HEEEYO
Well-
few can resist the clit
maybe hetero girls?
yeah- and gay guys
/me can resist the..... clit...
and people who think they look creepy
Awesome chat guys :D
or that other thing
Who of you guys is homochromatic?
im not gonna say it.
ah, those poor gynophobiacs
Why is it you always make chat warped Vivix.
Not srue what that is
I can't help it JMO,
Honestly.
seriously I feel like typing in caps lock, my hands are shaky and my ears are ringing
Oh suck it up you wuss.
Jake you mean monochromatic?
ythen do it.
Vivix, sounds like you have ponies on the brain.
Alchemist same thing
Well, that, and I just finished rehearsing
ysounds more like a luna in his head to me.
;__;
That y.
I will murder its children.
oh yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Sometimes, if I play games for a really long time, that y will haunt me for hours
Jake: not one person consists of one particular wavelenght's worth of color...
You know I like to scroll up to see what I miss when I divert my attention
the children are the i and the J
But I'm starting to question doing that
Touche.
Alchemist but it just means your eyes have the same color
Namely because I'm not sure I want to know the relevance of the sentence "No one can resist the clit."
I heard that the clit is an offshoot of the Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning Apes movement, C/D? :)
yi agree Meanwhile
/me shrugs
Fffff.
Wait, what the shit is this?
Ooh Ryunosuke, I c wat u did thar
Bananas are greener then at night
<3 Jay and Silent Bob :)
Jake: Really? I didnt know that? I didnt know a person being mono/homochromatic had this meaning. Sorry.
He said sorry, must be canadian.
you can also be heterochormatic Alchemist
hi all
Jmo: or just a nice guy.
Hallo
Naaa
Jmo: Don't be silly. If he were Canadian he'd be fighting off a moose as we speak.
No such thing.

Jmo: you mean the rejects?
Bingo.

Jmo who was being an idiot

☻
luckelie i got the ie and the ij
older than you uddy so STFU Jmo
But Joomay, you're a child.
LOL
Mm. Kids nowadays haven't even been kicked around hard enough at school to understand the meaning of mad.
even though it's a common defect
Noone yet, technically
Princess_Celestia, please go. You're making my brain cells commit suicide.
*remembers school*
I just took all the broken parts of the hinge out and taped the corner
id had more then enough thank jou
Dwr pls.
go start a riot
-blocks Jmo due to stupidity-
DWR in a riot. That'd be funny.
PSIJ!
I already did today
Sound? :'D
suddenly stream
GANGNAM STYLE
Sound arrives. Overplayed song get.
Hey Celestia, wanna see how much care factor I have?
EEEEEEEEJ SEXIE LADIE!
/me gangnam styles all over chat
plastic laptops have a tendancy to break
My brother's lenovo is pretty nice
love this song
I hear Gangnam Style
it's aluminum

Princess_Celestia: You should probably go read the rules page.
Hang on
All right! We have sound!

we all do chrysalis
oppa pinkiepie stÿle
T_T
Chrysalis: you're*
I hear this song almost everywhere i go
Chrysalis: you do know it is the best song of 2012 right?
Now to test something else
I don't think it's the first time he or she is here, nor did he or she break any upon entering, don't up-play bullshit
so...what's going on now?
well mostly
Dken2021, stream apparently.
Dken2021: Meanwhile is pregnant
dat discord
there are some plastic bits
Also, I like that wallpaper
Bronysith :O
*puts on back the y*
The fauq?
Osu! music?
! SOUL EATER!!!
YESSSSSSS
My god o.o
omigosh steam finally started up
Smells like the pizza's burning
did somebody mention Osu! ?
Woo~! Its up!
osu?
Yep ouo
I think it broke because the hinge is right by the vent, so the metal and plastic got warped by the hot air
omigosh the stream finally started up
08,01someone's showing Soul Eater?
ah, see that you upgraded your streaming software Domo
ui soul eater?
swwet! Osu!
Dken2012: Yep!
whats osu
Rhythm game
resonance!
And in the spirit of the month, lets have some Marilyn Manson
and Soul Eater
it sucks though... I spent 1/3 of my earnings from my summer job a couple years ago to buy this thing
/me 08,01is listening to Jeff Bridged inside his earholes again
08,01*Bridges
:(
inb4 this is halloween
Soul Eater, was that the bad anime you had up that one time?
08,01it's funny because i'm also configuring ethernet bridges
warranty claims on anything sucks
the only thing that actually works is taking it back to the store
but … not when youve had it for a few years
Meanwhile, it's not that bad :3
Oh i love this remake
awww
dat game
08,01ha!
Invi: Is it the one with the school run by death?
08,01i just had cause to name a virtual interface vif4.20
Meanwhile, yeah
boys and girls of every age, would you like to see something strange?
Invi: Hate it.
08,01the mellowest virtual interface
yeah. =/
/me 08,01is mellow yellow
Meanwhile, yeah, it is pretty silly
dese game mechanics
my laptop has this thing
the only other option besides taping it was to buy another case from HP for like $300
fuck my internet
where if the same picture is on the screen for too long
ew no
you can see a ghost of it when you go do something else
yeah HP, I'm totally giving you more money for making defective laptops
its faint and you have to look for it to see it but its there
like a old plasma tv.
08,01Panda|Drawing: is your internet hawt?
hm, weird
ok ill go and do something productive
/me 08,01explodes
its a documentated issue though
I am the who when you call "who's there?" I am the wind blowing through your hair.
dammit, thought i got a skype message
/me sneaks out of chat
lol productive
and they wont do anything about it because they say its "within spec"
not possible.
/me glomps Jake before he sneaks out
08,01UNPOSSIBURY
"productive" Ha.
/me 08,01is doing it right
That's rich.
/me falls and tumbels away
That's a lot of bananas.

Don't be silly Jaymoo, if you don't like what the streamer does then you get banned.
yO.o"

That's how the site works.
LOL
O U Meanwhile.
08,01oh bugger
I just really like that intro song
oooh meaanwhile <3
08,01you know what i just did?
08,01i just did something really fucking stupid
I'm guessing you don't have a touchpad for regular mode?
Dken2021, and the one guy/girl no one knows the gender of ^^
08,01i just bought a bluray of Tron Legacy
08,01well, guess what?
>.>
Yeah that was stupid.
Oh dear, Birthday Death Game... MLP:FIM edition
Terrible film.
08,01i forgot i don't actually own a bluray player.
ROFL
Hehehe
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: well, i'm just about to buy a blueray player >.>

http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/16924_297710413675440_1458994613_n.jpg
how can you forget you have no blue-ray player?
^
is this game free?
Not paying attention?
today was a wasted day
So did you plan on buying a blu-ray player or did you just decide to get it so you can watch Tron?
08,01Invi: because i have an HD tv and i play HD stuff i've downloaded on it all the time!
I'm gonna buy a guitar
brb
08,01that... made more sense in my head
>.>
What am I looking at? Some DDR knockoff?

Invi lol

/me pets Brad[Laptop] and gives him some popcorn ^^
Panda|Drawing: ha!
I feel compelled to ask why the visage of a random lady keeps popping out the sides of the screen.
Meanwhile, your future wife.
Still not seeing any flashing colors
If anyone ever wants to marry you.
... my HD is making strange noises recently... I guess it's time to back everything up on the external now :/
is this Audiosurf but with fruits?
Ooooooooh.
Bronysith, calm down. Reddit will be up in its own time.
maybe it's too fast for the stream to process?
Panda|Drawing: Can't be that then.
and again, who is streasming?
Im sure we would get at leasta solid color then
Domo is
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350908577670.png
So, streaming an MLP episode anytime soon?
It isnt like youtube where its compression rate is shit
lol did you really just ask that?
Dken2021: OH, I vaguely heard of this! But I thought it was a Elite Beat Agents fangame?
Sure why not.
08,01wellp
someone ping me?
who pinged me
One sec, gotta plug something in for this one
You know Bronysith I'm sure if she cared she could find Asuka pics herself.
08,01i'm voting Tron Legacy and Tron for A and B this week
Domo was pinged
Bronysith alexxm weas on stream I heard it too
/me buries Meanwhile alive with eggplants
It bothers me when the reply typed into my chat window shows up before the reply typed in domo's window
MadSurge well it was what elite beat agents was based off of
Bronysith: I'm just saying.
/me puts eggplants in Meanwhile s tea
... something isn't right witzh my chat :/
Whats the big deal about asking about streaming MLP.
Who's Domo?
SpadeMagnes[School], why?
Meanwhile: im just filling your life with eggplants
Bronysith: Because, it's kind of pathetic.
ASoftFluffyThing: Makes me think I'm lagging\
/me pours more eggplants on Meanwhile
Bronysith: Seriously, I'm trying to put this nicely.
MadSurge she's a member of the bronystate art team
SpadeMagnes[School], I don't think it's lag.
Dken2021: :O
And if my tablet will go in--there we o!
We can play more Osu! xD
Woah that chat delay....
Malmortius, they forcefeed us seaponies when we do ;__;
Meanwhile: right, me trying to do something nicely for another person and you being your dickish self, now lets stop this before it gets extremely out of hand and we both end up getting banned
Then hello Domo, nice to meet you! :$
seaponies?
Nice to meet you too MadSurge ^u^
you know a bunch of us should vote for the same thing to increase the odds of it getting picked
What about the glorious sea ponies song?
Vivix, replace seaponies with Newborn Cuties.
Bronysith: That seems like a bit of an overreaction. I'm just saying she could do it herself and frankly she isn't likely to care about you regardless.
is he Browsing via µTorrent?
What really?
We've come to love the seaponies to where there's an ocean, we wonder where seaponies are.
Domo Ping~
:>
ASoftFluffyThing: so true lol
Oi Jmo! I haven't gotten a hug from you in a few days.
btw, some of these beatmaps are friggin hard to do with a mouse
O U
>Joomay
>Hug
/me hugs ASoftFluffyThing tightly
stfu dwr. :<
Ash is jelly.
Oh god, they exist
Elite Beat Agents much?

You want a hug too?
Why would I be jelly of a hug?
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350895976914.jpg
I can always go to Gary's girth.
Aaaah, now this looks more like Elite Beat Agents
Do it.
True.
SpadeMagnes[School] actually elite beat was a localization

Doh
Luna is ready to be shipped http://derpiboo.ru/129953

Spectrum_Rush: no way she will get bumps!
this freaking tablet XDD
:3
:D
well at least you aren't using a mouse ;)
^
Yes >_>; Mouse would kill my fingers
This game looks impossible
mainly my index
and brrb
Kill all fingers.
And it just gives up
D:
http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1350864546014.jpg Meanwhile this acutally happens in rebuild BTW
how would this game work with a mouse
I must be lagging or something, I get what Domo types way before he types it in his window
wat
SpadeMagnes[School]: aye
I almost never buy extended warrantys on stuff
Mee too
When I buy something I expect it to last, if it doesnt I buy a different brand
SpadeMagnes[School], her*
...brb getting some water, I feel like I'm dehydrating
Baaack ouo
alexxm this game would kill your wrist if you're using a mouse, it's more prefereable with a stylus like with the DS game
Yaaaay!
hay iam a new brony
Welcome to the herd.
So why does this remind em so much of Elite Beat Agents?
Yo new guy!
yeys
That hurt to say.
welcome to the herd pony_2472
So much chat.
The resembalance is uncanny
btw i love sweetie belle
SpadeMagnes[School] because it is

I would suck at rhythm games
I never buy extended warranties.
13reddit is down
13panic time
Shizuka: panic with me
I dont give a shit about reddit
a good practice is to take whatever you would have spent on an extended warranty and make your own warranty fund/pool.
REDDIT IS DOWN!?
why woulöd I care about Reddit?
08,01zomg
who's straming? :3
awsome
08,01reddit!

Never went there, never plan on doing so
08,01noooo! don't die reddit!

>Total freakout among the Redditors
>No one else notices
Dken2021, yep
Meanwhile no, I wanted to ask first if someone nows a website of the top of their head before I try, but appearently that's what I'll have to do now
13imgur is reddit's go-to place for image hosting
13if reddit's down, everyone floods over there
So like ponyboru then?

seems like a good idea for tablets and phones, but for pc it just fails... worse than vista from what I read
I work until 5 today and I think they're closed by then
yeah
what
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hmDZz5pDOQ Intermission time!
oooh audio engineers
np
iv got 6 years of experience doing that
Yeah you just have to fill out customs papers its super easy
08,01uh
and i did it at the last buck
08,01what?
08,01we're not looking for audio engineers
just declare it as a toy, say its a gift, and value of $10
08,01are you sure you're looking at the right page?
good one
Why do they need to know that?
08,01we're looking for A/V technicians

canada customs
08,01mainly to carry stuff and plug things in
i mis-read aww
that would of been fun
so they can charge duty fees
08,01not even that
but they wont charge anything on a $10 toy.
You have to fill out customs forms every time you ship out of the country
ttyl brohoof
Why do people bitch about vista so much? I dont have problems with it...unless Im missing something
08,01we're just looking for gophers who know what plug is what
I declare everything as a $10 toy, it helps it speed through customs.
SpadeMagnes[School], i guess you havn't tried sth else .3
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: i hate it because it's windows
O u nerd u
/me 08,01sits in his castle of free, open source software
Am I the only one laughing about the Vista complainants?
You and your mac
LOLMAC
EHH
lol, they don't look through it or anything then?
I use Vista and it works fine
yeah sometimes
yep
People used to punch you when you use XP back then
I have had vista for awhile, and not had any issues with it...why is vista so "bad"
Mainly inner things
like UAC
08,01Vivix: fair point to apple; the core of Os X is open source
In english?
08,01but yeah, I use Linux
how 2 engrish
Vista was HORRIBLE when it was brand new, but then is okay, but W7 is better
Inb4 Apple outsources
it could be replacement value.
osx core is opensource? That's kinda neat-
... finally get a chance to get in touch with someone who buys Blindbags ou-mass, and now Euro Wave 5 is such a dissappointment -(\
Seems like kind of an invasion of privacy
08,01Vivix: aye, it's called Darwin
trololol Lil_B
I have used windows since win95, I dont particularly LIKE using windows, i just became good at it :)
08,01that said, no-one from the community really contributes to it
have you ever been out of the USA?
Nice- ah-
Nope
08,01or really uses it
You could argue that it can be for your protection
I haven't used Linux in years and years, not counting android of course, but-
At least its betetr than Mac OS
08,01Ryunosuke: i've used linux for the last 10 years or so
vista seemed... clunky
They I should say...
Despite not knowing what I'd do with it, I kinda miss it
then you don't know invasion of privacy until you are pulled over at the border for a random car search.
08,01i'm awesome at it
08,01Chrysalis: ASAP
Unless you count going to Ontario for like 5 hours
each to thier own :0
well im writing it now
08,01i'm currently sorting through applications
08,01as in right now
where they tear your whole car up, take the tires off, seats out, and go through it.
They do that because of drugs right?
and then leave it in pieces when they are done.
Problem for me with Linux is that most of my pay'd software is Windows, like Cubase, ReValver- Animate
Bribe him with a Pinkie Pie.
all that shit-
o_O
wow
Invi no Mane 6, the ones who are there have kinda weird colors, ... there are Cadence Luna and Celestia though, but they are all the same... and there is Trixi and Lyra
ohai :)
drugs, weapons, mexicans.

Hi MaxTheBrony
You haven't uploaded new content for ages.
I'm disappoint :<
:P
when I come across the border after going to the usa you have to show them receipts for everything you are bringing back.
