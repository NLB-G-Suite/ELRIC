keyword is some
I want to see an episode with just Luna & Celestia - Angry Beavers style :)
Bam
11,01Every group has idiots.
11,01Too bad they're the loudest.
no i want an episode with luna and Celestia in bevis and butthead way XD
:D Yes!
11,01It was wise knowledge.

Grr. I'm used to talking to Brits
Alienware is overpirced IMO, you are paying for the name
I'm amurican :)
lol
Yeah
Luna died fast
those 60 dollar infernal things
i still remebered when they played it in the phonix episode
Yeah, Alienware is a fancey name, nothing more.
just get a wired 360 controller just as good
11,01$60 for a controller is stupid.
My XBOX controller costed me around 40 quid
^
For wired
11,01And they do nothing special.
my wireless 360 controller cost me 60 bucks at frys
I might make my own Controller
11,01Just buy a Logitech and download Xpadder or something.
11,01Tons cheaper.
for TF2 to be more specific
they're cheap
I already own 2 xbox 360 controllers
Punch Rarity!
lol
That fitting music.
No, small/
One is fine, the other is very handicapped
I have one
aw shit

Plus PS3 controllers are too spergy to get working
11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Tried Motionjoy?
Aaaaw shit
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a real song

ooh
The only music I really listen to is Beatles and Oasis

Pretty much
Heh, nice
Well, she did pull a umad face

Hey what's the song on right now?
11,01Wrek is Rarity again.

11,01No. You have to do favors for it. :p
11,01MaidSurge never gives things away for free. :p
You have to do [open quotation mark] errandz [close quotation mark]
we need more ppl
Last night, I would've asked for it. But I'm buying my own copy. And I'm going to be budgeting my food for the rest of the month.
11,01Pee Pee Ell
Ppl = people -> multiple
hush now quiet now its time to kill everyone
XD
Otherwise all of you would be gibbing
Waaaaay before it was for free :D
11,01Where's Wrek's hero?
When there was no F2P whippersnappers
11,01Red has no pony.
11,01Wish people wouldn't make fun of F2P players. Everyone has to start somewhere.
Whippersnapper isn't really a fun making term
very_silly why does it even matter if F2P players plat TF2? they ust wanna play it not annoy you -_-
play*
just*
11,01Oh.

11,01Then you can't add me.
11,01I'm a member of quite a few pony groups.
That's alright
my*
arnt shared accounts against the ToS
XD
People around me (exc. family) are shallow bastards.
11,01I keep it from some.
I keep it from my IRL fans
11,01And keep ponies out of places where they don't belong.
My mum knows, but I told her I'd shoot her if she told anyone
11,01Public.
I only really express bronydom here,
Everywhere else, I actually pretend to hate.
Yes, I'm srsbrah
its Discord's voice
11,01And I don't go pony-crazy around people that don't care for ponies. Not everyone likes ponies.
11,01Lol.
His moostache!
where did you get the celestia and luna skin? XD
Mustache is SRS business
05fail :P
11,01*ding*
11,01Spy is hard to play.
naw
11,01Trixie!
I have an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200
11,01Spy is also annoying to die to.
The more you move to the right for TF2 classes is how hard they are to play
11,01Rainbow Dash!
I'm not here
i just joined and didnt see any text
sorry
It was my first strange item
kewl
11,01I have strange items from trades.
Mine was from a trade
11,01Do you get strange items from drops?
I don't trade much, all my items are honest earned loot
Jumping RD :D
NOOO TWILIGHT
11,01Twilight is his favorite pony.
^
Ikr
I would think it would make him sad to have to fight Twilight
Is it me or is someone micraging?
Sneaking around and spychecking is pretty fun

Wait, who's Celestia supposed to be then?
11,01I hate living with family. Feel like a slave at times.
Hehehe this song

Cant think of a comparison...
Celestia is announcer
The announcer is playable? O_o
Luna is RD's mum
11,01Grandmother had hip surgery. Making me take her for a ride. I really don't like going places.
11,01Rather not waste the gas.
11,01Trixie!

Ragers gonna rage
Guys, is the announcer playable? I just saw a Celestia...
Then why was there a Celestia on the field?
Guys, I'm off. Hope you had fun watching me blow up wrek's buildings tons of times earlier
Nittany, it isn't a "waste" if it it to take care of family members.
You should take care of grandparents, any minute could be their last
11,01Sorry.
You know, when people don't know something, I just wish they'd flat out say it.

11,01Kandarihu: Then the vhost works.
11,01Oh.
As far as I know the medical community still don't know why migraines happen.
11,01That second instance might be due to my client.

I can't brain today, I has the dumbs

The medical community used to think it was Vascular but not anymore

trains.
had a room full of em
i had a little train
0,5I highly doubt you have. In this room, at least.
even had a watch lol
they might have but they probably were banned immediately
http://noclipmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Train-sex.jpg
Yup. My second or third day on this site a mod put up a link for a disturbing lushy pic
And there has been many many more instances.

It was weeks ago.
bummer
0,5I think you were in a different IRC room
11,01Mods aren't above the rules here.
oh gawd not that room
^What nittany said
(unless in special channels)
:3
eeeeeeeyup
0,5It mustn't have been a moderator.
11,01If a mod linked r34, we'll get them for that.
0,5Because none of us would do that here.
11,01^
13Derpy_Hooves: it does if the channel isn't tagged for it
"Channels which are not labeled as such are not permitted to share any sexual content"
0,5Maybe we nailed them afterwards then.
0,5But the idea of a mod doing it is plain silly :3
I think I remember a twilight plushie pic, but it wasn't a mod that linked it
13how about
13you follow the rules
13kay?
13everyone
0,5No one here is breaking any rules at the moment, no worries...

I'm doing great
00,10Did I see a request for ponies?
11,01Nope.
woo! bann
!
11,02Ooo...

11,01Shamroc: I wouldn't put you through that unless you deserved it. :p

05NEVER LISTENED TO THESE GUYS BEFORE BUT THEY ARE ENTIRELY ADEQUATE :d
05just had to
00,10Canterlock
haha
Hey
05sad? :3
05:o*
11,01Dunno what's up.
wow
but no its just gone quiet
11,01Yeah.
This music is pretty epic
though not quite sure how the rules cover that
Extraordinarie*
and wrench
I played TF2 once. I was not the best.
11,01TF2 takes practice.
no one is at first
11,01I still need quite a bit.
11,01MP games take practice.
11,01Even more when they have unlocks.
:D
Nastacha is fantastic for taking out hero classes
11,01Tomislav should be more accurate for being slower-firing.
against players its pretty poor
00,10both good guns
because of its slowdown
11,01How long does it slow players down?
but not for any length of time per round
11,01It took me a while to warm up to TF2.
:'( am i here?
11,01And stats make me rage.
:P
*wubs
11,01KDR is a rage stat for me.
NANANANANANANANANANANANANANA BAT MAN!!
does tf2 even have a kdr stat never seen it?
05back
11,01TF2 doesn't.
11,01I like that.
11,01I don't like persistent stats.
inb4 kick
here it comes
AND DONT FORGET TWILLIGHTS HORN! *facehoof*
11,01I really need to work on not caring about stats.
11,01Or not playing games that punish dying like CoD and BF3.
11,01Since they work off of "Kills = rewards. Dying = bad."
punish dying?
ahh
11,01BF games have the ticket system.
which are bullship
11,01MW2 and MW3 have deathstreaks.
11,01They also have killstreaks.
11,01Sumica: Yeah.
details, details.
11,01It's too long in L4D2.
kk :P
00,10the horn you are looking for is in another castle

Hi, Good afternoon everyone
how do i stream when he done?
11,01Or something else.
:) fair enough
it is ... aDAWWWWWWable :)
11,01And $15 map packs?

^
11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: Maybe it's still coming.
11,01Or they're working on Modern Warfare 4.
11,01I dunno.
11,01That's Treyarch.
I've... heard about MW4, or at least rumors
*the
11,01It's easy.
^
11,01I won't be surprised it IW makes MW4.
ooooh, it aint baby twillght in a cot, it is twillight reading a book under a blanket! :3
you dont
only mods can
when i want to put up a live stream, oh.
how do you become a mod? 9_6
6_9
11,01DerpyDude: Wait for us to ask for mods.
well
any easy way?
twi_sparkle_GS17: yeah
i'll just leave it at that
Warning: Plutonium is still hard to find in 2012.
lol, if any of you saw me whilst playing A:DD you would laugh until you crapped yourselves
11,01BO was OK.
11,01I didn't finish the SP.
Only reason I still play COD is zombies
11,01And I don't care for the overpriced DLC.
05that should work
WaW was my fave , next to 4
just saying
I really hope they don't mess BO2 zombies up
and russians
11,01Looks as scripted as the rest.
Me neither
wow he/she has done alot since i got off it looks realy nice
thats not believable
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif
11,01MW was great because it was believable.
11,01MW2 was fun, but wasn't as good because it wasn't believable.
^
16 players zombies? That's gotta be a biiiiiiig map
05>16 players
05>big
lol
05>wait untill you see planetside 2
05>LOL
11,01TF2 has more.
11,01TF2 is 16 I think.
Origin, GFWL why does computer have to be infested which such shitty online system
05lets see
Planetside? 1000 players?
o.o
Dust514 looks promising though
That's amazing
05but thats just the stable limit atm
lol
that isnt going to end well
yeah
I can tell you that now
that'd be epic
OMG BLOBBS!
How would you have unlimited?
05imagine that the maps are basically 100if not 1000 tiems larger than a standard bf map
053 factions a map
11,01IW doesn't have good post-launch support.
05oh
then you'd need fast transportation
05its an MMO too.
11,01Treyarch at least tries.
yesyesyes! trade my killing floor and rush for borderlands goty !
11,01IW ar Xbox 360 fanboys.
11,01Activision are paid to promote the 360.
05Rodney: there are tropships, maps doesnt "end"
05dropships*
lol
05that are manually piloted
05by players
feh dropships...
lol
manually piloted by players
11,01Is it more arcadey?
inb4 trolls
h okay
yeah XD
11,01So you don't have a steep learning curve like with Battlefield?
Hello...PerfectChief
11,01I hate BF's learning curve.
11,01It's the worst.
0,5Das gay
05it wont be p2w
0,5Ah crap......
0,5Wrong room
0,5x3
BF3 has a learning curve?
lol
das embarassing
00,10it's not a very good punishment if you feel it's work it to spoil
11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I dunno.
No Jon, doesn't come here.
11,01I never played BF3.
00,10the point is for it to be not worth it
0,5BF3 is fun
I won't do it again... Digh typos... -_-
05which arleady is hard to get in the first place
When is planetside 2 release?
I do like how EVE/Dust is set up though, there are ways to deal with AWOXers
I hated that
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
05MASF123: you already screwed yourself over
I'm sorry...
Ok I stopped.
I just hope there's ponies in the UK

11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: Lately, it was TF2 or L4D2. I don't play multiplayer much except with friends.

11,01Potanity: PS3?
Xbox
11,01Aww.

i used to have PS3 though

11,01I hate paying for online play.
I sold it
11,01XBL is rip-off.

11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: I can torrent in America.
i would like to know also
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, you give the authorities too much credit
11,01Twitter?
11,01How?
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, yeah, but when they do that its hilerious
11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: They make examples of people by fining them way, way too much money.
00,02like the grandmother that was sued $200000 for music downloads
I dunno.
11,01Fuck the RIAA. They're greedy.
00,02GabeMoist, that too
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, not to get sued, but from this side
I'll stay here for maybe another 10 mins and then go off. I'm getting light headed.
Glad I don't live in the US
Denmark is great
No dangerous animals or spiders everywhere
00,02always use https (NOT http), use 3rd part dns servers (googles are good, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)
11,01You have to now in the US.
11,01The copyright monopoly bought monitoring.
11,01They waste money trying to punish everyone for piracy.
Thankfully i couldnt care less about modern games
11,01Causing even more piracy in the process.
11,01And pissing people off.
00,02it got on fox news
Ok guys i've seriously got to go now. I think i'm ill..
11,01panda: As far as copyright, the govt is listening to the wrong people.
bye guys
11,01They're listening to greedy businessmen doing the wrong things to make money.

11,01The only DRM I outright hate is always-on.
11,01GabeMoist: Explain.
:D
11,01GabeMoist: XD
00,02GabeMoist, trololololo
11,01FairysHuff: And idiot publishers think those methods work.
11,01Because pirated copies have unlimited installs and no DRM.
11,01GabeMoist: I remember that now.
11,01There are anti-piracy measures that work that are OK.
11,01Or Earthbound.
11,01Where the pirated copy is worse than the paid copy.
00,02in my opinion, only copy-protection that was worth while: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php
11,01When you make the paid copy worse with DRM and/or bad DLC, then you encourage piraacy.
11,01*puracy
11,01*piracy
11,01killerpony7733: And I accept that more than having to constantly connect to a server.
11,01Which is dumb.
er
morrowind
11,01Nice.
11,01Diablo 3 won't.
I can hope
11,01But thanks to stupid DRM, it does.
Theres an FBI investigation into Blizzard because of DIablo3
11,01I wish Always-on would be made illegal.
11,01It would make my day.
Or we could just firebomb Actishitten/Blizzard
11,01FairysHuff: Or buy it.
trance
11,01Ubisoft was the first publisher I ever boycotted. It was over always-on DRM.
11,01Back in 2009.
Cool
It was DeepSilver wasn't it?
aagh
GOG?
00,02and gog has none
11,01Steam is the most successful DRM to date.
11,01GOG is DRM-free.
