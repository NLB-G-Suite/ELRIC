why does it randomly turn on
Tribes: Ascend, ey?
No idea
Anyway, out for now
Jim I tried playing that but the community are dicks to new players
bye otakon17
bai otakon17
Take care eh?
bye otakon17
FairysHuff: its because the game is very competitive
05wodner if this has a windowed mode
Warhammer 40k, ey?
I recently bought that
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG No point in my playing then. It's no fun playing with people who only know how to scream obscenities down a mic from thousands of miles away
FairysHuff: lol no one really talks
FairysHuff: dont think there is voice chat
I've never heard anyone talk in tribes ascend
Wrek should stream some Warhammer 40k.
Oh please god no.
No Warhammer. Please
I don't like it either, but it's something.
why not?
Well, howdy, fellow humans/ponies/whatsoever !
oni_link: Tribes is kinda balanced
Hello, fellow.. whatever.
hey Elarcis
Hello Elarcis, whatever you are :D
hi Elarcis
Well, Octopus for me.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I have no FPS to play, and no PC to run one if I did :P
Warhammer 40k you say? http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/295e498ae62ca9b984629cb68f6e9e02/87338%20-%20artist%3Alaaseensld%20balloon%20cutie_mark%20flamethrower%20highres%20parody%20pinkie_pie%20ponified%20space_marine%20warhammer_40k%20weapon.jpg
that link got too big :/
Tinyurl
Can we have some midgets in tutus playing harmonicas while sky diving into jello?
just saying
FairysHuff: I'll have what he's having!
can someone stream botchamania
Tribes is also kinda boring to play after awhile
I play for fun. Not for E-Penis
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I think I'll stick with TF2 and
051 sec
RPGs
oni_link: good for you
05solving shit
Wrek, will you open the server tonight again?
JPRGs with turnbased battle systems ftw.
FairysHuff: you are my kind of player
^^
lol im very competitive
speaking of JRPG, any ponies in PSO2?
*Hates the new Final Fantasys after Enix bought Square*
^ ^ ^
FFX was the last good one IMO
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I am competetive with what I get comfortable with.
oni_link That was the last one to have a semi turnbased battle system. I was still un happy with the removal of the explorable world map
oh boy Warhammer
Wrek Stream ;D
Speeeeece Mahhhhren!
>_>
FairysHuff: Twas a bit more linear but I still enjoyed it more than Final Hallway XIII
I can stand ads. I can stand buffering. I cannot stand buffering ads.
yay Hard
dat steam sale
oni_link True
CupcakeExtreme01: Simple, get adblock
Ave Imperator.
Ad Blocker plus on Firefox/Nightly :)
Warhammer isn't my thing. But I'll watch this for a bit I suppose.
the hay?
FairysHuff, this game is gloriously over the top
Hmm..
I've always wanted to watch somepony play this game.
any other pony see hyrle sign?
I might go and play something..
Quick_Thinker: me :P
SFM!
this game looks interesting
Unnr To each their own. I just found the Warhammer mythos to be so very boring.
hmm Terran Days
never played warhammer
FairysHuff, it often tries too hard, but this game is just silly.
Serious face.
Forge world? What is this Halo: Reach?
^
^ ^ ^ ^ IKR
damn it
serious buisness
You will be GRIMDARK and you will like it!
Stalker?
I miss that game :(
Hmm.. I need a good laugh.
What game is this?
so is this an RTS or a shooter
Stalker was a good game.
Oh look, Warhammer
Shooter alexxm
Blood for the blood god!
Stalker IS a good game.
this keeps reminding me of Warcraft and Starcraft
thanks Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
FairysHuff: It came with my last tower. I loved the open world.
Two more months I'm hoping is the time I will have a new one.
I ALMOST bought this during sale only because it was so cheap. Glad I didn't now.
Way to kill the chat.
Its what I do best
ded
So who is streaming?
Wrek.
In other news, the Khornate creed is really easy to sing to Gitchee Gitchee Goo from Phineas and Ferb
Blood for the blood god, that´s what the Khornate said!
Skulls, skulls, skulls, cause the throne keeps growin´
Well, that's one retarded turret.
05brb
If its any consolation, I had fun talking with you FairysHuff.
Chocobunny: You'd think such an obvious weakness would be corrected.
RobertRevenge: The budget.
Anyone know a good Terraria server?
no
127.0.0.1
Bye everypony! Im calling it a night now. Well, more like morning over here. Also thanks Wrek for the stream.
Bye.
I think I'll go try that now.
oni_link bye bye
good night oni_link
HÄR TAR DET SLUT.
Well, that server isn't working.
Robert, screw Terraria, come play some Smite with me.
I have no clue what that is.
Google it.
Smite.
It's like crack cocaine but worse.
Smite is weird
So it's pretty much a over the shoulder RTS? I'm in.
*an
its more third person shooter
what game is this?
WarHammer Space marine
oh
Either way, I'm interested. Making an account now.
Ah bollocks. I have to wait for a Beta key.
Herp.
I wonder what Wrek is doing..
beta key for this game?
Nah, for Smite?
No, beta for Smite
for what game?
Google it.
Robert, it looks awesome, right?
im a bit confused
It looks like LoL, but over the shoulder. I'm intrigued.
But it's with gods!
MYTHOLOGY, MAN!
Seriously? I'm in.
Fuck yeah, going all norse in this bitch.
so is it paused for anyone else
WAHT FUCKING GAME ARE GUYS TALKIG ABOUT
/me brohoofs Chocobunny
Hell yeah.

Quick_Thinker: We already said, the game is Smite

/me brohoofs as well and ask

sorry thought you meant the admin XD
Yes, Smite.
LOL.
Robert, what's your Steam?
RobertRevenge, lol.

My pic should be a dude with orange hair in goggles
My anti-brony friends refused to add me as long as I kept a pic of Luna as my pic
lol
>friends
^
not very good friends then
^
fuck i can't rember for the life of me the password to my beta
Eh, they have their preferences, I have mine. I don't bash them for liking CoD and other manly things like that.
for Tribes that is
Friends are people who accept and enjoy being around you, because you're who you are.
RobertRevenge: yeah but its just an avatar
Tribes sucked asshair with Ramen noodles.
/me shrugpony
>CoD
>Manly
lol
Robert, you're not online on Steam? It says you were last on 2 hours ago.
I don't know anything about CoD/Battlefield or anything like that. So I just assume it's manly.
And I am online o_o
Steam is glitchy
Hm..
Alright, brb.
Going to relog Steam.
Same.
You'll probably notice in the stream. :3
Wrek is AFK?
He said BRB.
Not AFK.
STEAM! I hate it when it's slow!
Derp
Finally!
I had to accept
*facepaw*
Cue Derpy "I just don't know what went wrong!"
Screw it, I'm changing my avatar back to Nightmare Night Luna
Way to go!
wow Batman Franchise really cheap on steam right now :o
GOD DAMN GAME PATCHES!
Smite patches takes the longest. :C
Says it's about 30 minutes left for me.
/me is downloading in preparation for beta key
6 min.
Wait.
Scratch that, 2.30 min.
Aw yeah, massive props for the Strawhats Pirates logo Chocobunny
Fuck yeah!
I'm reading the Water 7 arc right now
OH. MY. GOD.

/me 's day has been made 20 percent cooler.
Robert, have you watched the anime as well?
05back
05sorry bout that
Welcome back
wb
what did you do Wrek?
this is my first time getting up at a reasonable time for like 2 months
hehe
Wrek is totally making me want to play this game.
lol now imperial guards
Wrek should play Smite. :3
Indeed he should >:o
Bah *>: o
He played Tribes when it was in beta for a while
BB.
what is tribes anyway
Tribes: Ascend, a FPS
It's kind of like class-based Halo multiplayer
its a Multiplayer game with a huge enviorment
thanks Jim RobertRevenge and Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
I think Wrek usually played the Juggernaut class.. if I remember right.
Back from my BB.
Welcome back :3
YES!
The updates has finished downloading!
My fun has been doubled!
Lawl, go for it. I'll probably cheat and buy a gem pack later so I can get a guaranteed beta key.
I love my e-mail. :3 Derpymail is best e-mail.
o_o What, there's derpymail now?
I'm so changing my main email.
Derpymail.co.uk
but wouldn't derpy lose it Chocobunny
I see.
Nah.
dat derpy mail
She fixes it.
Wewt for making new friends :3
Oh gosh, a Chainsword sounds so fun.
how about a chain gun sword
Wouldn't that be a Lancer from GoW?
good point
hmm
Just took a stroll by my part of the creek - water is still really high, be at least a week before I can get close enough to the creek to measure just how high it went
We had torrential rains here for the past week while I was camping out of state.
with last summer's drought, creek bed was bone dry - I thought it would take years to fill back up - all the rain helped in that regard
also, found a leak in both my boots in the process :P time for some fishing waders
not even going to attempt to drive around today - last night several roads were still baracaded off
damn how bad were the floods there Cypresswolf
Thursday it poured down rain all day - up to 6 inches an hour
05back again
last night coming back from taco bell, there was still water under the overpasses at the closest highway intersection
alexxm: I live close to the creek - on the higher side, but still got flooded a bit - the low side...Im sure there are sections of neighborhoods that still cant get out
damn that bad then
Howdy y

Then who would the Main 6 be?
FairysHuff: well if you were some multi-billionare you could fund some research that might lead into a ghost-in-the-shell like future..
I vote for the Jackson 5 + Frank Sinatra
shana If only I did have that kind of money. I would do exactly that.
Jim: I wish I could answer that, who the Mane 6 is.
Ideas for the Mane 6 for My little Human?
We must have Gandhi
Jim: That's Princess Celestia.
LOL.
Alright, Gandhi as Princess Celest
Nightmare Moon as Hitler?

So... This is how Luna got banished
omg Nightmare Moon Vs. Princess Celestia

now Very Silly we do not need to resort to viloence or hurtful words to make our point we need to be calm and collective just like we were at 4chan
not Nightmare Moon
Silent stream is silent :s
i cant tell is that princess cadence or Celestia?
Molestia
I thought Luna was banished for keying "The Moon Rules! # 1" on Celestia's royal cart
i see
I actually like season 2 luna more than s1 luna
we all do pudge cause she was acutualy in it and had some lines
i mean her design
ah
some ponies have called me crazy in the past
keyword is some
I want to see an episode with just Luna & Celestia - Angry Beavers style :)

Awww dammit, Wrek has the mecharm
Pudge: She was like a production assistant or something.
<3
11,01I know more about FiM than everyone! I'll could overthrow queen Faust and banish her to the sun :p (lol).
Nittany_Discord: Poor newspaper
yeah, like a consultant so her show doesnt go too far from what it was intended to be
11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Wut?
Dat Celestia.
Nittany_Discord: You aren't British are you?
11,01No.
Nittany_Discord: What'sthe names of the 3 animators?

We have a newspaper called "The Sun"

WREK IS A BEAST
my stream is down apparently

DED

Wrek is very good at TF2.
Nittany_Discord: why thank you :3
Whats the Ip for this serveR? If its not private
Quick_Thinker: At the moment 13 but apparently theres evidence it'll be more.
11,01I'm actually a Luna fan.
11,01:p
Luna > Celestia!
good
Nittany_Discord: Learn to spell Rarity
Nittany_Discord: I can't wait for Children of the Night to come out :3

11,01Very_Silly_Filly: R A I N B O W D A S H
damnit
Pinkie?
hey whats the IP?
huh?
I'd be so bad at this game...I could never shoot Fluttershy.
Fluttershy looks really scary
Nittany_Discord: Wow. You should enter a Spelling Bee or something.
how is that a season 3 spoiler
._.
11,01Was it?
11,01Sorry.
children of the night is a fan video
yeah ._.
np tough
And so far it looks amazing.
11,01Sorry.
fluttershy gona die!! =(
NOT FLUTTERSHY HOW COULD YOU
i honestly would not have the guts to even say hi to fluttershy for fear she will run away
You must protect fluttershy at all costs Wrek
Fluttershy is OP.
Looks like blue is gona win.
I just got news about my laptop, hopefully it will be fixed by Augst
When it's fixed, I can enjoy speed again
11,01Wrek was killed by Rarity.
11,01That must be awesome.
Very_Silly_Filly: what kind of laptop is it?
Still, can't run Crysis, or pretty much any game from 2009 onwards
Pudge: Dell inspiron 1545 upgraded
also i think im more shy then her i never talked to anybody in school (but next year thanks to the loving brony community and swag i will get and Canterlot Garden con i will be much more social
Whats really funny is I think Rarity's whining stuns the other team. lol
Very_Silly_Filly: if you want a modern gaming laptop you should invest in an ailenware laptop
Not... sure if trolling...
Pudge: I could buy a decent laptop for 400 quid, but I literally have 0 money
I can piss poor
am*
what u mean?
wait
quid?
Alienware: the name you trust for overpriced Dell hardware. :p
^
Serious though Alienware laptops are not so bad. Some of them you can take apart to change out the dedicated graphics cards.
Wrek: are u playing on ur server?
Grr. I'm used to talking to Brits
also im trying to find pony skins on the workshop what do i search for ?
Alienware is overpirced IMO, you are paying for the name
I'm amurican :)
Very_Silly_Filly: £400 huh? :)
lol
Yeah
:D dat apt Benny Hill music
Luna died fast
11,01Overpriced like PC Xbox 360 controllers?
Nittany_Discord: Yup
those 60 dollar infernal things
i still remebered when they played it in the phonix episode
dat Benny Hill
Yeah, Alienware is a fancey name, nothing more.
just get a wired 360 controller just as good
11,01$60 for a controller is stupid.
My XBOX controller costed me around 40 quid
^
Oh look its AJ, and she is on Fire.
For wired
11,01And they do nothing special.
Normal day at sweet apple acres.
my wireless 360 controller cost me 60 bucks at frys
also guys just asking but im trying to find MLP FIM stuff in the steam workshop what do i search up?
I might make my own Controller
I have the family members who have the kit
11,01Just buy a Logitech and download Xpadder or something.
11,01Tons cheaper.
for TF2 to be more specific
but seriously people, if you want a good controller for the pc, get a ps2 controller
they're cheap
I already own 2 xbox 360 controllers
Is the server playing the song? Or is it Wrek? =P
Punch Rarity!
lol
Pudge: Dualshock controllers rape my hands, not ergenomic enough
That fitting music.
Very_Silly_Filly: do you have big hands?
No, small/
One is fine, the other is very handicapped
ah, i see. get a wired 360 controller then? I think you can use those
I have one
aw shit
my favorite song
i'm mad because the plug and play cord doesnt work with pcs
Dat caramelldansen :D
Plus PS3 controllers are too spergy to get working
11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Tried Motionjoy?
Nope
Aaaaw shit
I only recognise this music from Meet the Pyro
Very_Silly_Filly, really?
kids these days
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a real song
it is
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't really listen to music
ooh
The only music I really listen to is Beatles and Oasis
is 2day brony day?
then again this is used in a lot of movies
brony 'apreciation' day
I'm one of the few "kids" who like retro over new
=o
Very_Silly_Filly, Do you believe in magic is VERY Retro
oh no
not friday
OH GOD NO
I dunno, but do you believe in miracles?
god no
oh god
Holy crap!
Oh but it's sunday~
and MUTING STREAM
SITTIN IN THE FRONT SEAT
ITS FRIDAY!
Thank you, brah
KICKIN IN THE BACK SEAT
WHICH SEAT CAN I TAKE
Oh lordy
oh shit
Don't worry bros, it's fine now
This song is good
I like rarity songs but pinkie is best singer
11,01Wrek: is the pony everypony should know.
^
11,01Pudge: My hand is a dolphin!
Autocomplete fail
Nittany_Discord: was waiting for someone to say that :D
I am hungry for fudge :)
I had some earlier, and I'm hooked
peanut butter fudge is the best
Meanwhile's favourite song
>Dark Souls now on Pre-order
HNNNNNNNNNG
Very_Silly_Filly: Because of Trixie? :D
Yeah, hehe
which song is this?
Wait, did I hear Eduard Khil in there?
that trololo
Very_Silly_Filly: Or any song with Trixie
Pretty much
Meanwhile even goes the extra mile and hates twix bars
Very_Silly_Filly: And yes, you did hear Eduard Khil in the song
Heh, nice
Chezne: Trixie the Pony Troll by Alex S.
dat benny hill
Well, she did pull a umad face
dont you just hate pyros
Is anyone else's stream behind by a minute?
i know i do
an Alex S. song I'm missing it seems, thanks AttacktheAndalite
Pyros are overpowered, even after the HUGE nerf
In 2007, Pyros were retarded
Chezne: You're welcome. It's on YouTube, or it should be.
Anyone's else's stream behind by a minute or so, or is it just me?
AttacktheAndalite: I don't know
Dammit, he has a strange Bazzarr bargain
killerpony7733: I refresh and it seems like the actual stream is ahead and mines is behind.
should i get TF2?
Yes
You can either, waste your life playing TF2
I played it on the 360 orange box it got old real quick
Or you can waste your life even more by playing VoD
CoD*
Pudge: 360 and PS3 TF2 are crap, PC TF2 is good
TF2>>>>>>>>>>>CoD
lol i am in the same game
11,01PC TF2 is better because of mods.
And hats
well very_silly_filly is this wasting my life : since feb 1st this year, i have played 560 hours :-p
whhhat
tf2 is free?
11,01Most I have logged into a game is L4D2.
11,01150+ hours.
hello :3
Master_Derpy: Since October 2007, I have played 150 hours
TEAM FORTRESS 2
lol
17 October, release week I'm pretty sure
i was the spy who killd Wrek.
celestia skin?
I thought it was a demopan
THERE SHOULD BE A DISCORD SKIN XD
Mind the caps, brah
Hey what's the song on right now?
Pudge: "she's a pony", I forget which remix
Dubstep methink
11,01Wrek is Rarity again.
Pudge: Glaze remix
BACKFLIP Son:BUT DAD THAT WAS A FRONTFLIP! Me:DONT QUESTION ME YOU LITTLE SHIT!
So I'm asking again: anyone wants an extra copy of Frozen Synapse? :D
for free?
11,01No. You have to do favors for it. :p
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: it was two copies per purchase :D
If I take it, no more deals for me for the rest of the Steam Summer Sale.
11,01MaidSurge never gives things away for free. :p
You have to do [open quotation mark] errandz [close quotation mark]
we need more ppl
Nittany_Discord: don't make me look evil :D
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Worst grammar ever
Last night, I would've asked for it. But I'm buying my own copy. And I'm going to be budgeting my food for the rest of the month.
11,01Pee Pee Ell
Ppl = people -> multiple
YOU MUST BECOME MY STEAM FRIENDS, ALL OF YOU :D
hush now quiet now its time to kill everyone
XD
MadSurge: I no has tee eff too
Otherwise all of you would be gibbing
Very_Silly_Filly: I got it back when I got the Orange Box
MadSurge: So did I, 17th october 07 :P
Waaaaay before it was for free :D
11,01Where's Wrek's hero?
heavy got owned by luna XD
When there was no F2P whippersnappers
11,01Red has no pony.
Very_Silly_Filly: what's your steam nick?
MadSurge: Sorry, but I'm not adding bronies :P
11,01Wish people wouldn't make fun of F2P players. Everyone has to start somewhere.
Nittany_Discord: I'm not making fun, I'm making a relative term
Very_Silly_Filly: :( why? I don't have pony avatars
Whippersnapper isn't really a fun making term
very_silly why does it even matter if F2P players plat TF2? they ust wanna play it not annoy you -_-
play*
just*
MadSurge: If you aren't in any pony groups or a pony avatar, I'll happily add you
Thing is, I share my acc with my dad and he kinda hates bronies, he doesn't know I am one
11,01Very_Silly_Filly hates bronies?
11,01Oh.
closet brony
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka
forgot to bring the intelegens
11,01Then you can't add me.
Very_Silly_Filly: only TF2 groups
11,01I'm a member of quite a few pony groups.
That's alright
im a closet brony because i wont let me parents know im one XD
my*
arnt shared accounts against the ToS
Well my life depends on it being secret
i dont show it in real life
i show it all over the fucking internet
XD
like joining pony groups and adding people on steam from here who have pony avatars
People around me (exc. family) are shallow bastards.
11,01I'm mixed now. I started out as a closed brony. Now I show it off a bit.
11,01I keep it from some.
I keep it from my IRL fans
Nittany_Discord: lol
11,01And keep ponies out of places where they don't belong.
My mum knows, but I told her I'd shoot her if she told anyone
Nittany_Discord Example?
11,01Public.
11,01Unless around other bronies.
I don't see why I should tell everyone I meet. Only if I feel comfortable and I trust the person.
I only really express bronydom here,
Everywhere else, I actually pretend to hate.
Yes, I'm srsbrah
i dont show im a brony in real life i show it all over the fucking internet even minecraft XD
myself and my car are ponied out, hard to hide it
its Discord's voice
11,01And I don't go pony-crazy around people that don't care for ponies. Not everyone likes ponies.
Poor meanwhile
That sea monster is meanwhile :3
11,01Lol.
Lol Very_Silly_Filly
His moostache!
where did you get the celestia and luna skin? XD
Mustache is SRS business
What a world, what a world!
you're freaking lucky if you have irl brony friends
Pudge: agreed
11,01All of my brony friends are back in PA.
05fail :P
Wrek: what wazzat?
11,01Poor Wrek.
Hey do you need that good of a pc to run TF2?
dammit Wrek :(
11,01*ding*
11,01Spy is hard to play.
naw
11,01Trixie!
I have an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200
11,01Spy is also annoying to die to.
The more you move to the right for TF2 classes is how hard they are to play
pudge i used to run it on my old netbook
Dat Flutterguy
11,01Rainbow Dash!
I don't personaly know any bronies irl. But whenever i walk around my college campus with my derpy t-shirt, i almost always get a bro-hoof from some random person. Always fun :)
anypony here?
My school is becoming 60% brony
Jspang1: Obviously
But fucktard brony, not decent brony
I'm not here
i just joined and didnt see any text
sorry
is it just me or is Wrek a little off today?
panda: Dunno maybe
I just go around with my .mov shirts and troll people that don't know what they are :D
im so much worse
he was going beastmode with the spy earlier
Pudge: just my timing then?
Pudge: Only because he had the HP to last
11,01Feed the box.
I have a strange Black Box
It was my first strange item
kewl
11,01I have strange items from trades.
Mine was from a trade
11,01Do you get strange items from drops?
I don't trade much, all my items are honest earned loot
GO DEMOMAN
Jumping RD :D
Solider is the only class I'm good at, never really been good at TF2
NOOO TWILIGHT
Dont have any brony friends irl, but have met several around Houston at meetups
Irony.... Wrek gets killed by Twilight Sparkle XD
11,01Wrek might be happy Twilight killed him.
11,01Twilight is his favorite pony.
^
Ikr
Nittany_Discord: hehe ninja'd again XD
/me 11,01dusts panda
I would think it would make him sad to have to fight Twilight
/me places a fan next to Nittany_Discord and turns it to 3
I'm happy to just kill someone with the Pyro :D
I think he may have given up willingly... killing Twi, would kill his hopes and dreams
/me 11,01's hair flows in the wind
Is it me or is someone micraging?
Sneaking around and spychecking is pretty fun
Nittany_Discord is the new Fabio
only talk about FIM and stuff with those at the office on occasion and my brother when I get something new in the mail - 2 co workers outside of that
I really need to learn online programming, I'd totally make a pony game
bonjour
Wow, chat is quiet today
Bonjour RAWRity!
geronimo?
How's it going for everybody?
Mum has made cupcakes
They aren't ready yet
WindWhistler: it was even quieter an hour ago!
My body is, though
Riverside
LETS GO
/me 11,01sits on panda-femalezebra
Love this song
11,01Adventure!
xD
What's it called?
Welp, I'm bored.
/me gallops with Nittany_Discord on his back!
11,01Yay! A zebra ride!
What's this song with Engi called? I am curious
11,01Wrek lost to his love again.
Was anyone following the events at Comic Con? What else went on outside of ponies?
11,01Twilight is Trixie.
11,01Lol
Very_Silly_Filly: It's on the tip of my tongue but I can't remember the name.
STOP BEING SO QUIET PEOPLE
Or maybe my chat derped upon logging in...
WindWhistler: No~ It's just a tad bit quiet~
Nyria: That's an understatement
11,01Wrek always gets Rariy.
11,01*Rarity
His chosen pony is Raritty
11,01So Rarity is a spy.
ofc
11,01I guess RD is a scout.
Love this song
..nothing much of note from what I can tell...
Song cover reminds me too much of star wards kinect
wars*
11,01What pony would the heavy be?
Heavy would be Buffalo
Heavy would be Snowflake (fandom name: Roid Rage)
Or Big mac
Snowflake = SNOWFLAME
( Cypresswolf: Don´t forget horsepower)
11,01Kill Fluttershy!
Actually, Big Mac can be heavy :3
11,01:p
Yes :)
Is Luna playable?
Oh god, Walking dead is 40% off
11,01Ugh.
Me want
Wait, who's Celestia supposed to be then?
11,01I hate living with family. Feel like a slave at times.
Hehehe this song
that blood stained mane
I'm guessing by the silence no one knows who Celestia is supposed to be then...
Cant think of a comparison...
Nittany_Discord: Welcome to hell
Celestia is The Announcer, then I guess Luna would be Miss Pauling.
Celestia is announcer
The announcer is playable? O_o
Luna is RD's mum
11,01Grandmother had hip surgery. Making me take her for a ride. I really don't like going places.
11,01Rather not waste the gas.
But given that Luna loves the Canterlot voice, she would probably be better suited as the Announcer and Celestia as Miss Pauling.
11,01Trixie!
how did we lost !
05i like how this guy rages on about us goign rage heavy push
05when i was heavy all along
05xD
...........
i get the last point
Ragers gonna rage
Guys, is the announcer playable? I just saw a Celestia...
Anyways, I'll be taking my leave now. Might come back later. Going to play some Smite.
WindWhistler: Nope.
Bye Chocobunny
Then why was there a Celestia on the field?
Guys, I'm off. Hope you had fun watching me blow up wrek's buildings tons of times earlier
WindWhistler: I guess it randomizes through the ponies and players
Bye Dermathil
Nittany, it isn't a "waste" if it it to take care of family members.
Aaaand I killed chat.
Nittany_Discord: That's kinda disloyal of you
You should take care of grandparents, any minute could be their last
11,01Sorry.
You know, when people don't know something, I just wish they'd flat out say it.
11,01!down
Not sure if enough crates

Pony name in Russian accent?

None of us can be arsed to say anything to be frank
Okay.

How close the voices are
The kid sounds like she is in the background
i see, shouldnt he go watch yo gabba gabba or something then
11,01Kids shouldn't be playing M-rated games at all.
every day i am raging
i mean that's what the kids like these days
Nittany_Discord: True that
Nittany_Discord: TF2 is a 15
Plus I played it since I was 11 :P
11,01TF2 is M-rated in the US I think.
TF2?
Mabye even 10
Has TF2 even been out that long
Pudge: I'm 15 now, TF2 came out in 07,
ooh
I was 10 in 07, so yeah, I played it since age 10
i woulda been 15 then
hmm
Ohai
Oh, you youngsters.
I am an adult sir
For some reason, my parents don't care what age games I play, my dad let me play bloody unreal at the age of 4
Techinally a adult by less then a month more
I'll be an adult in around 3 years

I suck at all classes, 'cept Engi and Soldier
11,01At least he didn't kill Rainbow Dash.
im surprised nobody knows eppaljeck series
AttacktheAndalite: it's okay, you can still have fun even if you're horrible! (Unlike CoD)
twi_sprinkle_GS17: never heard of it...
MadSurge: Not if everyone keeps getting mad at you for being terrible.
00,10At least he was't killed by twi, he would be heart broken
tf2 has too many clan assholes
is this a vidio or a live stream?
Pudge: its on youtube if youre interested. its about a crazy evil all-powerful applejack-liek being
MadSurge: I'm somewhat decent at Engie and Heavy. I know on the offline practices, I would have most kills sometimes
11,01Wrek's been killed by twi already.
WindWhistler: I never hung around the same server, so noone yelled at me
Nittany_Discord: Twice
Twi doesnt like him, yay! means i still have a chance with her :D
I'm single, and proud
05i wouldnt liek it any other way nit :3
11,01I think I'm best as heavy and demo.

Very_Silly_Filly: so am i
Very_Silly_Filly: and neither do i : o
Nittany_Discord: it's a slap-slap-kiss relationship :D
Too busy being in war with the government

Well that Magic The Traveling thing's pretty awesome. I have a feeling that's probably going to become something you guys will run when you play random pony vids right?
oh hell yeah

/me dreams of multiple PCs

Appreciation*
you build stuff in this game by smashing a wrench into it?
yup
under a flood warning until Teusday 10 pm now
just came in local news
Tf?
dat music
time to move everything important to the upper floor. and fill a few dozen sand sacks
/me lives on the 10th floor ^^
luna?
Im on the high side of the creek - all of Houston would have to be under water for this house to flood - the roads are the main concern - many still blocked an underwater as of last night
hello, gonna see if connection is stable with chatzilla
what is this my little pony mods for TF?
forgot a comma
sorry
hi Dken2021
what is this, my little pony mods for TF?
better
the most important conncections should be reestablished by now, Cypresswolf
currently 8 ft above flood level
oh
wonder who's playing
Shizuka probably
not sure, probably wrek
hm...
maybe it can be SuperBrony too
there are a lot of gamer streamers here
according to my Friends list, Wrek is currently playing Tf2
oh look, mecha nightmare moon
Jim: eeyup :D
/me 13doesn't stream Source anymore
Shizuka: You don't play crappy TF2 then? :P
hey now
>TF2 >Crappy
hello everypony
allop StuffCrusader
All the weapon updates have added mechanics that warrants this game to become more and more stale on features that ruins the game balance
If TF2 is crappy then what is CoD?
hey StuffCrusader how you doing
And with the modding including in many of these TF2 skewed it big time each update
CoD is deep shit
^
i'm doin great alexxm thnx 4 askin
I'm sure it's a great game, just overhype
Firstly
Oh my god
Pf2 = Unable to kill a pony, 1 pony buck up a whole team-
i like tf2 cuz it hs humor, tons of pretty colors and it's FREEEEEEEE
I didn't know Skyrim only needed 1gb ram
I could run that on this shitbox of a PC
how get luna mod?
The only thing that can kill a pony is a pyro, who in my honest opinion, has no weakness at all
some of us have played TF2 long enough to have paid for it :p
well, owned at least ^.^
Vordox: Pyros lack range by a mile, So smart players are able to avoid them
flooding events seem to be quite common in cypress
killerpony7733: Flare Gun?
how do people get the pony model mods?
killerpony7733: Which gives a dot too, you know burning stuff that kills
killerpony7733: Oh did I mention it's AoE now too? Or that's kinda redudant?
ponibas: not to mention their primary weapons do stacking damage or do average damage
uhh.. ok?
Vordox: Still pro players has no problem forming tactics to win against pyros tbh
05it was already aoe vordox
killerpony7733: Add in team fights
05but now instead of usign the detonator
Wrek: Not before the update, Flare Gun was single target
05its a gun in istelf
Wrek: And a gun is...a mid/long range weapon riht? =P
Streaming Team Fortress 2?
yes
I can counter argue anything that people say "Pyros are not overpowered"
all dem craftes
Single duo triple Teamfihts included
05pyros area easy to kill
05no matter how OP they seem to be
Wrek: Kill Shizuka
05gladly
Wrek: Good luck :P
05done it many times before
TF2_X_class_is_overpowered.avi
TIME FOR ART
MadSurge: Scouts, Demo man.
Wrek: Going to continue on the jensen pony?
what draw?
Derpy_Hooves: yep, that's the downside to living along a creek - all the water comes this way with excess rain
the pics looking good so far
13it is easy to kill shizu
sorry, Derpy_Hooves, meant to ping derpy_pony
Shizuka: So what weakness does Pyro have?
:) studious Twi
are you using a special irc client? I wouldn't have found my post on the web client so much later
Cypresswolf
hearing another news chopper flying around, guess we're the story of the evening new tongiht :P
haha
13Vordox: that shizu is nowhere near as good as you think she is
derpy_pony: yep, that's the downside to living along a creek - all the water comes this way with excess rain
Cypresswolf well you did get flooded
Shizuka: Class wise tournament play experience.
Shizuka: You're not far ffrom it :P
local cant seem to talk about anything else
it's more interesting than a g1 solar storm
vacation season...they report anything remotely sensational
^
the flood is the jackpot

Lil_B: Awesome! :D Mind show it?
FairysHuff|Headache 32 ? really? Concrats!

FairysHuff|Headache: It's our friendly wrek

I have 784 Dr. Who episodes to watch

Somepony is watching oldschool dr. who.

Oh and I was denied DLA again btw. Though my disability employment advisor wants me to try a third time.

Hey guys, quick question to those familiar with Kevin Smith
Also, haio everybrony.
hay CountDoofus
hi CountDoofus
countdoofus: i see what you did there
If Jay and Silent Bob were to be ponified, what would their cutie marks be?
CountDoofus SPliffs
Spliffs?
CountDoofus: Weed
CountDoofus Joints = weed = cannabis etc
Howdy CountDoofus!
Ah.
Haio Everlasting_Joy :)
Does anyone know a good Minecraft server?
It's because I am ponifying (is that even a word?) Jay and Silent Bob for a friend, you see.
RobertRevenge Don't play it sorry
hmmm
CountDoofus It would certainly be a variation of the weed theme but that isn't very interesting.
11,01Yay. Got a host mask.
I've already given my Jay pony a weed leaf cutie mark, just wondering what Silent Bob's would be.
A lunchbox?
Nittany_Discord Huh?
CountDoofus Batman, a MallRats reference
Exploding.Draconequus.Maid :D
Hey everypony
"FLY FAT ASS FLY!!"
(I really should start watching Kevin Smith movies)
Haio Very_Silly_Filly
Howdy Very_Silly_Filly!

I'm hungry for cupcaek

hi Very_Silly_Filly
i like trains.
i want my trains
11,01FairysHuff|Headache: The Exploding.Draconequus.Maid part of my IP now.
11,01Been meaning to do that forever.
11,01I actually needed to.
Nittany_Discord I don't know what that is...?
11,01Do a /whois of me.
hello.....everypony?
my trains :)
hi BronyInstrumental!
11,01Hello BronyInstrumental

its drawing all over again
Nittany_Discord I did the Who Is but still don't understand... sorry.
heya Jim
hi Everlasting_Joy
hai MahBoi777 !
MahBoi777, this Sunday greeting on Brony State is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
FairysHuff|Headache: it's just an identifier used in irc
XD
shana ah ok
11,01FairysHuff|Headache: Vanity host. It replaces the part of my IRC IP with a phrase I choose. So, if you do a whois, instead of seeing Nittany_Discord@whatever, you see Nittany_Discord@Exploding.Maid.Draconequus
FairysHuff|Headache: usually it's a slighty obfuscated version of the clients ip (revers hostname to be excact)
Nittany_Discord Aaah ok. Now I understand. Thankyou
FairysHuff|Headache: you can guess the isp (and thus country) by looking a hostname, it's also used to ban clients
So basically, if you change your name to Nittany_Tiger, as you do sometimes, if I did /whois, would it say it was Nittany_Discord?
*at the
11,01It would say it was Nittany_Tiger
11,01But Nittany_Tiger@Exploding.Maid.Draconequus
Ahh, well I'm lost then :3
Ooohh, okay
We need a conversation topic. Chat is dead.
how about........ time travelling rave genies?
11,01How about
How about no
how bout dem ponies
11,01Aww :<
I shall steer away from my preferred topics of politics, social conventions, news articles etc and pic something more community friendly ^_^
Science?
Food?
I tried whoising you, and I got [15:48] * [Nittany_Discord] (chatzilla@Exploding.Draconequus.Maid): Exploding Maid Draconnequus. What's with the second instance of the phrase?
Anyone know anything about how the human brain works?
11,01Kandarihu: Then the vhost works.
11,01Oh.
Dat creepy smile
11,01That second instance might be due to my client.
oh hai Nittany_Discord
11,01Hi Vordox
my internet connection hates me :P
is this live?
brain am good for making smart
MahBoi777: l o l
I can't brain today, I has the dumbs
Kandarihu: thats the realname entry
Wrek Do you think you could do a second version with Twi with glasses on? ^_^
(iirc)
its full chat all over again
Jim: mine does too:S
Kandarihu: in any irc client you can specify username, nick and realname
Kandarihu: whois entry will look like username@hostname: realname
UM, can I ask for this song's name?
The medical community used to think it was Vascular but not anymore
its science all over again
That accounts for the first instance of the phrase. But what about the second instance?
I don't know alot about teh brain
11,01Kandarihu: Do another whois
Done
its about brains all over again
MahBoi777 Neither do I. I know some basics but thats it.
wuts the date today/
BRAINS BRAINS
?
Oh, thank you, skylerarmor. :$
Depends on your time zone
ok that looks pretty creepy
July 15th
I'm guessing no one is up for this topic ^_^ lol
Kandarihu: k thanks
i want my trains
FairysHuff|Headache: Ah, that's cool
it's a mask!
FairysHuff|Headache: If I knew how the brain worked, I wouldn't have problems, or if anything, I'd know how to fix them.
Eeeeh.... How about them Tank Engines n stuffs. Thems smokey.
The Mask
Oh and the one playing right now?
Ok you asked for it. I'm going to look up a news article to spark conversation now. ^_^ You only have yourselves to blame.
did u hear Sylvester Stallone's son died?
Please FairysHuff|Headache, all you'll find are stupid political articles, pointless tabloid, and stupid "lighter side of the news" stories.
good night everypony! :)

k i am back
the pictures coming on well

Howdy ducky!
I remember as a kid, I'd take the train to my grandparents' place. That was a fun experience, mainly because I was riding the train
yay my internet was poop
trains.
I used to love trains
Is it better now?
had a room full of em
BaconMane I'm confused. I've seen people link much worse than that, including mods.
Lionel trains
i had a little train
0,5I highly doubt you have. In this room, at least.
FairysHuff|Headache: your goin a little crasy dude...
even had a watch lol
BaconMane So no mod has ever linked the pic of Twilight plushy with genitals? I think they have.
wait what
WHAT
they might have but they probably were banned immediately
http://noclipmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Train-sex.jpg
Yup. My second or third day on this site a mod put up a link for a disturbing lushy pic
Skylerarmor: So many captions. . .
WAIT WHAT !!!
And there has been many many more instances.
FairysHuff|Headache: which mod?
^
^^
I'm just confused by the double standard. I don't mind not posting suggestive stuff so long as Mods hold to their own rules.
It was weeks ago.
its twilight sparkle all over again
FairysHuff|Headache: you have logs, right?
shana No. At that time I was using the in site irc thingy mah bob
bummer
11,01FairysHuff|Headache: Who linked the Twi Plushie?
0,5I think you were in a different IRC room
0,5Maybe you were in brony
Nittany_Discord I wish I could remember. But I dont.
11,01Mods aren't above the rules here.
oh gawd not that room
^What nittany said
note that adult material is against ponychat network rules
(unless in special channels)
shana: Exactly
:3
eeeeeeeyup
BaconMane I don't see how. I was using the in site IRC embed. And had no idea how to enter other rooms at the time.
0,5I think you're fibbing or you're confused.
0,5It mustn't have been a moderator.
11,01If a mod linked r34, we'll get them for that.
shana: adult material does not violate the ponychat ToS
0,5Because none of us would do that here.
11,01^
13Derpy_Hooves: it does if the channel isn't tagged for it
"Channels which are not labeled as such are not permitted to share any sexual content"
Shizuka: i was actually typing that up when you spoke
BaconMane I am not lieing. I despise dishonesty. Though granted I could be confused. But I certainly remember someone linking that adult pic in chat.
i am ducky and i am confused
0,5Maybe we nailed them afterwards then.
0,5But the idea of a mod doing it is plain silly :3
I think I remember a twilight plushie pic, but it wasn't a mod that linked it
13how about
13you follow the rules
13kay?
0,5Shizu: Who are you speaking to?
Shizuka Happy to. So long as everyone else does.
13everyone
11,01Floaty Twi face.
0,5No one here is breaking any rules at the moment, no worries...
13not talking about now
13i'm talking about the future
13how about we just have everyone follow the rules, and there will be no problem
But now I know. I shall be more careful from now on.
I won't break da rulez
I follow rules! :$
Always following the rules and never will stop doing it

11,01Too bad it takes minutes as input. Would like it to use hours.
11,01Maybe I can edit that.
/me yawns
I guess chatzilla uses javascript for scripting?
11,01It does.
is Mount and Blade worth buying?
chatzilla ???
Jim yes. I already did
It's like Godzilla, but friendly
oh k
Jim I bought the pack
ducky: it's an irc client
Nittany_Discord: in the kick message i saw this on the end )))))
11,01Shamroc: Testing again
woo!
Shamroc is the new ric flair
derp
stop human testing :P
whereed nittany go?
keep human testing
oh hai Nittany_Discord

11,01I'm testign a script.
Nittany_Discord...im here for more testing
lets take my books
BOOKS
Shamroc: the cake is a lie!
Nittany_Discord likes testing...It's almost as he's a machine that likes testing...
*Coughs* I mean.. books.
alright Jim
i am liking this song
iunctus per amicitia
Google Translate says: Unita per amicitia
11,01It's not being edited.
ducky isn't that "I ate your wash cloth"?
??? i wroted it in my books like this :P
someone please tell me which song this is
ducky Oh dear dear then ^_^
Alright. I promised I'd start up that Terraria server as soon as I got home. So I'm an hour late
let me do it again
Kandarihu, Starting it up now?
08,01ducky: google says iunctus is "connected"
Yup
moop
08,01latin dictionary says "joined"
oh google translate, you so silly
08,01it's the root of the english word "junction"
i am now confused
Aaaaah at last. The painkillers are working. Oh thankyou sweet monkey jesus!
Nittany_Discord: it done yet?
11,01No.
woo!
Think I shall play something for a bit.
note to myself pay atention when you are at school trip in itali
Shamroc you'll never replace ric flair
alexxm: w/e
Alright. I'm starting up an unofficial Bronystate Terraria server at 68.169.139.179:7777
what Shamroc
alexxm: what/ever w/e
ok
11,01Dammit. Now it broke.
08,01i think i'll go with "unita per amicitia"
Allo everypony.
you doing good Meanwhile
11,01Hi Meanwhile
11,01Dammit.
Nittany_Discord: you are joining the channel without vhost and then leave and join with vhost set..
Been better tbh alexxm, but I'll get over it.
now lets see if it auto unbans
Whatcha testing Nittany?
what happened Meanwhile
11,01A timed kickban script.
I see.
http://www.artemis.eochu.com/ This game oh god
oooh
alexxm: Nothing relevant to chat.
though just under a minute
11,01Oh well.
11,01I'll just do the conversions and fix it later.
Nitt, and it's using username instead of host id
11,02Poniez ^-^
11,01No.
hai SuperBrony64!
SuperBrony64 do you liek them
Meanwhile is anything releavent in this chat
11,01I want the script to use hours.

Nittany_Discord: can you paste the script?

jklcssadjkl
/me hugs WindWhistler :3
SuperBrony64: NOPE
ok
SuperBrony64: No Newborns for you. :I

Hello everyone
11,02Hai BronyInstrumental :D
Allo Vinco.
i've been fine alexxm
11,01shana: Did that.
you doing good Vinco
Hey Meanwhile!
I'm doing great
00,10Did I see a request for ponies?
in before Nittany_Discord goes shopping ^^
11,02ME SUMICA
11,02I would like poniez on stream ^_^
/me 11,01goes to the panda-store and gets himself a panda. ^_^
Uploading your video. 213 minutes remaining
Sumica: THE WORST PONIES, PLEASE :D
^^
Nittany_Discord: and it didn't work?
11,01Nope.
00,10I should find the ep where sweetiebelle is born
11,01If it had, Shamroc would have still been banned.
Hey Sumica if you're putting on ponies why not put on Magic The Travelling?...although you guys are probably going to save that for when you run random pony vids
woo! bann
!
11,02Ooo...
imma scan my drawing for the BS art contest when my dad isn't around...gonna take some stealthy ninja stuff
11,01If I had forgot to unban him.
SuperBrony64: Uploading your video. 213 minutes remaining
youtube take ages
Nittany_Discord: i got ponies to bug on steam and skype dont worry
Sumica: that one is so awful :D
mainly because i am DEATHLY aftaid of him finding out i'm a brony
11,01Shamroc: I wouldn't put you through that unless you deserved it. :p
Nittany_Discord: i always desever it...but you guys like me to much hahaha
Nittany_Discord: and you're sure that you loaded the right script/reloaded the script? try changing the text minute to hours to see that you really changed it
11,01shana: Did that, too. It didn't change the readout.
05SO FAR SO GOOD
05BOTH IN ART AND MUSIC
Wrek: CAPS LOCK IS AWESOME ISNT IT
Nittany_Discord: then it's probably cached or something, try clearing browser cache?
05NEVER LISTENED TO THESE GUYS BEFORE BUT THEY ARE ENTIRELY ADEQUATE :d
05just had to
00,10Canterlock
haha
MFW I think Wrek's stream is the music for the video I'm watching.
Hey
00,10She looks sad now wrek
05sad? :3
05:o*
lol im bored
05next one to /bored gets a kick
11,01shana: That might be it. When I take the script out of the proper directory, the command doesn't work at all.
11,01Dunno what's up.
wow
Twi looks more tired than sad. So much study <3
i thought that was alot of joins / parts
but no its just gone quiet
11,01Yeah.
so what now
11,01It must be cache
im tempted to advertise my creative MC serv
ohai
This music is pretty epic
though not quite sure how the rules cover that
Vinco welcome to a Wrek stream ;)
11,01One more time Shamroc
Chrysalis: yeah, I don't think I've ever seen one
moop
and spy
Extraordinarie*
and wrench
dat blink
11,01It must be a cache thing.
pretty much every TF2 class
though iv never seen him as medic
I played TF2 once. I was not the best.
11,01TF2 takes practice.
no one is at first
11,01I still need quite a bit.
Hello Bronys and bronettes
11,01MP games take practice.
Nittany_Discord which class is your fav?
11,01Even more when they have unlocks.
11,01I'd say Heavy and Demo.
Woah what is with the realistic twillight drawing?
:D
Derpy_Hooves Wrek stream
Nittany_Discord: ok...unless you like sticky spam...keep a sheild on the dmeo
Nittany_Discord: for the heavy the tomislav is for quick ambushes
god he is a good drawer :O
Nastacha is fantastic for taking out hero classes
11,01Tomislav should be more accurate for being slower-firing.
not so much for other players
Nittany_Discord: yeah
:[ YOUR GOING TO LOVE ME! :[
Nittany_Discord then it would be OP
11,01I like Tomislav for advancing and Brass Beast for defense.
11,01Not a real fan of Natasha.
SWEET CELESTIA! BABY TWILLIGHT????????
against players its pretty poor
Nittany_Discord: same here,i'm an f2p(mainly because of 1: my mother hates purchasing things of our PC.and 2: we didn't have alot of money before in wasn't free 2 play)
Nittany_Discord: natasha is for defense as well...mainly support...
but against MLP Heroes, its unparralleled
00,10both good guns
because of its slowdown
11,01How long does it slow players down?
Nittany_Discord...also unless YOUR REALLY good at angling demo nades...stick with the default nade launcher
Nittany_Discord: enough to make a scout as slow as a soilder
:( no one aint even watching the video.... :/
Nittany_Discord just long enough so you can lock down a player
Nittany_Discord: i still love playing it though:)
but not for any length of time per round
11,01It took me a while to warm up to TF2.
:'( am i here?
Nittany_Discord: me too
11,01I don't have a lot of patience, so it's hard for me to get into a MP game.
DerpyDude: your here man...we see ya...but were discussing tf2 and such
11,01If I die a lot, I will get mad.
11,01And stats make me rage.
THE HEAVY IS A SPY >:(
/me wubd DerpyDude
Should I play Alice or Batman?
:P
*wubs
ALICE MADNESS RETURNS
great game :D
00,10that's what bot match is for Nittany_Discord
11,01KDR is a rage stat for me.
NANANANANANANANANANANANANANA BAT MAN!!
11,01I never enjoyed Battlefield because I died so much.
and it's funny how I was able to get my pirated save file when I ran Alice through steam
the guy aint drawing anymore, he is just playing music.
does tf2 even have a kdr stat never seen it?
05back
11,01TF2 doesn't.
Nittany_Discord: well,why care about KDR in TF2?
11,01I like that.
11,01I don't like persistent stats.
Im bored
inb4 kick
wrek keep drawing :[
Nittany_Discord...still here for any testing
here it comes
Nittany_Discord: your my BEEESTTT FRIIEEEND
AND DONT FORGET TWILLIGHTS HORN! *facehoof*
11,01I really need to work on not caring about stats.
11,01Or not playing games that punish dying like CoD and BF3.
11,01Since they work off of "Kills = rewards. Dying = bad."
punish dying?
ahh
Nittany_Discord, play Kirby epic Yarn
Nittany_Discord i have to disagree
11,01BF games have the ticket system.
cod rewards for death
with death streakjs
which are bullship
11,01MW2 and MW3 have deathstreaks.
00,10only stat that botheres me in shooters is respaun timer.
11,01They also have killstreaks.
Wrek, WHERE IS TWILLIGHT'S HORN?????????????
11,01Sumica: Yeah.
:[
details, details.
11,01It's too long in L4D2.
Nittany_Discord: i play Nazi zombies and TF2 to have fun,not be alll serious about stats,just help my team and if i get some good kills,well that's awesome,but i don't really care.
DerpyDude, on another layer
kk :P
00,10the horn you are looking for is in another castle
ba dum tiss
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Sumica WELL YOUR CUTIE MARK IS A PILE OF POOP! MUAHAHAHAHA
whats this? a wrek twi drawing without sexyness? and a 5 pony eps the same day? today is truly historical
DerpyDude: your steallin all the caps......he'll do the horn when hes done with everything else
lol he done the horn it in another layer, Shamroc
00,10too early for sex. Wrek needs more shots before he goes that way
sexified ponies kill my soul
11,01If Wrek was in the sexy mood, he would be working on my OC pic.
how do i stream when he done?
why does my cooking taste like sweetie belle's? :/
11,01Or something else.
What are we waiting for - Get Wrek more shots!
Nittany_Discord: MW3 sucks. soap dies, the game is nothing but MW2 just with new modes,and IW ONCE AGAIN lies!!where are those 3 new modes may i ask?
11,01I'd rather let Wrek work on Twi here.
Nittany_Discord: have you ever played minecraft? no pvp there, just a mutual attempt to survive
:) fair enough
hen3ry: did you burn the toast?
it is ... aDAWWWWWWable :)
11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: Infected, Kill Confirmed, Some modes from Black Ops.
Whore versions of MLP make me wan't to kill the entire internet.
11,01Don't look to CoD for major innovation.
String_Shredder: nah, didn't have toast. meatloaf. Sorry... spare mustaches, I mean.
DerpyDude: ikr
11,01They're making games for max profit. Why do you think CoD: Elite came out.
11,01And $15 map packs?
/me breaks Ryunosuke 's link in half
Murder pinkiepie drawer passes by me in town *turns round with flame thrower* KILL IT WITH FIRE
wat.
Nittany_Discord: umm,actually,there were gonna be 3 new modes as DLC coming out,but they never did
^
11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: Maybe it's still coming.
11,01Or they're working on Modern Warfare 4.
11,01I dunno.
Nittany_Discord: I think they're finishing Black Ops 2
11,01That's Treyarch.
I've... heard about MW4, or at least rumors
the MW series is clearly over Nittany_Discord ,thye main villian is dead
*the
11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: They'll make a new villain if they want to stay in the MW universe.
11,01It's easy.
^
and from what I have heard, they have
11,01I won't be surprised it IW makes MW4.
Nittany_Discord: Soap is dead
ooooh, it aint baby twillght in a cot, it is twillight reading a book under a blanket! :3
11,01They'll make a new protagonist.
11,01And they'll do it until Activision tells them to stop making CoD.
adressing all of bronystate, HOW DO I STREAM?
you dont
11,01Or Activision tells them to do another era.
11,01Or Activision lets them make their own game.
only mods can
when i want to put up a live stream, oh.
Nittany_Discord: All CoD protagonists are the same anyway :D
how do you become a mod? 9_6
6_9
My theory is this; hell, you see, is a bureaucracy. And at every level, you have a real jerk of a boss. No matter how high you are promoted, your supervisor is still the boss from hell. But so is his boss. And his boss' boss. There is no top, it goes on to infinity. Thus there is always a bigger boss.
11,01DerpyDude: Wait for us to ask for mods.
DerpyDude: you don't. A mod becomes you
well
String_Shredder: so mods are like Agent Smith?
DerpyDude: It's a long process overall
any easy way?
DerpyDude: hack a mod?
twi_sparkle_GS17: yeah
looking at the history of RL events and MW series... there isnt a big list of conventional enemies to deal with ;)
i'll just leave it at that
Easiest way is to invent a time machine, go back to before FiM came out, and create bronystate.
Warning: Plutonium is still hard to find in 2012.
lol, if any of you saw me whilst playing A:DD you would laugh until you crapped yourselves
why does a game need to be grounded in ealife events?
Nittany_Discord: wwe'll see what happens,then,but it was confirmed that there were gonna be 3 secret modes that come out on DLC,i think BO had the best DLC,and i think that BO is probably one of the few GOOD COD games
theyve been fight russia for forever
hen3ry: and delorians are even harder to find
need a new enemy just pick someone
amnesia dark decent*
11,01BO was OK.
11,01I didn't finish the SP.
Only reason I still play COD is zombies
DerpyDude: Nope, Wait for when they ask for mods and then you gotta go through a process that eliminates others and puts the best candidate as a mod
11,01And I don't care for the overpriced DLC.
05that should work
WaW was my fave , next to 4
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, because its easier to sell if you go HOLY PATRIOTIC in your game ;)
It doesn't _have_ to be a delorian. I've found an old-style VW bug makes a decent time machine. Except you can't really get it up to 88.
Zombie mode <3
Ryunosuke: feh
DerpyDude: You can't stream everything you want on the stream, So alot of stuff are a factor
just saying
I really hope they don't mess BO2 zombies up
i heard new COD will have crappy robots
11,01I wasn't impressed with the new CoD's campaign.
and russians
11,01Looks as scripted as the rest.
Me neither
russian villians are so 80's
Nittany_Discord: an interactive movie
:L
wow he/she has done alot since i got off it looks realy nice
thats not believable
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif
11,01MW was great because it was believable.
11,01MW2 was fun, but wasn't as good because it wasn't believable.
^
11,01And MW2 is when CoD decided to be an MP-centric game.
Sonic: I heard 8 players
16 players zombies? That's gotta be a biiiiiiig map
05>16 players
05>big
lol
05>wait untill you see planetside 2
05>LOL
11,01BF has 64-player MP
11,01TF2 has more.
not a big fan of FPS's to begin with
11,01TF2 is 16 I think.
Origin, GFWL why does computer have to be infested which such shitty online system
Wrek: I'm so excited for that game
Wrek: Ever played dayz?
wait what?
05lets see
Planetside? 1000 players?
05palnetside 2 has confirmed to support 1000 player MP games
o.o
Dust514 looks promising though
That's amazing
how big is the playerbase of planetside
05but thats just the stable limit atm
05once the game is release they hope to have unlimited player counts
lol
that isnt going to end well
yeah
I can tell you that now
so much players you can't even move
that'd be epic
OMG BLOBBS!
Wrek: is 1000 players on each team or is that map overall #?
Nittany_Discord: when MW2 was announced IW said that there was gonna be a local search for other countries,MW2 comes out,no local search,2 months later,no local search,,and then FINALLY after a while,they patched MW2 and gave it a shitty local search
How would you have unlimited?
I really hope they make it so you can remove mic
05imagine that the maps are basically 100if not 1000 tiems larger than a standard bf map
and when everyone joins that one guild/etc, there will be what? :)
053 factions a map
11,01IW doesn't have good post-launch support.
05oh
then you'd need fast transportation
05its an MMO too.
11,01Treyarch at least tries.
yesyesyes! trade my killing floor and rush for borderlands goty !
11,01IW ar Xbox 360 fanboys.
Wrek: How long would it take to get to a battlefield then? I don't want to walk for 1 hour straight and then die within the first 10 mintues
11,01Activision are paid to promote the 360.
@Sumica, thank you for not permabanning me, it was only an hour...but I must say it was so worth it. Lol.
no,IW are just shitty liars,and MASF123 ,if you're here,they are bigger liars than me!
@Wrek, are you streaming?
05battles can rage for days
05dropships*
lol
00,10not somthing I want to hear MASF123
05that are manually piloted
05by players
11,01Wrek: Sounds fun.
feh dropships...
lol
05(they need a lisence first though, so that you can guarantee that they are actualyl able to fly the things)
manually piloted by players
try orbital bombardments :)
11,01Is it more arcadey?
inb4 trolls
h okay
inb4 teamkilling Wrek
@Sumica, well what did you expect from me? Just tell me and I'll say it...with some exceptions...
yeah XD
hello MASF123
11,01So you don't have a steep learning curve like with Battlefield?
Hello...PerfectChief
11,01I hate BF's learning curve.
11,01It's the worst.
0,5Das gay
11,01And no bot matches or flying in SP.
05it wont be p2w
0,5Ah crap......
0,5Wrong room
0,5x3
BF3 has a learning curve?
lol
Dat BaconMane
das embarassing
hey MASF123 , does jon go on here?
hey BaconMane
00,10it's not a very good punishment if you feel it's work it to spoil
11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I dunno.
No Jon, doesn't come here.
11,01I never played BF3.
00,10the point is for it to be not worth it
0,5BF3 is fun
/me is anxious to get into MWO beta
TBh, Dust514 does looks like a futuristic BF3, but... better :)
MASF123: we have benn talking about COD and TF2:) and IW are liars and such
11,01MP games having bot matches would be a big plus nowadays.
@Sumica, wll I won't so it again...in fact MLP broke me streak of not spoiling things.
05i imagine that planetside also will include punishment for "troll" flyers. such as revoking their lisence
I won't do it again... Digh typos... -_-
05which arleady is hard to get in the first place
When is planetside 2 release?
11,01You could troll players with that as well.
Who is drawing? Is it @Wrek?
back in the day.. playing R6 and RS online MP maps.. you'd spawn and soeone would drop a grenade and TK everyone
MASF123, yes
I do like how EVE/Dust is set up though, there are ways to deal with AWOXers
MASF123: Eeyup
I hated that
11,01Pilot pissing you off? Fake a report and have his license revoked.
"@Sumica, I learned my lesson..."is that what you wanted to hear?
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
Nittany_Discord, just kill him... repeatedly
MASF123: I checked,and i have seen SE1, EP15
05MASF123: you already screwed yourself over
I'm sorry...
Wrek: when is it's release?
MASF123, just drop it
Ok I stopped.

FairysHuff: Sure. I'm done for today, but I still plan to add in Jay's hat, Bob's CM, a background (maybe the Quick Stop) and redo the smoke from Jay's cig.

"Daar Lein los dii." ― "This World is mine"
/me doesnt have tv either

FairysHuff: woah. that deserves a record
Eagle3302 Tis true. I don't even own a tv
wow
well I don't own a TV but my mom does :/
FariysHuff: wait.....HOW DO YOU WHATCH MLP!?
and since I live with her its inevitable for me to hear it when its on
StuffCrusader On Youtube
everyone watches MLP on youtube or gets it from Itunes nowadays
There's 2 things out there I do find worthy to watch: MLP and The Walking Dead.
^
in Uk i dont even know on what chanell it airs
You forgot Game of Thrones
Internet is best for things you want to watch. Cuts out the adverts and other crap
also I have Polish TV and I have no idea what chanell airs it
Season 2 of The Walking Dead still not on Netflix :|
/me has no idea what Game of Thrones is about
the only show I like is the IT crowd
8,6saw a few episodes of Breaking Bad before, not a bad show either
^
Game of Thrones is about awesome
what's with the Game of Thrones hype anyway?
05I like this song :3
i whatch NCIS -3-
GabeMoist: good to know
am I the only one who doesnt watch it?
Eagle3302 Dunno.
Nobody watching Family Guy?
Wrek: me too though i don't know what it is
Eagle3302: It has bewbs in it
Eagle3302 I don't watch it
Wrek: is that a filly twilight?
8,6I like the pony Wrek <3 ^_^
Eagle3302: Nah, I don't watch it either.
Eagle3302, I watch it because I liked the books
Family Guy I gave up since season 9 its degrading
i'm not CountDoofus is it on
Family Guy got boring
yep
season 9 was my last enjoyable one#
Watch PowerPuff Girls.
Thats one of my faves
now prefer Futurama
alexxm: Nah, was a general question.
/me has never seen an episode of Family Guy because the jokes he's heard sound stupid
The stupidity of Family Guy is what makes it funny. To me, at least.
yep
well it used to
i like mysterys at the museum
I usually like stupid, but it sounds like it crosses the line
now its just crap, they try to force the jokes, it seems like it
Eagle3302: i agree
:)
IM BACK

JESmith71: aren't we all?
they are vegetarians, I am still unable to figure out why the fuck Applejack has pigs -_-
11,01Serious Sam 3 is $10. Not my kind of shooter, though.
If you not gonna eat it then why keep it?

I just drank two 200ml chocolate milkshakes in the space of 10 mins cuz i was too lazy to put them in the fridge so i drank them so they wouldnt go stale over night.. was it a good idea?
chat where i feel like chatting
Potanity: depends...do you feel like pukeing?
R34, The ONLY thing worse than 4Chan
11,01I don't follow an active normal RD tumblr. Follow two grimdarks.
Potanity: There is never too much milkshake
no i drink like 4 200ml's daily
i rink your milkshake

i practically live off chocolate milkshake
I hate milkshakes...I would much rather have Chocolate Milk
milk is good for your body, chocolate is good for your brain and heart, what celese do we need?
*else
Potanity, I've consumed an entire 1L in less than 10 min
i think i have an addiction problem
When is the release date for PlanetSide 2?
Potanity: better than drugs, ciggarettes etc. I have MLp and GAming addiction
FairysHuff, Today
and internet
jk
Wrek: Is she reading it in the night beside a fire, with moonlight coming in from a window hitting her face/Book? ;)
Vinco It's in beta
I know
lol
Vordox: cheesy XD
Eagle3302: chocolate is good for you? i need more chochlate
i have: gaming addiction, pony addiction, chocolate addiction and lazy addiction!
Potanity: me too
StuffCRusader: well cocoa beans are but manufactured chocolate is not rly :/
Eagle3302: Cheesy but iit works
FairysHuff: not sure when the full release is
XD
i have a stomach ache now..
And besides, it's good training for Wrek to improve his BG experience if he's going pro :P
Potanity: Face it, was it worth it? I say yes XD
lol
Finds pony in box on the side of the road, Trixie
I can hear people downstairs now.. it's the middle of the night! burglars!
d
Wrek: you gonna do backround?
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-
|Discord| look dinner
quick grab the ponies and defend urselves!
Potanity, tolerate the till they feel uncomfortable and leave XD
i dont actually have any pony toys...
I dont as well
my big bro doesnt approve
as I said the only ponytoyi would get is a plush
/me has pony shirts
ages ago i told him i like ponies, didnt end well
Potanity, if it is burglars, just run at them screaming. They should leave pretty quick.
Potanity: me neither but i want the Firecracker Birst 2 ince figure
its been about a year now..
you take no candle.
i want dat twilight pillow
if there were burgalers in my house, i would claw at they're necks
alexxm: Tastes...spoiled
twilight pillow?
yum waffles
I'd walk downstairs with a shockingly realistic bb gun and mess with them
|Discord| what did you do when she realised you were going to eat her
what if they were tough and they are not scared of bullets?
Waffles: yup a twilight pillow :)
If I had burglars in my house...I'd....moisten them
If they're not scared of bullets? Terminator!
go downstairs naked, they will fleein terror
if you are male...
Eagle3302: in that case, fire a couple shots - I garantee you they wont stick around for long
Walk downstairs naked and fire a couple shots?
lol
I was waiting for that comment
are we using a bb gun?
Twilight Pillow: http://www.walmart.com/ip/My-Little-Pony-Pillow-Twilight-Sparkle/16651250
want want want but cant have
if burgelurs were in mah house, i would either scream leroy jenkins or get them assassin's creed stlyle
lol
if there were burglars in my house, I would charge at them with mah one handed katana XD
i unplugged the clock in my room cuz its too loud.. I have no idea what the time is half the time
or my hunting knife
Eagle3302: you have a katana?
I shoot first and ask questions later
if i had burglers i would just go downstairs in a clown costume with some fake blood on it
alexxm has the right idea
i'd run down the stairs with my window and smash them in the face with it
alexxm: that is terrifying
11,01I'd call 911.
Vinco, I have a one handed one like a ninja and I have a big one in garage
11,01Smart.
lol
i have no idea what i would do if burglars, only way to find out what i do is someone actually brakes in
Nittany_Discord, I'd do alexxm's clown idea then call the circus
walk downstairs in a jigsaw costume and a tricycle
911 first of course
Eagle3302: I'm super jealous right now.
Vinco: I dont think they were meant for fighting but id shit my pants if some massive dude charged at me with a katana
11,01I thought you were going to moisten them?
Vinco: I am a big guy XD
I am
I want burglars to come round my house now..
Eagle3302: I'm tall, but not wide. I guess I could put on a suit and pretend to be Slenderman.
You don't
llol
i'm going to hire people to rob my house
I'm interested to see what Wrek will do for BGs...
I still say the cheesy one!
dat candle
Vinco: I am both tall and not slender more of a big guy but I dont train so I dont look scary XD
big flame lol
In fact, I think I need a new rifle...something that'll darn near shoot off a limb in one shot - :) if they can make it past my dogs first

I remember when I started playing Morrowind. Got killed by the first enemy I encountered. Which was a Kwama Forager.
What is le chat talking about?
EA donates to charity!
11,01It sold the most copies ever, so I guess everyone loves it if you look at sales.
FairysHuff: i only played it for an hour and i agree

Yhtäkkiä neutromassasta manifestoitunut Maken järki muutti ajan rakennetta ja luuranko hyppäsi kaapista ja sanoi PÖÖ ja kaikki näki pelottavan naaman ja taulut seurasi silmillään ja niiden taakse oli teipattu 30g ruohoa lusikoituna takaisin Aladdinin paidallesi.

NEVER FEAR, SKYLER THE TRAIN MAN IS HERE
05wonder what song to play after this one
Does every solution in the chat have to be 'Kill the Batman'?4
Wrek: more polka
what do you mean AttacktheAndalite
wrek is doing this and chatting at the same time?
Kirzstryfe: wouldn't it make sense to send him that message in HIS language?
woah. awesome drawing
alexxm: A lot of "We kill the Batman" happens in the chat. Everyone must be the Joker in here.
im going to be assasinated for talking back to mods now arent I?
Suddenly from neutromass manifested Make's intelligence that changed the structure of time and a skeleton jumped from closet and yelked BOO and everyone saw scary face and paintings followed with their eyes and back of them was taped 30g of weed spooned back to your Alladins shirt.

11,01Ow
Ooh I hate the government, more than you and me! The government stole my goldfish, and unplugged my TV.
Uh-oh.....
11,01Thanks.
no problem
Trains are happening.
trains suck
they keep me up at night
11,01I like trains.
I like trains
Nittany_Discord: they'll eventually be able to do it without you wanting it
I like trains tho
you shouldn't do banking on that
HEY. thats racist. ima train.
I liek trains :3
ninja'd by Nit

SkylerArmor: i dont liek your kind.

/me 00,02runs over Nittany_Discord Vinco Potanity GabeMoist and crazypony

/me is run over
there's nothing quite so lovely as a train wreck.
I can understand y u h8 trains if they keep u up at night
/me 11,01dies
wait what?
Phase4...that was painfull looking..
What's with these trains suddenly?
00,02trains are cool
train wrecks are so much more aesthetically pleasing than plane crashes.
oh... well... thats a bit of a prob- GETS OUT FUN AND SHOOTS EVERYONE.*
i hate my clock cuz it keeps me up at night. i took the batteries out
Content That Should've Initially Shipped With The Game Is Availble As DLC For Only 849.99 On Our Great Service, Origin
I like riding in long train journeys just staring out the window and relaxing. So long as the cabin is relatively empty or quiet
I've liked trains since I was but a wee lad.
Gun*
also Phase4 the train killed nit..
trains are evil. try living near a railroad.
00,02SkylerArmor, GET OUT YOUR FUN
00,02Shamroc, D:
try not living near one, and needing to take a bus to get to the train :/
Phase4: well maybe the train should of hit him...go
d
hen3ry: Know that feel.
Still hate trains though.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: the school i work in is next to a railroad. the trains make me jump every time"
Lets get out our fun and shoot everyone. yay
hen3ry: lol its not like theres an actual station to get on it.
/me 00,02runs over Meanwhile
Potanity: i know, trains are evil
Ow.
I had a couple rather awful mornings in NoVA, where I had to walk 2 miles with luggage to get to the train station to get to the airport to get home. Not. Fun.
11,01Origin. Powered by Toilets.
I don't mind going on trains though
watch out for that Mine Turtle!
Trains, planes and automobiles stole mah babeh
i like trains :)
I love the London Underground (not in rushhour though lol)
Shamroc i got borderlands for my killing floor :p
yeah, underground trains are better
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: nice man
London Underground, Uncharted 3?
Trains like Bronies
Nittany_Discord: i know your pc is ded, but what onlne games do you play?
wrek wife wants to know if she can keep filly twilight?
hey whoever's doing the paint tool sai where did you get the nice tools? i got it but there's barely anything...
Potanity: God london underground at rush hours :D
oh celestia
11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: Lately, it was TF2 or L4D2. I don't play multiplayer much except with friends.
btw doesnt that look like fluttershy's eyes?
I've gotton hurt there soo many times
11,01Did play MW2 when my PS3 worked.
I was on MW2 today
I LIEK YOUR DRAWING wrek. i love you.
Nittany_Discord: hm maybe ill get tf2 some time
I miss WarHawk for my PS3. Shame it wasn't as popular as it should have been.
i want grand theft auto 5
i havent even played GTA 4
05music trivia: the singer of this not that well known metal badn is black. whom there are very few of
I go on S&D and kill dem annoying 12 year old trickshotters with model 1887's
Wrek: Sweet
11,01All of the gaming machines I like are dead. The only working console I have right now is a 360. I hate paying for online play.
GTA IV is practically unplayable on MP cuz of hackers
same for WaW
i love you
11,01Potanity: PS3?
i love you too?
Xbox
11,01Aww.
soz
Nittany_Discord Online play is for PCs ^_^
i used to have PS3 though
:)
11,01I hate paying for online play.
I sold it
11,01XBL is rip-off.
to get an xbox :$
*sings smile song*
Nittany_Discord: if only I could convince my friends of that.
Nittany_Discord: too bad you dont live in some slavic country, you could torrent to your hearts desire and avoid paying for games you dont like
@Wrek: where did you get the more advanced tools on SAI? i downloaded it but it barely has anything...
11,01Problem is, most gamers have no economic sense. It's why they're so easily milked and take tons of publisher bullshit.
i would like to know also
Who's heard of TheSyndicateProject on Youtube?
Nittany_Discord: i know you can, but isnt that hella dangerous?
Nittany_Discord People are idiots
11,01Somewhat. You're fine if you encrypt your traffic.
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, you give the authorities too much credit
Nittany_Discord twitter have been paying for my xbox live for over 2 years even now that my xbox is dead
Phase4: they might put individual effort into a few individual cases to make a point
11,01Twitter?
11,01How?
Man I feel dizzy now. I need to go to sleep.
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, yeah, but when they do that its hilerious
Nittany_Discord win a lot of easy giveaways :p
11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: They make examples of people by fining them way, way too much money.
00,02like the grandmother that was sued $200000 for music downloads
Potanity: Milkshake coma?
im back. who missed me?
Phase4: certainly not hilarious to Get sued for that
I dunno.
11,01Fuck the RIAA. They're greedy.
Phase4, didn't they try to sue a dead person?
Nittany_Discord: i know which is why i wouldnt torrent in usa
00,02GabeMoist, that too
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, not to get sued, but from this side
Even death cannot save you from the RIAA
I'll stay here for maybe another 10 mins and then go off. I'm getting light headed.
11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: If you encrypt your traffic, you're fine.
Phase4: i know, just saying that i would not dare risk it
Glad I don't live in the US
11,01People will always torrent everywhere.
Demopan?
I love living in England
Denmark is great
i wonder if anyone knows about my youtube.
11,01The US has a greed problem. Almost causes SOPA and PIPA.
00,02always use https (NOT http), use 3rd part dns servers (googles are good, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)
what?
Don't get me started on internet censorship
also i remember the days when 20$ for a game was expensive. nowadays im just wtf when i see 60$ for games
SkylerArmor: Well don't advertise it unless permitted by a mod
00,02its not hard to hide your traffic, which is why sopa and pipa are hileriously stupid
twi_sprinkle_GS17: I know, right?
11,01You have to now in the US.
11,01The copyright monopoly bought monitoring.
11,01Like it will work >.>
11,01They waste money trying to punish everyone for piracy.
Thankfully i couldnt care less about modern games
11,01Causing even more piracy in the process.
00,02like some years back when they raided the pirate bay
havent bought a game in 5 years. last game i bought was NFS: carbon :D
11,01And pissing people off.
00,02it got on fox news
Luckily most modern games are so easy they are boring as hell so not worth buying.
Nittany_Discord: well... can you really trust the gov. to do something smart? -_______-
Ok guys i've seriously got to go now. I think i'm ill..
00,02instant jump in users of the pirate bay
11,01panda: As far as copyright, the govt is listening to the wrong people.
Potanity: aw, get better and cya later!
Get well, Potanity
bye guys
11,01They're listening to greedy businessmen doing the wrong things to make money.
Seeya Potanity.
00,02later Potanity
bye Potanity
Nittany_Discord, what about anti-piracy measures that the game developers use, like in Earthbound?
11,01GabeMoist: What did they do?
/me join dashiesauce
whos that guy on EQD? its just a head. Double U Tee Eff dude.
00,02They're listening to people who think the internet is like a truck
Nittany_Discord: eeyup... well.... >.> the gov. will be its own downfall sooner or later ^^
11,01The only DRM I outright hate is always-on.
Nittany_Discord, crush your soul
GilDash: Dat fail join
killerpony7733: Shh! :D
11,01GabeMoist: Explain.
:D
Nittany_Discord, IIRC it makes the game very hard mode, then right when your about to fight the final boss, the game freezes and erases your cart
I hate Online only DRM. Limited install DRM and so many others
11,01GabeMoist: XD
00,02GabeMoist, trololololo
11,01FairysHuff: And idiot publishers think those methods work.
11,01And it only causes people to not buy the product or pirate a better version.
11,01Because pirated copies have unlimited installs and no DRM.
Nittany_Discord I just simply don't buy games with those on it.
GabeMoist: oh i love that one
And Arkham asylum got rid of Batman's cape's functionality
00,02its really funny when cracks for those come out same-day as the games release
GIYGAS AS EATIN' YOU SAVE FILE
11,01GabeMoist: I remember that now.
11,01There are anti-piracy measures that work that are OK.
11,01Like Batman: Arkham Asylum.
11,01Or Earthbound.
Nittany_Discord, i think those are the best
11,01Where the pirated copy is worse than the paid copy.
It's tragically funny when people pirate stuff to avoid the irritating things that are in the games they want to prevent them pirating it.
00,02in my opinion, only copy-protection that was worth while: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php
11,01When you make the paid copy worse with DRM and/or bad DLC, then you encourage piraacy.
11,01*puracy
11,01*piracy
I know serious sam BFE had a mini scorpion with a gatling gun which can't be killed
11,01'sup RainBroDash
what the sound &&
There should be a DRM where you have to match the breasts cup size on screen with a image that is keycoded to a website. ^_^
11,01killerpony7733: And I accept that more than having to constantly connect to a server.
11,01Which is dumb.
/me licks Nittany_Discord
11,01When that server is taken down, your game stops working.
well. im off to skyrim
er
morrowind
11,01Cracked copies work forever.
11,01Cya Bronysith. How do I taste?
Nittany_Discord: like moon rocks
May Diablo 3 die a fiery death for it's always online DRM
11,01Nice.
11,01Diablo 3 won't.
I can hope
11,01It's sad so many people suffered due to the DRM.
FairysHuff: may EA die in a molten pit of lead for well being EA
11,01Lag shouldn't exist in a single-player game.
11,01But thanks to stupid DRM, it does.
Theres an FBI investigation into Blizzard because of DIablo3
booooo Lag
Bronysith Yup
11,01I wish Always-on would be made illegal.
11,01It would make my day.
11,01It's so anti-consumer.
Or we could just firebomb Actishitten/Blizzard
11,01FairysHuff: Or buy it.
Nittany_Discord, there's a cracked article on some of the hilarious anti-piracy measures
Nittany_Discord With what? We're all poor ^_^
trance
11,01Ubisoft was the first publisher I ever boycotted. It was over always-on DRM.
11,01Back in 2009.
we need some creepy celestia eyes in the darkness XD
I like DeepSilver? I think. For the X space sim series
Cool
It was DeepSilver wasn't it?
aagh
00,02i basically wont buy anything unless its through gog or steam
00,02valve has been good about drm so far
Phase4 Same
GOG?
00,02and gog has none
11,01Steam is the most successful DRM to date.
Well, I just bought Frozen Synapse
Happy Brony Appreciation Day everypony!
11,01GOG is DRM-free.

MahBoi777: I killed a deathclaw with my fists

With bear hands.
'cuse must dance
MahBoi777: I named him Chuck Norris :D
/me dances his wings off
LOL
lowfn: In FO3 or NV?
Both
Because the Deathclaws in NV makes the ones in FO3 look like radroaches.
lowfn: now to take on the Legendary Deathclaw with fists
MahBoi777: ... Legendery Deathclaw??????
MahBoi777: A winner i yous
Well, that was probably influenced by me walking straight into the Deathclaw place in the start of NV.
you cant killa deathclaw with your fist unless you used console commands
*is you

lowfn: you haven't found the Legendary Deathclaw? O.O

Uncle ruckus "Run darkie run"
just act like a zombie like in shaun of the dead
lol
Just give up
This is why id rather have an awesome melee weapon instead of a gun
Why?
no loud noise when used
call upon the sea ponies
So
and melee never runs out of bullets
But can break
a gun can jam
Yay alcohal
better fix that up fast before the zombie gets ya
Zombie can hurt you when too close
i prefer melee as well
ill just use a buster sword
deeerp
WHAT 0_O
SlurryMoon: make him dance :3
or a tree
ill use a tree as a weapon
Melee has infinite ammo lol
Inb4 mistaken for a zombie because of that limp.
Pinkies4thWall: yup
fluttershy can hear you
inb4 Ded, no big suprise...
go inside
surprise*
wait.
DON'T SHOUT
But melee can break
Uncle ruckus "Dat Darkie is going to rob em"
dat limp

Bronysith: if you get tired, ammo starts to run out
dem walking skills
cratorkid: That very very limpy walk
Vordox: BUT THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE IS TRADITIONAL

Clearly you need to make a grappling hook out of that push-cart and your own leg.
Wait
GRAB THE CHAIR
Bronysith: you kidding? that's the paragon option. Renegade is to become hitler.
XD
Why can't we just break in already

RAWRity: what about rainbow ending?

Sixth Option : Use psycic powers to yell at CLem
This game is GOOOOOOD
Bronysith: rainbow ending is discovering the portal to equestria. Which leads into the sequel where you defend Ponyville from the reapers.
dat cel-shading
Once it goes up in high wheel
Keep talking to the tree house crazy
YAAAYYY
I HOPE YOU ARE PREPARED FOR KARMA, SlurryMoon I assure you

hey Om
wait, you can look at half-rotted freaks of nature without flinching but you puke at a girl killing herself? good job glenn
Suicide is a sin because it's murdering one's self. But killing in war is not murder. She killed herself knowing that she was going to become an enemy.

Oh jeez, a religon debate. I'll just be over in a corner.

Pinkies4thWall: which one?

Slurry's strategy: Fuck the old man, he'll just slow up down

i look a t religion from a logical point of view. I'm going to heaven, but even if there was no god, there is no cosmic punishment for religion, meaning that being religious is the safest. unless i go to hell for overanalyzing the system.

adasdad: cosmically covering your ass... i need to bring that up sometime
/me stares at all the people in his corner
Suicide is always excused by hating one's self, or being unable to face the consequences of one's actions. It's the easy way out. That woman head-shotted herself because she knew that she was going to turn into something that would harm the other survivors.
LOL
Jspang1 : Lollipop Chainsaw style?
Again
Everlasting_Joy: i don't even know how to play poker, best. pokerface. ever!

lol
hey bronies :)
Everlasting_Joy: id like to know too, i only know texas hold em
Jspang1 : Oh, basically the main character is a chick with almost no clothes on, so the first thing you do is try to see her ass, but the game cock-blocks you by making her cover her ass up really comically
derpy_pony: hoo?
Everlasting_Joy: aww but then everyone will know if i'm bluffing or not ;)
Derpy_Hooves: enjoy your greeting ping.
better thing to door is chip away around the door frame - most of the time, it'll be sheetrock - pharmacies may have stronger material - never wired a pharmacy so I dont know

Sumica: THANK YOU

Sumica: That just made my day
Someone said it. I don't even know if it was a mod or not. Maybe I was trolled.

Prick commands you!
SlurryMoon: do you need help? :S
Nittany_Discord: Is something preventing its airing right now?
when in doubt, DO A BARREL ROLL
00,10Now we just need to wait till they anounce the air date
player used family photo, ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE
Our viewership will probably triple the day of S3 premiere
00,10perhaps tom knows

Well when once we know the air date you'll put some sort of Season 3 countdown timer above the chat right?
Shizuka: Pong
00,10bullshit

do you guys stream it through live stream itself? or do you guys stream it by puting a stream on a stream. im confused
pwnies, isn't there a rule against that sorta thing?
get the tv to work?
he is a wizard
I wonder if they'll do like S2's begining, first two episodes, a two week break, then normal airing.
/me hugs Shizuka
Shizuka: oh nothing

OH WAIT.

*25 % of the people
Ghost30k, 25%
Shamroc: gotta keep women alive for repopulation i guess..

Isn't it obvious as to why people save Carley?
Slurry, how bout something other than games?
typed to fast
SlurryMoon: you done?
Can't say I'm fond of that ending. >_>
and they use that for the next ep
SlurryMoon....yeah that was fun man...i await the 2nd episode

Eulshy: if you could laze Pwnies, you were probably in the blast radius
11,01I could even give the highest donor a free game I have.
Nittany_Discord: unless you can buy repairs with tf2 items....i cant help
Nittany_Discord: I would try to help out, if that counts. I don't have much money myself, either.
Doesn't matter, I'm OP
/me Realises that standing near Eulshy while a nuke dropped on him was not a good idea
So I'm curious: since this is "episodic" content, do you have to pay for each episode as if it's DLC? >_>
Yep
Nittany_Discord: if i wasnt broke i'd help for sure
That's incredibly lame.
Pwnies.... Eulshy.....will you STOP with the RP please?
fine
SlurryMoon: this game reminds me of heavy rain
Maybe
11,01RP isn't allowed here. Please quit.
No more games :____:

Whenever you stream yourself playing a crappy game SlurryMoon, you should have your nickname be "Slutty_Moon", sine you're basically whoring yourself to the game's developer(s)
grab somethin', just not the brick.

1TB. I wish I had that much space on my computer.

Shamroc: You wanna know something insulting? Cthulhu Saves The World is less than two bucks (the cost of Dinner Date) and is a VASTLY superior video game for the price. xD
Those yays :D
Eddmario: nittany cant stream..his comps busted
SlurryMoon: Look up pyschicpebbles, He does hilarious animations
Is that a custom IE skin?
11,01People need to stop telling Slurry what to stream.

Content beats none in my opinion Nittany_Discord
CK|Caynap: Cause sea ponies are awesome
/me demands we sacrifice pwnies
/me slaps Pwnies with a nuke
?
For most of my life I thought this song was by the Beatles.
lol
Eddmario: lol
Eulshy: They ARE, but the people whining about videos usually don't like the Sea Ponies.
Hey why does it say that bronystate is offline?
This song would also be perfect for the intro to a zombie movie
Well screw them
/me Grabs SpadeMagnes[R] and takes him to a place called Prison Showers
11,01Hi Shizuka!
:)
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka
13hi
Maybe Zombieland 2?
/me glomps Shizuka
btw.. i heard theres a new intro for my little pony friend is magic. is that true?
I'm still ticked that poor Slurry ended up losing two bucks to that Stout guy. XD
13hopefully this worked...
Probably
hi Shizuka
uhhhhhhnnnnn I feel really sick
11,01Wait Rainbow Dash. There's a picture of a lighting bolt on your butt.
3whatever, it's fine
Season 2 had a new intro, why not S3?
Eulshy: G4 ponies are my fav but I don't talk down on people who like older gens, etc.
32 bucks is basically nothing to really cry over
3two*
Eddmario: wait whick song did you think was by the beatles beep beep or mr.blue sky?
*which
mario_pony: The song that's playing right now.
anypony gonna answer me? :S
1345C... stay low stay low...
oni_link you telling me this y?
Nittany_Discord: should we do something?
ah
/me LYRA
Slurry: I'd agree, except....Cthulhu Saves The World. Same price, easily worth it. :P But yeah, fair enough.
shizu plannin on hosting a sever tonight?
The villain from G1's pilot is the new character leaked. Calling it now.
Shizu: Tweaked your rig did you?
3yeah
season 2 didnt have a new intro.. did it?
no
11,01Dunno. Maybe RD just got a tattoo.
Shizuka: having temp problems or something?
Skyler are you dumb Skyler?
Eulshy: I saw you saying screw them. :P
SkylerArmor: Starting with Episode 3 it did.
strange it said bronystate was down
00,02Shizuka, 45 o_O
Not changed much
But they song was chaged
oni_link Screw people who don't like sea ponies?
00,02Shizuka, oh, do you meen asuka?
wait they are already leaking season 3 stuff
Yeah
13not so much tweaked as i did disassemble my desk, pull her out, and give a good spray of canned air everywhere
13not nearly as dusty as i was worried though
Ah.
They realsed two songs from S#
13though the fans are happily clogged
S3
I think unless I read that wrong Eulshy. I was asleep up until now
13not much i can do about them
I gotta get my keyboard cleaned. Almost all the keys have gum ereaser gunk on them
I should probably do that myself pretty soon.
1353... hrm...
88 mile
Slurry, I didn't expect you'd have these as you're favs
11,01Are the fans at least running?
Shizuka: Try an Air Compressor?
...
00,02Shizuka, you can often pull the fan itself off, held magnetically
13i think the biggest problem is the GPU
00,02blades i meen
meow
and clean them
I had a dream last night that was a trailer for "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe", the sequal to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
00,02then give the thing a good scrub
