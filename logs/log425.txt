O_O .....
WD
:D
Uh oh
WD.
Back.
I am back
anything that isn't Seagate
I like UPS Rainbow Dash shipping myself. But that's just me, some people prefer Fed Ex.
wait what mario_pony
drf
Seagate or Apple?
Red Bubble has a ton of pony shirts too
>_>
UPS is best shipping.
Red bubble is AWESOME
alexxm: nothing
several people at the last Houston meetup like my Dr. Whooves scarf
I ship UPS all the time.
I prefer FedEx for fragile goods like HDD.
mario_pony: meh, that room is crazy
Apple doesn't make hard rdives
dont make him choose XD
*drives
they use Seagate
http://fav.me/d3iurmm Disloyal Dash.:|
Screw that. Postal Service is best.
Otherwise, usually UPS or whatever has the best balance of cost and timeliness.
MahBoi777: its kinda funny
last I checked anyway
they might use WD
http://www.redbubble.com/shop/brony+t-shirts Brony t shirts here! :D
hmm
I bought 144$ of Brony t shirts there :|

UPS, USPS, and FedEx are all bad in my opinion.

alexxm: I dunno.
they'ld probably run out of ideas thoug Biglaw
10Gyrados backwards, Sodarayg
the new one I bought should come with one so I suppose I can just wait on mailing it until that comes in
M_BISON_YES.avi
Do you really want that to happen to ponies?
10Pronounced soda rage
and it will, WITH THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!
Krakass then ponies will take over
07isn't the ps2 cable the same thing
http://fav.me/d46t2hv 2000% faster than all of the other karts out there.:)
is it?
02Ok
Biglaw: Minus the fact that they took decades to write a movie.
What Krakass said.
07pretty sure
10!pokemon
hm
04So that's why my Gyarados inexplicably got confused everytime I used SOda Pop on it
Skylands, you are a 6Skiploom.
mario kart rainbow dash? TheRainbowDash
04!pokemon
Drake, you are a 3Probopass.
048I
that begs the question: where is my PS*2* cable :P
I think FiM can hold strong for 5-8 seasons, depending on their strategy.
alexxm: Aww yeah! Fucking right!
/me noses people
Sad face....
:(
6uh
10Probopass is an imposter Mario
13AT least you're not probing anyone
Why sad face?
6probably should google that one
well I can see if the p
plug fitgs
-g
if I find it
TheRainbowDash: I want that Dashie Kart :d
I could make do with 8 years of ponies.
6cuz if that's true, I guess I can switch my cable between the PS2/PS3
what Krakass said
Gunthler: Who doesn't?:D
but the first-gen PS3 I bought is coming with the regular cable
26 episodes * eight years is plenty.
so I can wait for that and just put it in the box, if you want
Yeah.
I just use HDMI for everything DX
*XD
26 times 8 seasons=208 episodes, amazing.
I don't want MLP to become just one big forced show like the Simpsons.
FIM can last as long as spongebob has lasted 13 years

alexxm: Rainbow Dash saying..."Fuck you! I'm a pony!"
cachi01 x pinkie pie trains
Ya, so will other characters, but in any case.
/me suddenly has Rhythm Heaven music stuck in his head
thanks TheRainbowDash you don't mind me asking what the pictures are do you
Meanwhile..you up for a game in l4d2?
It will sorta be how I would have handled the whole controversy. An episode about her and the Mane 6 getting to know her.
Shamroc: Sure.
ok now to get others
Monfang x Chrysalis
Dafuq
well then alexxm its a giant luna picture in minecraft shown from birds eye view (so the image is larger and therefore of better quality than if the picture was stood vertically), and TRD's was a rainbow dash version... just to clarify
Jaketehsnake...you want to paly some l4d2?
Hm?
dari: Is it bad that I want to buy that?
Reasons to buy this car, makes perfect sense.
Monfang x Chrysalis?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT...were gonna start a l4d2 game
Bottom left.
What made you say that?
yep
thanks KwakLad
alexxm: Dash putting up her hooves in the air, and standing up on her normally so, back hooves.
or try to at least
Truly, we can never have enough Derpy, but a full episode about her would ruin her
yeah that's weird
my crazy little insane pinkie pied train liker head made me say that
thanks TheRainbowDash
I can't find the PS2 cable either
i'm on a lol match it will end in ten minutes tops
That is one hell of a Craigslist ad
Shamroc, I will participate if we get a game goin, but right now I am playing FO:NV. See if midnight of Bronysith wil platy
I'll just wait for the new one
ahh
Shamroc, If so, I will go with you guys
Well tell it to stop that. I'm trying to convence myself that people are interested by talking to myself on IRC.

TheRainbowDash: :D
cachi01: who is monfang?
lol
/me bonks cachi01 with a cinderblock.
cachi01: is it appropriate to say Monfang got burned?
Pikeman beats Tank Shizuka. How could a catapult stand a chance against an archer.

ith was lik e"This model of PS3 doesn't support PS2 software"
at least Sony is honest :P

CupcakeWarrior: You do not have to share that publicly, you know...:D

Of course that's a real site, are you kidding?

There needs to be a channel just to talking about pony lore.
pissing people off on red dead redemption
so let me get this straight no trolling no advertising any channels no harmfull stuff to any body or no disgusting stuff to post
Sounds about right.
PRINCE DARI, LOVELY IS HE, KING OF ABABWA\
i'm good DashWithRainbows
has any body ever broke the rules
Yesh
i dont think no one would
They have.
oh hey Johnjoseco got online via skype
00,03No one breaks the rules when I'm around...
XD Litwick
All the time
Then they get sent to THE MOOOOOOOOON
people break the rules, and they feel the might of the banhammer
TheRainbowDash: oh okay
yeah right :P
Scoot-Scootaloo: I was there when someone did, a lot of times now. You're not doing your job well....:| - Ghosties
Just ask CCCP about how many times he's been kicked!
or they just enjoy the kicks *cough*ota*coughkon*cough*
the glorious banhammer, made of gleaming metal, shining ever bright as a beacon to the power of the moderators
And GOTTA GO
DATE
hey Scoot-Scootaloo you have a awsome name it ryhmes pretty nicely

Litwick: hey ive only been kicked like 30 times!
Unless you get a record number of rule breaks.
Bye LadyCanary! (kisses you)
HORRENDOUS THINGS
I hope Canary has fun on her date
Scoot-Scootaloo: Can I be a mod? Pweese? :3
Then we celebrate you and crown you our supreme ruler
CCCP: can people get banned

@pony
12Shamroc is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves

dari: sounds legit.
RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
By bad things...They mean shoving the rule breakers into a closet with Val since he is obviously gay.
Moo.
Litwick: O_o
alexxm: oh whats the longest they can banned some one
00,03Nahh~
dari: so otakon is our supreme ruler?
Shame Val wasn't here to see that DWR
13Does anyone know how to stop Steam from notifying you when someone on your friends list gets a comment on their profile?
Val would've blown a gasket.
wow has that ever happend to any one i hope not
DashWithRainbows: Yeah, if Val was here, he'll go rage on you.:D
somany times

We need 1 more for L4D2 Anyone want's to play ?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Why you ignore me? I wub you! :'( I wanna be a mod. Pweese?
Chrysalis: how do you get a permanet ban

Okay, party people, I am back!

...still need...an 8th for l4d2... honestly im gettin annoyed from asking

mario_pony: eww

otakon is actually in chat, but probably not paying attention.
or you still break the rules after the temp ban is up
00,03Kipkat07_Mare: Hmmmm.... nah~
Kipkat07_Mare: There will be actual times when additional mods are needed on the channel, but not right now.

Meanwhile: lol
CupcakeWarrior: um okay
So, I'm ready to be one too!
otakon is out shopping at the moment
And there we have it, otakon is confirmed as a penis.
Tacowiz is the member who chose Spider's Web for B film.
So he gets all my love.
Meanwhile: LANGUAGE!!

It's about a deformed piglet being a spazz.

otakon gets all the mares, if you know what I mean
It's a hate-hate relationship.
I have no idea what we're talking about at all.

In other news Scoot-Scootaloo has been defeated by a baby.....
Whoa!
Kipkat07_Mare: Knows.
Shoot that guy
The Vault Dweller killed The Master...
So, how did you mess up so bad you "accidentally" blew a city up! I deactivated an atomic bomb on my own!
TheRainbowDash: SOOO THAT DESTROYED MEGATON
YOU CANNOT SAVE THEM SADY!
cachi01: Eeyup.
I liked Megaton.
lol
OmegaMaretroidBrony: well the Master WAS insane
i thought it was me activating the bom
Meanwhile: Sadly, Dash destroyed it.
00,03Well, I KINDA delivered a package, which KINDA blew up a city...
Jeez, you really need to start using VATS
I wish we could have fought a Master like in Fallout 3
Kinda you say......
TheRainbowDash is worst pony.
Wrek|Observiking: TAKE THEIR ARMOR DAMMIT!
He was a Blob of flesh with psychic powers and a super mutant army
Woah man. We don't wanna hear about what you did with your package.
Wrek|Observiking: WHY DO YOU NEVER WEAR ARMOR?!
Well I KINDA didn't put a detonator on an atomic bomb which KINDA didn't blow up a city.
Wrek needs to play L4D2 with us.
/me slices Meanwhiles dick off
:3
TheCourier: No, my pony logic state that Dash did a sonic rainbomb and destroyed the city by herself.:)
00,10wrek never uses Vats
ThePinkiePie is best pony
cachi01, isn't there a limit of pages that they put in the book?
Meanwhile: What?!:D
otakon: armour is for pansies. Vikings don't use it.
Sumica: he never uses armor either
I know, and it's really annoying
Yeah...
otakon, he is wearing armor
Meanwhile I have lost all positive feelings for you
vert
Meanwhile: how many Vikings do you see kicking about now?
Time for genocide of the unpure
that's right
Ryanier128: that's nice. Who are you?
Ryanier128: you had positive feelings for Meanwhile?
00,03Big deal, I saved an entire state from being a deranged pseudo-roman empire!
otakon: Wrek. Your argument is invalid.
I understand killing the radroaches, but do you really need to kill the fellow people that you grew up with?
Spell-of-Gaming: i actually waslooking for some mods and a book mod appeared the description said now u could read harry potter books and the hunger games in minecraft!
Wow, people can't seem to understand sarcasm
stop in the name of love
http://fav.me/d48r23u How cool is this?:D
Meanwhile: what argument?
But...the Romans are kick ass!
Kandarihu, they started it
what is it TheRainbowDash
otakon: exactly.
Well except for Butch.
Yeah, to be fair, they are trying to kill you.
That_British_Guy: the Romans LIKED ass
But he was a douche
So who was this "courier" spoon-fed by? The NCR? Well I'm the LONE wanderer! I make my own choice. Except... In terms of the Brotherhood of Steel... But I could've walked away!
alexxm: Rainbow DAsh, Perler thing...
TheRainbowDash: Aw yea, bomberman
Meanwhle I am a guy who his holding back from sending you a long rant in a PM about why RainbowDash is the BEST pony
did.. he just say... raj raj?
From what I can tell, they were locking down the place because of the Radroaches taking over.
/me activates the water purifier with the FEV strain beign injected into the water.
sou desu!
Maybe something important happened in that dialog that Wrek skipped over.
00,03At least MY dog was a super cool robot!
rainbow dash is obviously not the best pony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYkbsAi20ZU
Bats! Bats in my face! heeeeelp!
TheCourier: ....my turtle can fly.:D
Raj raj!!
BE A MAN YOU FUCKER!
rainbow dash is obviously not the best pony
At least I didn't NEED a robotic dog. I could keep my own with my regular dog anytime.
says Derpy_Hooves
Derpy_Hooves: Wha....(sobbing)
A soda
No. The player character's dad left the vault, so the the security staff went off their rocker. They've already killed the PC's dad's assistant.
Derpy_Hooves: what?
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
And my Super Mutant, the one with the gatling laser, would have a field day with your small pooch.
Come at me Raider Dash!
alexxm: D'aww, th..thanks...
obviously all pony is best pony

00,10it's like skyrim only more orange
Well, at least he's gonna end up with ALOT of ammo
oh rly
True. But I think the specific "blood for the blood god, etc" think is from Fantasy. Then again I don't follow Warhammer all that closely, so I probably wouldn't know.
WELCOME! To level 2
ITS SKYRIM only with guns
Sumica: do you like mmmmmmoranges?
Sumica: its like skyrim except good
Wrek|Observiking: FINE! But you'll be sorry when it takes you 10 hours to hack a computer fromt he beginning of the game!

I haven't had much luck with DVDs on Winamp
That's a nice SAFE idea :)
and WMP works fine enough
Sleep is for the weak
Dark92Enigma: EXTREME RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bullhorn: Wrek your mom's calling for you!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/752/
Gunthler read MLD. It's a good story that's well worth reading
/me enters fluttershy cringe mode
JaketehWanderer: it restores health
I hate playing DVDs in the useless piece of crap known as Windows Media Player
otakon: What...
00,03Sleeping is for the weak!
especially since DVD support is not free
That's just how I do it. Sleep how long? 14 hours. No 10, no 12. Damn, only time for seven
Y U NO <3, FlareChaser?
you need to pay for it
Bronysith, I know, still
http://fav.me/d4rvfjp Yay!
Meanwhile, that's not how it works.
Uh no.
00,03No rest for the weary!

Pinkies4thWall: Flare is mad right now....
otakon I didn't knew you were a wrestling fan too!
lookin like a boss!
Someone had an interesting little book to write, so I had to walk into a MINEFIELD. Talk about almost blowing up. Could you survive the Pitt I bet not. I walked in and out of there without so much as a scratch. Vault 87 was as easy to me as Vault 101.
What is with all these got-damned links?
it might have changed since then though
Flare will be happy tomorrow, just not today, its been a long weekend.
I enjoy clicking on them.
Since 2006?
get soda
I have not used Windows Media Player in about 10 years
JaketehWanderer: I do not know, I only send the awesome Dash ones.:)
Exactly
Pinkies4thWall wants you to Smile Smile Smile, though
it remains the best thing in the wasteland
that is how useless it is
because I found better media players
Megaton this way
wait..for it..
my thing will come up...
with better format support
When in doubt, use your BB gun

I will read MLD eventually, as soon as that pony withdrawal hits, been over a week and still all good
Is now writing in italics/ Thanks Dken2012!
Dken2021: The plot is so ogirinal, the characters are all very human and fleshed out, and none of it feels artificial.
I failed
Airpuff: Uh-oh, you read THAT story?:D
TheLoneWanderer can you take a behemoth with just your fists
TheRinbowDash: No! *Liard face*

They're usually have brackets on both sides
The great taste of raw fish in smoothie form!
Look for two brackets of the same kind with a bunch of characters in them. If you click on them they'll remove incorrect passwords.

Dark92Enigma Sentence

Take a leap, drink a Quantum. Oh!

ponies47 eeyup
is that dari?
I don't think they're happy with Wrek
bullents aren't the best for your health
xmasninja: You must kill a nest of giant spiders that has been eating my racoons, there is an estimated 485, all the size of a trailer, and one drop of poison from their veins will kill you
Phase4, Wrek is
dang it
You can't go ballistic with a knife
Phase4: Wrek|Observiking
although it might be another character ponies47
it never gives people Mami Tomoe for some reason
huh

his voice sounds a little different
put explosives in his pants
xmasninja: And i will accompony you on this mission, you will have to carry me on your back the whole way
ded
Oh mai gawd!

http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m12gz7IJ1U1r1b6b6o1_400.gif
I said again. -_-
TheHoodyNinja: so what now
Just move on bro. Moriarty isn't worth it
perhaps if you didnt yell so loud when using your knife
stealth mode
the yell is for intimidation
nothing like a coke float when one's out of whiskey :) delicious
xmasninja: gotta kill the spiders
Derpy_Hooves: lol
Moar Ponies IRL! >: D
00,03And now we have gotten full circle :3

For realsies.
00,03X_X
gay runs are best runs
Wrek is suicidal after that
i regret nothing
TheHoodyNinja: sensei you seem to like making things hard if i must i will
Simms lives to die another day
*faceground* http://derpy.me/chnuU
stop dying
ded
wrek is so drunk
We got a pro right here.
One of the few things I know about this game is what can happen to Megaton.
02I'll do yellow, some people don't like it when I use orange
I actually found Simm's dead body outside, so now I carry it around megaton.
SCOOTALOO! SCOOT-SCOOTALOO!
I hate how I can never tell the difference between Kirz and scoots. they both are Greentext
hai there wrinkles
pikorar, why'd you go and recommend that movie?
pwnt
Wrek, are you drunk or something?
hey
Three for three?
Dken2021: I didn't recommend that movie?
Wrek is sooooo good at killing himself
CupcakeWarrior: looks like it
Note: Falling off of buildings is unhealthy.
Nay!
4 for 4 now!
Damn you suck.
00,03... Clearly?
Scoot-Scootaloo: ohai
CupcakeWarrior: Yeah, im over at his houseand we having a good time
Wow....:D
pikorar oh my bad, sorry
If you can walk a rail, you can walk a wire
Dken2021: I recommended the pony episode, Fall Weather Friends.
Well, 80% is good.
brb
00,03oh hey, Pinkies4thWall!
gravity sucks
"CRACK!" =O! *INITIATING DOOM MUSIC!*
Now, you;re stuck. Grats

Fail :D
InB4 Wrek kills himself some other way
indeed Krakass
indeed
And then he slipped over a pipe and died. Dee end.
02wait, now I remember
TheHoodyNinja: here is the damned sandwhich oh dont worry about my missing arm and eye im fine
Wrek may or may not be an alcoholic
beep boop son
unleash the scorpions
Death by mines.
6for the sake of the script, yellow fits, and it's not like you have to read it to know who it is
02it was unh1024-XD
6the only character associated with yellow is mami
STOP KILLING YOURSELF!
Thus ends the story of the Lone Wanderer... He tripped over a pipe.
you know, in the time it took him to do that he could have just walked to the door like 5 times
Yus.
One of the few things I know about this game is what can happen to Megaton. Are you going to make it happen?
Beggars apparently can be choosers
02true
So I just start a new game of Fallout 3. I need a name, any suggestion?
Kandarihu: He saved Megaton.
I'd recommend Java
Lawlz.
name
what a hero
I'd go with Lawlz.
Kandarihu: He could've blown it up.
Java: Name him "FillyFlam is great and sexy"
/me heals xmasninja because he did not complain about his missing body parts
Java: Boy or girl?
Java Admiral Wolverine Lightningbolt?
boy
00,03Java: Dr. Fluttershy
I'm surprised he didn't.
He-she.
It.
Java: Odiferous
Wrex is Megaton's Dark Knight
If boy, name him Calvin
Xe?
Aeiou
xmasninja: I must go now, we shall resume your training when i am done

There we are, enough theme names here

Lil'Pip?
Is it too late?
Hmmm.... let me see... Dr. Fluttershy looks good

Lil'pip is my favorite fan-made pony.
It won't let me scroll down or up.
Wanderor is best spelling of wanderer.
Like a BAUS!
Name him Kenshiro and optimize his build for unarmed combat.
Krakass: Nah, Calvin is mah real name. Interestingly enough, I was named after the comic
:P
Nyarr

D'aw.

HNNGG

Rhythm Heaven is a bitch to play on a ds emulator
You do what you think you should do ^_^
/me boots up his lappy
No u

11,02Nah, cause liek Allie Way doesn't know me and she could have a better colt than me ._.
TheRainbowDash hi ! you there ?
Get the real deal. :3
@pokemon
Lol
SuperBrony64|AFK: You can dream
6point being
SuperBrony64|AFK...lies you are great colt...
SuperBrony64 is best colt.
I'd like to be able to pay rent...
Even without my normal hacks
I still got it
Dat Get Out
SuperBrony64|AFK: dont say that! :3
May I ask who Allie Way is? lol
6nintendo owns the company and all of the marketing, but for the most part they let TPC do their own thing
yay
laptops
@calc 2+2

Haha!
Superbrony64 is best moo
02true
The rent is too damn high
MahBoi777: a background bowling pony
All I know is that she's a desktop pony
Alister No.......
02which is good
Gunthler: ah, I see, thank you
Except for extremely large values of two
Dark92Enigma : what a shame
without a hole, where would you be?
I like that new pic of Alleyway
wat?
What would happen if I met Colgate IRL?
02TPC would know what they're doing more than Nintendo would
Who said I didnt?
Eg. Apple partially owned Pixar/whatever and doesn't control it
Mwahahahahaha...
mfw I just found R34 of Allie Way ON THE FIRST PAGE WITH THE SAFESEARCH ON!
I want a changeling mod for Skyrim.
Unfortunately, housing is still an issue.
Then I'll buy it.
you would ASPLODE
Dafuq
Or at least, Stevie did
11,02MahBoi777: Background pony in the Cutie Pox episode when the CMC are at the bowling alley. She was the tall one with blue hair.
CupcakeWarrior: HA!
Alister and i have mixed feelings about it......
CupcakeWarrior that takes... skill?
SuperBrony64|AFK: she needs more Colgate in her life.
Even if I joined up, I wouldn't be able to live on a ship the whole time.
You should DESTROY YOUR SEARCH ENGINE CupcakeWarrior
Its the third result!
SuperBrony64|AFK: OH, I see, thanks
Dark92Enigma what do you mean ?
