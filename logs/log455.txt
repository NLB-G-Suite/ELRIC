There is one type of bug I like...video game bugs...like the one in Big Rigs (considered to be one of the worst games ever made) where there's no limit to the amount of acceleration you can get when going in reverse, causing you to be able to go in reverse at millions, and even billions, of miles per hour. (Yea, I know...kinda off topic by now after the change to diamonds :P)

hi guys

wtf WWII?
Hey hey hey pony_911
hi pony_911
hey pony_911
I'm not sure if this documentory will explain, but I hope everyone understands that the choice to drop the bomb wasn't one made lightly. If the US Military wasn't certaint that Japan would have fought with every man, woman and child to drive our troops back using suicide tactics, they would have never had done this.
^
13the main effect it had, iirc, was to scare hirohito into calling off the generals
they had it coming
AHH! I'M SO BORED! (Slides across floor)
And be thankful that they never called our bluff on a third bomb
13yep
We didn't have it
mhmm
I bet it wasn't an easy decision
13anyway... sleep time for me
thank god we havent used one sence

Good night Shizu!
11,01Night Shizuschlafen *hugs*
pony_911: Why would I do that?
because you're bored
One of the major things I don't like about the end of WW2 is that the US made it illegal for Japan to rebuild it's own army. They found a way around it, but it lead to private ownership of guns to be illegal in Japan. (based on my research)
pony_911 ewwwwwww
I can think of only one other pony that licks herself .
:O
who?
better safe than sorry Monfang
You don't wanna know.
People should be allowed to defend themselves however they wish, MahBoi777
okie.....doki.....loki
Honestly, I kinda wish private ownership of guns was illegal in the US, too, but I'd rather not get into that debate here.
Pony_911, what about other countries?
It loves trying to be a world police force.

hen3ry, even if it did i doubt the atmosphere would sustain combustion
exactly, there's no gravity. Earth just sucks
yea, igniting the atmosphere wud SUCK
*Flys around chat*
igniting the sunlight seems more plausible
/me 11,01explodes

Phase4: Oxygen + fuel = fire. Plenty of fuel on the ground if the air had maintained superheated status. Fortunately we have JUST enough Argon in our atmosphere.
I'm not exactly sure where they got the idea the atmosphere would combust. :S
Bet you can't do that again, Nittany_Discord
11,01You can't ignite radiation.
the friendship cannon is more powerful
AAAH YEAH!
hen3ry, what is in the air that can combust?
I don't know much about radiation,
Love is...
Carbon?
Helium?
Hydrogen?
nitrogen could. But it was mainly the concern that you get it hot enough, the surface burns and the atmosphere sustains it.
/me 11,01explodes
good night everyone
*pokes Ponies47 with a stick* boom.
It is true! You can explode twice!
lol

if you call a "trade war" a war.

think of all the deaf whales...
China is trying to build a monopoly on green tech.
MUFFIN
<_< >_> *explodes*
I wonder if we'll ever find something worse than nukes...
Fission bombs?
Fusion Bombs?
Dark Matter Bombs
slipspace bombs
H-bomb is fusion
Anti-matter bombs ?
Ninjazz, we probably will
Indeed. :(
11,01Anti-matter weapons maybe.
Quantum Torpedoes...
Black Hole bombs
Rain nukes ?
depends what you consider "worse" though in that case. A-bomb = more residual radiation. H-bomb = bigger, more destructive blast
it probably would be anti-matter
and it will probably end up destroying us
Anti-matter weapons are the future
Neutron Bomb?
Over all effect.
neutron bomb = everything ded, buildings intact
11,01Neutron bombs are a type of nuclear weapon.
So who's hungry?
*bites Midnight_Temptest*
TheRandomkid321 here and todays random quation is. What if the maker of my little pony inetended it to be humans but was really bad at drawing?
I'm Hungry!
We have salted nuclear weapons
I'M HUNGRY!
bigger fusion boms are the most immediate concern though, it would not be too hard to double the yeild of a 'fat man'
11,01High radiation; low-yield.
is this... learning videos?
11,01Yes.
Someone out there will create the Z-bomb...a bio weapon that causes mass death whlie keeping most structures intact, but causing the dead to be reborn as zombies, thus starting the zombie appocalypse.
It's a documentory
we actually reached a limit on fusion bombs. Get them too powerful, and they simply vent atmosphere into space
11,01You are learning things.
ur the best at explosions
NOOO! LEARNING!!

OK BYE! *Flys outta chat*
11,01You couldn't make nuclear weapons small enough to fit into a hand grenade.
wanna test it?
War is srs buisnss
holy hand grenades lol
11,01Also, a dumb idea since it's suicidal to throw one.
11,01Even salted.
Can you make a nuclear reactor small enough ot fit in a backpack?
11,01Dunno.
Monfang: not one you can survive carrying
mabey
00,10yeah but once again the weaight of the object
11,01Depends on if you can get enough fissionable material in there.
If you can, then Power Armors are in the future
too much radiation
in the FUTURE
11,01And Sumica has a point.
reactor, no. Bomb, yes. For a big backpack anyway
we probably will have nuclear reactors tiny enough in about... 2-3 centuries...
11,01Because nuclear materials are heavy.
BUT you could use a low power nuclear battery, but they are exactly that. low power
all like ghost recon and shit
The mechancis of the power armor could eleminate the worry about the weight
00,10any thing light enough to be carryable would leak radiation

@Sumica yes but isnt nuclear warheads are built in missle?
MahBoi777 Im good with any biodome. as long as paulie shore is left at least 20,000 yards away from it.
11,01No.
no imagine if we had these bombs in the times of Napoleon Bonapart
(\
now*
there are such things as atomic shells, fired from cannons
I have a feeling pony_911 is confusing anti-nuke defences such as intercepter missles and jets that can shoot them out of the sky with a 'shield'.

the missile is just a way to get the bomb part to its target.

Midnight_Tempest: Send me your XBox
what's the range?
Castle Bravo was the largest H-Bomb detonated by the US... the Russians did a larger one...
yeah, Ruskies did a 50 megaton one. And they scaled it back.
11,01Fact: Castle Bravo was larger than predicted because of the unexpected fusion of Lithium-3 (I think).
they intended to go 100 megaton
Correct, Nittany_Discord.
ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Nitanny_Discord On that DVD there is a film of a guy in his car when He sees the flash and he jumps out of his car. Aroudn him is all rubble and once he finds his hat he wlaks around liek it was nothing

/me hands VioletGreySha a cookie
it wasn't rly scaled down
11,01Funny. I think Tsar Bomba was a "clean" bomb.
it was. one of the cleanest ever
/me noms teh cookie from Alicorn_Prince_Shane
What was "clean" about it?
they just replaced the uranium tampers with lead
11,01Low-radiation.
like 99% of the power was from fusion
especially compared to the yield
high destructive power but very little radiation
very low fission yeild
VioletGreySha: lol jks it has coffee in it
it was impressive
fusion emmits very little radiation
that was because
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: oh now now i only get more sleepy
11,01It's actually a lot less MelaPonie
nugget?
they replaced the uranium tampers on the secondary and tertiary stages with lead
and the waste material from fusion (spesificly deterium/tritium fusion) is helium
/me gives VioletGreySha a wub hug

11,01Contribution of fusion to thermonuclear explosions.
11,01It's like 30%+ off of the top of my head.
Ninjazz, it depends on the design of the bomb
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nah man... Alicorn's are all OP...
:P
11,01But it's not 99%
Liek A BAwss
O_o
MahBoi777: iz http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/b/e/be922_ORIG-u_jelly.jpg
Nittany_Discord, with Tsar Bomba
and ur right
VioletGreySha: http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/b/e/be922_ORIG-u_jelly.jpg
97% of the yeild was from fusion
only 3% of it was from fission
11,01With Tsar Bomba?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no iam not atm :P
dem chinese
New Player has entered the gaem!
New challenger has arrived!
Nittany_Discord, you're correct on fast fission of the secondary and tirtiary tampers
lol
but with Tsar Bomba the tampers were lead
not uranium
11,01I know.
hence no fast fission
MahBoi777: bitches love alicorns
and the scaled back yeild
only 3% of the yeild was from fission
Then China got the bomb, but have no fears; they can't wipe us out for at least five years.
11,01If it was Uranium, they would have had the 100MT version on their hands.
and that was from the primary
yup
lol dat horse gas mask
then suddenly Error 37, nuke doesnt work

Grunty sucks in this game
dammit
/me rages
/me flips tables
/me unflips tables
They change so much in this version.
/me gets out chainsaw
/me cuts up tables
/me tries to put tables back together with glue and duct tape
SuperBrony64|AFK is bored
yaay~
ugh....that interface
From what I can tell so far, there is no reason for grunty to be in this game other than to just have some incompetent villian for us to laugh at
woo!
...
remember when the xbox had folders as the interface?
In the prebious games she was an actual villian important to the plot.
She kidnaps the sister in first one and she was gonna get revived in the second
lol you said plot
...
huhuh, I did, that was cool uhuhuh
Anyway, that's why grunty sucks in this game
derp.
Lol mario_pony
see ya later
Blazang: You intrigue me
WHAT THE F?

Yeah, good game.

Betilla
*hard
I played Rayman for PS1. It was brutal
Rayman Orgins is coming to the 3DS this summer, I'll be looking for that one.
Yum, Rayman
I will admit 1 thing for this game, building your own car looks fun
lol
What about Glover? You ever hear of Glover?
and Rayman 2 on Dreamcast
Oh no I havent
Its wasn't that good.
my eyelids feel..heavy
You played as a glove rolling around on a ball.

/me slaps Blazang
Oh sh- Bayonetta, this game was cool
any1 else confused to how cadence is related to celestia?
SEGA.
cause apparentley cadence is celestias niece
The PS3 port is atroucious
therefore meaning shes lunas daughter but i have not a clue
I did not believe it at first. Then, I tried it. :<
Blueblood is celestia nephew too. i assume it's the same thing wiht him, very distant
Like great great great and son
*so on
11,02This is the back story of Sarah Palin
e.o
whose blue blood again
Time to play Binding of Isaac
is he that jackarse in galloping gala?
My preferred weapon set for this game was the sword and two shotguns on the legs
Yes
so who is cadence's mum?
im think logically luna
but idk
SuperBrony64|AFK DOING BAYONETTA?
Dunno, it's irrelevant. no it not luna
or celestia has another sister
HOLY MOTHER OF CELESTIA ALLMIGHTY
Blazang: just curious dat is all
"I don't get it."
That's my speculation anyway.
SuperBrony64|AFK: I HOPE YOU KNOW THEM COMBOS
cause this is going to be a loooooooooooooong ride
Well, I got some work to do, I'm working on a remix.
I'll be back later.

so a unknown sis of celestia
Ohhh yeeeaaah
and allso
cause they put the ring on their horns
where do they put it for pegasi and Land Ponies?
A distant niece I think. Like a great(x29 or whater) grand neice
Oh man...I haven't played Bayonetta in a long time...
Blazang: k lol
11,02Bored -.-
OtakuTom: hows ur wedding coming along

SHARRO

comeon you's SHARRO!!!
say sleep if your awake
peels
heya Phase4
patatos
Phase4: u there
ohai
Phase4: wha was the place to quickly share voice memos?
hows your day been so far?
[web]JRP2234, http://vocaroo.com/ i think this is the one you meen
Chrysalis, it's been good, yours?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qlp0GbhwPs whistles
Phase4 pretty good slept through most of it so far XD
Evening Phase4 :3
ohai XAX
So, about last night. Did Nittany_Discord play anything other than SAW?
Phase4: stream please?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane phase is a tech not a mod
Chrysalis: hes streamed b4
Phase4: If you were going to, I'd play something with you if I were in bed. Maybe tomorrow?
he has permission to stream Chrysalis silly changling
Doesent matter if it's streaming or not. I just wanna play something with ya :D
Phase has streamed before.
XAX that sounds dirty :P
If I WERENT in bed
sigh
XD
what a choice of EQD post...
XAX: is dirty child
D: didn't mean to
:p
currently i'm fighting mysql
doesnt seem to want to work
http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Squjd49oMZ
Phase4: Go at it. Slaughter it like a dog. Make it call you master.
http://vocaroo.com/i/s0maBiSMtRR0
Phase4: dont feel like streaming?
I'm beginning my very first lessons in coding at school after we're done with game design. I think we're learning HTML...
Hello, dead chat. May I take this seat.
Hi XAX, btw.
/me sits in seat
XAX, coding + html is not something that should EVER be said
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, little busy to stream
Phase4: no worries man
Chrysalis: Sorry. Shows how newfag I a
am*
no probs :P
go for c++ if your going for games
Chrysalis: We doing
DAMNIT
funfact ios is written in c++
Morning everypony
"120522 7:21:27 [ERROR] Binlog has bad magic number;" gee thanks mysqlk
mysql'
fun fact, all major systems that rely on speed are based on c/c++
Hello Nerom.
XAX, if you want to learn how to program, start with something like python
fucking Send button is right below Backspace button. Anyway, our whole class is doing a Game Design project in Game Maker...
oh god not python
that puts you in SO many bad habbits
go for c# and XNA
Phase4: We're doing python at some point this year too, I think...
Chrysalis, well its that or pascal, anything else either has too many concepts (like c# ) or is evil
coding is easy....the challenge is all the shit that gets in ur way
pascal is just bad, not quite evil
eg erros
errors*
Errors are your mistakes in coding
eg bugs
can't be that easy if enough are getting in your way
Creating code = easy, Debugging code = little bit harder, Reading someone elses code = 80% of your time
bugs arnt errors thoguh
hiya Ghosties
I can't choose what I do. It's already set what im going to learn this year. I am only 15 :(
ohai Ghosties
gasp
04Hello~
What Chrysalis and Phase4 said
^
04How is everyone tonight/today?
Fine :>
Phase4 try debugging multi-threaded networking code then say its a "little bit harder"
04That's good
Great
Ghosties: Did your computer turn out to be perfectly fine?
04Even better, Nerom :D
Ghosties i'm good and yourself?
Hey, Ghosties.
Ikr :P
04Yeah, my comp's fine XAX. Thanks for asking
04I'm doing alright, a little tired but fine
Ghosties: That's good to hear :)
04Hello Ninjazz
Ninjazz|Depressed: What's got you feeling down again? :(
XAX: Week's been hard on me.
Damn.
life has been a bitch to me
Finally caught up with me, I guess.
Ghosties try sleeping 2h and then go up and do a driving leason in an hour :P Now thats the fun I will have soon
Chrysalis, ever tried debugging nodejs?
Nerom: Oh god good luck
Yea thanks XAX
I will need it... And 2 cups of coffiee
/me hasnt heard of it, googles, throws up at the definition
04You should have gotten more sleep :P
server side javascript
my brain. it cannot handle that.
Chrysalis, javascript is great imho, but for some reason stack traces are lost in events
Sleeps sounds good.
javascript is interperated, its too damn slow
04Hell yeah it does, I can hear my bed calling me now *yawn*
that stuff should NEVER touch a server
so you will have an application just insta die for no aparent reason with the cause detatched from the problem
Yea should but have a bad case of insomnia was up to 8 this morning and woke up by 10 now its 12 :S
Ghosties: Time?
Chrysalis, its not interpreted, V8 js engine has a jit
Heading to it, Ghosties?
04Here? It's 6:20 AM here
04Not yet
Phase4: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0iSpIkHet3a
still slower than a compiled language
Chrysalis, fun fact: javascript is now faster than php
Did you just wake up, or have you been up all night?
04I wanted to see how you guys were doing and mayyyyyyyyyyyyyybe play something
who still uses PHP?
04I've been up all night
Chrysalis, far too many people
Damn :o
ooh what you gonna play Ghosties?
Neat Ghosties that was the time i tried to sleep at but it was to bright to
A Ghosties stream?!
[web]JRP2234, MY EARS
Y U DO THAT
Phase4 too true, too true
ohaidere
04Whoa, 81 people...that's the lowest I've seen it
04Well, recently that is
Lowest today I saw was 79
04I'm not sure, Chrysalis
inb4 chat is very dead
it was 63 yesterday
I see 99
yeah, balnket keeps seem to be dropping the numbers
Phase4: lord :I
inb4 Denial, not just a river in Egypt
though the lowest i've technicaly seen is 8 during a netsplit
Doesn't count. :P
04I have my eye on a few things: Saints Row The Third, Spore, Terraria, Fallout New Vegas and Morrowind are my top picks right now
it was a bad split
Well Not been here much these couple of weeks after the final of S2 but it was usualy this low by this time in the week
ooh if you play saints row i could join you :P
Terraria sounds good.
but thats what happens when you name the servers 'celestia' and 'discord'
04And sorry Ninjazz, but I won't be streaming for a while :P
Jackolen BOWLLL
Ghosties: Saints row the third. Oh god, that game. SO entertaining
Ahhh, oh well. :$
Hey somepony host a terraria servr
ohia
ohai
03gooood I have no idea what I'm supposed to write
04Saints Row 2 is much better in my opinion, but The Third has its moments
03for this stupid paper
03gotta do it in an hour and a half or so
._.
you can do it
03gotta be 500 words, too
Both games are great.
03there's only so much I can BS
03:/
I loved em both.
last minuite charlie
SR3, fun fact, they had to change the penetrator in japan to be solid because floppy was too offensive
03yeah so far I haven't slept all night and I can't at this point
hm
I wrote a 1200-word essay in 2 hours
03yeah shut up LOL
you can do 500
03want to help
/me runs
ohai Flareon
hm
04Haha
500 is nothing :P
04Neat
LOl
I loled.
I'll write it for you if you buy me some games
/me runs
nah
03What is The Growth Machine? In the New Orleans area before Katrina, how did it relate to the political system at local and national levels? How did/does it relate to social structure? What effect did that link have on the natural and man-made environments?
kidding
03I would,a ctually
03but yeah
hurrrrrrr
03I'm googling stuff, right
/me has never played the first or second Saints Row, and has only played the third one because a mate tormented it.
03so far I have
03The Growth Machine is a name given uncoordinated economic growth. The idea is that cities are containers for human actions, and as such, humans would compete for the most strategic areas of land.
03reworded from wikipedia
03XD
lmao
TORRENTED
tormented it?
500 words is easy
o.o
I suppose I could help you
you should be ashamed
03that's like 50
03xD
03well
learn to bullshit :P
03...woah
though I have no idea what the hell The Grow Machine is
Torment games now thats skills needed
03why did that not get blocked
yeah Flareon
I do that in my essays
AUTOCORRECT CAN GO DIE :(
04And I would play multiplayer Chrysalis but it's almost 6:30 AM here and I am tired :P
03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Molotch#The_City_as_a_Growth_Machine
03basically this
That's terrible and you should feel terrible.
03is what I gather
03LOL
cus' only "sh*t" is blocked
not *sh*t*
03it would help if I actually had a copy of the book we're supposed to read
03>_>
03<_<
hah
I could be an anime writer I'm rather good at putting filler in stuff
ebooks
Ghosties fiar enough, you might want to get a nap if its that early
03meh
warez dem ebookz
03go find me one then
03but like
XAX why are you using t9 on your comp?
03OK
03People like building cities by rivers, right?
03because of uh
03why
03what reasons
One more day and I can stay up that long for as much as I want.
03I can't think right noiw
03*now
water supply
Or are you on a pad or something?
Nerom: I'm on my iPod touch...
economics -> shipping by boat
03hm
fishing
Phase4 googling for nodejs and looking at link 3 "Node.js is a tumor on the programming community"
power->dams
feesh
*shot*
Chrysalis, that artical is actualy a joke
/me wants Star Wars: TOR
Figured.. I was here on my school comp all the time before
04Haha, yeah, some kind of sleep would be preferable at this point in time
/me also wants Assassin's Creed
Though I can pirate that
but I cbf
farming ->irrigation
Ghosties: u talking about saints row?
farming -> solis are fertile
03yeah O(K
04Mhm
03I can only BS stuff so far
Chrysalis, i'm going to be blunt and say the reason most people hate javascript is because they dont understand it, the ones who do and hate it anyway have good reasons too as well though
03*Fast
Ghosties, go sleep, dude.
that sentence kinda derped at the end
Ghosties: tbh i think if the combined SR3 s fun with SR2's customisablility it would be awesome
the first one or what
i'm one of the latter i'm afriad, iv use it alot in my time, then i started coding in c++
first one yeah
04Yeah, I'll be heading to bed pretty soon and I agree Shane
Altaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaair
Alicorn_Prince_Shane yea they pretty much limmited the fun there
Well... The mod is
on pc/steam or?
04Best GTA around
Ghosties: night mr Ghosties
or really, Altaïr
A freakin men.
Either is fine
True storry Ghosties
idk what's the difference between steam AC and normal AC
lol sr3 running around with a dildo bat whacking hookers
or trees
03Steam lets you show everybody what you're playing
kudos to that ghosties
03basically XZD
03*X
XAX: the best mutha bucking game ever
03*XD
only difference is that the steam one I could be able to get 1,1with my virtual item tf2 wealth
so like a game e-peen system?
03yep
trees have advantages so shelter, wood/timber trade
food maybe
i see
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfJygwKKp8o&feature=related

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I want to sleep in your mane.:D
Don't worry, sometimes I don't even wake up.

03then drive people somewhere
Ohey, Dashie.
03while tired

Oh, hello everypony.
04Well everyone I'm calling it a night. Have fun, be safe, and stay gold beautiful friends~
but on the other hand
"mine!"
/me lifts TheRainbowDash into his mane with Airpuff

bai Ghosties
Ghosties: http://mtavc.com/ before you go
Gnight Ghosties! Take care and sleep well!
oo Bai Ghosties
I like how half of people here goes to sleep and half wakes up.
i swear to god dis fillies <3 my mane
damn you guys
I have a software class test on monday
Woah. Site just broke
which I'm going to hate
04Thanks XAX. Anyways, night~
since it's theory, not prac
Aye. Next group of people about to wake up.
Night gho-- damn
and I never cared enough to learn about the theory and crap
lol
it's just weird to do such tests theoretically
Ninjazz|Depressed: What'S up?
and then the week after that I have a music presentation due, a maths test, and two band performances
feels wrong
-_-
Why are ya depressed Ninjazz|Depressed :(
it is kinda wrong
Malavolent: The week's been hard on me. I just felt really crappy during guitar practice.
but my entire class uses visual basic
XAX: Hold fuck, that looks amazing, thanks.:)
03XD
oo
03now go write me a java program kthx
03nah I'm not thinking abut that right now
I'm the only one who actually does programming languages that don't require a crap GUI
03too busy with other things ;.;
Like... SUDDENLY, bad feelz.
hurr
03well
03TUI is a crap GUI
03:|
And now I can't even speak without hating how I sound.
Bleh.
/me shuffles both Airpuff and TheRainbowDash into his mane
Ninjazz|Depressed: Why are you depressed now? (puts a hoof on your shoulder, with a look of concern on my face)
TheRainbowDash: It was my favorite thing to play for about a year straight. I moderated a server :D
03you know that's the most practical and useless thing ever
03:D
XAX: Yeah, it does look awesome, maybe I'll try it before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.
/me snuggles Alicorn_Prince_Shane 's mane
lmfaaaaao drf
daww
THE FILE YOU'RE DOWNLOADING IS NEW OR VERY RARE
TheRainbowDash: Rough week. And I guess since I'm about to say good bye to a friend I had since my childhood. She's going to college in Japan while I stick here.
03though apparently it only works on Windows
03like I tried to compile that on klinux
03-k
03and it didn't work
03no idea
hang on
And also I only had around 10 hrs of sleep this ENTIRE week.
Ninjazz|Depressed: (sobs) Why do you make me....cry....
03I used uh
03visual studio
03to do it
TheRainbowDash: If bronystate was going to schedule a gaming event, It should be on MTA. Servers can fit 1000+ people on them :o
TheRainbowDash: I didn't mean to... :(
Ah
lol VS
(sobbing and crying )
MTA?
Hey, stop crying.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Oh my god, that feel. That must be gutting
XAX: (Hold hay, that is a lot.)
man.. Ninjazz|Depressed ... sorry to hear that =c
What is MTA?
jeezus Ninjazz|Depressed what did u say to TheRainbowDash
matrix.cpp:188:3: error: cout does not name a type
matrix.cpp:189:2: error: expected declaration before } token
Scroll up, Shane.
and a couple other cout errors
that are the same
My chat derped, why is Ninjazz Depressed?
Kandarihu: (It is Multi Theft Auto)
Kandarihu: http://mtavc.com/
03yeah I have no idea
03I made that like 5 years ago
03or more
03anyway
03baaaah
Oh, okay.
Malavolent: he is tired of being a ninja
03what are political effects of having a city by a river
actually
you have a random bracket in the middle of nowhere
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: What? Why?
03also LOL
03is it just me
oh wait
03or is that a ton of japanese
03at the end
you made an error
I guess... I felt okay for the past few days. Then EVERYTHING this past week just hit me all in one go. Man... Not even Monday felt this shitty.
there's an extra copied part in your code
/me deletes
03>_>
03<_<
/me laughs as the wind is tickleing him
Tests... Sleep... Losing my friends... Just hit me that THAT is going to happen.
(still sobbing in a corner)
I said stop crying.
hurr drf
I....can't!
Please?
your .cpp file works
You'll only make it worse! :(
03o.o
I can't until you feel better...(puts a hoof on your mane)
search for }ut<<num70;
change that to }
Ninjazz|Depressed: Dont think I've ever had to lose a great friend. Must feel bad :(
03far too lazy
and delete everything after it
it's just a copypaste error
other than that it works
Well... I can't say it feels pretty good.
also it looks better in python
03also it's much simpler to just have one random character
and it's faster too
03because like
Well I'm off now Driving lesson and all.. just need to find my pants
03yeah
/me wakes up
C++ is slow as
Hmm
03well
cya everypony
Cya Nerom. Good luck.
Gunthler|Zzz: Oh, finally, now you're awake.
Nerom: Good luck again
03I realized this after writing it
03that I only need one random number
03not 80
03XD
yeah
Bye Nerom!
03but I was like 13
I was looking at your thing
03give me a break
Ninjazz|Depressed: Cheer up, it'll get only better from now on.
and going lol at it
03looking at my thing, eh?
03did you like it
/me runs
/me huds TheRainbowDash
/me slaps
03:(
I can't even remember what I coded when I was 13
03stop being so perverted then LOL
hugs*
03uh
03probably an entire network
that's you being perverted
not me
haha
I think I made a virus
bai nerom
03Why
Malavolent: I just don't know about that... I'm supposed to be psyched for summer break... But I just feel so crappy.
03ew making viruses :|
that I accidentally infected myself with
Gunthler: D'awwww.....it cheers me up after Ninjazz|Depressed is so depressed, because I was crying for him for the past 10 minutes....:D
and couldn't get rid of it
):
well Airpuff it seems like ur the only one up there
03LOL
ナラださあな
so I had to reformat
03I thought you were pretty pro 3 years ago though
03o.o
iirc
D:
it completely screwed my AV
03inb4 norton
/me giggles
XAX: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE3PXTDiaEw

Ninjazz|Depressed: LETS SEE YOU GRIT THOSE TEETH
/me punches Ninjazz|Depressed
Phase4: You should stream the 5 hour version of WOAH OH AH HA AH AH HA HA AH AH HA AH if you fix FFmpeg
Trixie: ...K :|
/me looks dazed and confused
lol
YouTube search "woah oh ah" to see what I mean
lol
this looks like as good a time as any to attempt the other setuo
setup'
Ow.

Why did Kamina come in here is a better question.
/me licks DiscordsMaker
Ninjazz|Depressed: why are u down
/me pings Kamina
/me gags
The week's been really rough on me. Now that I got my tests done, I remembered that my close friends is leaving this year for Japan while I stick here.
03actually nvm that shower, someone else is in there
And sleep deprivation too.
So many Discords up in this chat!
Always that.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Copying this text was a good idea.
Colloquy. Y u crash
Ninjazz|Depressed: enjoy him while you can. savor every moment with him
I sleep during the day and run around at night.
Hello Kamina
Kamina: arent u dead?
Do get some rest, Ninjazz|Depressed.
The janitor?
/me runs
03nope
03someone else showering
hmmm, ffmpeg is still broken for different reasons
/me turns music to dubstep
Phase4: How does FFmpeg work? Do you have to type out all your stream settings yourself?
I try. But she and I don't really have the same interests. Still she's been a friend since Kindergarten.
Bronysith: "You idiot! A true man doesn't die even when he's killed!"
XAX, yes
/me stayed up all night =.=
I throw up my hay I never eat it.
There is only one shower..?
03there's 4
Dubstep gets everything out of ya mind
Petrified_Discord: kick logic out.
03but one doesn't work
Why can't you go in?
Oh
XAX, there in a script so i dont have to retype them, but yes
03and I don't like showering when other people are in there xD
That is just crazy
AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE
Kandarihu|: One more day... Then I can sleep whenever I want.
Pfft
03because unlike them
/me is listening to woah ah ah ah ah 5 hours
03I don't just wear a towel, I actually take all my clothes in there
03and get changed in the bathroom
JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?!
Bronysith: Logic? Discord? These things do NOT go together! :D
You're supposed to be dead, actually.
Kamina: I think you're Kamina. :|
Kamina: A guy on the internet?
And others don't?
ToxicDiscord goes together
03nope
Petrified_Discord: thats why i said kick logic out
Phase4: It would be stupid if it didn't save your script that you typed in last time, so I get what you mean
03they just take a towel + soap and stuff
Ninjazz|Depressed: Is summer vacation starting for you?
03then put the towel back on, walk to their room and get dressed
Bronysith: OKHEREIGO
/me kicks logic out
Later buddy
Twi_Fi: Almost. One more day. Tomarrow. I send my friend off. Then Summer Vacay.
Well, if it's just other guys
/me kills logic with a broom
03though seeing girls walking down the hallway wearing nothing but a towel, it would be fun to jump up and be like BOO
/me runs
DiscordsMaker: Seems legit
It'd be different if opposite gender
I'm more of a Reason kind of guy, anyway.
Oh u
http://i.imgur.com/0fGgA.jpg
03if opposite gender I'd be sitting there with a chair waiting for people to walk out

'Bronystate is not an RP channel, and as such, excessive Role-Playing is discouraged. '
Scootalooo: Say you like cheese in deep fried butter.
The 13 Commandments of Bronystate, heed them well!
urgh

03http://chzsetphaserstolol.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/sci-fi-fantasy-in-fact-forget-the-avengers-team2.png

i like cheese in a deep fried butter?
0.204
oh...then well done ...WELL DONE...you are waiting to be molest? dear god you must wake up very early in the morning

Spell-of-Gaming: That's because the rules aren't over 200 pages long.

Hello DoublePint.
Hello DoublePint
they're crappy
0.096 and 0.098 are the best
Oh yeh, more crappy then the old as <censored> ones? :P
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 99 time(s).
except for 0.098's memory leak
Yes, FlutterWonder.
...Don't start flamewars. -.-
i just finish a painting today yay !!!
0.096 and 0.098 are good
they aren't overly bloated
Then again, you ARE Discord. :I
I have had no issues with the 0.20x's

eh
suit yourself
at least you don't have to deal with the code
Spell-of-Gaming: I only post pictures of myself when I flamewar

I need to clean the servers sometime
Rainbow dash isnt nice
well
I'm kinda focusing on making the bot though
because its true
since you know me
lazy as hell
I have like 16 connected (when i was checking)
Yup
Ninjazz|Depressed: Do you want me to make it Rain Chocolate rain on you!?
Finish the god damn bot first
TBH, if Lauren Faust DOES make an award to who is best pony, she's most likely to say [YOU NEED A BRONYSTATE SILVER MEMBERSHIP TO VIEW THIS]
shes nice and all but usely she gets... kinda craz
Finish the damn bot first
Twi_Fi: To the non-regular's probably.
Woh

You're a wizard Scoota.
Discord, its registered (as in.... i was about to explain
00,03:O
double ping

FlareChaser|Octavia: This week has been hard on me. The year is about to end and one my closest friends is about to leave for college to Japan while I stick here. Plus I only slept for like... 10 hours this entire week.

Among other things.
ping pong
Did no one get the reference?

Hello FlareChaser|Octavia
FlareChaser|Octavia: It's alright, man.
Discord, its registered (as in someone has an account and owns it) but unless they set an auto kick you can just use it
Hi everypony.....
00,03Party ROCK!
PONY ROCK
PARTY TOM
Ok that makes sense
051: allcapsing while typing out the lyrics of smile atleast twice. when told not to you argued against saying "no u". henceforth kick and the twat status.
Phase4: autokick you say?
PONY ROCK
Discord, if the actual person logs on they can /ns ghost you and it kicks you off the network
Meh
Im "happy" with my setup
Twi_Fi, yeah, i've got it set on mine
Oh
/me get's his shuffling hooves ready
ShadyVox?
Ninjazz|Depressed: Alright, I think it will cheer you up when we own the mods in L4D2.
i wasnt trying to be a twat.
:(
Hmmm
Phase4-: How does one set this autokick?
Discord, try change your nick to Phase4
I think ShadyVox is the ONLY brony no one can insult.
Ok
WHAT THE HELL IS A TWAT?!!!!!!
FlareChaser|Octavia: I almost forgot about that! :D
Pony Tom!
Twi_Fi, /ns help, i forget how
There's always hope for redemption ofna01
Twi_Fi, its one of the flags

ohai ponyloverforeva
wtf wrek?
heh I modified both services' software
i really dont think that was worth a kick though, Wrek
Yeah I heard it
[14:35] <Litwick> I think ShadyVox is the ONLY brony no one can insult. That's just tempting people
I think I'm going to disable network changing sometime soon
since that's often abused afaik
bk
Twi_Fi, i'm derp, its nit actualy a kick, it just changes your nick to a pony(random) one
Also, who?
as much as I'd like to allow freedom
i think you could afford to loosen up a bit, to be honest
wb Scootalooo
Phase4: ah

Om: Maybe I just get a little weak willed around you... One could take advantage of me so easily... ;)
WallDives: Is it because you win -_-
WallDives: That just means you're better than them and they know it.
I just punish mistakes, and I win. (also, I play VERY dirty)
Eurobeat: it's good when it's made fresh
Agreed
WallDives: Dirty players are amongst the best to play against. :)

Ninjazz|Depressed: And I'm the only one you have right now.
Im not leaving...
0,5When we say stop, don't fucking keep going.
What happened?
Now I just don't know what to do. :P
0,5That's what leads to annoying the crap out of us, and punishment.

Then again, I suck at parties. :|
Hey @Wrek is streaming right?
1,3Bronystate is not an RP channel, so while there are times when playing along is acceptable, constant RP is not. There are other channels on the network dedicated to role playing, or you can make your own, just take it elsewhere.
RP ey?

GilDash|Relocating: Oh yes quite right. Its its a gloriously pristine flank he hath drawn
GilDash|Relocating: I haven't seen enough of your flank to compare.

GilDash|Relocating: Cant say I do. Not sure what you are getting at.

GilDash|Relocating: Hmmm... Nope, drawing balnks.
I think it's time to pull this old tag out again. :D
Damn thats one nice cutie mark...
GilDash|B4D9R4MM3R: what the hell is that on the end of your name?
alexxm: Maybe you could write about how you experience the fandom?
It almost looks like Bed Manners, which fits. :$

alexxm: are you writing an article about the community?

WallDives: My very first, highly appropriate, username.
WallDives: Leet, for badgrammer

I wonder, Om, if you give up, would s/he go away?
Om: I have that effect on people. ;)

I can enjoy this image while you're gone, Wrek. ^^
WallDives: I am not willing to find out. For I know what giving up means.
hope it goes well valoreins|Drawing
WallDives: It'd provoke me further. "The only winning move is not to play." That means never get involved. ;)

Om: :3
Ninjazz|Depressed: It is one hell of a nice image...

Ninjazz|Depressed: I could do with some nomming on that right about now... ;)
GilDash: Get in line... ;)
Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm British. I know how to queue. ;)
Ninjazz|Depressed: Mein Got, you're getting as bad as it is!
Ninjazz|Depressed: In that case, feel like sharing? ;)
Om: What have I said before, Only for Rarity, dude. ;)
Om: I refute this, "it" nonsense. :D
Ninjazz|Depressed: It might be a dissease and spread.
Om: Then it's only a matter of time before you're infeced too.
GilDash: How would you put it...To bad?
Om: Tough. :)
GilDash: You get one side I get the other, she's got two of them. ;)
GilDash: I am invincible!
Om: you're still a loony.
since when Om
Ninjazz|Depressed: Now you're just teasing me... I react well to teases. ;)
Om: I've been a fanboy for her since the beginning of S2, dude. :D
/me smashes barrels of liquid nitrogen above Om.
Ninjazz|Depressed: I think Suited for Success was when I started to really appreciate Rarity.
GilDash: That is rp GilDash, I don't think I'll compli
WallDives: And I always will be.
Om: You even know where that reference is from? :D
Ninjazz|Depressed: Still... Creepy
GilDash: Oh, my yes! Her singing voice really made me change my innitial image of her. At first, she was rather... stuck up. :S
GilDash: Red! No BLUE! (sproing)
She was my least favourite character too
hai
Ninjazz|Depressed: She just needed an episode to really shine. I knew she was something special during the opener, she just didn't have the time needed to get across her personality. :)
hey Discord hows your day been
She has her ups and downs, I cant really pin her down on my favourite pony scale.
Om: Don't judge me.
Om: Not even close. :D
alexxm: Pretty good, got started on my fanfic for MLP and now it is time to relax
GilDash: That is how you know I have seen it.
GilDash: Reminds me of what Applejack really needs.
whats it about Discord
Om: 007: Goldeneye.
Ninjazz|Depressed: What, you mean that background character that works on the farm? :D
alexxm: It is the stroy of Discord before he was so...evil is the word right?
Ninjazz|Depressed: And I use my right of freedome of speach to say. You still be creepin
GilDash: Oooooh. You'll make some mods angry with that one.
chaotic i guess Discord
GilDash: I know nothing!
Ninjazz|Depressed: I do that all the time anyway. :D
yeah that is true alexxm
Om: I know that. :D
Om: You know nothing about freedom of speech when your mouth is being filled with another one.
great...
Oh god we got maintence
Ninjazz|Depressed: wat ._.
Om: Then maybe I should exercise my freedom of speech some... ;)
Om: You should know... Oh look.
so what happens when we get maitenace
GilDash: You are brittish, none for your
Ninjazz|Depressed: Right on cue, eh? :D
Om: She means when you are kissing someone
GilDash: and by that, you are going to verbally assault him?
Or he
GilDash: As planned. ;)
I DONT KNOW
well at least during the maintenance I can study instead of hanging around here :D
Discord: I was well aware
WallDives: Well, it is *chat* after all. :D
Om: Just makin sure
Om: Being British has nothing to do with it. :)
"* [Giger4444] rarity.ponychat.net :The Element of Generosity" << your not on fluttershy so nope
what happens when maintenace happens
GilDash: But it was the only thing I could think of :'(
Good luck to those who get net split.
how long will this site be under matenance?
Om: Please, you'll need more than that! :D
who knows. a few hours?
which one am i on Phase4
GilDash: Its too eeeeeeeeearly
I used to be a Pony hater, then I took a flutter shy to the knee. And boy was it good
alexxm, rarity allso
+Phase4: ?
Om: It's never too early. ;)
use /whois your_nick to find out which server you're on
I'm on Rainbow Dash, I'm safe.
I'm starting to not like fluttershy. seriously.
Giger4444, maintance is not going to stop you chatting
GilDash: I think it is. Sooo, go que or something
WallDives: Why?
Huh, Pinkie Pie's server. *shrug*
+Phase4: Oh... well then... I wont study :D
PinkiePie! :D
lol
Discord: the fanboys are irrational, imo, and I DETEST spineless, overly-reserved characters.
WallDives: She is soooo cute though...yah
Om: I'm at the front of the queue. It's time to take action. ;)
just like I hate spineless, doormat-type people.
so will anyone else see the stuff if you type /whois yournick Phase4
I feel ya, WallDives.
WallDives: I know what you mean. That's why she doesn't rate too highly with me.
alexxm, nope
/me is on the Pinkie Pie server
WallDives do you want to see the article now
alexxm: already read it.
/me is on the server with ponies
Jim: Snap! :)
what did you think WallDives
Discord, you're on rarity
alexxm: Grammar, than try again. right now, to me, its almost unreadable.
I'm on the Fluttershy server. And I am still here sooooo
Oh that is a good one
I like her
Om: Lucky you.
Walldives: because its just a draft.
Ninjazz|Depressed: I told you I am invincible~
Om: Stubborn.
i'm on the Twilight Sparkle server
/me noms Om.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Meh, that too.
GilDash: No RP >.>
Om: I'd like to test that theory with some vigorous research. ;)

GilDash: How is that even... ._.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Its GilDash. Nuf said

Ninjazz|Depressed: What? :D

Good idea
Intergrated is a bitch to replace

I'm going to need smooth jazz for this. I like metal and all, but RARITY!

Ninjazz|Depressed: You and your Rarity.
Ninjazz|Depressed: x rarity
Yes. All my yes.
lol
what about otakon cachi01
she's too dramatic...
D-D-D-D-D-D-Derp
Hello all
hey ZB
otakon x SAI
Actually alexxm, the otakon shipping has been enforced to be toned down.
hi ZombieBrony
hey ZombieBrony hows your day been
hi ZombieBrony.
how come Ninjazz|Depressed
yeah shipping otakon in excess is banable
alexxm: Too much to the point where it became spam I guess.
I never shipped him once, so I wouldn't know.
i cant stop headbanging
do you want to see this article about bronies i'm working on Ninjazz|Depressed
I for one can't stop sliding all over the place! :D
lol
Sure, alexxm.
/me bops his head and swing his body in the direction of the music on account of smooth jazz
/me is listening to Guns 'N Roses, so has no problem. :D
Ello there, everypony.
why am i still sleepy even though i already drank 2 glass of coffee now?
Malavolent: Holla! :)
Hai everypony!
ohai Malavolent
hi DerpStar.
hi DerpStar
hi Malavolent.
hi Malavolent
Oh my, is everyone drawing now?
lol i just watched the fresh prince of lavender town
hey DerpStar hows your day been
and hi DerpStar
hey Malavolent hows your day been
Good good I found a ring for DoublePint!
Wrek was drawing before it was cool
DerpStar: Holla! :)
Malavolent: nope just kirz and wrek
I hope he likes it cause it's going on my finger lol
alexxm: Pretty good, how about you?
good Malavolent just sent you the article
Alrighty then.
I'm so nervous I'm not sure if he'll like a girl proposing to him
what if he says no?
Hi, Good morning everyone
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
DerpStar: I've got a feeling he won't mind. :)
DerpStar: considering all you two have been through?
I guess so WallDives
alexxm: For over $9000, heh. Couldn't resist.
yeah that happened Malavolent
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
alexxm: Yep, I know. Anyway, it's pretty well written.
hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows your day been
I just hope he doesn't have another girl in mind
alexxm just woke up so good, and yours ?
DerpStar: Is he seeing anyone else now?
I dunno he's very attractive
Time are changing, I'm glad to see a female wanting to propose to a guy.
good TheGreatAndPowerfulT do you want to see the first draft of a brony article i'm working on
true story, Om.
He has been Derping a lot around me
05back from an awsome dinner
WB Wrek
DerpStar: Maybe he's hiding something?
DerpStar: Maybe you just make him nervous. That might be a good thing. ;)
Oh God I hope not
alexxm sure
He's never been nervous maybe he's planing something >_>
DerpStar: maybe. or you could be paranoid.
If it were me I would be blunt. But I know some people are far more refined than I
Om: Yes, quite. You haven't got the best sense in all this. :D
has the chat derped
alexxm: no.
Moral of my story, if I say something. It is probably not the best thing to do.
thanks WallDives
/me eats the rest of Wrek's left overs
alexxm: i think so
Hun I'm a woman we're all paranoid when we don't know what the man we love is doing, especially if he doesn't know I love him...
DerpStar: Have you actually asked him out?
Heh, hun
We've been kinda hanging out together for the better part of a decade
just ask him DerpStar
DerpStar: Yes, but are you two "involved".
DerpStar: just take your shot. seriously.
Not really but he's the only man I've felt comfortable with
I'm not making my case very well...
DerpStar: It might be just a tiney-winey bit of a leap to propose to him if he's not aware then. :S
No, I don't think this sound like a Leap then Look thing. It might be a good idea to get involved with him, as GilDash put it, first.
If your not together, that would be the first step
DerpStar: Otherwise you might end up pushing him away if he's not ready. :(
i wanna the D!

<(
(<
buuu, i droped peanutbutter all over my computer cords
Its really hard to explain our relationship over a text chat

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'm just worried that'll be per item and cost me half as much in shipping. :D
only WLF shirt i found i liked was a scott pilgrim K.O shirt

I'll probably get an mlp hoodie, I need to invest in a good one.
Gunthler: SparklyWaffles, you muppet. :D
SparklyWaffles: http://www.welovefine.com/41-my-little-pony Do it filly! :D

GilDash but i live in mexico and i paid $40 for the shipping of 2 tshirts and one bag, plus for some reason didn't get any taxes ._.
/me noms on GilDash
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Thanks for the info anyway. :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thx for the info i also live in mexico
GilDash so yeah if you live over seas is better if you order more than one tshirt, just to make the shipping cost worth it
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: As long as they don't charge per item. Otherwise, yeah, I plan on getting a minimum of a half dozen. :D

Invi: I always try. Just today... I can't see anyhting good coming out of today. :(
WallDives: What ever you say, man.
Ninjazz|Depressed: It's not the end of the world. :)
GilDash: It's going to be the end of something. :(
Ninjazz|Depressed such days come and go. there will be days where your fortune is on your side ^^
Ninjazz|Depressed: Why, is he never coming back?
Its the end of the world as we know it~
GilDash: She. And I don't think I might see her again.
Om: I feel fine.
Ninjazz|Depressed: As I said, is she never coming back?
WallDives: xD
Ninjazz|Depressed why? Can't you visit her?
Om: It'll take more than that to keep me down. ;)
GilDash: She might. I don't think I'll know.
Invi: DIfferent country.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Ask her. :D
oh
Invi: She's moving to Japan.
GilDash: It would take the universal collaps to keep you donw
Om: Please, you need to level a multiverse to stop me. :D
oh yeah, that is crap. The grilfriend of my brother went to australia
GilDash: Well, sorry to insult you then.
GilDash: I'm not even sure I'm staying here in a few years either. Everything just seems so unstable right now. I wish everything were set in stone like they were. Less of a worry.
I AM THE ROAAADIE
Invi: I've seen that happen thrice amongst my freinds. Hard to help them through sometimes. :(
03http://i.imgur.com/hY7Va.png
03there, that's the assignment :P
03I have like 2 hours to do this x.x
Ninjazz|Depressed: Well, at least you've got a clue. Try being in my shoes. :D
trice? wow
Om: Insults maybe met on with chocolate sauce. ;)
the ballad of hollywood jack and the rage kage yay :)
GilDash: That always makes me feel worse. Sorry.
Ninjazz|Depressed: There's nothing to feel *worse* about. Just know that there's something you can do about it. :)
GilDash: That is just unfair
Om: You'll learn your lesson one day. :D
Om, how does it feel to be chased through the ends of the IRC earth?
WallDives: I dunno, but it's a pleasure chasing. :D
WallDives: Once they invent a word that describes it, i'll let you know.
He likes it somewhere deep deep deep down. He can't just keep this up without having SOME sort of motivation.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Who? Om or me? :D
Om.
Om: Terrorfied? :D
03OK
03thanks
03I literally have no idea what this stuff means, which is probably bad but this thing's due today :/

Om: Don't we all?

Om funny, I'm afraid of heights XD
GilDash: To a point I suppose we all are.
Om: Falling is fine. It's the landing you need to worry about. :)
^
no one is on skullgirls today, apparently.
Wrek drew a wang in the box of boredom :D
GilDash: You wouldn't worry about it for long.
That's actually quite nice metaphorically, now I think on it. :)
Gunthler dick in a box?
It is...
You surprised me.
Om: I think I'd be worried the whole way down, until I landed. :D
GilDash: Ded
lol i guess so, Lil_B
Om: Tsk, metaphorically, Ommy. :D
Ninjazz|Depressed: I surprise myself. :)

GilDash: Me too.
05wonder if i can msuter the will to make her more gold jewelry...

alexxm: Deliver it to GilDash, she'll like it. :D
Om: I don't think I'd end up metaphorically dead. :D
She'd look amazing in it.

Something looks wrong

Oh, the tail
GilDash: Wasn't suggesting you would

Invi techniclly 9 or 10 weeks, but the very first time i was on this site was during an apisode and everything crashed, and the next time i tried was 2 or 3 weeks later
05gold certainly is a good contrast
is this video still going on because last noight i saw the same thing O_O
Gold looks good for certain
05^ sure*
Aye
Om: Orange, apparently.
wrek both would look goodd
GilDash: So gold would be best metal then.
gold is worst resource in minecraft
no
hey therainbowdashy hows your day been
Or copper maybe. But that isn't much a jewlery component
but i think Gold is the better choice to give the picture a higher variety of colours
Om: Technically copper or someting similar...
*puts on hipster glasses* gold is overrated, i use copper as my accessories
alexxm good yours
Om: Maybe polished bronze?
GilDash: Bronze might work
moin valoreins|Drawing
valoreins|Drawing: Beat ya. :)
05too tribal id say

valoreins|Drawing: :yaoming: bitch please i use dimonds incrustated in diiamonds
Wrek: I'm just going for the closest metal to the "technical" complimentary colour of purple, orange.
hi

hi

GilDash oh ^^
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4jgyp8EIu1ru5991o2_500.gif
TIME FOR TICKLES
13celestia is similar to rainbow dash, just stripes of color
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, NO.

05raritys mane uses a gradient and curls. nuff said
hey CrimsonPhoenix hows your day been
GilDash then explain it to mee ^^
OI!
meh tiresome
yay
anypony here wants polybius?
and I had a bad sleep to begin with...
so, yup, rarity's tail is more time consuming
From the link I posted earlier, "Many of the axioms (c, d, g, h, i, and j) deal with how addition and scalar multiplication work, but W is inheriting the definition of addition and scalar multiplication from V. Therefore, since elements of W are also elements of V the six axioms listed above are guaranteed to be valid on W."
GilDash oh xD
can i post a video here? theres this guy on youtube that makes cool vids but hes not getting the attention he deserves and that makes me sad
not when theres a stream pony_5380
pony_5380: It's you isn't it?

Lil_B: lol funny name :3 i will taste one tomorrow

idk how to put it though

Jim: I love schnitzel, better than most of the fast food.
Malavolent: Where can I get em? :d
have you got any more finals TheRainbowDash
Gunthler: I don't know where do you live, but in my country they serve them in restaurants... or you can cook your own.
Malavolent: I live in USA
Malavolent: same here, they dont serve it in fast food joints though.
Where get em?
dat stream
As I said, there are millions of ways to make schnitzel, normal or natural, fried in a pan or in a deep freyer, and millions of kinds of souces
I'm too lazy to make my own food. :d
what is schnitzel Lil_B
Gunthler: Dunno, they don't sell schnitzels much in Us.
Gunthler: Well don't be lazy and make some fucking food.

TheRainbowDash: tell him I said hi!!!!! and give him a big hug for me!
05DC'd

U WILL BE ONE OF US SOON
Gunthler: you buy boneless chicken breast, hammer the hell out of it till its thin, beat some eggs, coat the meat with it and finally coat the meat in bread crumbs and fry it in oil. simple as that.
hi sean
Wrek: hm... i knew it was wierd ^^
Alright, they stopped dunking the monkey, and the forest elf princess wasn't as good looking as I thought...
!kyu
/me 07does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.

Giger4444: WAIT? COOKING INVOLVES HAMMERING? BUCK YEAH
03also, you know
03bop it, twist it
03pull it
alexxm food, a thin piece of meat (usually pig, but sometimes sheep) you coate it in egg and then in breadcrums, then you fry it
05hi Sean, dont let cachi01 force you to anything, jsut give it a try adn decide for yourself.

/me now belongs to Kyu for 15 minutes
Gunthler: It's quite a long way to US from here. It would probably disintegrate till it would reach to you.
also, normaly fried in a pan, but some cheap restaurants use deep fryers, because it's quicker, but it doesn't taste as good and the Breadcrump Chrust will come off to easily

If TheRainbowDash comes, tell her to message me.
Lil_B here you can always tell if they deep fry it, because if they do they dont try to soak the oil off from it and it tastes really bad.

CCCP: that is strangely adorable.

Lil_B: Oh, I live in the eastern part of Czech, too bad.
GilDash: i do great on tests
One does not simply work
Lil_B: :(
CCCP: so a lime twilight = fail class? XD
CCCP: So why are you worried then? You'll do great, surely. :)

CCCP: 57%
thanks ^
i never made a technology work in class and in the exam i got 10 (perfect grade) in the exam but i failed the class lol
Lil_B: Seems like it. But hey, I'm sure you can find some German bronies on the internet. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a meetup in Germany too. In fact, I think I read about one when I had searched through EqD archives.
am i the only one that always finds bronies on omegle?
I passed all of my labs so far :) Now onto the theoretical stuff.
CCCP: i only use omegle when i havemy trolling senses on
Malavolent actually... the meetup i was talking about is supposet to be at the German Brony Meetup in Frankfurt XD will be the first time for me
02*WB03(Rukario03)02WB* - <Umbreon> there really isn't anything hard about DOS <Umbreon> except making it do something useful
Lil_B: You're going there? Enjoy it, then, I hope someone will organize a meetup here, too.
cachi01: oh, lol :P
CCCP: I was asking xD not telling... and you will do fine... the more you worry the worse you will do you know?
panda: i guess
:)
Malavolent i thought i already saw a Czeck Brony Meetup featured on EQD
CCCP: :) you'll do fine... just think WWPD!
08,01so i just found pretty much the most adorable thing ever: http://www.iaza.com/work/120514C/iaza14188048228600.png
panda: not always true. worrying keeps me on my toes and sometimes I can pull incredible stuff out of my mind while under pressure :)
WWPD?
CCCP: what would Pinkie do
Some asshole on tumblr just insulted a friend of mine.
panda: ohhhhhh!! LOL
08,01i know the person who made it, and she's going to do me a little floppy pony, but i dunno which one i want
Time for a little fun.

Malavolent I would like to meet the german voiceactors, they actually have done a great job speaking their lines
OmegaMetroidBrony: What?!
http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/latest-update-on-tornado-poten/65595
It's still there :3
alexxm: Wow, this sounds amazing.
Lil_B: There is a German dubbing? Can you send me a example? I've seen on television that there will be Czech dubbing too, on the 1st July I think.
scottish heavy metal pirates TheRainbowDash
Malavolent ok
my little brony
Lil_B: I hope they won't screw it, we have both great and lousy dubbings.
/me nuzzles TheRainbowDash
Heavy metal pirates, I approve

I'm Fluttershy in this
flutter_spin: Oh, you...absolutely amazing.:D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8HAbxmQ0g&feature=g-all-lik
Malavolent the biggest problem i have with the german dubbing is that they don't have some more coordination. It feels like they are giving the voice actors just the text to read and thats it :/ it even is a decent Translation with some minor errors here and there
hello everyone
lol ,limeware
Hai MahBoi777
Hiya MahBoi777
hai MahBoi777

Dat MahBoi777
if there were male versions of the characters on the show who do you think would voice them
Malavolent they even went so far that they dubbed the backgroundchor in the songs like "At the Gala" and such (although The Intro and "Winter Wrap up" do sound really bad)
MahBoi777: Ponies! :D
hey Jim, FillyFlam, Michael, CCCP, WallDives, cachi01, and Gunthler! lol
THIS IS JUST A TRIBUTE U GOTTA BELIEVE ME AND I WISH U WERE THERE
MahBoi777: Holla! :)
what about me MahBoi777
Lil_B: Not enough emotions in their speeches?
hey alexxm, I'm doing GREAT, goin to see The Avengers in a few hours
MahBoi777: great movie
hope you enjoy it MahBoi777
I actually have the dream to meet a girl and dance with her inside a ballroom to a waltz
Why am i always pulled away from my comp once i enter the chat!?!? :[ Ahh!! What have i missed in the past few minutes? :D
MahBoi777: remember its a marvel movie so dont i repeat DO NOT leave before the credits end!
alexxm: thanks, how are you?
Oh, hey MahBoi777! :o
05love this song
RaveBrony: We had a party. Without you.

Yeah, don't miss BOTH TWO secret endings
hey RaveBrony!:D
05press play dimwits
good MahBoi777
but only Wesker and Zero matter in marvel...
Malavolent actually they have, but things like raising the voice, lowering the voice, screaming, things like that are there, they just sometimes don't sound right
FillyFlam: Nooo D:
hello GilDash!
wait,you mean the movies, nvm.
alexxm: Ah, i see, lol
http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf
if there were male versions of the characters on the show who do you think would voice them
05alexxm
Oh, ty Wrek :D
Wait....
05wait what?
Wrek i've only got the buffering circle
^
...My wits are still dim.
still no vid
Lil_B: Oh, I see. I'm looking at the first episode in German dub and it sounds pretty good!
cachi01: I'll remember that lol
lol
05well thank you for actually saying it then. i mean without you tellign me i would never have realized. thank you so much
can't tell if sarcasm
^
Malavolent also, the voices of rainbowdash and Fluttershy don't really fit (althugh RD got one of germanys best voice actors and Fluttershys voice is so god damn hard to really sound so hushed
