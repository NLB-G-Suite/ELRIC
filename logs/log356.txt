might I recommend sound isolation headphones?
Muppets :D
YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
muppet bohemian rhapsody YES!!
Twat didn't even hear me knocking. Can't say I'm too surprised. The moment I got into the hallway I could listen in on everything happening in the game as if I were standing next to the TV playing it myself.
that's what I have, they work FANTASTIC
YES! YES!! *M. Bison voice*
oh 3 scootaloos
is this real?
HEY! Who was wondering about Darkness 2 last night?
dat scootaloo
I have a review of it here!
This is made by the Muppet Team

GONZO!!!

anypony with a sense of humor loves the muppets Midnight_Tempest

I really love what the Muppet team have made for youtube, it proves that they are awesome
indeed
i want the dvd set of the muppet show... MUST HAVE!
Immensely tempting.
me too
Although I annoy them enough.
Muppets are better than puppets
They can't seem to grasp the concept that big chunks of food DON'T FIT DOWN THE KITCHEN DRAIN.
hahahahahaahaa
But Moaaaa
:D
So every time I find the drain clogged by chunks of food, I stand in the middle of the hallway and shout something like "NEWSFLASH: IN A SHOCKING DISCOVERY, IT WAS FOUND THAT BIG THINGS DON'T FIT THROUGH SMALL THINGS!" at the top of my lungs.
hahahaha!! Good afternoon Bronystate! xD
hahahahaha
Followed by "CLEAN IT THE F*CK UP YOU TWATS"
Then I go back into my room.
ohai RaveBrony
the Muppets are the greatest thing jim hansen every gave us
lol
hey there!
Eventually they'll get the hint.
eyeep
afternoon RaveBrony
I'm sorry Lasharus

:D
Hanging up notes doesn't help, but I'm sick and tired of cleaning up after twits.

00,10*headdesk*
how many times has this video been played here?
soooo cute
diabetes,I have it
this like one of the most random things i've ever seen
Link to the video
bc he borrowed the money from his grandfather
the answer is probably 'too many times'
00,10thank you dari
so why did I have to pay him?
Onion onion onion onion.
:O
the name of this video was stated REPEATEDLY, how dense are you guys?
it was YOUR portion
Haha Sumica, I wanted to spare you having to answer again. XD
What are you, an idiot?
the one YOU were responsible for
those silly flillies
wasnt in the chat at the time, different tabs
I paid mine already
WHATS THE NAME OF THIS VIDEO?
00,10it's not too bad i just press the up key in IRC
I was screwed over many times it seems
Heheh, fair enough.
:o
Epic!
Quite clearly.
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU
lol
Thank god all bills are individual here.
What's wrong with your face?!
we like ponies, thats whats wrong with us
um what else
its a addictive drug
since when was that a bad thing
yh, I was the house bitch
It's not wrong to like ponies
^
I usually ended up doing most of the cleaning
I have not admided to any one i know that im a brony
and almost all the yardwok
work
00,10but now we all know
:P
I paid my portion of the bills
on time
and the other two didn't
Ive openly admitted it to anyone who brings it up :P my friends dont give a fuck xD
^
so we had several times that the electricity was cut off
Yeah,I think Im the only brony of my town. xD
same here
oh
I converted 3 friends of mine
:D
and when I finally did move out
My little cousins sorta likes the show
Theyre just like 'Cool story bro, you do what you want'
and paid back what I owed
My cousine wanted me to pay full rent
I dont think people would like me if they knew i was one :(
:\
lolwut
for the month my stuff was just sitting there
Sounds like a nice cousin.
00,10Converted I dont like that word, Assimilated seems better
after I paid him back for covering me for a month
well
it seems like that
transformed^
I would tell people, but it would just come off to me as bragging, I hate bragging

otakon: even if you get kicked from this channel, you can still use commands like /join
is there a brony BF3 clan?
besides, you guys get kick happy sometime
Will we ever see Vinyl again?
Probably not.
Don't use the web client. Use xchat or mirc
somebody kick him to demonstrate
otakon use /join to hop back

What is this??
did you use your easy button otakon?
no
09,01like Digimon 01 and 02
09,01best part?
there is no easy button
FLUTTERSHY IS BEST PONY
well thats cause it was easy enough as is
09,01in the sequel to this, Tai appears
you have to remember the channel name
09,01because ALTERNATE WORLD SHENANIGANS
if you don't
BYE
third season was good too
/me facehoofs

this echo is killing me
cya moop
Digimon? Ive heard of it, never seen it O.o
Meh digimon
Cya moop
ive only seen season 1 im very confused now
Ingwaz: like you've never entered teh wrong channel name before
Silly Digimon.
I like the PS1 digimon worlds game
09,01Digimon is best Mon
Why do japanese voices always sound the same? I hope that doesnt sound racist :(
RaveBrony: It's like a cooler version of pokemon in general
But I like Pokemon better in general
nope, i'm too good to do that otakon1
otakon1:
that star has got the gurenn lagann shades
japan only has like 3 voice actors
yea! pokemon
09,01Pokémon was good because of the games
Haha
ColgateSparkle: same question here
digimon season 1 and 2 were best seasons
ekips: it also looks like the King Kittan
09,01but I got bored of those because it's a rehash EVERY SINGLE YEAR
lucemon doesnt look like a digimon
wait WHAT? wasn't that angelkid the bad guy last time i checked?
09,01in Digimon 04, yeah
09,01but remember
I guess if i was japanese then i could tell the difference though :/
does he have a microphone stand thing?
09,01ALTERNATE WORLDS
pffffffff
um what?
WHAT?!
alternate qorlds, number one excuse for buttraped storylines since series
tap tap tap
Dammit Shoutmon.
this is getting REALLY weird now
09,01Alternate worlds in Digimon have been around since Digimon 01
do kon
otakon:
09,01due to the canon Wonderswan games
do all the protagonists look like tai
Ingwaz: what?
nothing
and i remember a time when that taelking ming vase was a huge asskicker
09,01namely, with Ryo, who was from the world of Adventure, and traveled to the world of Tamers
rainbowdashing: seems to be a running them
e
oh crap
never good
evil masterplan worked
inb4 evil
that thing is a taiko drum...
/me strolls inside chat

Hello
Why does the guy in the green sweater look like Brock?

Nice NewDCD
crap, it's Dragon Quest 8 all over again
Oooh no.
lol otakon
a floating island WITHIN a floating island?
09,01also I like how in this series, the Human MC is like a "tactician" general rather than a simple partner
/me is not grounded anymore
lol
Fun ^^
well, at least lucy's bad again
brb
and you FELL for it
idiot
09,01oh shit
09,01that arm
09,01no way
damn
duuuuuuuuuuuuuude
09,01>He looks like he'd have a decent fanbase!
yep. that's more like it
wat!?
he's a girl!
um
Ga h hah haha.
dude, thats creepy
09,01Best quote
Wut
that face is oddly femine
What was that about a fanbase?
.....
femenine
falldown mode
09,01dari: FANGIRL fanbase
Lilith. . .I know that's a reference to some demon in some mythology.
09,01they dig characters like that
09,01the fangirls.
oh, it's busty again
that'S becasue the original myth of amgels displays them as genderless
NewDCD: that never made sense to me, WHY do fangirls go for guys that look LIKE guys?
ahem
GIRLS
ded
why the lipstick?
damn
we need more people like this http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-cool-bro.jpg
who's this chick?
HAIRCZTS
09,01for the same reason that the females who guys find attractive have more testosterone than regular girls, true story
Iron Largechest!
NewDCD: really?
09,01said features are found to be rather attractive by them....akin to a moving piece of art
BIG McLARGEHUGE!
hmmm
that's odd
i knew it EVERYONE'S GAY.
they just don't notice
i liked the gen where the human MCs had like power cards and tactics
Openings were more epic back in my childhood
09,01well I'm just speculating, but yeah, the more "attractive" a woman looks, chances are they recieved more prenatal testosterone in the fetal stage
hello everypony
:3
that was tamers
I always prefer my girls look like GIRLS! Wide hips, ample curves and such
ohai everypony~ and emangamer

Do the old megazords appear?
Lasharus: what did you watch?

but the ninth is also very good
Yeah Jim :3
Yeah, he is.
FINAL WAVE
Finish him!

The main difference of opinion I have is some people like Matt Smith, and I abhor him
09,01Eccleston is like the Godai Yuusuke of Doctor Who though

that guy is? 11th?
09,01yeah 11th

Space Ponies?
abhor - despise, hate
again
Well, I just only saw the 1st epi, so I haven't got a real opinion there.
HA!
Why do you need a pirate ship IN SPACE
that makes NO SENSE
He looks real annoying smug, though.
emangamer: bc
11th acting is good, but that's like saying Quasimodo has a beautiful voice.
cuz theyre fucking pirates bro
they also need MORE ships in the ship
emangamer: Because why not?
and seriously WHEN DID PIRATES BECOME THE GOOD GUYS?
Tolver: thats so mean
I can't see why they souldn't have pirates in space
ahahahahahahaha those action figures
otakon since one piece, I guess
Captain Jack Sparrow, shall I say more?
I like how they're blocking by crossing their swords.
well that's different
um
Magirangers?
yeah
Sentai is Magic
I am SO confused
Jack Sparrow isn't really a good guy
wait.....
just look at Somalia
but hes a fucking pirate!
WAIT.....
but he's NOT a good guy
he's selfish and manipulative
BUT!! HES A FUCKING!! PIIIRATEE!!

Gumri: I like the Italian opening but I still kind of prefer the original opening
But that's just me
yep, that's just you :D
Judgemental pirates?
Polydunami: I prefer the original one too
ANYONE!?
09,01This is the Dekaranger episode

TopHat: not as if that happens often is it though
Who's got Super Sentai on the stream?

This is Japan-crazy
I like laser guns~
I love it
They're not *rad* or anything, but they don't jam.
Argh! Everytime!
there's reason the military gives out semi automatics as side arms
Better capacity.
and that about every other police force usses semis
Better capacity.
Japan has better police dogs
Oh my
Doggie Kreuger?
its a dog.
in b4: furry
Ok so now there is a man in a furry dog thing
Norio

09,01BUT THEN HE SERIOUSED THE FUCK UP
Seizure warning

About time something HAPPENED that made sense
you couldn't fucking SAY why
So who's died?
and now the reason DIES with you for being a fcuking little TWAT
He'd be sent to the chair anyway
I'd say it should be, but Mamori is still a kid...and the mods wouldn't approve either...
otakon: that wasnt Volfogg... it was ChoRyuJin
hmmm

that one midget robot sticks out
i've lost whatever faith i had in capcom

Because so far I've got that some douche got killed by his clone and there are robots and some other bollocks going on

09,01TO THE CORAGEROUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS
That to.
good night for now
Never saw Lost, and never wanted to since you had to watch every ep or you were as lost as the title.
um
BOOBS
'um
^
:3
Just asking if that's basically the case here.
Guys, qucik question, is there something paticularily wrong with the pinkie_pie room? Whenever I try to acess it, it sends me here.
/me is scared some more
I like this anime
so, whos getting mass effect 3 for 360?
I heard Lost sucked.
Main 6 rooms are locked till pony ep
see you guys later
I think all the rooms are shut down
Bye alexxm
later alexxm
Well thats new...
Cya alexxm
nopony is getting mass effect 3 for the 360?
....Papillon?
It is, did you not read the newsletter?
Ingwaz: PC.
you make me sad Meanwhile
Your frat boy console makes me sad.
No no, say it with some love now. It's Pa~pi~yon~
i'd get it for the pc, if i didnt have my character files on the 360
Meanwhile Y so Francis?
pc is generally better imo
it's an EPIC MEDIC
Seriously KoutarouTaiga could this show have ANY MORE fan survice?
MFW i missed the mane6 room update on the newletter XD
09,01emangamer: it's one of the bad points of Final
wow that looked like good shit
eman: Could be worse. We could be watching Freezing.
yay drawfriend stuff!
So... basically she gained super mental powers by getting stoned.
/me feels like shit for no reason
Kencolt: yes.
mario_pony: Same here
TOY_PON3: Francis is reserved for when L4D is actually on.
09,01but at least it's not as horribad as shit like HSotD
that's Papillon
also DCD
mario_pony: same
it ain't that bad
I'm just going to AFK for a bit
the fanservice is overshadowed by the sheer awesome
HSotD was almost hilarious in its misunderstanding of physical attributes.
I hate it when Meanwhile knows when to hate......
KoutarouTaiga: I've been popping in and out ever few minutes and ever time I see either cleavage o pants so tight that their legs should be falling off
I can't see anything but the fanservice.
Francis is ALWAYS necessary when hate is involved!
Why is this girl such a bitch?
09,01also, by the last episode, Meanwhile will learn about the virtues of COURAGE and HOT BLOOD
Well, one could call it awesome fanservice? ^_^

this is too adorable
..............
09,01also WHAT GAOFIGHGAR SAID A MILLION TIMES

KoutarouTaiga: Five bits says I don't. Why is that girl such a bitch?
Ingwaz: so much d'awwww

O__o
09,01Hot Blodo: Pluck, Bravery, The Essence of Pushing Forward and Overcoming ALL Adversity...no...outright SMASHING through it.
Dismo: what sorcery is this? lol
Must have been some hell of a party Dismo, my memory is blank. :P
ive seen enough hentai
I have pretty much given up all hope of being able to follo this story line
11,01I think it's hot.
emangamer: This is nowhere near as bad as some shows I've had the misfortune of seeing.

The day I can't see stream is the day I'm so fucking confused. These are one of these days.
i may make that my background
Well I bet she's a jolly sort.
"durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
CriticKitten: are you sure those weren't just hentai?
MORTY: Y U SAY THAT?
Pretty positive.
09,01Her vision is augmented
/me sighs
As KoutarouTaiga mentioned, there's always HSotD >_>
GUNDOBER

Ingwaz: dat Wiley Shrug

09,01say hello to my li
09,01.....
He has THE BIGGEST nose i have EVER seen
09,0164
What is with that dudes nose?
09,01you just kicked my lifelong friend.
deal with it :V
why no one say bye to TOY_PON3??
emangamer: ikr
To be honest I'm more getting tired with people whining about what the streamer decides to stream.
I said bye to TOY when he first said he was leaving.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEQUIIIP
09,01exactly. GaoFighGar is just watching my back. Like he's always done : I
09,01because I'm too nice to tell some of you to take a nice hot cup of shut the fuck up : I
DCD, relax bro
Oh it's DCD
no need to get your pants hot for that :V
Sup
10,02Don't like the langauge though, we can handle this in a civil manner.
I'm trying to figure out what this show even is
I didn't name anyone specific eman.
Hey SuperBrony64|AFK. :)
13ping...
It's IRC, everyone logs everything.
:P
09,01tru dat
well still....
I'm trying to figure out what's going on in my average crass manner.
10,02Dat Shizu ping
Shizuka pong :3
it's on the record
I agree with SB. Also, If users prefer that something else be streamed, go watch it on youtube or someting :p
/me 11,01explodes
/me makes Nittany_Discord explode again
"Flasher :(!"
something epic is going
10,02If you don't like what's streaming, you can always pause the stream and watch something else.
09,01MIKOTO, BIG DAMN HEROES
to happen
Exactly
I still don't know what's going on.
08,01man, we should stream some Mongrels
Systeeeme CHANAGE
WOW...did anyone else see that camera shot?
burn
anyone?
11,01This show is so random.
O.o
I'm with SuperBrony64|AFK on this one. As I've said on several occasions before - not EVERYTHING can be done perfectly to your liking. Shit happens.
it isn't random. it's just that you missed 50 episodes of plot
/me is confused by the giggle physics in this show... :/
What GaoFighGar
08,01middle class foxes... it's my adolescence all over again
09,01pretty much that.
said
There are robots and some space jerks who want to remake a universe or something and some robots aren't actually robots and this chick has hot blood and that guy has a nose like a toucan's beak...
>Toucan beak
11,01Makes perfect sense!
Meanwhile: Just follow your nose!~
You can't restream all the episodes everyone missed everytime someone new joins.
dude
Meanwhile: yea I noticed the nose
Are they like reploids from Mega Man X or something?
09,01002 nose
that's a shout out to cyborg 009
No shit you can't.
So if you don't understand what's going on, that's just kind of too bad.
09,01is best nose
KoutarouTaiga: how does his nose compare to Seto Kiaba's?
...That's the stupiest robot
koutaroutaiga: was that a cyborg 009 ref?
And it's Singing
>mfw I get so signal
You have to watch anime from the beginning in order to truly understand what the hell is going on
OH FUCK THIS SEKAI.
lol old fart
It would help if I even knew what this show is even called
09,01Morty: Cyborg 009, ever watched it?
So who's bird face?
09,01The King of Braves GaoGaiGar FINAL
yes i have, i love that show
you should stream it sometime
Wasn't that the dude who got blown apart earlier?
09,01but yeah...Soldato J
Guy, you know what we SHOULD stream? G3 ponies 6_9
YFW DCD has streamed some Cyborg 009
Back in the day
:P
I liked Cyborg 009
09,01he also has a "002" somewhere in his
also, emangamer you crazy
otakon: did you read that fic?
09,01name or something

I was eating dinner
otakon: :'(

I fuse my elemental hero burtinatrix with my elemental hero Flame Wing Man
mario_pony: Dear Diary, What am I?
I'm a little sad that I know what you just said emangamer
dat Yu-gi-oh reference thingy(?)
09,01is it that time yet, bro?
They're formint the Megazord!
almost
forming*
also broman, getting no signal at all.
Is the peacock lightshow really needed?
Man, I REALLY want to enjoy this show
Meanwhile: dat YGO GX...probably the best one of the YGO series
but the DAMN STREAM HATES ME!
09,01>GX
Meanwhile: His robot was sponsored by NBC
09,01>best
Maser...Cannons
09,01o___ó
I personally preferred 5D's
Of course the lightshow is neede3d. How ELSE are they going to sell the toys?
KoutarouTaiga: are you agreeing with me???? I'm not qite sure.
"weeeee!!!"
09,01maybe the last season....
Hi, guys! Long time no visit!

> How do you stop a baby from crying?

remember, you have to ASK!
I didn't think that "seen enough giant robots" was possible on the internet
I was thinking hammer TopHat.
Hammers fix all problems.
especially goldion hammers
I dunno, why?
buck the police
why?
How do you spell Lieutenant? Like that.
lolwut?
/me bricks emangamer for that horrible joke
Meanwhile: because it is a hard word to spell
I hold up my trousers with a belt. :P
But not my underwear
That's just silly.
Antidisestablishmentarianism is harder.
Oh, shortly after I was born
Agreed dari. Who uses a belt for underwear. Absurd.
Meanwhile: not really :/ it is spelled like it sounds
I was gonna say since the beginning of time...
Must be a cultural thing eman.
screw underwear i have boxers
>boxers are underwear
bouncy

I think someone accidently awkwarded the chat...

I'm back. What did you expect, gentlemen?
/me is nommed like a bauss
lol..... dat MIPS
/me and Meanwhile
mips sucks something bad.
Sorry, MIPS took you DOWN?
You know, sometimes stream can get so silly with "can't find provider at..." problems that I just want to do something so silly it is sure to push time out of whack, then jump into the TARDIS when Doc comes to fix it and eat popcorn at full HHHHHHHHHHHHHD TARDIS TV, while marathoning Streams from 2011-2015... Why the heck did all that come to mind?
Silly Mips, trix are for kids
Mips.TV is the worst invention since MySpace
Do we have a less invasive adblock on hand for google chrome yet?
Because I can't find one and mips ads are beginning to cause bloodlust.
WHEN it came out
thats the thing
emantrollslayer: I can't remeber, was shit good or bad back then?
I definitely thought MySpace was shit when it came out...
Ictiv: not shit, THE shit
big difference
Not really.
emantrollslayer: I know
It's still faeces.
emantrollslayer: But THE shit can be still "The chosen on of all the shits that encompases everything that makes shit shit"
...
Oh this isn't SillyFilly
wtf is this shit
orly?
fine let me rephrase that in a way that everyone can agree on: since MLP LIve
The kind of shit other shit doesn't like to be seen with.
thats pretty shitty
Ictiv: umm...was this supposed to make sense?
Dat.. SILLYFILLY
oh DCD
lemme tell you
SillyFilly: How are you not in #SillyFilly?
remember that DX Aquarion?
I have no idea
Ictiv: how dare you go and flaunt our secret room like that :|
and then every SB came?!?!?
'secret'
It's not a secret room
emantrollslayer: its not as secret as the OTHER room :3
ORLY?
the secret room is where all the regulars hang out
LOL
what is going on?!?!?
Ictiv: that room is even less secret.
Ictiv: thats more popular that that room
tee hee
SillyFilly is a land of hapyness
Seriously.
um
eeyup

Stop doing that!
Damnit! another person died!
Genesic_GaoGaiGar - don't make me launch the Egg Carrier.
hello LadyCanary
Hey LadyCanary
Ohai
The system's firepower is more than plenty to deal with this.
Hello there.
Pasta machine.
told ya
god damn it
does this show even know what dark matter is?
Ohai M31
Does anyone? Really?
.........
it's whatever needs to be
because COURAGE
Meanwhile: i do
It's a macguffin for the time being.
hm?
emantrollslayer: This show was made in the very late 1990s, of course it doesn't
better get your tissues ready
hehe
because MANLY TEARS WILL BE SHED.
Is there something streaming?
And autopaused again.
There is.
LadyCanary: refresh
eh?
09,01canary: refresh
LadyCanary: Yeah, refresh
Am I the only one to whom that keeps happening on veemi?
Looks like it so far Lasharus|Robotnik
The stream just randomly pausing for no apparent reason?
hmmmm
Not for me
Blegh.
This requires further research then.
dumb ad
how long has this show been streaming now?
it's your internet connetion
I very much doubt that Genesic_GaoGaiGar.
emantrollslayer: since yesterday
most likely noise on your line
There we go.
I had that yesterday
<macrocat> I installed Ubuntu but it just throws me into a debian console.
not straight thorugh
ahahahaha
*through
DAT SHOW TITLE :d
Genesic_GaoGaiGar - I'm on a 100mbit university uplink. :P
but it STARTED yesterday
Ohdang
Where's ZA POWA
Okay
Also, it ONLY happens with Veemi.
I see
Mhm
...human Fluttershy? o.o
eeyup
maybe it's something related to Veemi and your college?
also no.
._.
That's a possibility.
that was 1999
OH SHIT
HIS EYES
Oh hey bird face does have eyes.
THE ONLY TIME IN THE ENTIRE SERIES
HIS EYES ARE SHOWN
Guys
uh she's back
now the REAL BATTLE begins
I'm sure you would like to know who was doing that weird nickname change thing
Wouldn't have known if you hadn't said, is there something special about his eyes or are they just hidden because?
Well
It was....
Hey Doctor
KoutarouTaiga: is...he part machine or something?
MY MOM! AHAHAHAH- Just kidding c:
Yes TopHat?
INB4 entire anmation budget in this episode
emantrollslayer: almost
09,01Gai is an EVOLUDER
hello
O U
'ello.
he was a human who became a cyborg
who then, by the power of the G Stone became an evoluder
woah!
an Evoluder is like a superhuman
Well at this point I'm definitely not watching for the plot.
Oh bby. This is pleasing me
did he just catch up to his own bullet
Moonlight: yes
LadyCanary: -_^...
that's how awesome he is
11,01Lol. 5 Daring Do ask blogs now up. That's quick. Wonder how many will stay around.
busom!
AMAZING! :O
moar busom!
:o
Nittany_Discord: my guess? 2
Probably only one or two.
also LadyCanary, you'll LOVE the next episode
so MUCH BOSOM
"go go gadget..."
episode 8 has the MOST AWESOME moment ever
Go go gadget gun.
otakon: that pretty much describs this entire show, as far as I, someone who has no idea what the hell is going on, can tell
/me shoots all
Gogaigargadget.
indeed emantrollslayer
is it neccessary to name every attack?
Genesic_GaoGaiGar - stop telling us that. I'm sure we'll see awesome soon enough. :P
Moonlight: yes
Moonlight: of course.
POLEMYRIZATION
11,01I'd think a text and a drawn one would survive. The one that updates the most and/or does the best job at emulating the character will have the best chance of staying around.
I should really realize that by now
Ok so most of them are robots, cept one that is some kind of ship and a...statue and a metronome.
Nittany_Discord: well you can't really have the best job at emulating the character, because we know so little about her. It will probably the one that makes the character the most entertaining.
This is so MANLY.
11,01True.
LadyCanary: marry me :V
LadyCanary: eeeyup
Careful LadyCanary, it'll put hair on your chest.
....Too soon for me.
D;
how many proposals does LC get per day I wonder?
...
3 is my guess :d
She's a woman who can appreciate the AWESOME of GGG
emantrollslayer: about 5?
/me hits emantrollslayer with a newspaper. NOPE.
=_=
too much to count
Told.
Well settle for 4 then
LadyCanary: ;___; sowwie :(
The correct answer is 0.
or that many
I was only 5 off :3
Technically for today it's 1.
:P
It'll happen someday LadyCanary.
gagaggagagagaga
And I'm sure the moment will be truly special.
OOPS I LEFT CAPS LOCK ON
sorry
said
LadyCanary: you can't say that, because you just got one: P
True, dari.
:P*
GAGAGAGAGA
so how many is that in total?
09,01has chest grown on all of your hairs yet?
MY CHEST
09,01...derp, I mean, hair grown on all of your chests
Um.
KoutarouTaiga: what?
Ah. :P

Mine would've had I not removed it the other day.
THAT HAS CHESTS
Indeed, Taiga

{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Rainbow Dash Swag" - "Ranbow Dash has moves The Song or My little pony does not belong to me"
KoutarouTaiga: I have more chest hair than previously if thats what your asking
MY CHEST HAIR HAS TRIPLED!
Even my chest hairs have chest hairs!
welp, back from fooling around with famitracker for 3 hrs
I looked at the stream "Get ready to take a pounding!"
haha, the chest has been tripled
Chest hair? Pics or it didn't happen!
Hiii Dken2021! :3
It pays to either pay complete attention, or no attention.
hey LadyCanary
/me 11,01lowers the chat room temperature by 20%.
...Brrrr.
LOL
i c wut u did there
Chat is 20%...colder.
Nittany_Discord: but, now its too cold :(

TOO COLD
that's..... mildly cold
SOMEONE GET ME A BLANKET D:
/me hands PinkiePie101 a duvet.
/me starts a fire
MY HOT BLOOD WILL MAKE THIS CHAT HOTTER
ah, thats better
how much is 20% in temperature?
Depends what temperature it was originally.
1/4 a temp?
20 degrees i suppose
or 1/5?
/me covers his hoof with his face.
Spiral drill. Huh.
That isn't how temperature works!

Goodbye PinkiePie101

Fight his own father?
Thunderpony: you misspelled Pinkie Pie
Try not to dribble everywhere otakon
it's not his father
it's more like an evil clone
I didn't say pinkie pie...
ooooohh

Thunderpony: I know that's what you ment though
holy shit
well that was horrifying
It's not

Thunderpony: it was

No.
I see fairies in this show, not ponies.
Bird guy has interesting hair.
the one scene of her screaming in pain with DOZENS of needles in her?
THAT wasnt' horrifying?
Seen worse pal
that wa pretty scary
Watch out guys we've got a badflank over here.
but not that bad
Thunderpony: you are desensitized
I got it. Assuming it's about 15* C in here, 20% colder would make it -51.63* C
so we'd all be ded within minutes
I have seen worse, that's why.
lolwut?
and WHY have you?
HOLD HANDS
Lick her then burn her... seems logical
perfect logic
Because you're in shock

It's just too big
I'm not in shock
Im surprised his helmet can fit it all in.
I've seen crazy shti too
Or could before it broke anyway

Boner?
Ive seen enough anime to know where this is-- actually, i dont :p
This music is annoying

Midnight_Tempest? "always" is a depressingly short amount of time for you, should you presist in this...
11,01
lol at RaiRyu can't land
In case you're wondering, YES, the Egg Carrier is en-route.
Apart from the Forever Red episode. That I liked.
it's a big blimp
09,01Gao is basically the sound of an animal's Roar in Japanese. It's like going "ROAAAAAAAAAAAR"
RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik RoBUTTnik TOTALLY WORTH IT!

What are you guys doing?
I have no idea what you just said Thunderpony but it sounded card gamey
/me calmly observes the nuclear fireball that was formerly Midnight_Tempest's home.
Roarranger, DCD XD
/me 11,01bathes in fireball.
Maser?
/me is faintly worried about some weirdo apparently bathing in the fireball. What the hell.
A man laser?
Thunderpony: for UU I cast counterspell
UU?

11,01XD
A Mare laser?
/me laughs as he transmits from a bunker deep in the earth. HAHAHA! RoBUTTnik!
Thunderpony: double blue
/me dusts Nittany_Discord's shoulders.
/me 11,01dusts Meanwhile
You mean double summon?
/me sighs.
Thunderpony: no, double blue, so I can cast counterspell
Engage PlanetCracker. To everyone else on earth - blame Midnight_Tempest.
It's still my turn though

I was talking Yugioh, you seem to be playing magic the gathering o.o
RoBUTTnik! what kind of name is that! LAWL!
DCD consider me enlightened to a degree
This music sucks!
Meanwhile: LOL!
Meanwhile: seriously, what happened to love and tolerance?
It died with discord
...fire.
FUCK LOVE AND TOLERANCE
Don't know what you mean emantrollslayer.
Midnight_Tempest: A very funny one lol
Genesic_GaoGaiGar: that was uncalled for
:3c
/me 11,01sits on Genesic_GaoGaiGar
I may not have seen this anime before, but i can tell when it's pulling total transform crap.
09,01I agree with him : / mainly because bronies mistake "tolerance" with "moral blindness"
^
I rather like love and tolerance. But I also believe not all things can be tolerated.
That's what ponychan used to do at any rate
Dunno about now
/me is saved by nothing as the world explodes. Game Over. Out of continues. 'O_o HAX!'
I think this needs to be the brony code: http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyn3e1uznI1r6yguzo1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&Expires=1328752448&Signature=zr93C2NtPtsc1Um8Yg0nWP8rxIU%3D
KoutarouTaiga: that is trut, but you still have to act respectful, else you are no better than the /b/tards
^ agree
11,01I guess "Love and Tolerance" is a conditional thing.
More like a relative thing.
that is awesome emantrollslayer, 40k ref ftw
emantrollslayer: Just for that, I'm giving you a BROHOOF!
emantrollslayer - EVERYTHING is better than /b/
OH SHI-
LOLWUT
Doping cylinder
I chaos summon number C 39: Ray Hope!
09,01That's okay, I'm not looking to be better or worse than anyone :V I'm looking to just be me.
And now the robot is drugged up to?
HE'S DRUGGING HIMSELF
Good grief.
SNAKE FINGERS!
Steroid bot is go.
OHOHOHOHO
lolwut
KoutarouTaiga - you might not be trying, but nobody has to TRY to be better than /b/. It's something that comes naturally to most of humanity.
HE JUST ASKED FOR IT
11,01Literal love and tolerance will make you friends in some places and get you flattened by others.
This anime is just trying it's very hardest to be a good mech anime
But it's doing too much BS
Nittany_Discord: it's nice to know where to draw the line on loving and tolerating
09,01Thunderpony doesn't know shit about good mech anime.
EXPLOSION!
I know this isn't one
11,01Yes.
Don't have enough experience with mechanime to comment on it in that regard
Is this the same anime we were watching earlier, or did it finally end?
it's the same
eeyup, same
But I'm only recently grasping what's actually happening.
In my opinion there has only been one good mech anime.
09,01you kind of missed 50 episodes worth of TV show plot, plus 6 of OVA plot
09,01so yeah.
what anime are we watching now?
Stupid bloody auto-pausing VEEMI!
this is the AWESOME AWESOMELY ENDING
09,01inb4 Gurren Lagann
the next is the final episode right?
No
Gurren was ok
Ofc everything is better with plot.
yes
Wuz going on in here?
Epic, but not the best
wait wait
you saying Gurren Lagann was ok
you wanna see epic: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyndr6F7Uk1rnpo0wo1_400.gif
and this is not?
/me sneaks onto the Egg Carrier and stands behind Lasharus|Robotnik. '<_< >_> RoBUTTnik...'
The hell is this
GGG still?
When will we reach the final episode?! :O
Boohoo people have opinions.
In my opinion gurren was ok
what are you smoking?
09,01This is one of the main inspirations behind Gurren Lagann
09,01so yeah
wait for the gif to load
How am I unable to guess
indeed
09,01so what is this good mech anime you speak of?
09,01INB4
Midnight_Tempest? Off my ship. Shout all the insults you like, but get off my ship. Now.
09,01THE LEGEND OF THE BLUE WOLVES
Or I'll teleport you inside an active volcano.
Lolwut
G-Gundam of course :$
Gurren Lagann draws heavily on GGG, Getter and other classics
T_T but... but... the Egg Carrier is so awesome...
09,01....this is kind of like G-Gundam
09,01although yes
Yes Midnight_Tempest. Yes it is. That is why I will not allow someone on it just to insult me. Off.
09,01G Gundam is fucking amazing
DCD
Lawl, nah I got the Pinkie AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA gif eman
you must stream G Gundam next
XD
if anyone doesn't think GGG draws on Getter Robo, I want to know what they have been smoking.
09,01indeed.
KoutarouTaiga: eeyup
09,01get ready
09,01for
09,01FINAL of FINAL
um
I don't know any of the anime you're all talking about.
FINALLY!
Boobs are everywhere

WHY IS EVERYONE NAKED?!

/me gives Lasharus|Robotnik a glare then sighs. 'Fine... Doctor Robotnik... I'll go... T_T'
YES!

09,01wait for it, Thunderpony...get ready for HOT BLOOD
Does it involve boobs?
/me still has no idea what the hell HOT BLOOD is
09,01no
Good
The JoJo OVA was awesome. The water guy was so OP.
09,01it involves epic
it has a very good first half, but as Code Geass, its second season is amazingly underwhelming
Am I the only one who also really liked the second season of that? :P
most likely yes
Geass/
JoJo is always at least amusing in a bizarre kind of way.
Did ya'll upgrade the viewing window? stream is running smoother for me
Fair enough :P
Geass?
I thought R2 was more like "HEy we're back, but we lost control of our bowls so we stink" wasn't a big fan of R2
I've got an R2 poster on my wall
KoutarouTaiga: I have yet to see this HOT BLOOD of yours
Is she using a giant sugarcube as a weapon?
god I need to catch up on my anime
Mostly because they KILLED the main character for justice
I never liked killing the main
Cypresswolf: I know! So much less buffering! Last night was a NIGHTMARE!
i can't see anything my internet freezes everytime i try to watch this.:'(
>dat piano version
I'm sorry...
Sometimes killing the main character is just the way the story goes.
brb man, wiping the MANLY TEARS
I've been buffering since i came in
Not often, because killing the person we've been empathising with all that time is usually a dumb move.
Thunderpony: Yes. Yes they did kill him... all according to his plan. He'd set himself up for it. Ultimate sacrifice, that.
I have some upgrades going on the background. stream lags when that happens. Its flawless :)
:( I feel sorry for you mario_pony
Yeah, still...it makes me feel hollow when the series ends and the main isn't around to enjoy it
What's streaming?
helps dry Genesic_GaoGaiGar's tears
thanks man
or woman.
Unless he's like Light Yagami, in which case i jump for joy and laugh.
whatever
GaoGaiGar is The_4th_Wall[Borderl
I'm a girl; and you're welcome.
um waht happened?
*whispers* gagagagagagaugaigar
I liked Yagami.
WHAT DID I miss?!
Otakon
you're back just in time
it's wed it happened whith that veemi.com live
I thought he was a prick, an awesome prick, still a prick.
Did you see scissor formation otakon?
to see the last episode
the one with the MOST AWESOME SCENE
Is this the intro?
EVERYONE DIED! otakon
I'm sorry, I'm kind of balancng between 3 streams atm
gods
yes, it's the intro
Just like in akira
THe anime movie not the manga
otakon: whichens?
alright thank you
Shy's and Derm's
I think it was Kira
I thought I missed the whole thing
Why does the robot have hair?
akira is amazing movie... i have the VHS on the table behind me
bc
09,01FINAL of FINAL
it's not hair
Because its anime
09,01they're energy cables
they're energy cylinders
FE.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
the same kind that Gai has in his cyborg form
I found Akira somewhat disturbing Midnight_Tempest :P
Grunt with each word
lol
It makes you resist more!
His power comes from his hair. Blatently.
why did they switch to veemi.com
Oh shit
Like Bayonetta?
Courage = power
Bc people were complaining
09,01because mips was giving trouble
no
Lasharus|Robotnik I did too but I watched it when I was 7... when I saw it again, it was the greatest movie evah
Bayonetta is a witch...her power comes from her sold soul
his power comes from his his courage
Her hair is just a conduit
Wait Bayonetta has hair power?
Ah, Japanese technobabble.. up there with Star Trek.
man i can't see anything veemi.com makes my internet all slow!
Yeah, she uses it to summon demons from hell to eat angels
I assumed from the game box art that she shot people.
Conduit? (sorry, I'm a little bit on the dumb side. lol)
She does
BOOM!
I really missed the point of that game from the box didn't I.
I watched it only a year ago or so Midnight_Tempest. I just can't stand organics (dunno why, they just make me nauseous), and the final scenes didn't help there, I'm sure you'll agree. :p
Conduit, like a pipe.
mips worked so well with my internet
Though not in a literal sense
Things travel through conduits
I heard they're making a bayonetta two
Really?
Not sure if it's a more than a rumor though
I did, too!
:O
Never played 1.
Thunderpony: you spelled Copout wrong
now they're showing who's boss
GENTLEMEN
Lasharus|Robotnik I get that, the last scenes gave me nightmares when i was younger... but that's what happens when you try to force evolution :D
Stop correcting me on words i don't say!
BURN THAT INTO YOUR EYES AND HEARTS
lol
And now the robots go topless.
she's a lady
Midnight_Tempest: last scene of what?
How very...peculiar.
Eeyup.
KABLAM!
"Forgive me for going topless." Dat....wut
Explosions made of win don't hurt you
Thunderpony: its what everyone was thinking
"excuse me for going topless"
akira emantrollslayer
/me doesnt know waht that is
>_<
Now maybe the dual guy robot can go trouserless just to really drive the point home.
your dead to me emantrollslayer...
;___;
Yes
okay, Bee Chick is nippley
I still like you emantrollslayer ,#
are you gonna go back to mips after this?
<3
I hope not. mips sucks.
That brat annoys me for some reason
/me i'm talk'en like a boss
/me nope
Which one?
O_o
The little girl...boy....the one who said defect
Abel
Whats going on everypony?
We're watching robots fight.
IDK, my BFF Jill?
GaoGaiGar Final is up

I see that :o
/me nope
Fuckin epic
emantrollslayer... you need to watch the movie Akira... now... for I am disappoint
lol xD
/me may be disabled
/me O.o
It's /me. but no space at the start.
Oh guess not
Midnight_Tempest: IDK if i want to aftter that description
/me thinks you a baws
brohoof man, brohoof
/me does not simply walk into italics.
They should have a brohoof emoticon here
^
BROHOOF! [\
^
emantrollslayer... doooo eeeettt, the movie is actually very good... disturbing, but still very good
But... (\
/)
(\
Not enough
That's all you need.
They need a brohoof AND and AJ icon
Midnight_Tempest: those two words dont go together
LIKE A SPOILED CHILD I WANT MORE!
/)^3^(\
Your argument is invalid.
emantrollslayer: of course they do, maybe not often but they can still go together
lol :P
rOBOTS IN DISGUISE!?
:D
what are we watching????
idk :o
We're watching Gaogaigegegegegeggalllalala or something
GoaGaiGar
GaoGaiGar
Yeah that
bay blade\
just one letter off
^^^
Thunderpony: ax smash attack
WAIT A SECOND
We're watching very large robots beat the crap out of each other. That's what we're watching, and that's all we really need to know.
So...tomorrow can we get some drawings on the stream?
ROCK TIME!
wut?
:)
I remember seeing this scene somewhere
....
<--- LOL
Destroying enemies with the power of RAWRK
If I ever get epilepsy I will blame this show
Suddenly, the power of music
CRACK THAT BITCH!
thiss is weird right now
:D
lol
well that was easy
09,01MIC SOUNDERS THE 13TH
hi guyz anyone (ingluding girls) that is a brony say I
whats the
09,01ENGRAVE IT INTO YOUR SOUL
Be glad you missed Symmetrical Docking moop
I!
did u just make a goldion hammer with sound!?
Pegasus: Most of us here are bronies
I!@
DUH DUH DUH
dat...metronome?
oh shi
Most?
:S
You mean all?
I I I I I I
I
Thunderpony: Not all, Genesic_GaoGaiGar isn't a brony.
Meanwhile: im not even gonnask what that is..... okay what is that?
:o
O.O
I always figured Bronies wasn't a gender specific term.
I'm here for the robots :V
Despite the bro inclination.
Oh my god!
It's not gender specific IMO too Meanwhile.
xD
Orlly? Is Genesic_GaoGaiGar a unicousin?
GOD MY OH
MIC NO!
doesn't brony refer to /b/?
WHO LIKES ICE CREAM SAY I;)
09,01VOLFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
....
I
boom headshot
I
moop: symmetrical docking is what happens when two giant robots love each other in a special way...
no, brony is bro-pony
Nooooooooooo
Im here, becuz im here everyday O.o.... dont have a clue whats going on on the stream :D
I had it today
and then they were all killed an overpowered
because bronys started on 4 chan
well this sucks
so /b/ bronies?
and my chat is derping hard
:O
:O O_o
VOOOLFOOOOGGGG
Meanwhile: gross
then everyone died
moop: mhmm.
they usually call themselves /b/ronies
Brony. A pormanteau of "bro" and "pony". Used to describe adult fans of MLP:FiM. Although not technically gender specific, many female Bronies use the term Pegasister instead.
and were gonna see ALL of them die now
this sucks
Oh wow they got chainbladed.
dudes
get ready
Kencolt: Eeyup.
HOW!?:
because tears will be shed
If they have a sword that's also a gun i will be happy
they're getting SLAUGHTERED
GREAT MORE CASUALTIES!!
Kencolt: what if u are a teen boes that not make u a brony?
Kencolt: that proper use of pormanteau
D:
Man that isn't even a fight.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENOPE
O_o
ded
They're all basically bread in a toaster.
EVERYONE IS DEAD!
all ded
My robots are deeeeeaaaaad
even Jder
DAMNIT!
EVEN J DER!
DAMN IT ALL!
liquid toast
Teens a Bronies too. THey just aren't fully matures, really. More colts or Fillies than Stallions or Mares.
They were so ugly that EVERYONE died! The end.
^
my pizza is dead
I want to strangle that little girl
._.
Stallion right here
I just don't know why
do you have to be 18 to be a brony?
09,01I don't blame you
that's horrible
09,01so do I
No
09,01but I'm still wondering if it's a girl or a trap
Just a fan of the show
FILLY! :$
it's a boy
That little girl is infinitely more annoying because she's a child.
they were so ugly EVERYONE LIVED
it's a trap either way
If she were grown she'd come across less like a douche.
and then the entire team was slaughtered
he has freaky face
Pegasister16, Pegasus, your names are confusing the crap out of me
If boy it's a shota trap, if it's a girl it's a loli which is a trap in it's own right
:o
well thats it
they lost
And then they hade tea. With biscuits.
Otakon
The acid test is if you find yourself annoyed because the Celestia toys are pink and they never give AJ her hat. If that's the case, it's pure Bronyhood.
I do love tea.
Pegasus: Na-ah! I just said that everyone DIED! :[
have you lost hope?
They are all fucked now
so?
Not really. The good guys usually win.
how is my name confusing?:'(
um
as long as one has courage, one can keep fighting
yeha
all dead
eeyup. And then they hade tea. With biscuits.
the end
Though tbh I'm not emotionally invested in this enough to care who wins.
Genesic_GaoGaiGar: EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS!
4th wall has been broken
SO WHAT?
Pegasus: Pegasus, Pegasister. They sound similiar.
um
YEAH
bits are bits
AS LONG AS WE HAVE VOURAGE
COURAGE*
WE CAN KEEP FIGHTING
Pegsus, Pegasi, Pegasister
Vourage will see us through.
Pegasisters are bronies too!
we know
:D
Eeyup.
Ibelieve I just said that...
but we usually just say bronies
oh.......that's pegasister's fault
why does he have pony tail?
:P
09,01OH BOY
lol
:3
HEY, I'm a pegaSIS...oh that does not sound good outloud
NOOOOO
I've heard these voices before
lol
no :3 image
I think one of them was in bakuman
emantrollslayer: you're right. Mostly because you're a dude, escapist referances aside.

09,01you won't be sayign that in seven minutes, Pegasus
09,01you won't.

Oh, hey, everypony!
Pegasus: GET OUT
I got on EqD!
Pegasus: just dont say it so loud... KoutarouTaiga is starting to get mad at all the people saying that....
Guys, be nice.
To each their own opinion, but if you dont like it, then dont watch it. No use complaining.
Hello Honey_Whistle
There's really no need to swear at others.
LadyCanary: IKR?
But, as LadyCanary just point out rightly, there's also no point in complaining.
no it's fine....
Now I've got a lot more ponies on the job.
Weird self rebuildingguy sure is taking a pouding.
so KoutarouTaiga is HE a god, or is his mech just really fucking powerful?
his mech is just powerful
Why do so many bad guys like to claim they're gods? I've seen countless bad guys do it and they all die after doing it
I don't care much for this show either. I'm here for the awesome ponyfolks
his mech is just too epic
09,01Genesic GaoGaiGar is said to be the God of Destruction
and he has this fantasy that he's a god because he can regenerate forever
...NOOOOOOOOOOO D:
NNNNOOOOOOOOOO
Fairly decent fantasy tbh
You might as well be a God.
Tarku: OMG! Those pics were soo CUTE! :$
oh a twist
Dat British line of thinking dari.
I'd say thats a curse rather than godhood
so this is what, the 5th time he's exploded?
KoutarouTaiga: so what happens when two people with G-Stones who are both full of courage fight each other?
Nah nah KoutarouTaiga - that's Chaos. (Yes, Sonic Adventure reference :P)
starscream?
emangamer: they don't
Did he briefly become a blue cactuar?
they bro up
NOW
Yeah.
Genesic_GaoGaiGar: in hypothetical situation land, what would happen
They do die
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END
THE POWER OF THE G-STONE....GRANDS COURAGE...AND MAKES FLUTTERSHY CRY:'(
But they regenerate

You waste your weekends to?
NO
Good grief man.
I need to find you and get you drunk.
Pegasister16: oh god... mfw I read that as a complaint... Sure you can take it as a complement if you want
Where do you live?
thats what weekends r for silly ;)
RAWRity: das ish true
Lawl, don't worry about that Meanwhile, my friends have that job.

You just seem to be being deliberately difficult today
YFW Pegasister16 hasn't read, or would even understand the moderator...
emangamer: it's kinda my job to piss him off at this point. Why do you think I made that casting choice to begin with?
It's because I'm usually like this and I'm not in the mood to restrain myself.
Seems kind of out of character for you
TheDr: hell, I'd go see that movie, lol

Pegasister16: it was a funny, but it was in reference to a screenplay RAWRity wrote about the chat that has an infinite amounts of inside references in it.
Don't worry about it Meanwhile, I'm unlikely to be offended by anything said

:P
RAWRity: I know...that's the joke
and be more clever. See, stuff like that won't work on Dari.
Good, but I feel the need to be sure dari. Since when I do say something stupid my immediate thought afterward is "Oh way to go dumbass"

Meanwhile: I would love to see you read either My Little Dashie, or Sunset
dat spike tail wag :)
I read sunset.
Meanwhile: didn't it just BLOW YOUR BUCKING MIND
cuz it was THAT epic
No, but it did make me feel a bit sick.
Meanwhile: how so?
?
And my My Little Dashie is, as always, boring.
:O
you know what we need? We need one of the streamers to stream the Star Wars: Clone Wars mini-series that Genddy Tartakovsky did.
:(
:O
boring..... now THAT makes me sick
Same way bacon is pleasant, but not god's gift to people who eat meat.

blasphemy
NO ITS A TRAP!!!
emangamer Meanwhile- Will one of you send me a link to Sunset. I've never heard of it.
Boohoo I have opinions.
Meanwhile: I got it
why are there no fat ponies in ponyville?
well stop having them
Pegasister16: you don't want to.
Pegasister16: it is pretty intense, but it's rather long
everybody has opinions and I respect that
it's the best fic I've ever read
moop: fat ponys are gross
I respect some opinions more than others.
Pegasister16: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-sunset.html
/me also didn't find MLD to be anything special. Felt like somebody took "Where The Red Fern Grows", abridged it, and put ponies in.
moop: no they have more to cuddle up against
but, HEY, for some reason I'm a sucker for fics where twilight tries to overthrow celestia...
PULEAZ! My Little Dashie made me cry myself to sleep!
i love some people and i simply TOLARATE others :)

New chapter? Missed it, I'm slacking.
WTF? is going on in that fan fic?

Sunset
oh, it's been complete for MONTHS
why does discord squees ponies?
Or the 2nd story anyway, Idk how you mentall y categorise it.
http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111008152652/mlpfanart/images/b/bd/FANMADE_Trollface_Discord.png
Yeah see, I'm reading the 2nd story, that's the one that made me feel ill.
meh, MLD just struck me as the guy taking every trope he could from other sad "giving up your pet" stories in an attempt to make people sad through remembering THOSE stories.
what do you mean "2nd story"
You missed the For Want of a Dawn bit?
It's on 15 chapters already
RAWRity: I have never read any of those stores and yet I still balled my eyes out
For Want of a Dawn?
I thought MLD was touching, but hey, that's just my opinion, may not be for everyone
whats MLD?
emangamer: it's on the same page you just linked
scroll down
all it was missing was Dash getting rabies and him having to take her out back and put her down.
my little dashie
moop: ones sec
moop: My Little Dashie, supposedly sad fanfic
emangamer- Thanks. What made it worse was I was listening to a read along to it WHILE I was reading it; he started crying and I couldn't help but cry harder! My troll brother wouldn't stop laughing at me. :'(
Oh for fudge sake I broke a nail.
Now it's really uncomfortable.
Meanwhile: umm...the alternate ending?
sad? i've never read a sad fan fic ever
moop: keep it that way

00,03I think i'll think much clearer tomorrow!
if i had feelings that is "cough"
TheDR: i make it sound worse than it is
but yea, sunset is the best fic that I have ever read
granted I've only read 4 fics but still...it's really good
00,03My Little Dashie was the second best fanfic I have ever read!
hmmmm, Sunset? never seen that one

i keep meaning to read all these fanfics but i cant find a good time to voluntarly make my self sad. life is doing a good job of that on its own

Last thing I saw was trixie hate
mario_pony ate a mushroom
And I agree
moop: dont read MLD then
Trixie should be eaten by Timberwolves.
Meanwhile: good, cuz she deserves hate
im reading it right now just started
um
moop: ikr? lol
you know
At last we can agree on something.
she could change
Or she could be devoured.
I prefer that
moop: I feel bad for you
SHE COULD CHANGE
otakon: no she can't
I hate Gilda more than Trixie
why can't you give her a chance?
its completly against her character
Because she's a bitch.
manly tears will be shed.
Why should she have a chance.
ummm
but ponies CHANGE
Fandom Trixie is completely different from show Trixie.
yh
people don't change otakon.
show trixie = bitch
that's true
fandom trixie =....IDK what
Meanwhile: do so
Do not.
do so
emangamer: many things
Do not infinity.
/me really doesn't get the rabid trixie hate.

/me really doesn't get the equally rabid Trixie love.
ok how about this THE WORST PONY EVER is ....... ugh TWIST....dumb bitch
another trixie episode would be good
Gilda<Trixie, just saiyan
Yeah ok that's just weird eman.
emangamer: why the hate for the pony with a speech impediment?
MahBoi777: no the only thing <Trixie is..... Twist
she has a lisp
that is NO reason to hate
I mean, she's not the most agreeable of personalities, but she serve her purpose as a character without ever doing anything all that despicable.
otakon: It's not the impediment....I ust dont like her. stupid termagent
it's like hating Derpy for her eyes
Trixie is Twist?
But she's such a bucking douchewad
termagent?
otakon: fancy word for a bitch
/me REALLY doesn't get the Twist hate. SHE'S ADORABLE!
RAWRity: NO, bad RAWRity
^^^
emangamer: do you mean Twisp or Trixie?
SCOORE...dat ninja
She's like some goober who kicked a puppy, and everyone saw that they kicked a puppy, yet seem willing to look past that because...I don't even know.
otakon: I mean Twist
emangamer: WHY!?
so much hate, lol
/me delurks and noms on otakon
noes!
Really, the only people who I can fathom liking Trixie are people who like being kicked in the crotch during sex.
otakon: because she is a stupid termagent who doesn't deserve my love
emangamer: did my ^^^ show up under your comment on your screen?
/me glomps kirzstryfe

otakon: what?
she's done NOTHING to deserve hate
hi kirzstryfe
NOTHING
otakon: I agree
otakon: IDK why I hate her, shes just a bitch and I hate nothign moer than her
um
HOW?!?
I really don't understand how being a show-off is tantamount to injuring an innocent puppy.
you can't just have unexplained HATE
@Pony
12mario_pony is 6Twilight Spa13rk6le

that's the same as saying you HATE the show

otakon: no it's not
yes it is
@Pony
Is being a braggart a good personality traigt? no. Is it deserving of the wish for DISMEMBERMENT? Hell no.
because I saw twist, gave her a chance, and FUCKING hated her
ok... so i remember seeing something about hating Twist? who could hate Twist, she's adorable
@pony http://derpy.me/HebFb
6 http://derpy.me/HebFb is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
lol
you hate something for the sake of hating her
not for any real reason
noo i is sweety belle!!
otakon: you're not going to dissuade me
emangamer: and what did you hate about her? What part of her character did you find disagreeable and why?
RAWRity: It's just an example. I've read fics with Trixie in and she isn't a complete jerkwad and that's fine. But her actual canon representation is that of the kind of person I have spent my entire life despising. It isn't her actions strictly, it's who she is. I hate her as a person.
she is just a plain old termagent that I do not like
I literally hate her being.
Meanwhile: ...wow
i supose thats the best reason for hating someone but still... wow
do I need ANY other reason to hate her? just look at this comic and tell me she isn't a termagent: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZhXaND3vtAw/TlGVD87wpgI/AAAAAAAAK1I/yjPmuMjEI9Y/s1600/1313961409.kturtle_iygaparc10t.jpg

oh my god RAWRity WHY

I only know one fanfic and I have yet to read it. Something called "Cupcakes".
why post that?
Placidzone: don't read that
Also
RAWRity - oh god is that a man?
for future referance
Placidzone: no...do not EVER EVER EVER mention that fic in this room
Placidzone: we're not supposed to talk about it.
Placidzone: no! bad brony! we do NOT mention that!
Placidzone: we shouldn't mention that here
else you will be banned
MirrorImage: NOBODY KNOWS
You aren't allowed to talk about Cupcakes in chat.
otakon: chill out on the poor lad, he's new
Chill out guys he's new he doesn't know rules

RAWRity: you have just pushed my love and tolerance levels INTO THE RED!! THAT WAS WRONG! VERY WRONG YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!
...Oh. I didnt know... I just arrived. :'(
/me protects Placidzone from the hate
Placidzone - that fic is the equivalent of Voldemort in Harry Potter/Chamber of Secrets
Placidzone: yea, it's easy to get kicked by mentioning any of that, just warnin ya
S'all good. We've all been there.
overhyped fic is overhyped

Midnight_Tempest: what? I didn't do it! I just shared it!
that's all I has to say
RAWRity: I think that is you in that pic
RAWRity :[:[:[:[
Placidzone: I got kicked and I never mentioned it ever again
Placidzone: I suggest you go read the rules before continuing on
^
EVAR
Agreed.
though amusingly, i seem to have avoided getting kicked recently over mentioning it
Ok....
maybe i've just done it when no mods are around
emangamer: nah, I posted pics of myself before. With my sword!
They can be found in the links up top.

Mars and Ares. I like it.

Stallion_of_War: YFW you realize that in greek culture Ares was the two faced coward and Mars was actually the brave one
hmmm
They're the same person...

Stallion_of_War: enope, one is greek one is roman
Yay for pictures! :3
http://i.imgur.com/atqBL.jpg
Mars is the Roman version of Ares
TopHat: I hate you
and then came Kratos the pony
quadruped'
IIRC Roman's just converted the Greek gods
Dat Dashie_Dashie.
:3
Yes one is Greek one is roman but they both represent the same deity
otakon: correct sir :)
Jupiter=Zeus, Mars=Ares
ah thank you
etc etc.
Hey LadyCanary
Hihi~
Dashie_Dashie: AAAAAAUGH
Ares is a reinterpretation by Romans.
No
Dashie_Dashie: Dat eyebrow raise
Stallion_of_War: actually, the Romans and the Greeks had very different interpretations of the gods. while Poseidon was a big deity in Greece, Neptune was considered unlucky and mostly ignored by the less navally inclined romans.
:3
Ares was reinterpreted by romans
:D
hello LadyCanary!!
There's a reinterpretation there somewhere
close enough...
Heya LadyCanary.
hi LadyCanary!
I was referencing GoW anyhow...
I'm here! I'm here!
Stallion_of_War: romans took the greek gods and MODIFIED them, they're not the same. In greek culture Ares was a coward and hated by Hera and Zeus (his parents). in the roman culture Mars was a brave and nobel god who they respected
Why is rarity so...snobby, yet she's the spirit of generosity?
Out of interest LadyCanary, are you still talking to me?
Yes I am ^_^

Night LadyCanary!

inb4 RAWRity killls Thunderpony and keeps him in his trunk

While the greek Ares was mostly a smaller god compared to Zues, Poseidon, and Hades, while Mars was a BIG part of Roman culture.

Thunderpony: Simply put, one of rarity's character flaws is that, while she is generous and giving to her loved ones, she can be easily frustrated at times, and often struggles with the choice of helping her friends or helping herself.
Dat raw shark.
XD Yes.
So many art pieces to look at, so little time.
emangamer: Dats a win
That's dedication right there
I'm making Valentines for my pals~
i think my chat broke
yup, broke
Thunderpony: told you RAWRity would put yon in your place
Oh so she is generous, just a lot of it can go to herself.
And one for a special someone >////<
If one of you were so ugly that everyone died I probably wouldn't love you anymore.
LadyCanary: do i get one?
You said rarity would hold me in a trunk
Meanwhile: because you would be dead
NO. But you did give me an idea.
lol
/me wonders if he should post a picture of his "beard"
Thunderpony: no, he said I would.
True fact, but by deficit, whoever loves them would be dead anyway
/me if it can be called a beard
has anypony seen Chronicle?
D: how do I not get a card then LC, I'll make you one if you make me one?
I'm not in a trunk
0,5What?
Epic Beards
So i win!
emangamer: you get something even better than a card. You get a kick!
LadyCanary: I'm sure your crush will love whatever it is you have in mind.

Curse you autocorrect

Stallion_of_War oh jeez, yeah. You can even make them.
I imagine I won't get anything for Valentines because I live alone and have been shut off from a social circle for about 4 years. Though even when I had people I knew in my life I still didn't get anything.

If you keep finding excuses I'm just going to find my handcuffs and do it my way.
TheDr - we all know dat feel

it's a good feel
mario_pony: no, not at all.
Oh lordy.

Meanwhile: RAPE. RAAAAAAPE.
TheDr - did you have a porn tab set aside to alt-tab to?
oh its just some material about human thinking
_▲_

RAWRity: don't make me relink that picture.
TheDr Is he a younger bro who torments you?
"What are you doing?" "Watching porn."
hmmm
TheDr: lol, I'm the same way
naw im just fast at closing tabs when people open the door wink wink
TopHat: now do the triforce

and does not feel MLP is a man's show
But still tortures you?
mfw the greatest treasure in the universe in Gokaiger is the TRIFORCE.

You just cannot trifoce right.

it won't register more than one space
TheDr I know the feeling though, my bro caught me, and while he hasn't bothered me about it (why, I don't know), I'm waiting for the day he will.

11,01My mom and mom's friend know I watch ponies I think. They don't know how deep I am into the fandom.
TheDr, WHY?!
i will chat again when it getts really sad
/me sits on LordCelestia's shoulder.
11,01My dad doesn't know.

LadyCanary: you tiny

11,01My brother knows and doesn't care.
/me pets LadyCanary
otakon: you beard.
TheDr: g'luck man
going to see if I can pick up anything there
um
ofc?
thanks
^-^ *tweets the MLP theme*
I don't know
gotta be strong
Nittany_Discord - likewise on the first two, though i've outright told my mom and her friend, so i know they know
Its a game store so maybe I can pick up some posters
/me hums along
11,01I didn't tell anymore.
RAWRity, you still kicking about?
11,01*anyone
Meanwhile: si
11,01I just let them find out for themselves.
only people that know are my cousins, and they're only children
11,01I didn't think "I like ponies." was something you told someone.
My mom's kind of an idiot like that at times.
Did you ever start on that shipfic of my moustache and otakon's beard?
/me is bracing himself for more random pictures
no
Nittany_Discord - it isn't
I've told only one other person.
just no
you bring it up casually and tangentally
11,01I did tell my brother after he moved in. That's the only time I told someone.
My mom and dad are quite fine with the things I like.
Meanwhile: no, but I did plan to have it in Mod 4 if I wanted to write it.
They dont judge.
I only got one person that knows, everyone else has no Idea....well except ya'll
my "coming out of the stable" moment involved me inserting a reference to the ending of S2E2 into a converstion that mentioned it was a sin amongst nerds to confuse Star Wars and Star Trek
My mum bought me a pony at my request. Whether she knows anything beyond "I wanted a pony doll" I am not privvy to know.
Cool good luck!
LadyCanary: well, to be fair, it's a little more normal for a female to say she likes MLP than for a male.
​ ▲
▲▲
i've told my hole family and all my friends they don't really care though.
there we go
inb4kick
RAWRity: You should write that.
The only reason I told that one other person is because he's my best friend and I knew he wouldn't riticule me over it.
/me figured out how to triforce
0,5>_>
Your best friend doesn't mock you?
Heck, I might have gotten him into it (but I can't tell, I haven't spoken to him since).
thanks
I talked with the manager there already
LOL, I just kept showin my friend clips off of youtube and soon he succumbed
Meanwhile correct.
When I had one he took the piss out of me all the time. And then I punched him in the spine once and made him cry.
he will be able to give me some game logo signs
I wear my MLP shirts all the time. so far most people have no clue, while ive recieved 3 brohoofs
What did he say?
not sure if ill be able to get anything else
"took the..." CONTEXT PLEASE
Admittedly, we were like 12.
ohai Hodiku
hola
MirrorImage: this is probably a cultural thing rather than a context one. See here that's slang for mocking.
yes... cultural indeed
Taking the mickey, having you on, pulling your leg.
If youve gone to a gamestop lately, most will have some signs that say xbox or ps3
Beating your whisket.
:D
thats what I might be able to pick up
LOL
I made up that last one
Meanwhile still, I love sayings no one uses here.
"Is that what you youn'gin are callin' it nowadays?"
Oh well I guess you will see tomorrow

I remember when hamburgers cost a nickel
Anyone who knows what i just said can have a hug.

Idk who Nigel is.
