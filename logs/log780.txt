Suddenly confusion
I thought this would be canterlot wedding.

Phase4: Actually, this is the one version with rasicsm...
wait... is this the animated Cindarella?
I have seen this one many times and I hate it more each time.
Keanu when he was like, 17.
Disney should make the original tale of Cinderella and freak out children across the world
AssaultWithEmbraces: You're better off not wathching it. :D
05,15I didn't even watch Babes. I was in for like 30 minutes then I went and played Left4Dead

river dance
Thisis the 1997 version people... it says right in the blog post.. and there is alink contained...

It pays to IMDB the movies before they're on so you know what to expect!
fluttercry: :D

And looked absolutely no different than he does now.
Never forget Spider's Web
musical?
Whatevs, i'll just see where this goes

You all jsut don't like it because it has a multi-culteral cast.
I wasn't even here for BITL and I still want to forget it
Racists.

I think all of us are here for the chat, not the movie.
shes black!!!!!!!! BUCK YEA,there no colors
Hey, now I think about it, Blackerella sounds like it'd be hilarious. Get an all black cast, and totally replace the setting from this to a Chicago or New York ghetto. IT WOULD BE BRILLIANT.
Sumica: Actually it's a TV film
night GilDash
BROADWAY, HERE WE COME
Fluttershy likes it, so everyone stfu

00,02this movie bores me
You know, I rather have Black Micheal jackson Cindarella.

Keanu Reeves is pretty much Dorian Grey, in any case.
Ugh, the ONLY good blackification of a classic is Muppets Wizard of Oz
/me 00,02returns to coding

Randomnerd: no shit
oh crap, this is a DISNEY movie, there's going to be ALOT of singing like this isn't it?!

VenHur: I know, right! You just want to start singing!
Someone... get me a gun... and one bullet...
TheSplixer72: Yep, this was based off of a musical version
anistasia >
Rex_Ivan: It reminds me of one too lol
Randomnerd: you dont say

05,15VenHur I HIGHLY suggest you keep comments like that to yourself
Ya, those two typical ugly woman, I always think two of them are Jealous.
I SHOULD POINT OUT guys that the 1957 original version of this musical had Juile Andrews as Cinderella
because black people voice are better
oh man, this chat is brilliant tonight aint it
IshPonyPonyThePony: Isn't it obvious?
this is a very diverse movie
asian prince
ricky martin?
Who's this guy? He's good at singing too.
OH GAWHD
IshPonyPonyThePony: I hope we don't get a live Wreck -It Ralph.
bruce lee XD
Cheesus, the racism level in main chat....
if were gona watch a black-sploitation film, it might as well be a good one
HE'S HAWT
a black and an asian?
The sweetest sound i'll ever hear is the sound of my ponies...
Aisian prince?
IshPonyPonyThePony: This is an adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.
05,15Seriously guys? Like....this is getting kind of ridiculous
o.O
<.< so, random asian guy
Oh...sorry...
:|
i don't like it when people sing in movie like this...
yeah..
:S
Smack-It Saul: The Musical
He is the hottest
asian prince...
wait until you see his parents
You know - I grew up watching "politically correct" shows like this. This was the 80s - before the term "politically correct" was even invented.
:S
ratialy diverse cinderela
Can sing pretty good
blackula or something
>_>
DJ well it was based off a musical
"i'M GOOOIIIING....TO WRECK IT!"
srry i just think that the cartoon version is better
I'm going to keep my mouth shut
I think we all need to calm down, guys. :S
Oh man, we should watch Super Soul Brother on here for a B movie... that would be HILARIOUS
This is ok.. it actually showed on ABC back in the day... I was ok with it... I like it better than Geppeto...
you mean you don't like musicals?
Is that Saito from Inception? (I know its not. don't answer)
Still I rather have Micheal jackson in this. lulz
So, what time period is this set in?
I think Obama should play the prince
asian prince?
This is getting a bit out of hand.
he doesn't look like a prince
Darzoz: a non existant one
NO
im amazed how many people expected the disney cinderella when they saw it under B mivies...
That guy broke my chat
the harmony:'(
lo ts not bad, but its better to comment over it, MST3K style lol
i would like it if rainbow dash said it needs to be 20% cooler
fluttercry, i'm so sorry, I...I had anger managements...
AssaultWithEmbraces: You wonder why I like this room?
NOTHING'S TOO AKWARD IN BRONYSTATE
...Forgive me!
he's not a prince. He's a kungfu master
where all the love and tolerance bronies?
THEY WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER
Ugh, THIS IS HORRIBLE! WHY AM I STILL WATCHING!?
at least it does teach girls that only white girls can be princesses
I'm thinking they threw all these roles into a random ehticity generator program.
GUYS, as I've said 50,000,000 times, prepare for a lot of singing because this is a 90s adapation of a 1950s musical
What movie is this?
ugh. This movie is lush
05,15This is going swell ain't it
Is Whoopi the fairy godmother?
ive always wondered how people would react if someon ACTUALLY went around town just randomly singing to themselves
alright, on a scale of 1 to 10, how imperative is it that one sees Wreck it Ralph?
i feel like everyones faces are a little too close to the camera
we should do a fan-dub
WHAT!? :[
Asian Prince in Spain? SEEMS LEGIT.
it could be soo bad
fluttercry, yep
oh dear, I've think I ruined everyone's weekend....
10
:(: what a nice harmony
People: Why are they singing? People: I don't know, but let just ignore.
I think the best part will be the singing and music.
Asian prince x Black cinderella? How about NO
i haven't even seen it and i know it's a 10
Kinixys: LOL
The random races I see here are the white ones.
This reminds me of fantastic movie ...
Do you expect any better from mane chat nowadays fluttercry?
i like the diversity of the cast.
We're all a little bit racist
oh well
havent noticed eachother yet? WTF
Deacon: Nah, this should be interesting. :D
this is in spain? I thought it was England
Beep beep
You guys are all racist
white people
Those horses are so rude
AND I should point out, this musical is coming back to Broadway next year

Walt Disney was originally a racist.
05,15AssaultWithEmbraces you're not alone
AssaultWithEmbraces: No, you are reasonable in that thought.
Plus the actual correct term is colorist, since every person in the film is a homeosapian which is the race which we know as humans
yay
he is very strange
she slave
despite waht i said earlier... is this movie being intentionally racist or just kinda poor wording?
Stalker STALKER!
RD SIT DOWN!
Can we all just either watch the movie/don't watch it and stop complaining? :S
ugh, this scene makes me vomit
Awkward moment
AssaultWithEmbraces: wish they done it sooner
stalking is good

IshPonyPonyThePony: good

Everlasting_Joy: Yeah... there's usually a modicum of decency here...
Stalking bad!

BANGBANGBANGBANG, BA BA BA BANG!
insert luna sumica
this is a long ass song
STOP FUKING DANCING
SATURATE EVERYTHING
AJIsAwesome: Reikim, Meanwhile , RX...
Endhiran was a Bollywood film. Like almost any film from there, it attempts to cram in everything it can-- action, comedy, tragedy, romance, and lavish musical numbers-- att in one film. In India, people need that level of escapism.
how long is this dance session?
Fluttershy so much yay!
Why is there so much yay?
04Bangarang
sudden flying dance?
THE PRINCES BODY IS READY ALREADY!
someone spiked the punch there for a momment

At least in mlp, the characters explain what they want or are doing. This is... doing nothing.

bring on the edible boots!

I do not sniff a slipper. but I have a foot fetish
Trollestia it wouyld be the best day ever

coinflip2 :D
rubbish!
Pony_1374 logic? unheard of!
REAL SPEAKING!!! :D
unless its just the slipper. then my idea is moot
And then, the Prince, realisiing that person so bucking stupid as to wear a glass slipper to a huge dance existed, any kids of theirs were going to be morons and the kingdom would bge doomed. So he married the sensible baker from across teh street. The end.

Weird, odd, socks
Art of the Dress was based on a different song.
the square root of pi is 1.7724538509055160.......
By some singer.
In the original story, the step sisters sliced off their toes to make their feet fit.
so there's absolutely nobody else in this kingdom with the same shoe size?
BALLAR Pillow.

making white girls try it on is kinda taking the piss
IKR DudeManGuy

why is he testing on little girls?
They were repaid by Cinderella's friends, the birds, who flew down and pecked out their eyes.
I'll imagine he pick the little girl. lolz
I forget who, but it was a song about being an artist, and the trials that implied.
Does love make shoes fit now?

AssaultWithEmbraces: Well, Shining does give good examples why she's that way even thought that's not true. Cadance has just been telling him this to cover her for her being Chrysalis.
Luminus Maximus

Again, it seems that Twilight is the only one with a gut feeling

Shining *might* have noticed something, but he does have the "kind of busy and in constant pain" excuse
Geez. She's freaky

THE CAKE IS A LIE
00,10good thing Dari is not here

EYESSSSSSSSSSSSS
a miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
What'd those apples ever do to her?? :'(

Rookeealding: less songs here and these are better
I do have to admit, brainwashing is a dark concept by itself.
in my heart there is no room
A little high are we cadence?
DAT. NOTE.
that bum here
ANIMATION ERROR WITH MY EYE!!!!
Sumica: he hates this song? is it cause the i''i could care less''?
Crazy eyes
No I do not love the woman!
yay
Actually I don't think it's an error.
People can wink.
how in the hell is no pony no hearing her?
Oh, Scout's mother. I'll see you very soooooooon!
Oh scouts mother, Ill be there very SoooOOOOOOOOOOon!
no error
Guys
soon I will have that mermaid and the ocean will be mine!!
use your magic
You think we'll get a song tommorow?
WE SHOULD OF THOUGHT THIS THROUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I'm sure someone as wise as Celestia would have had a feeling about Cadence not exactly "being herself" or known if somepony was being brainwashed
OH SCOUT'S MOTHER
Time to Die!
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
What would have been awesome is if there was a little shimmer in the mirror, and you could see Chrysalis for like a half second
/me winks
BEST SONG EVER :D
SaxyPretender "BBBFF" is my favourite, but only because I can personally relate to it, being a big brother and using the song as my sister's lullaby.
Let the pesants do the heavy lifting

This is the same VA as Trixie btw
And this shows for little girls :D
Canadian_Brony, the only good one is Daniel's Remix
How does she know what guards have and haven't been brainwashed?
The doctor is there multiple times.
I think Little girls wll have nightmares after seeing heri
Chrysalis is the best.
MM HMMM

Chrysalis seriously looks like a corpse
MMM HMMM
Discord is best villian, Sombra is worst
TAKE A BATH CHRYSAILS
MM HMM
woah
HAKU IS HERE. ALL SHOW BOW DOWN TO MY POWER- Oh hey, Chrysalis. Cool.
CrystalPhoenix all personal opinion~
celestia
"This is for Kids" … were 00s kids really this sheltered?
meh, dont like it when a show has changeling characters, it makes it a potential for cheap story twists
LOL
Also, I'm pretty sure every security system has a hole in it.
Hm...
I'M SO PUMPED FOR THE RETURN OF TRIXIE
It a succubus quick sing This Day Aria backwards!
Green eyessss
Greatest tactic ever by those changelings. BASH OUR HEADS INTO IT!
ok so who bet on sumi doing an all nighter? it's time to collect

Canadian_Brony, you're just clouding yourself in your safety place from the truth
MOSH
out of nowhere, all of a sudden this pony is changling
and for some reason no pony didnt want to look up

isnt that the same thing?
Wives controlling husbands are typical even in Equestria...
nooo
only five of them are chipping away at it.
