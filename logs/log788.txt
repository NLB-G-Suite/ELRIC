fluttershy*
rarity is thinking about maridge keep that in mind
boofire: she's just acting like we'd expect
Because anime.
They're all over 18.
dat hoodie <3
I vote all of them be 20 somethings
Fluttershy is the oldest
Yeah, they all have jobs, prolly file their taxes already, many are paying mortgages or whatever no?
she is all motherly
dont base their age because of their actitude
pls
it has nothing to do
This is amazing <3
XD
xD
/me applauds. Yaaaay~
I think Rarity isn't the oldest because of the age of her sister.
pinkie too
^o^
http://derpy.me/lhCTY :D
Pretty sure the Apple home is long-since paid for.
Rarity works her own store. Goodness knows she has to file a million taxes and expenses and deductions, oh gosh
I think the mane 6 are all teenagers
we dont even know if they pay for their housings
but yet, need to see a lot
*Raises lighters**Shizuka raises her fireplace*

They're adults at the very start of their adulthood.
Rarity has to file as an LLC

I had sympathy for trixie untill this episode
Saturn: hey
Saturn: can i add u
I actually enjoyed Trixie returning.
WHY
shaddup, trixie is awesome
Shes a fun character, lol
Not saying she isn't a good character
Well the fact trixie learned nothing from her first incident annoyed me
Pride does strange things, my friend
yeah its the first time we saw her limits actually
Well pride goeth before the fall
Her way of living was taken away from her, and she wanted revenge. O.o At least she 'sorta' apologized

Oh wow
All the cuddles :D

I could take it to school and play BO2 without a tv

11,02Time for a fun parteh \:D/
sadly you cant take the gamepad away from the Wii u to far
:I
On a Wii U?
darn
then I still cant talk to you...
Wait, can the Wii U support the microphone?
mmm
11,02yes
yes
Is the Wii U just the gamepad and like an add on to the wii?
Oh, it's on the Wii U now.
is that the MP412
?
Revolver? Really?
Its the executioner, i think it shoots shells
honestly, why are they saying hostile with weapon
like honestly
Maybe some hostiles carry kittens
Do you get something special if you use only the weapon you spawn with?
and by that I mean drugs
maybe they are only carrying spears or whips ... they dont specify
Maybe.
<:
Didn't you hear?
:I
he lurk, lurk, lurk
I lurk big-time

I had to be an asshole today on my TF2 server
I play on a micspam server, and we have a rule where you don't overspam

You lose or gain league points by winning or losing
I haven't been playing much of it though...
You're a tryhard Speccy.

You fag.
13HWAT!
13ding!
well, I'm out. Later
Well jobs was a mean boss, is the rumour on the street
At least he kept the cap on the shit company. Now it's just spilling everywhere.
At least Jobs didn't wanna sue every frekin person that opposed them.
Jobs wasn't in the legal dept. I think
I think they sued crazy things then too
Not as much as after he departed.
13CLOTHESLINED
no, but his economics and--legal dude took over as CEO didn't he?
Something like that.
11,02Because $18,000 goes a long way
I never liked how Apple buys things and says the made them...
13ramen works wonders
Apple has agressive echniques
11,02oni_link: People say that about their computers they built and that's perfectly acceptable.
the price anda gression is the only reason I don't like them
the machines themselves are ok, decent
my head hurts-
13it barely looked
13wat
Goaticorns demanded it.
The betreyal stings!
built as in home-built
automaticall assume Apple=best
There are good macs out there, just cost too much
yeah, the price and advertisement/marketing is the issue
*automatically
13wat
no that's just the point, they're the same
run fast
13THEREFORE FAIL
lol
yup
monopoly is very tupical of evil companies
if Apple can't own it, its dumb to them
Night Work? Have a good time? uhhhhh....uh oh
/me over dramatizes with evil laugh
or "illogical" or a "waste"
they just came to light and killed it off before it layed eggs
Only in 4.1
*laid
removing it is a mistake because of backwards compatability
you can still get the APK for it if you look around for it
but its pointless
perhaps
13PEGGY PAWNCH
11,02Apple is best visionary.

That was a shorter flight than expected
Patcher's being a pota :<
00,02Gold_Demona|cooking, it does that
00,02wobble wobble
00,10needs more duct tape
00,02also lost my main engine
O rly duct tape
00,02was not suposed to lose that
Duct tape fixes everything
00,02Fl00t4sh41, kinda needed that one though
00,02pony_624, far too many
mica have you seen my host name?
Say 5 games.
00,02so

i just want it cuz it works with doom
Lets do this
Next stop MUN
00,02those engines still dont want to stay still
and then...BANG!
00,02wobble wobble
A little jiggling don't hurt anyone
00,02this is not good
They only need to be stable long enough to run out of fuel
00,02so those are the wrong engines
D:
They worked, didn't they?
00,02i wont have enough fuel
00,02lost an entire tank
That way its not a problem if it snaps off
00,02Fl00t4sh41, the bottom tank exploded
A few explosions never killed anyone
I SEE IT
Wouldn't be any fun if nothing blew up on the way
00,02i'm running on fumes
00,02not sure how far behind the stream is
00,02the upper stage is full but i need that for landing
00,02weylinish|Blarg, woah, really?
yep
00,02was expecting more
Not gonna use a parachute to land?
