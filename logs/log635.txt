Tips to watching Gurren Lagann: 1) Skip Episode 4. 2) If you do watch Episode 4, pretend it never happened.

How do all these people know me
I haven't even been in manechat in...
/me thinks
evrypony knows me after like a month of being here
Something like a month?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13kBJb2VJgs Here's some Pony + SRW
Well, I've been here, but not really chatting.
me too
i've seen you here
I haven't /properly/ been here.
Mostly just pop in to say a word or two and forget all about this room.
Like when D-Wars got streamed.
well that rude
I still say we WMC D-Wars. It really does deserve it.
ERMHAGHERD
http://youtu.be/bt210ehYSk8
It takes /effort/ for a movie to reach that level of unwatchability.
d awrs is really bad
Not in my opinion, anyway.
they rifftrax trigun?
The first...three quarters of the film? Just plain unwatchable.
No, not Trigunn
it saved it in my opion especially the brian blessed
*Trigun
SECOND STAR TO THE NORTH AND STRAIGHHHHHTTT ONNNNNNNNNN XD
We're talking about D-Wars mainly, though Trigun is also awesome yes I saw it
yea, D-Wars was all over the place
Rifftrax is a bit of an acquired taste.
D-Wars, AKA Flashback The Movie
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLD3aqkGYWM&feature=channel&list=UL We need some music all up in this bitch.
oh wow
Bah
I actually may have liked it even /less/ with the Rifftrax.
sure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwGR8payUBc
wll gotta go
night qui ahh he gone
There was literally nothing to even make fun of in D-Wars. It was just bad.
back No Stream?
There were
/me thinks
Exactly two good moments.
Over an entire movie.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-tX9reTNno&feature=channel&list=UL
Pretty much, yeah.
Doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being terrible.
And the Rifftrax...I don't know why, but I couldn't like it.
Not my style of comedy, I guess.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtIOJT2Zju4
But still not as bad as Newborn Cuties.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMghvnqDhT8&feature=fvwrel
Either way, my point is, WMC D-Wars. The non-Rifftrax version.
And thus I've said my piece.
Sigh. This is boring.
Now I'm probably going to forget about this room for a while and, I dunno, go play HL2 or something.
I'mma go.
Bye~!
I might drop in later.
Goodbye, chatter.

Something is downloading 500kb/s :D
And before you lot begin to say that's crap. I live in the middle of nowhere
500 is my peak
05guess i shouldnt mentioned my average 8/mbps down?
guys, time to get out the torches and pitchforks
rable rable rable
05though when i torrent i can reach 30
I get 16 through Ethernet... And with my crappy router I get 2
Torrents have no limit
*oh dear god*
05yeah
when i torrent i do have the limit becasue 360kbs is the physical limit for the line in our region
05i know right?
05my line is capable of 100
05well
05its capable of 1000
Jeezus
05but its strangled to 100
that'S a lot of seeders with good internets there
05and really few services send past 10
well, officially my connection is 120 down and 10 up, but that stupid router limits it at 54 down...
think i should move to sweden
05unless its torrents
haven't seen anything above 1000 kbs for downloads here
If I could, I'd totally move to Wrek's street and lurch him
My line is also capable of 1000mbps, but it's constrained to 30 mbps up and and down.
:D really? hm... now I just have to find the money to fly to sweeden XD
My up is around 700kb/s
I don't do room mates, I'd just live in a seperate house
