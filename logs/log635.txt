Lyra! Get off the map! You'll die!
I'll be back too
yes because my lingustics unit is in maintenence
lets get ready to rumble
less exciting than the intro...
00,10man valcs got good range
Voices!
i gave him items that increase it :P
this statement is a lie
these mechs
Sumica I have a question
So... Umm... Why is this not localized?
It looks like fun.
Because Japan
00,10yeah Lil_B?
Hello Lil_B! :)
00,10CrossChop114 because licesing this game is a pain with all the freanchises in it
Oh.
bye guys,
Cya DoctoDoctorWho :)
The music's nice.
00,10it will probably never be just because Macross units
take care doc-- oh
I'm back. What did I miss?
what?
What are you playing?
Huh
Super Robot Wars Z
Sumica I was on a Brony Meetup last Saturday, and the guy who made it said he wanted to make an Convention (like GalaCon) in the future and that he already contacted people from other European Countries
I'm underweight and it makes me sad. :(
Caramel, you really like strategy RPGs, do you? :D
Yeah, SRW will never be localized.
Well, they tried releasing the OG games to test how well the games would fare well internationally. It was a commercial flop.
dafuq
Back.
Reikim: the GBA ones were localized
Back here as well.
no they weren't
MadSurge: By a doujin translator.
those were just fan translations
well, fan translated
Yeah
fanslated
Im still alive...
Sumica and I thought it might be a good Idea to search for more Supporters in other countries via Bronystate
AG is working on a translation for Alpha right now, but AG has been dead for a while.
/me wishes he knew Japanese on an almost daily basis.
Alive
so, is this like one of those extra hard missions?
it's the second to last mission
still haven't unlocked hard mode
Oh my gawd they updated yes
00,10so you are looking to advertise then Lil_B?
Romhacking is a lot of effort.
Sumica it will be a while until everything comes together, but I yeah, I want to know if I could try to advertise it and find supporters
oh hi Caramel
Lyra must have over 10,000 HP.
howdy
Gotta love AGTP
*100,000
Lil_B: what are you advertising?
Hm
Yeah, my chat's working
Hm
Rsparx what's up? c:
Shoopie doo, shoo shoopie doo!
00,10I would say talk to some of the admins on that when you have a write up and a plan as to what you are gonna do with this con
trollghost currently, nothing, but I'm helping on getting a bigger international Europeon Brony Convention together
It is, it's just quiet.
tsparx What's up? c:
where are you gonna host it Lil_B?
Oh, I had a chatderp in manechat.
near Denmark?
Just checking whether I'm good over here.
near dorset in the uk? (plz)
Sumica ok, who exactly are the Admins of bronystate? So far I always thought that most mods are equal
So are you now refilled on tea?
00,10well Caramel for one
Less likely to suddenly collapse onto your keyboard?
Ghosties is one iirc
trollghost right now nothing is set, it will be a while until I get more infos
Much less.
Lil_B, bigger than BUCK?

don't be coy
i was joking ;_;
CrimsonPeewee I honestly have no Ideahow it will be, I just offered to advertise it on bronystate to get more people from other countries
It would be a real stretch to consider Megas XLR a Real Robot series.
Sumica: chicks dig giant robots...
opps false alarm >> red matter stable
Lil_B, yeah that's pretty cool I admit
Well good luck with what you wanna doo and all
if were watching robots fight why does it show humans in the chat box

00,10why dose it have to be a real serise?
AI piloted robots
Hm
so is anyone here good at building in minecraft?
Masdragonflare: results?
i am
I need to make a pic of that now.
turns out I'm rainbow dash
:D
A Megas XLR campaign would have to be rewritten to have Kiva fighting in her own machine the whole time, with attacks that are original to the game, since the one mass-produced Earth mech that's seen at all, I don't even recall it fighting.
i built a complete replica of manehatten
Bunnies
Altough I didn't go for it
Hi bronies/ponies :) guess how many rainbowdashes i spawned on desktop ponies
hai Pikachu
Pikachu: Hello! 30?

Robot Mage? Screw logic!
Hey kirz
CrimsonPeewee well for a long time :/ (he spoke about possibly 2 years from now) I have my doubts about it, but I decided to help him anyway, he's a nice guy :)
Megas: outside of the premier, pure Super. Big Guy and Rusty: pure Super. Titan Maximum: politics exists, but only for the sake of farce. Otherwise pure Super
they wont even let you switch to the regular nirvash mode
i just wanted to see rainbows

CrossChop114 hey, theres robots with a surfboard, why not?
Meh.
Ô_ô

00,10so what's with the rainbow dynobots?
alexxm: not flashy enough
My CPU would melt with only 100. This laptop sucks.
interdimensional invaders
Appears he has disappeared.
To me, a Super Robot is a machine that's COMPLETELY unique fighting in an unconventional armed conflict with over-the-top techniques.
they're the main enemies of SRW Z2
Heh, Desktop Ponies does not wanna work *eye-roll*
the bosses in this map are trying to control them
/me hugs MadSurge (sry I didn't said hello when you did, but I was typing :( )
in the next mission, they'll find that is impossible
hheeeeyylol
tSparx: its ok
Lil_B: it's a-okay :)
tSparx: Did you download it right?
hai ponyromPR
The Silence of the Kirz.
hey
/me thinks i could put around 10000 derpys on my screen
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Well, what do you mean by "right"?

did you recruit some new pilots or they were just in holding?
I think it's funny how if you fall far enough, you fall on your face
It's funny that all the enemies' attack miss and if they do, they only do 1 hit point of damage.:D
luggen: We honestly don't talk much about drugs on here, and honestly, I don't like hash much.
*attacks*
In what?
Bye, Lil_B!
gw2
Ah
buffer...
Indeed.
bye Lil_B
nah, that's just when I have wall activated
bye Lil_B
I have yet to fall that far.
Beyond a certain point gravity seems to focus on your head and spins you into a faceplant.
I've had a couple of fall deaths because I misjudged a jump
tSparx i just think that it's kind of a part of our genereation :3
luggen: Drugs? Nonsense. I wish it were, 'cause then I'd have more people to deal with :P

CrimsonPeewee holy carp, sweet looking wallpaper

When you change your name on steam and it says on your account user gose by these names as well.. dose that mean you own dose names now as well and no one else can use them?
I think the programmers intended that, for fun.
overkill

cow334_gone, those name can be used and re-used
hello everypony did i miss enything

Two head mecha? Must be Go Nagai
CrimsonPeewee: Aaah okay so that mean some one else can use them as well?

luggen: I think you really underestimate how conservative a nation the USA is.
your login name is what counts
I have to finish my homework ahead of time so I have time to get ready for Brony Fan Fair.

The number 114 has been haunting me for my entire life.
CrimsonPeewee: What's wrong with the wallpaper?
AJIsAwesome|Homework, it's a fiery fluttershy
what the shit are we watching?
flutterchu: a game from the Super Robot Wars series, it's about various giant mecha series merging together :D
luggen, no it isn't
So... This is Fire Emblem with kickass, giant robots?
luggen: No it isn't.
CrimsonPeewee: So it's controversial because she's on fire?
mentallyeffedguy: see flutterchu's reply
I can't decide whether headcrab zombies are hilarious or depressing.

We all know what happened last time.:S
Albert_Einstein: Not gonna take the bait? Fine then. You tell me when you're ready to rap battle.
Turns out my brother is watching Mlp FOR THE FIRST TIME

the thing about religion is mostly to not start in religion battle in the community
irc has ignore commands
yay lets talk ponies
that's why we avoid the topic
but don't ask me, because I don't know

Obsidian, I'm so glad you can google games like The Nightfall Incident and World Builder and find them easily, but the BIONICLE games are actually pretty hard to find. Luckily there's a whole website of them. :D
ancientblood well at least the GBA version is
ancientblood: wait for a translation patch

AJIsAwesome|Homework, y u here instead of doing homework

Phase4 always worked for me

Phase4: You're right:O

Masdragonflare: too bad
ancientblood tell them to buzz off, unless they're woking on the house that is
ye xD

Masdragonflare: u gotta record it
6D:
I'm trying
Got carried away with the chatting. Whoops.:$
wth?
Shizuka: Do you mean roleplaying, or /me'ing, those are two different things, right?
it might be my dad working on the house
probably like 20 minutes
7Long time no see, C7
6Indeed :P
13I mean shit like licking or slobbering on people. Have some decency.
6:O
7well. speak. you know what I mean
:D
oh phoewie, the songs already stopped :s
why is this japaniese?
In again?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: That is why I am always up so late :S
Shizuka: I thought we wanted Thomas Edison to go away, not me glomping people in the third person. Will stop that too >_>
Sorry :c
6How are you both? :P
13Did I say glomping? No.
;_;
Dude, RP shit is happening AGAIN?
spartan133t because they think foreigners are evil
I have a carrot
Shizuka: Well then, can we be specific? I don't wanna accidentally step on a mod's toes :(
people abusing of RP
I thought we were done with that shit in May...
7I'm good.
7started listening to some green day, got nostalgic.
He just stopped skyping
Dken2021, the Japanese aren't xenophobic anymore.
inb4 /me is removed
6Heh ^^
almost had him on vid
impossible
:p
so just be smart about it, and use it sparingly
6How come you came here?
Why would you slobber on someone anyways?
indeed
i could not find trixie recolor so i did this http://i45.tinypic.com/6hix5k.png
7*shrug* thought you might trundle in.
/me thinks that not all /mes are RP
7I still miss this place in its heyday. a lot.
CK|GW2: i can think of some reasons... are you female?
/me hugs everypony
There's nothing I hate more than a vague rule, uncertainty leads to anxiety, I have enough of that in my life. But I'll deal with it anyway.
OBEY GRAPHICS CAT http://i.imgur.com/BAzwm.gif
they have to be vague otherwise assholes find loopholes
/me Hugs ancientblood back
13tSparx: The alternative is a full on hyperspecific set of rules that no one will read.
Caramel: hence the crisis back in May/June :p
/me hugs ancientblood
CrimsonPeewee: da faq?
13No one reads the current rules as is anyway, but it is a better method.
CrimsonPeewee: The cat keeps on getting closer to me
hello everybody
:o
/me hugs ancientblood
6Same..at least something's started around here again..It's not completely dead..
BloodyCupcakes: Hello!:)
your call on that
It just means I'm gonna have to worry about everything I do :/ But I guess I do that anyway, so *shrug*
So who is streaming?
We could Literally define RP down to the last term of what is allowed
ohai BloodyCupcakes
tSparx, you'll get warned before you're kicked, and kicking itself is more of a warning
Shizuka i think
nice name BloodyCupcakes 6_9
hi BloodyCupcakes? why would you chose that name? :'(
-_-
tSparx, dont worry so much, it doesnt make one happy
look at the pony in the corner
7I keep forgetting to come here.
kicking is a MUCH better warning than a regular warning
13It's not hard to behave
that should answer
rule 1 of cupcakes. we dont speak of cupcakes!
what's happening now? some asshammering dolphin smackers roleplaying again?
7I keep meaning to get back into the habit... *shrug* real life takes over.
yep
trigun <3 so far

6xD
Eli: i think he likes the fanfic cupcakes o_o

You know whats funny? The USA government considers Juggalos (Insane Clown posse fans) a gang, and so the place I go to will expell you if you wear any ICP gear. Also, no Rossery beads and several employees quite from Jobcorp because they refused to stop wearing their Freemason rings.
Aww shit, son!

I hate my computer

Klumzeedragon: and then they had gruntilda for unknown reason's soooooo edison is one of my favorite video game character's along with banjo and kazooie
man iwant that org 13 jacket :D

Aha!

tSparx: Yeah. He got it though. :D
ya pretty much
flutterchu, yes, yes, and yes.
Its still Alive
flutterchu: it'S RPG. You choose the attacks; Mostly because of graphics and music capabilities. You play as all those characters.
Bunny-Striker intresting :p
Caramel: Unlucked Super hard mode?
nope
It almost sounds like its time for a reinstall
Hey there Twilight_Sparkle_61 :)

Alister: it's non-sexual fanservice

AJIsAwesome|Homework: whole level over. These games are unforgiving
WHY does it need a UNIVERSE DESTROYING BOMB?
otakon: Because Anime
otakon: boredom
it doesn't, he's fighting to make sure bad guys don't abuse it
Sigh... I searched and searched but could not find that one song that's stuck inside my head. *flops in sadness* I'll get over it soon.

What gundam series?

BerryPunch has only kicked me 11 times

Klumzeedragon, remember that BerryPunch gets only a tiny fraction of the kicks
very VERy tiny
Oh wow, that's a nice opening theme
ValtheJean: I think your video component is busted
I'm working on it
Phase4: Yeah. Still amusing to check otakons kicks. :)
When did my kicks become a past time?

otakon, as soon as they started becoming funny
so
immediately
yeah, prety much
/me hugs otakon

FYI: this is an earlier save on an easier difficulty
Obsidian Thanks ^^
hey, no weed smoking in here

Bronysith Weed is not as bad as society is trying to make you thinbk you know :3
what..........whats wronge with your?
Can't stand weeds when they're in my garden :|
Phase4: a cutie mark of herself and her cutie mark would have a cutie mark of herself and that will have a cutie mark of her self it keeps going
luggen: no i tried it once, i much prefer reality
flutterchu, thats a fractal :P
Phase4: okay
All because of this fandom
Truth be told
Bronysith i prefer being high :) Cuz being high is more interesting than not being high :3
Phase4: like dis http://www.core.org.cn/NR/rdonlyres/A166EB14-E7FD-473F-98FB-741A9817540C/0/chp_triangle.jpg . i was actually going to make that my OCs cutie mark if i ever made one
It makes me pour them into my mouth.

such bullshit
Bronysith any responses to that?

or reading a book
well said
watch a movie
anime
Oh wow, aesop-kicked :D
i found out what color is a mirror thanks vsauce :$
dammit
luggen: response is simple: man up. who cares if someone hates you, if you did nothing wrong then its just them being douches. weed is just a cheap downhill escape
HAAAAAAAAAAX
Shield blocked EVERYTHING
WOW, ?????? HP.:O
and then Super Dimensional Beast
Well you might think so, but that thought only aplies to how you think people works, not how they actually works.
Phase4: huh worked for me. 6_9 It's the paradox list from Portal 2. :D
DAKKA!
Ellooo
no dakka?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: it's beyond 100000 hp, so yeah
It's needs to be about 20% more DAKKA.
Twilight_sprinkle i saw you talking to him as you logged in xD You're not a sencible voice, you're one of his friends "In a jury of his peers" Not friends of friends
luggen: lol XD youre drugs are making you sounds ridiculous
Twilight_sprinkle but i agree to the most part
*your
luggen: to be fair, twilight_sprinkle hates my guts
ValtheJean: is the final boss a Super Robot Wars OC?
So your going to try that scanning first tomorrow Cades?
yes
DashWithRainbows, you meen theres other ways to eat skittles?
luggen: indeed, id choke him in his sleep if i knew where he lived
Yes, actually.
ok, then my argument was invalid.
You can liquify them and inject them.

Well, you can just do what the commercials do, pick one at a time and eat it.
DYNAMITE EXPLOSION

She doesn't talk
Bronysith not jibberish :3 swedish (Basicly the same thing)

hai Pearly :)
Dynomite! Dynomite!

Brad_: Pet all the pretty ponies! LIKE A MAN! :O
Brad__: do not taint ponies with the failure that is the Kinect :F
:D
Ill accept ponies on any platform.
:P
best way to interact ponies is in dreams
so much fun
Twilight_sprinkle I appreciate the thought but i like the effect of it and since i'e been on it (Part time) För like 8 years already i cant see the problem :3 It's not like i have something to do tomorrow xD
Oh wow, look at all those enemy ships
unless your dreams involve zombies and slenderman <.<
Or a direct nural connection to the matrix for ponies.
Bronysith: At least you can control your dreams.
neural
I once had a dream that I was one of my OC villains. So awesome.
>kinect is a failure
>sold 18 million copies as of January 2012
I wish I could control my dreams. I haven't had a good sleep in months.
i had a dream where i kept drinking water. but it didnt quench my thirst
i was drinking liter after liter
and i was still thirsty
Bronysith: Must have been horrible
Ive had some pretty weird dreams.
Bronysith: That sucks.
luggen: your choice, but its not healthy, and you lose thinking ability when under the effect. the what you see under drugs is all fake, and you cant escape the truth that way
Bronysith I've had that dream D:
WHO IS BEST PPONY?!
a dog has to dream about banannas once in a while
I think they are due to watching mlp in bed for 2 hours a night.
Polydunami: but how many of those copies are used regularly/weren't returned? :D
luggen: like i care what a stoner thinks
^
pony_550: um that would have to be fluttershy i just dot know who's my second favorite pony
Bronysith: when i was about 5 or so, i had the same nightmare every night for three straight years
... People still bought it, MadSurge? :S
And that was the beginning of the year :P
My latest dream had me going to stores only to find out they were closed down or empty lots. Truely exciting.:P
Bronysith: Reminds of the scene from Constantine where a man kept drinking booze until he drowned in it, cause a demon put him under a spell.
luggen: i am sure you are a good kid/man just ditch the weed AND MAN THE FUCK UP
Twilight_sprinkle Check recent testing and you'll see that cannabis doesn't harm your brain that much :)
Polydunami: same goes for the other consoles though
ENOUGH
My little bro sold his for 25 dollars.
twilight_sprinkle: ouch
I guess so
I never realized how shitty my aim is in TF2 until now....
I am sick of this chat constantly devolving into stoner talks with insults
knock it off, NOW
Bronysith: Like i care about what you think
i didnt insult him
m
PillowPoni|TF2: and yet you're having fun, right? :D
luggen: "that much" <- id say thats bad enough
Bronysith: Feel good? Nice reponse?
PillowPoni|TF2: You arent the only one. Im pretty bad too. :D
hi everyone :(
LOL stoners watching MLP that just must blow their minds.
CCCP: Hello!
Brad__: lol
Hey CCCP! Something wrong?
Welcome back CCCP. :)
I'm awful at aiming. That's why I play Medic.
please dont say hi :s
CCCP: Feeling better?
MadSurge: Yep :3 But my shit aim isn't cool when I get to play MvM for the first time
Twilight_sprinkle Less than smoking ciggarettes
hi cc- ok i wont say hi O.o
Bronysith: WHAT?!
I love TF2 pony spray spam.
Bronysith: awesome
Klumzeedragon: I suck even as Medic :3 That's pretty bad. God forbid I have to melee

hi AJIsAwesome|Homework MadSurge and Klumzeedragon hi twilight_sprinkle MadSurge Yes, AJIsAwesome|Homework NO
who do you think should be my second favorite pony derpy or sweetie belle or trixie or rainbow
Diamond Tiara, flutterchu :D
AJIsAwesome|Homework: zero i guess
luggen: that doesnt really change anything, its still bad
CCCP: something we can do to make you fell better?
*feel
Bronysith: he had the helm on?
yup
PillowPoni|TF2: :P I'm a pretty decent medic in the healing aspect. But I cant aim with his weapon. and I too fail at melee.
Bronysith: You know what Zero looks like, right?
yup
Polydunami: T_T no
cool, zero then
Twilight_sprinkle yeah but would you have this conversation if i said "I'm just back from ttorching a fag"
MadSurge nope
Klumzeedragon: Fail Medics, unite <3 /)
Awww :S
Melee is where I'm best at.
ill just say sweetie belle is my second favorite pony
PillowPoni|TF2: But that's why I have pony mods to make everything more interesting! xD (\
If I ever cosplayed, I would cosplay as Zero from Code Geass. :$
luggen: that depends, and doesnt really make sense
if i ever cosplayed id just but on a lab coat and be done with it
http://i.imgur.com/F0AZH.jpg
Klumzeedragon: I can't download mods atm. I'm using my sister's laptop and she doesn't know I have TF2 on it :3
That's brittish for igniting the tip of a ciggarette and then smoke it :)
ded
Bronysith: wow that looks very good
twilight_sprinkle: the helmet cost him 500$
Bronysith: THAT'S AWESOME.:O
And since that more dangerous why do ppl care about Weed?

Gonna spend a couple minutes loading that pic...
3.5MB
Well, I'll be starting my mom on Macross 7 tonight.
minutes ?
moooooop
Bye MaSurge
MadSurge*
A couple minutes.
Yep.
ouch
Netflix ruined my first Gurren Lagann experience. It skipped over an entire episode and when I got to the next one, I had no idea what was going on. But, I rewatched the whole anime and it's still awesome.
My current DL speed is somewhere below 0 kb/s.
I mean
Below 1
Close enough to 0 as makes no difference.
because ?
I have no bloody clue, to be honest with you.
MLP Slater stop kicking my flank in SSX :l
complain to your isp
Tips to watching Gurren Lagann: 1) Skip Episode 4. 2) If you do watch Episode 4, pretend it never happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daB2y9kh1Ec WHOA
Oh hey Reikim!
How do all these people know me

evrypony knows me after like a month of being here
Something like a month?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13kBJb2VJgs Here's some Pony + SRW
You kidding? I'm pretty sure I've seen you logged in, Reikim :S
Well, I've been here, but not really chatting.
me too
Reikim I've seen you around sometime
i've seen you here
I haven't /properly/ been here.
Mostly just pop in to say a word or two and forget all about this room.
Like when D-Wars got streamed.
well that rude
I still say we WMC D-Wars. It really does deserve it.
ah, busy with another room huh?
ERMHAGHERD
http://youtu.be/bt210ehYSk8
It takes /effort/ for a movie to reach that level of unwatchability.
d awrs is really bad
TRIGUN WHY YOU SO AWE#OSME?!
I love that anime
Reikim: DMC Rifftrax as well?
Because Vash is the best technical pacifist?
Nope
Rifftrax couldn't save it.
Not in my opinion, anyway.
they rifftrax trigun?
The first...three quarters of the film? Just plain unwatchable.
No, not Trigunn
it saved it in my opion especially the brian blessed
*Trigun
Reikim: did you see my pic with tara strong?
SECOND STAR TO THE NORTH AND STRAIGHHHHHTTT ONNNNNNNNNN XD
We're talking about D-Wars mainly, though Trigun is also awesome yes I saw it
They streamed D-War here, Pearly ;A;
Seriously, though, Rifftrax couldn't save it. It just couldn't.
Reikim: what about the game of thrones cosplayers?
yea, D-Wars was all over the place
Although to be honest I don't like Rifftrax to begin with, so I'm probably biased.
Rifftrax is a bit of an acquired taste.
D-Wars, AKA Flashback The Movie
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLD3aqkGYWM&feature=channel&list=UL We need some music all up in this bitch.
oh wow
Reikim: it was better with Rifftrax
Bah
damn Val went to bed huh?
I actually may have liked it even /less/ with the Rifftrax.
otakon: want to see teh game of thrones cosplayers i saw at dragoncon?
sure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwGR8payUBc
I mean, it's a bad movie to begin with, makes you want to go and do something more useful with your life.
wll gotta go
night qui ahh he gone
And then you add the Rifftrax, and suddenly there are these guys rambling in your ear and making media references and generally being distracting.
well that was quick of quick thinker
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzsqx5uXmpA How about a bit of retro music? :3
There was literally nothing to even make fun of in D-Wars. It was just bad.
not retro enough http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_B5LlbM6bA
back No Stream?
Reikim: sure there was, you were there
nope, and welcome back you
thelonepony: eeyup, Val stopped
Yes I was, otakon, and I left for a good chunk because it was just bad.
There were
/me thinks
Exactly two good moments.
Over an entire movie.
Reikim: THe car hitting the bad guy and the old woman with the fence?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-tX9reTNno&feature=channel&list=UL
Pretty much, yeah.
Doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being terrible.
And the Rifftrax...I don't know why, but I couldn't like it.
Not my style of comedy, I guess.
So yeah, D-Wars was a bad experience.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtIOJT2Zju4
But still not as bad as Newborn Cuties.
at least Craig Robinson made it sorta meh ( the black guy btw)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMghvnqDhT8&feature=fvwrel
Either way, my point is, WMC D-Wars. The non-Rifftrax version.
And thus I've said my piece.
Goodbye for now Bronystate. I take my leave!
take care Klumzeedragon
bye Klumzeedragon
Sigh. This is boring.
Now I'm probably going to forget about this room for a while and, I dunno, go play HL2 or something.
See you Klumzeedragon!
I'mma go.
Klumzeedragon: Bye!
See Ya Klumzeedragon
Bye~!
I might drop in later.
Goodbye, chatter.

MASF123: who is best pony?

twilight is best pony
Pinkie Pie
CCCP: tried to join his game, but steam is pissing me off
MASF123 *hugs*
MASF123: /)
I heard a voice.
:o
:I
now im disappionted so screw it
I was thinking of joining the game. I even closed out of PSO2. But I figured I'd launch TF2 before asking for the address. Now my client's loading and the server is full.
Reikim, thats gona take a while to process
Ooh, you finished?
youre much of a voice clip spammer........(no offense)
yeah
is carmel streaming
It's a bit of a heavy one
cow334: yes.
...I don't know why I've lost my fighting spirit or just spirit...
thanks AJIsAwesome|Homework
But it's by and far my favourite of everything I have read.
IDK self-esttem gone.
esteem
MASF123 why?
Good, yes?
I DON'T fucking know.
self esttem is for people with no self esttem
this is still my fave http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22329/Pinkie-Watches-Paint-Dry
Reikim, but that was good
CCCP: esteem
But I wish I did. It could be a supressed memory or something.
Bookmarking that one too.
i'm not entirely sure what happened, will take time to think it through
XisBestChemical and spelling is For naughty sheep
I do know I am a little unhinged.
Axieious or whatever
oh boy
/me is sad.
Anxious
XisBestChemical :C
I need something to calm me down.
Take the stress off.
MASF123 morphine
/me is sad because he is for naughty sheep.
Lol. Wut.
MASF123: I suggest Fluttershy
XisBestChemical: ....
XisBestChemical sowwy
No otakon I don't clop.
/)_0
MASF123: no you idgit
By all means.
/me is just trolling. Badly. I think he regrets it now.
/me ponders the difficulties involved in raising the self esteem of those he does not know...
Wots all this then, otakon?
I'll be honest, to this date, I'm still not entirely sure how it ended.
MASF123: Make a paper airplane go out side and throw it
And that's part of why I like it.
Trolling can get you banned here, btw.
...thats what cheers me up all the time
cow334 how will that help?
otakon: you misspelled digit
MASF123 u troll
woot woot ^^ :)
CCCP I'm not a troll.
MASF123: Sorry. Won't do it again.
SafariMonkey: I was spelling the slang prounciation of idiot
MASF123 you said trolling gets you banned, it doesnt! Just read the rules
otakon: sorry should have added :P
MASF123: Well it's something you created and when you throw it and whatch your creation go into this wonderful thing it makes you feel like you can do something
woot woot
And do even more for the furture to come
XisBestChemical, you can use the >_> emote if you want to lie though.
Kthnx
what is code for emote
cow334, never thought about through your perspective.
> _ >
XisBestChemical you must first pay $5 for a premium account..
Upgrades that increase your survivability, like resistances and health on kill, should be top priority for a pyro
o
Whats that sopossed to mean
._.
I don't have a job yet.
CCCP Shut the hell up. :D
in case nobody noticed, that was an impersonator earlier, clever troll they are not
MASF123 :P
XisBestChemical: Just click the little smiley face on the side of the chat bar for a list
XisBestChemical jk
XisBestChemical: Are you using flash?
yes
Just do what Obsidian said.
MASF123: Well did thaat help anything?
ima switch to iris
XisBestChemical, you can also use > _ > just remove the spaces.
i like Burkas everyone should wear them
nvm
or < _ < for <_<
<_<
they make everyone attractive
>_>
poker face is best face
cow334 not really...but it was an interesting thought.
/me gives MASF123 a brohoof for helping him out. Thanks MASF123!
oh well thanks MASF123
I really like monocles. Don't really know why.
ok...? /)
...
MASF123: /)*(/
I'll be back later
monocles on burkas are hot
MASF123: upside- down hoof is best hoof
i like the fezz. fezzes are cool
Livin' it up in the Hotel Craftifornia
DoctorWhooves fezzes fall off it would seem
That was close........
AJIsAwesome|Homework: Hotel Craftifornia is best parody
Backwards brohoof is like this (\/) zoidberg is the only capable of doing it
Question how long do you play video games for?

DoctorWhooves: deliberate misspelling?
http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/31400000/Like-a-sir-random-31497073-500-388.jpg Hilarious.
flutterchu: Not everything
flutterchu: Only certain things cost money.
CCCP: nah som have straps
flutterchu: You have a smaller inventory and can't craft hats, but you can find those from drops anyway so it dosen't really matter.
DoctorWhooves oh
flutterchu, no I remeber Sumica discussing a $0.99 dogtag for TF2.
SafariMonkey: oh you cought that
i hate the animal kingdom it has no plants in it :(
Shizu's hair is really fun to draw, for some odd reason.

Latencey: NOOOOOBBBB
Or simply put, try something out of your comfort zone.
SuperBrony64

Funny story, though: boobs was something I had real issues with when I started drawing.
did you know youtube videos play faster on your iphone than on the computer?
pokemon
GTA
pokemon
XisBestChemical: All the games I played, TBH.
Both because of personal awkwardness and the fact that they're, well, strange to draw.
XisBestChemical ET
...
I'm never quite sure of the physics involved.
MASF123: i think it just numbs pain
XisBestChemical: Fable: The Lost Chapters
I say pokemon
or Super Man 64 ... >_>
AJIsAwesome|Homework: I agree with his comment.
pony_7007 numbs pain?
but then I lived abroad, only got games when they were like 4 years old
Is there a TF2 fluttershy mod as well?
well pokemon and sonic 2
Like what ?
Pokemon and Legend of Zelda
MASF123: both physical and emotional
i found r34 of tetris today
NEIN CAT ROCKS
oh and any early sonic game
pony_7007 should I try it?
CCCP: :S
Yes
CCCP: Gross.
CCCP didn;t think that was possible to pull off, but ok
:3
CCCP LOL SAME HERE
tetris porn
wow ummm
ohai regulars
MEOW!
I played so many games, it's hard to single out a single one. I remember that Chrono Trigger was the first game that I fell asleep playing. Final Fantasy VI was the first RPG I completed (and still the only Final Fantasy I completed).
I'll never understand why
im a medic, ask me questions
:D
MASF123: no, it only works temporarily
oh. :/
Yoshi's Story was the first game I fell asleep playing.
what about r34 pong?
is that even a thing
Then I found out my dad left me in the basement in the dark.
/me chat and Michael Clarke Duncan are dead, this makes Ish sadder :(
Let's drop the R34 stuff.:S
Imagine how scared I was.
SafariMonkey: DO IT FILLY
We weren't dead a couple minutes ago.
I kept tripping over stuff
Well there's not much for me lefy in this world. :(
r34 r34
alexxm: R34 knows no bounds
Less.
it looks like this
WindWhistler: Do you remember the dog?
43
AJIsAwesome|Homework: .........
4R3
Addendum: who is Michael Clarke Duncan?
WindWhistler: The spotted one in 2-1.
hmm
Reikim he played John Coffey in the Green Mile
nyannyannyannyannyannyan
apparently ponies smell like peaches
Never seen it.
Rule 34: If it exists there is porn of it. No exceptions. <--*insert emphasis here*
AJIsAwesome|Homework: ....that had nothing to do with what I said.
I feel like crap day after day and just want to give up an everything, not even enjoy anything in life.
SuperBrony64: you there?
I prefer Rule 85
I just don't know what went wrong
Rule 85: If it exists, there is a pony version. No exceptions.
WindWhistler: You were talking about Yoshi's Story, right?
Oh that I've seen, though it's been years.
Kandarihu: state it
this guy http://i.usatoday.net/life/_photos/2012/09/03/Michael-Clarke-Duncan-dies-fiancee-says-59272DUI-x-large.jpg
brb
AJIsAwesome|Homework: All I said was that I fell asleep while playing it.
What the hell is rule 85
MASF123: nothing,thats just life
WindWhistler: Nvm.
And that wasn't even the main thing I was talking about....
XisBestChemical: took me that long to find http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/115008/Rule/
Rule 86 there are always funny brony hate threads on /b/
Yeah, can't say I really know him.
not explicit enough?
Rule 85: If it exists, there is a pony of it. No exceptions.
and thus a meme was started
SafariMonkey porn is against the rules
CCCP: sorry
Shutting down for the night. Goodnight everypony.
CCCP: it wasnt really porn
Kandarihu I thought that was Rule 34.2
No rule about dubstep remixes of everything... on the TV Tropes list... yet
CCCP: I'm just as guilty as I goaded him to do so.
RougeFlutter yus it was it
i dont think the mods care
CCCP: I would never post anything explicit really, that was tounge in cheek
SafariMonkey i know :P
CCCP: But you have people who do, though.
I'm calling it in early feel so shit right now.
R34-B is second best rule
AJIsAwesome|Homework i dont have people, and hows your homework going?
hey MASF123, do you think it would be alright if i gave you a brohoof before you go?
MASF123: Night! hope you feel better.:(
you can if you want.
R34-B if it exists. Theres a pony of it
YES!
MASF123: /)
/)
CCCP: I finished it.:)
I mean... (\
AJIsAwesome|Homework oh :D
ok see you. :/
cachi01|phone: r34-P?
:(
There we go.
oh b for brony?
SafariMonkey actually its B but yeag P also works
i miss my pen when using a mouse and anything even remotly close to paint
I'm just popping in to say my cat is a fucking whore. She's trying to get laid right next to me, but the male cat's too short to reach the hole. Friggin' retard.
Rule 64: If it exists, Tony Stark was able to build it in a cave with a box of scraps
Enjoy your night.
Hey would Never Ending Story be an A movie?

nu, fluttershy is worst poni
05,159,3 How dare you badmouth Colgate!
For Celestia's sakes! Where in the hay is Fluttershy?!
Scootaloo and Applebloom Overated?

What about Doctor (W)hooves?
05,15I liek da green. But I feel like that's cheating on my old colors
Oh
Hey flutterchu
The Doctor can not be overrated
*fluttercry
[21:57] <cachi01|phone> Scootaloo and Applebloom rated? [ftfy] :)
Don't make fluttercry again.
You won't like her when she's angry.
:3
I think white/red will understand if you yet it down easily fluttercry
Yeah, those colours are kind of high-maintenance.
mitamaking: yeah, thought he was conspicuously absent. I don't think so either
it's not that stable when you mistake my name from fluttercry
hey guys 0_o is that dash? :D
Kind of emotionally made of glasswork.
Fluttercry are you Phase4 now?
flutterchu: tab fail. I'm not used to having another flutter- on chat.
Somepony become Fluttershy and shut the RDs up please
o_O
05,15You see, white/red is the kind girl next door. She's not a knockout but she's cute and cool. That green is like the super sexy girl that you fantasize about, but she's not that great once you get to know her
Always go for the former, I say.
So Black Cat and Mary Jane?

It's best if you go for the former.

Nothing
Bucking idiot

I prefer electroswing or EDM

well i'll just buy me a duke nukem throne chair and sit in it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8 How about the full version? :3
JRPHONE gah, I got nothing. Dubstep is good if you weed out the ones you like, but otherwise I'd vote for it as my least favourite overall
Dubstep isent a genre
/me gives Shizuka a spreckled muffin.
yes it is
It's 2 in one
I'd say the same, but with Rap.
I wubs me some 1812 Overture :3
JRPHONE -_^

Polydunami there we go. Can't stand rap.

Canadian_Brony, laptop, fortunately it has a usb 3 port
Hi Tom
Phase4 - you referring to bandwidth caps?
MirrorImage, yeah

Phase4 can I visit you?
Tom, when is the next pony episode? :3
eh, we have them floating around here in the states
JRPHONE, not giving you my address :P
Why
that's half the reason why people hate Comcast
Is that not how it works?
MirrorImage, yeah but you also have optic fiber
(the other half simply being that their connections SUCK)
:kickcount Tom
and that just makes it worse
Silver_Spoon, berrypunch is offline
because now you can blink through 200GB in the span of a week
Phase4: Ah, I see. Thanks
Phase4 make a party bot
Silver_Spoon :|
...maybe not a week
Phase4 blessed curse. Portable hard drive would be my only suggestion now.
is it like dead silent in there?
MirrorImage, *cough* day *cough*

BerryPunch is down

Then again, I was the one who linked the overture in the first place :$

If it was closer to DnB, it'd be more likeable to my ears.
one heck of a radio.
IKR?
No one ever gets the message, though, so lots of dubstep artists go fff all the way :D
pfft, dubstep
13dubstep really is just noise
^
noise sometimes played over an actual piece of music
Then again, so do most rock bands :S
IE Zeldastep
dubstep = farting transformers
13like let's take this synthesizer, feed it random static from cosmic background radiation, and see what comes out and be international superstars
sounds 'bout right
13i latched onto trance because it actually has a melody :)
still better than rap.

13http://youtu.be/Opxrm1sEQEM
I love stuff like Electroswing and EDM because it isn't just noise. They actually take time and put real instruments in the music. I've heard strings, various percussions (not limited to a drum kit), and brass.
i guess that's why i'm a sucker for ELO
Armin Van Buuren <3
classical/orchestral music is best music

hello, Sabershy.

Man, so I decided to by Guild Wars 2.
I have never bought a PC game before, so I was excited.
Turns out my computer didn't have the specs to play it.
:|
13wa wa waaaa
ouch
I know that feel
Still no stream?
That's the main reason I don't buy games.
nnope
That and my internet sucks.
Obligatory game music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_14Xf_j_C5o&hd=1
I want to learn how to play this.
It's easy, Creeper; just go up to unsuspecting players and EXPLODE :D
Polydunami: lolol I meant the song :3
In fact, I have that album. Suuuuch preeeety sooooongs
Oh -_(\ me
/me pats Polydunami on the back and hugs him/her "It's okay"
No worries :D
Ihop that was hilarious
Shizuka: kay, so far, I love the song. Nothing beats a good trance.
Last time I checked, Creeper, I was male.
The next time you check, however...
My username is ambiguous in that regard :S
This is pretty awesome: http://derpy.me/0XMnV
... No, don't think I'll ever change my sex :3
... But is it playable, Creeper? :D
Creeper - now you just program a large 2d6 display off the side of the map and play
Polydunami: Apparently so
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttUDcgKz-as&feature=player_embedded
Polydunami: I feel your pain. Sabershy oozes female. :\
13http://i.imgur.com/vDjse.jpg
The Monopoly board makes me cry on the inside a little bit. Because I know I'd never be able to make something that awesome
with a worldedit program, you could
Shizuka hey, it's Meanwhile if he were a cat.
Shizuka, Meanwhile the cat
Canadian_Brony, /)
Phase4 /)
Oh, did I sound like I was lamenting? I like it when people don't know exactly what my gender is :D
Shizuka; Meanwhile as a cat. This is official.
13better save it
And then when they DO find out...
I'll PM it to him next time I see him
Already saved
13also worldedit makes something like that trivial
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjlBCAx6330
13just convert to the lowest resolution pixels you can and paint
IF worldedit worked
I shall Skype him that picture when I talk to him
But Sabershy, your name has Saber in it. That's boyish to me :P
:)
/me is a female
13http://youtu.be/uAdx5se6Z1A got a random comment on one of my old builds the other day
I have only been confused for being female, once.
Polydunami: Not when you have this in your mind when you thing of Saber --> http://www.ultima-i.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/10083388a.jpg
Shizuka - i suspect he's from bronystate...
Oh yeah, THAT Saber
And I still can't believe that I was.
i checked his Feed, and he's commented on a video regarding... THAT lyra plush
13would make sense
THAT Lyra plush will not be spoken of again i hope
course, he's also commented on Gangnam Style, so i might have a misweighted sample
Gangnam style......
NO
DO NOT WANT
/me goes for his knife
Shizuka?
Then again, Saber never sounded like a girl's name to me, Sabershy :S
13yup
Plus, never played Tsukihime :P
that's a perfect OP-OP-OP-opportunity to troll him
13nah
/me 13is more srs with her accounts and reputation
Or was it Fate/Stay Night? Either way, I've never played those ones :P
Polydunami: True dat. Its on the internet, where anime is more known that people think I am being a girl for using Saber. I have more male points on everything else though. :P
And its Fate/stay night. :)

13and pretty meh since damon and greengrass exited the project
when the actor for the main character wants out you know its time to stop
well, we know, aparently they dont
13i know for some things like the silly spiderman reboot it's a case of the studio trying to hang onto the rights
What the hay is Phoenix Down?
13raise dead in potion form
Ah.
Creeper, final fantasy item
i should play one of those games sometime
I've never played a Final Fantasy game in my life.
/me braces for shitstorm
phoenix down is a potion? in ff7:cc i thought it was justa phoenix feather
meh, does it matter?
heck, the most FF i've played is about 1 hour past the end of disc 1
http://www.xkcdb.com/?22 XD
Creeper: sorry, im out of shitstorms atm. we get a fresh delivery in the morning tho
learn something new every day
twilight_sprinkle: Don't worry, I'll be back in a few hours so have your pitchforks and torches ready! :D
yay, new math knowledge and potential squirrel jokes
Creeper: nah ill be sleeping at the time
hey Phase4 how would you like the not-at-all exclusive chance to solve a spring physics problem for free?
twilight_sprinkle, meh, why not
Alright, everypony. I am going to bed. See you tomorrow. :)
/me fetches his physics book
bye Sabershy
Sleep well, Sabershy
nite Sabershy
Phase4: A 1050 kg car carrying four 82 kg people travels over a rough "washboard" dirt road with corrugations 4.0 m apart which causes the car to bounce on its spring suspension. The car bounces with maximum amplitude when its speed is 16 km/h. The car now stops, and the four people get out. By how much does the car body rise on its suspension owing to this decrease in weight?
twilight_sprinkle - ambiguous question. is the car's starting weight =1050+4(82) or is the 4(82) previously accounted for?
interesting
Phase4: i solved by finding speed, then finding period of one oscillation which is speed/4m, then found k by omega=sqrt(k/m) then used f=kx=mg
Phase4: but the stupid thing says ive got a wrong answer :I
twilight_sprinkle - refer to my previous question then
i'm not sure how to solve this but yeah, have to go via the oscilation
MirrorImage: hmmmmm...
that might've been it
MirrorImage: good point
MirrorImage, 4 * 82KG
MirrorImage, its a sum
MirrorImage: ill need to redo the calculations from scratch then <.< but thanks though, i hope thats the problem
if that is the issue i will be amazed
twilight_sprinkle, and you should complain if thats the issue
Phase4 - right, but the phrasing was ambiguous enough that it was the immediate thing i picked out of it
sigh, if it werent 3.24 am
even if i didn't have a bloody clue how to solve it
find the oscilation, then solve for the spring's force
MirrorImage, the details of the corrugation wont matter much
zzzzz
/me tucks MirrorImage into bed
is anyone streaming right now?
not that i know of
better question might be "is anyone still awake?"
nop
OH NO MATH, EWWWW
Well, I just woke up
...seeing as that question was asked 10 minutes ago, i'm half tempted to put a spider on your shoulder just to see what happens MadSurge
MirrorImage: chat half derped
you're using the bronystate chat client, yes?
13kssh paging miss muffet, miss muffet to the tuffet please kssh
Also do that to my brother, he hates spiders :D
MadSurge: and it was a physics problem, not math :P
*blink blink* https://www.xkcd.com/1052/
that 8th panel... is that a Moonstuck reference or was Moonstuck referencing that?
or is there another reference i'm missing altogether?
13underwater basketweaving?
yeah
13i think it's just a common phrase for "useless major"
ah, so i am just missing a reference there
look at that, xkcd taught me something
13it's one of those phrases you know from pop culture but couldn't actually pin it down to a source if you tried
MirrorImage: ha, I see no criticism of interpreting majors! :D
.
alright, 3:45am and i have work tomor-... today <_<
daheck am i still doing up?
13http://youtu.be/pRexBMPeRTo
Phase4: still says wrong answer <.<
twilight_sprinkle, hmmmm
Phase4: for the last step i just do 4*m(of one guy)*g/k=x
the question uses relations i'm not aware of
by my current understanding i'd need the spring coefficent and its length at rest
05hmm
Phase4: well the last question is just from mg=kx
05stream up?
Phase4: i found the spring coefficient, dont think i need the length
13go gogo
13while i sleep sleep sleep
05so yeah
05i got a cup o tea and osem entertainment
Phase4: im not sure if i can just do mg=kx for the masses of just the people who got off, i dont remember if thats right
Huzzah~
Stream incoming? :)
05yes
Hooray!
yay Wrek stream!
twilight_sprinkle, whats k and x?
Phase4: k is spring coefficient and x is displacement. but i forgot if x is always from equilibrium point or can it be used in relative points, like from x1 to x2
:O
More Eddie! :$
Yay for Eddie
twilight_sprinkle, so you want the differential of mg/k
MadSurge: what is Eddie?
NocturnalBlade: Eddie Izzard
morninng everypony
oooo...moo
Hello SirGanjalf!
hi SirGanjalf
Hello SirGanjalf
whats on
Phase4: i guess. i just did kx=mg by neutons 2nd, but im doubting now if i can do that by just counting the masses of humans and not the car
Ihop: Eddie Izzard narrating some document, i guess
oh cool

Late hai, Serenity.
Chrome is misbehaving today :/
Hey Ninjazz! :$
Ohey, MadSurge!
/me glomps Serenity!
hahaha yeah i know, its great XD
Oh, me messed up there. Hitler was a teetotaller also. And he didn't smoke. wait... Vegetarian, didn't smoke, didn't drink-- huge bastard. I drink smoke AND eat any meat I can find... and I'm a nice guy. This means something.
Kencolt, means nothing
lol
does too
XD
Kencolt: Hitler ate sugar?
I do one of those things, what does that mean?
i only eat meat so that must be the decideing factor
wirisme: you're halfway from a funny mustache
Kandarihu can you cite any sources for that statement to back it up?
05there there Mutterguy
I better get some beer then
hittler Mutterguy aint you lisnen
hahaha
Mutterguy, what? That being unlike Hitler in completely irrelevant ways makes one morally superior to the 3rd worst mass murderer in the 20th century?
you dont need sorces with hittler
Send attack dogs after her XD
:D
XD god attack the queen
Why dont people like this guy? he is awesome
Panda: theyre scared of different things
Holy crap
Something is downloading 500kb/s :D
My internet is behaving today
thats awesome Serenity :P
god attack the queen send big dogs after her that bite her bums
Serenity: 500? you lucky bastard
i'm happy if i have my full 360
And before you lot begin to say that's crap. I live in the middle of nowhere
500 is my peak
05guess i shouldnt mentioned my average 8/mbps down?
ouch Wrek
/me slaps Wrek
bad wrek
guys, time to get out the torches and pitchforks
Wrek beat you~ 16~
rable rable rable
witchhunt? I love witchhunts
My dad lives in the next town over with a 6/mbps down
oooh we goin on a strike? i ll get the spoon
Wrek, I hear Sweden has really good internet, and it was the best in the world at one time.
05Panda? oh really what services?
Kandarihu: Still is
05casue steam never goes past 5
Wrek Cox Cable ^^
05though when i torrent i can reach 30
I get 16 through Ethernet... And with my crappy router I get 2
Torrents have no limit
Serenity, AFAIK, Japan has the best internet now.
torrents are dependent on the seeders internet XD
*oh dear god*
Wrek wait 30mb/s torrenting? O-o
05yeah
when i torrent i do have the limit becasue 360kbs is the physical limit for the line in our region
least i think so
thats some psycho upload speed from those seeders Wreky
05i know right?
05my line is capable of 100
05well
05its capable of 1000
Super internet is a another reason why I wanna move to Sweden
Jeezus
05but its strangled to 100
yeah you send me to bed jealous of that fact last night Wrek XD
that'S a lot of seeders with good internets there
05and really few services send past 10
well, officially my connection is 120 down and 10 up, but that stupid router limits it at 54 down...
think i should move to sweden
05unless its torrents
haven't seen anything above 1000 kbs for downloads here
Wrek need a roomate? XD
05in a year I will <3
I wish Google Fiber would work on expanding. 1gig ups and down
If I could, I'd totally move to Wrek's street and lurch him
:D really? hm... now I just have to find the money to fly to sweeden XD
05would cost me 2400$ for tickets to NYC so
Stupidly enough, I have better up than down
My up is around 700kb/s
alright everybody, fight to the death for the divine roommate-slot. projectile weapons are prohibited, everything else is go
Wrek double that for me... since I would ahve to go from San Diego which is the opposite side of the US XD
I don't do room mates, I'd just live in a seperate house
05miss otu on rent
05and you'll pay back in different manners~
I did a room mate once. She was quit good.
Wrek: Sex? :3
quite*
05Serenity mebbeh
Wrek: live with me i has vacent place
this intrigues me :3
If I was female, I wouldn't really mind >_>
SuperBrony64: u liek it?
11,02Yesh
05Serenity: why thank you
isnt this that guy in that rocky picture show
Hm... I am not female, but I would have to ok it with the wifey XD
05its not tim curry
Probably the only thing wrong with my ISP is that it's a bit pricier than Comcast, and there's no IPv6 support.
:)
And with that, I must go maek TOAST
no the motercycle guy
Serenity give me some!
ok i will play gmod 13 now
05its not meat loaf either
oh Wrek, may I ask ya something?
05sure
oh yeah that was meatloaf
*looks at Panda's name* *Remembers adverts* uhh, sure
SuperBrony64: dat like
:)
wanna race in FONV?
05nope
Serenity O_o never say no
05i enjoy my own plasystyle jsut fine
Wrek D: Fine then!
:3
Wrek wait, you ahve all the DLC, right?
05mhm

05gotta beat it

Small pony?

Hi therainbowvortex
What's everypony doing.
WEARING SKIN PAJAMAS.
failing my kanji reviews while listening to this
I hope.
Hey Dusty
Hiyo therainbowvortex
mfw Wrek was actually making lemon water and not some joke for going to the bathroom.
Hiya.
Wrek: who take's picture's of drink's http://www.thirstydudes.com/files/uploads/drinks/18c280059cf65945277e6b8983075a7e.jpg
/me claps again
Hey, Dusty.
whats with the wom- ma- oh god i dont know what it is
What's with the red?
dafuq.
05Ninjazz: i spiked it with some vodka too
I love Eddie Izzard
Oh even better! :D
finally
I didn't even know they had a IRC for bronies.
lol.
This is new.
Ooh! Wrek. Sounds like you're having a party. :D
hey any pony seen moopy
Dusty: They've had this around since May 2011
o.O I really need to get deeper into this.
Dusty: Welcome to Bronystate, where we defy all sterotypes. Except sometimes. Like new episodes.
Lol.
:O
the heck
I'm actually from iBrony. But decided to come to this channel.
Seems like there are more active people in this IRC channel.
This one is much much busier
05well Dusty, welcome ^_^ oru chanenls rules are lsited at bronystate.net/rules
hey a noble member of iBrony!
Dusty: I take it you're not at the stream also?
Welcome then Dusty! Yeah this room is pretty popular!
groovy
Weren't you on the other day dusty?
x3
better than streaming 2 girls and a cup
05but yeah Dusty visit out site isntead
Most of the Brits are at School, and all the 'Muricans are kipping
I have to go to school in, 3 hours.
05it has the chat embedded next to our stream
More Izzard! Yay!~
Stream, eh?
flutterchu: Who the hell would stream that 0_0
Tell me moar.
Dusty: also we stream tons of stuff, not just ponies :D
All day every day, Dusty. :D
Dusty: we've got all kinds of cool stuff here#
I liek Ponies.
Dusty: Oh, this is no ORDINARY site...
Well, the embedded client isn't very good.
Dusty: Long story short, get your arse over here and enjoy yourself. Or else >:3
Dusty: OMG YOU DO TOO?
um is it a man or a woman
Certainly not ordinary. A site dedicated to ponies isn't ordinary.
x3
YES.
OF COURSE I AM.
therainbowvortex: a man, duh
therainbowvortex, he's a man
Dude. I have so much bug bites.
It's not good.
<sarcasm>PFFT! Nobody likes ponies around here.</sarcasm> :P
Any ideas of treatment?
walk like a man...
therainbowvortex: A man. And an open transvestite, quite het, and makes jokes about it.
05and before you ask
05yes he likes women
05not men
therainbowvortex: He's a transvestite
Wrek: but dressing like women is fun :D
and we all wanna pick at his skirt
peek*
Didn't see that coming, actually.
aw hes not wearing badass cloths
transvestite that like when you dress up in girl coluthes right
tbh i like his previous dress better
:P
A tranny is someone who cross dresses
i predict this is 1993
the coat things not bad
What's the chances of a guy like him even finding a woman who would go for someone like him?
the A tansvestite is a male with normal male intent and instincts, but who enjoys dressing as a female.
052003
05Kandarihu: probably just as anyone else
when i was 5 my older sister made me play dress up now im scared 4 life
pretty high hes loaded
therainbowvortex, you poor thing. :/
question: what is your biggest fear
therainbowvortex: You mean scarred, right? Scarred for life?
yes
i cant wait for season 3 my first time reacting to a new episode on bronystate
And Twilight is STILL researching the Izzard. Such a STRANGE creature.
as long as it's aired at like 2
I saw the chat reactions for s2 on youtube it was epic
i cant wait either but we dont get it in nz
wish I was here then
about 11 flutterchu
Twilight researches everything Wrek streams. :P
11:00 pm?
am
05my lucnh consists of potato chips and lemon water
mornin
therainbowvortex: You can get it by watching it live here on Bonystate. :P
Ihop: DAMMIT :'(
Wrek: Great lunch! :D
nice choice
thats my plan
Hey Ihop
And her only reponse is, "Dear Princess Celestia... What the FUCK do you have me researcing? I mean SERIOUSLY. Yuor Faithful but very confuse student, Twilight Sparkle."
hey Ponies47
*sobs*
lol Kencolt
glad to dash your hopes
wait i mean sorry
am i having that glitch agian
King Dingle Dangle is best king
HELLOOOOOOOO ANYP-oh everyone was just quiet

We're busy listening to Eddie. ;3
I came back.
Welcome back~
05welcome back dusty
WB Disty
Dusty*
Dusty: You on our website now?
Whats with the man with boobs?
Yes.
lol.
At this time of day, we often are. We're kind of all around the US... and Europe... and a couple in Japan...and at least one guy in RTussia, I think.
Dusty: Good. :33
*:3
Dusty: Man with boobs is transvestite.
o.o
but.. why..
Is this funny?
;o;
Dusty: Yes! XD
Dusty: Because he likes to. An dyes, he's funny.
And yes*
Dusty: Well yeah, i find him funny.
Transvestite COMEDIAN. I just realised it would be very tricky to ponyfy him-- no, wait. Wrek's streaming this. Not difficult at all.
lol Manlesbian
I may enjoy comming here a lot more often.
I just hope it doesn't get to busy as you all claim it to be.
Dusty: I hope you don't mind playfully trolling mods :D
Dusty, usually, better stuff is streamed than this.
all those spikes
achilles once took an arrow to the heel. so that'S why achilles heel
Dusty: only during episode streams
Dusty: Well, there a LOT of random streaming during the week-- and then there's Friday Movie Night.
This dude isn't all to bad, lol.
Kencolt: Not really: Just take a male pony vector, add Rarity's eyes to it(and maybe mane as well) and some relevant cutie mark
first one who says something about knees shall fall victim to famine
Dusty: Friday night and Saturday morning are the busiest. Cuz that's when Movie night and/or episodes happen
;o;
I hope I don't get to ignored.
Dusty: That being US EST times.
Tends to happen quite a bit.
Brb gonna go do some tweaking at my TF2.
Dusty: not likely, unless you stay silent
Fair enough. Wow, this is actually quite entertaining.
Dusty: well, we go from insane chatter to periods of silence to totally insane WTF conversations.
^^^^^^^
A lot better than scrolling /b/ all day.
lol.
IS THIS STILL GOING
JRP: This is a different show.
JRP: nope, different show :D
I come back like 1 or 2 hours and same guy
Same guy, different show
05of course JRP
05unch entertainment
05lunch
05got a problem with it?
05too bad
Dat admin skills.
lol.
for me its night entertainment after a lovely day, glorious
*sigh* i remember when me and my brother animated flipnotes
but its to late wrek
noon? late?
Dusty: so this here is our mod Wrek, who enjoys streaming Star Trek, games, music and his art.
05<3
Oh, and Dusty -- two VERY important rules. NEVER post a Youtube or other video link when a stream is going on, and NEVER EVER post links to blatant pony porn. And there was NO SUCH STORY S CUPCAKES. Did I get that right, Wrek ?
05you could have presented it nicer
05like
05"oh and please dont post video linsk casue its cosnidered rude durign streams"
lol.
05sounds better yes?
Yes
I like Star Trek.
oh, and if you like classic television, ask for ponies
So it's fine.
not alarmis enuf wrek
Wrek: Yep
Dusty: also, if you ask for ponies, it's likely you'll get anything BUT G4 :D
I appreciate the suggestions. ^_^
lol.
Dusty: Just be good and you'll be fine :3
Wrek: A bit, I suppose-- but I was just trying to give somepony a heads up rather than the usual "Yelling At The New Guy In Midstream" thing that always happens.
Dusty: I hope you don't mind jokingly trolling mods :D
I was actually looking around seeing for registration on BronyState. I'll assume there isn't any?
I liek RP.
:c
05you can register your nickname on the chat
Well, Nickname, yeah.
05like per usual
Dusty: that means role play
05as for the site itself
I know RP. lol.
Silly goose.
Dusty: you can open private chats to do RP
05there is yet to be a function that would gain from signing up an account
Oh, nice.
From what I'm seeing, this is like, a site that opens arms to anyone.
That's delicious.
Yep
How does one become mod?
Per-Zeus
We love and tolerate even the trolls :D
05you apply when we're recruiting
magic
I hug trolls. :D
now remember Dusty in the future your gonna say these rules to some future newbie
Dusty: By invitation only-- and not easily.
Dusty, mooing. The secret to being a mod is to moo.
Goodmorning everybody
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
And slapping people with trout.
Mornin' MLP_Brovakiin
Hello MLP_Brovakiin!
Meow.
Amidoingitright?
yes
So I see there's another new person... Nah screw the welcome song, too busy playing games :P
Morning MLP_Brovakiin
whos the new guy
That's so polite.
therainbowvortex, Dusty is I assume.
so am i able to link welcome song or what
05no non-image links during streams.
therainbowvortex, nope, not during a stream.
do it anyway
Dusty: also expect to be asked who's your favorite pony. Not that we mind, it's just curiosity :D
lol. I can't pick between Dash and Pinkie.
I don't know why.
Everybody knows that Spikes is the best pony anyway
The combination of both make up mah dream girl.
Spike is*
AdamTheDuck: best unpony
Pinkie obviously *shameless opinions :D *
:< no he is best pony
Best unpony= Gummy.
AdamTheDuck: nope best nonpony
dusty couldent agree more
The alligator!?
c:
BABY alligator.
Gummy, the comically serious :D
I love Gummy!
Canon says Spike considers himself a pony. Just a pony in a dragon's body.
Dusty: even thogh he barely appeared
spike is otherkin
Spike is... just Spike
XD
i keep geting stuck with witch pony is best fluttershy pinkie or dashie :O
I don't know why, but it seems that a lot of secondary characters are always better than the main characters.
lol.
Pinkie_Brony: that's spike (magic.mov)
Gummy > Mane 6
Pinkie is best, in my opinion
I'm fairly solidly in the Twilight Sparkle camp.
Obviously.. just look at my username
Dusty: okay mabye youre getting carried away
/me holds up his "Rarity is best pony" sign.
Possibly.
id wath it
aiight
Spike is best pony
Spike is best dragon
hes a dragon dude
i cant decide my little dashie made me like rainbow fluttershy is so so cute and pinkies kinda like me random
No, Crackle is best dragon
Pinkie Dash. Rainbow Pie.
Crackle is best dragon indeed
"Spike is best pony" = funny
ive never red my little dashie or cupcakes
MLD was intense. I cried for like, 30 minutes.
I like Pinkie because of her randomness and that she is the one who can break out into song at almost any moment
actually i read my little dashie
flutterchu: cupcakes does not exist here.
But that's just because I'm sensitive.
Gold_Demona: ill have to read it to find out why but i cant find it
I have a link.
Dusty: say that to our mod Scoot-Scootaloo when he comes in :D
Would you liek it?
c:
I certainly will.
Would it be okay if I posted a link to a picture.. is it breaking the rules are anything?
no thankyou i only cried once from reading a fanfic and it was not my little dashie
Dusty: I read that... and merely smiled wistfully. But that's probably because i'm the State's token old fart. So far, oldest brony here- at least on a regular basis.
flutterchu: I never read it, but I know enough to know that I don't want to.
05linking images is OK.
05as logn as the image doesnt break the content rules
05ie no gore, no porn
Pinkie_Brony: pic links are fine, as long as they're not violent or sex
Ya, okay lol
I'm like, 16. And it's hard to find a good b'aww for me. The closest to b'aww irl is Jersey Shore. >.<
Dusty: And before you ask, I'm 54 years old, with an artificial hip and bad eyes and teeth.
Dusty: depressing that such a show was ever greenlighted, right?
dat autoreference
Yes. Kencolt, I have so much respect for you right now.
You don't even know.

All of my why.

What opinion, flutterchu?
Yes... I have the wisdom of age, and the hip of my late grandfather. Well, not the ACTUAL hip. That would be CREEPY.
Gold_Demona: people saying dat izzz ay goohd pick fluhtahchuk
wut.
flutterchu: ....Why? What's wrong with it? I was just saying something nice....
Nothing wrong with. why waste a good limb when it still works. That's what the igors say.

Ihop: Who doesn't
I love pancakes. :3
pinkie dose :O
Dusty: No. I would mainly be confused if someone tried to impersonate me. :) Im just a silly filly of no importance.
Why would anyone want to impersonate me? :D
oh god everyone wants to be inside me
Wut
I'm not interesting enough to impersonate.
Ihop: I doubt that came out QUITE right.
i am ihop
Kencolt: I think that came out exactly as he wanted to.
a store
*restaurant
Ihop: Resturaunt. :P
/me goes inside the International House Of Pancakes.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
It's a breakfast restaurant that specializes in Pancakes. :3
International House Of Pantakes, shortened in later years to IHOP
Gold_Demona: Make sure to save a few seats for eveypony. :)
Klumzeedragon: im haveing an identety crises
05after this: live at wacken, sabaton 2008
Ihop: :D It appears so.
I know that. Overpriced, overblown, and not that good a pancake in my opinion. No offense.
cold ken you cant come in
Og god I am so bored, I have been waiting for the new skyrim DLC all damn day -_-
Depends on the pancake I find. I like their regular pancakes. I don't usually go for their special pancakes.

DA provides a shortlink on the right-hand side of the page.
Ok, I give up...
Gold_Demona: Aparrantly flutterchu doesn't care. :P I see what you mean though.
05btu yeah its gettign a bit spammy now flutterchu
Wrek: now im breaking rules by not even trying
They don't always work, sometimes staying stuck on the gallery
it's hard not to get banned
05would you be happier if i banned you isntead?
flutterchu: actually, it's not
05becasue frankly your shitty and self destructive attidude is getting on my nerves
it is really, because ive been trying for a year, but then i gave up
05stop linking a million iamges from DA in a row withotu sayign anythign in between
Wrek: oh okay
flutterchu: I've been here for about a week and I havent been kicked or banned. Just follow the rules, and listen to the hard working mods. :)
Well.... I'm off for now. Need to do some early morning shopping. Laters.
funny, i've been here since the beginning of bronystate and never came close to a kick
/me waves
Bye Kencolt
Goodbye Kencolt
They are moooore than fair with warnings.
Kencolt: See ya around~ :)
05the fun part is that the second i tell them to quit, i e a nice warning, they always go "AH HERE COMES THE DOUCHES BANNING AND KIKKING AGAIN I BET IM GETT ING KICKED NOW!"
05urgh
And the criminals would be the only people with the useful guns
lololol
it's the rebellious nature, Wrek.
05ratehr shot the fucking lot
I really hate those chumps that think they can challenge the mods and win
You kids these days, with your rebellious natures.
They want one last punch before being executed.
im not rebellious, peopole make it too easy
Can't we all just be coo'? ._.
I only got kicked a couple of times. Once for using all caps and once for posting too many messages at once. =P
nopr
Wrek: I've noticed. And I've only been here a week. :D It's rather silly, but I feel bad that you have to deal with that.
Ninjazz: We all are coo', just venting?
I've got kicked for many reasons. :$
maybeh. But the mods dun need dat.
What mods like is some peace of some quiet.
my door is opening by itself i must have spirit here
Now that's the Wrek we know and love :D
AdamTheDuck: I know right? :P He's still abnormally nice today.
05Ninjazz: maybe not quiet, but peace and moderatley calm covnersation
05ie no allcaps
Well somtimes for no reason becasue SOME mods wanted to get there kick count higher :P
Hahaha very funny Wrek
Wrek, well, yeah. I meat peaceful conversation. Quiet chats are kinda erie.
lol
capslock is a funny little bastard. he always manages to get pressed when i play guild wars. it'S like he wants to be noticed
But Canterlock sometimes canterlock is funny!
And brain. By no means, please disable the grammar part of yourself. Thank you.
Wrek: So wait, why ARE you streaming again? You already did a 10 hour stream earlier. Don't you ever sleep?
05hah
05nope
05kronic insomnia

Who needs sleep?
Sleep? Sleep is for weenies. :P

Hello TheRandomkid321_
Hello TheRandomkid321

how long is this movie (_( gawd
TheRandomkid321_, likewise. Been off in another plante for a bit. Also, would LOVE to come here more often but it feels wrong without having the stream up.
flutterchu, There is no end :<
Wrek: For the win indeed. I suppose I shouldnt pry, I was there for most of your stream earlier and Im here again. :D
05flutterchu: not enjoying it?
05too bad
05jstu mute in and dont ocmplain about everything
Wrek :D
AdamTheDuck: T~T
Oh lawd. Here it comes.
*head falls on desk*
so i have a quistion
flutterchu Roleplaying!? When Wrek's around! DEAR GOD! Are you insane?!
05ask away

flutterchu: both

Gnight, therainbowvortex. Sleep well.
Wrek Well remember to never make me a mod... or else there will be one message per hour.

Night therainbowvortex
MLP_Brovakiin: hearthfire?
Dark_Horst: The new skyrim DLC
wow. that totally went past me
:D I'd love to be a mod. But I don't have a nifty Capture Card anyway.
hpw many are out now?
Dark_Horst: two?
I was not prepare for the ammount of awesome in this picture http://i.imgur.com/wmnjq.jpg Carefull 56kers it's a pretty big picture.
MLP_brovakin ANother one? My bank account weeps.
Klumzeedragon: capture card? for what? You'd stream console games or something?
TheRandomkid321: It is only 400 points
MLP_Brovakin... I can afford that.
Dabuck is everyone?
Gold_Demona: Yeah. Probably. :P Youtube vids are something everyponies seen, usually on there own time, and I don't really have a great taste in shows to amuse everypony. :D
Damnit of all days http://derpy.me/z-Vlq -_-
Klumzeedragon: I see. I'd probably stream PC games. =)
Wait... Neanderthals = Testificates. It makes sense!
Gold_Demona: Only PC Game I have is Team Fortress 2. :D Cause it is for some reason, the only one that likes to work for me.
Gold_Demoma if everyone could stream... imagine the pornography....
okay that was funny
I'd stream some good stuff. No porn from me.
MLP_Brovakiin: :D Pfffft. That explains why I was kicked offline an hour ago. :P
05im already streamign enough porn
Kandarihu I mean from the trolls mainly.
I know Wrek, look at this hunk of man-woman.
Wait. Serriously? Porn? Oh.
DAMN THIS DUDE CAN (sorry) stand for like 2 hours not complaining
Flutterchu everyone can when they are moving around a bit.
05in heels
Klumzeedragon: I'm kindof annoyed I have waited all day :(
I have huge respect for this man's ability to stand in such insane heals for that long. o_o
I can't even stand in kinda short heals for more than a couple hours
TheRandomkid321: not me
heels*
dem heals
MLP_Brovakiin: I would be too if I was waiting for that. Cause Im usually excited for DLC for my games. But this one... it just seems a little disappointing for the game.
Klumzeedragon what's it do?
TheRandomkid321: Lets you build a house, expand it, and adopt kids.
Moving around in heels is even more of a pain in the ass than just standing in them.
AGAIn
Cuz you have to step a very particular way, else you dig the heel right into the floor.
BLOODY AGAIN
Klumzeedragon... Adopt children?... Can you murder them in cold blood?
JRP: Yes. :P
05put them on spikes
11,02Night all :)
Klumzeedragon: Meh I have already gathered things for the house like iron & firewood :D Plus I love games like skyrim I have put 320+ hours into one save alone :P
Children fricassee
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
TheRandomkid321: Of course not. It's Bethesda.
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Night Matt! :P
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
Nighty SuperBrony64|Zzz :)
i remember a perfect game in zelda 3 once
11,02Klumzeedragon: Dat not mah name /).(\
i mean i link to the past
Klumzeedragon Hungergames has a bunch of kids killing eachother and it's only rated M. Video games a game where a kid can't even shoot adults rated 18+. I mean Red Dead Redemption.
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Uh huh. >_> Night SuperBrony64.
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Goodnight Kieth
:P
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Also I like your new picture on DA :3
11,02:P
11,02Ponies47: Thanks :3
Holy shit. we're gonna have an awesome movie night this friday :)
I think i'll get that DLC because I am a strong roleplayer and it seems to benefit that side of the game.
there was going to be a zelda 3 http://img.engadget.com/common/images/3060000000050302.JPG%3F0.3213011481204663 just reaserch yourself
"* Ninny is now known as Ninjazz" << what happened there
TheRandomkid321, frankly, I don't mind that Bethesda has a problem with players killing children in the game.
oh boy here ew go
I have been awake since 2:30 AM and today is the first day of school and I start in about a hour ;_;
we*
Ohai, Phase4. That's my second nick. Incase of client derp emergencies.
WOAH the shadows in this movie
ah
Ohai Phase4
Apparently it's a cute name, says everyone. =_=
Kandarihu I agree but the fact taht there are movies rated only M that get great ratings and has a bunch of kids pointlessly kiling eachother.
05personally i think its to save themselves from bad PR
flutterchu: Zelda 3 is Link to the Past, which was on the SNES
Ninny Ninjazz sounds like a cute name
:>
05and sicne there's a mod for it
05i dont mind it
>.<
05hadnt there been a mod though
Not you too!
MLP_Brovakiin: I know what you mean. I have like 200 hours or so, but my lord, if I want to build a house, I'll play Minecraft~
05also
05Phase4:
05hai
ohai Wrek
05hows ogame goign?
05need mroe cash?
le-me logging in
id really rather not
Klumzeedragon: true
Wrek, i'm aiming for colony ships first
simply cant generate enough metal on one planet for the bigger things
and theres 4 planets in my system that are uncolinized
05well the stuff i sent you should be abel to fund some better mines for a few levels
TheRandomkid321, yes. But I really don't like the whole idea of the rating system polarizing age groups. Just because one company's game does something offensive and gets an M rating doesn't mean another company should be expected to put it in their game just to be "mature".
Wrek, yeah, i got to about level 10
Gold_Demona: this was going to be zelda 3 the triforce saga on the nes this is the only picture cause this dude is a REALLY busy man so he can only tak this blurry pcture and someone said that you can only play beta games on an beta nes and look at this a normal nes http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/LegendOfZelda3NES.jpg
Phase4 what game are you playing?
spent a bunch on robot facility though
Mutterguy, ogame
aparently it wont load
BACK TO SCHOOL WORK
oh wait, nvm
05hah
05got my boosters up, i have all my expeditiosn running
05trasnport fleets incoming from my mining planets
one shipyard level away from colony ships i think
05my fleet is strong enough to repell the bandit lords
05hoping to get destoryers by the end of the week
did mowvie tooooo lawlng
Brb need coffee
inb4 Wrek gets a deathstar
rocket horse
Wrek, call it the Wrekstar
is it one of those realtime get X turns per a day games?
05nope
05well
05its realtime
Mutterguy, no, real-time game, just slow
05but your turns and actiosn are ulimited
Wrek: This sounds like an interstellar version of Ikariam. :D
I wonder what those kids in that new skyrim DLC do?
By the way you've been talking about slow things takes, Wrek, sounds like simple actions take weeks to get done.
flutterchu: according to what I'm reading here, we're both right. They were originally gonna make this for NES, but then they changed it to an SNES project, and it ended up being Link to the Past.
TheRandomkid321: Irritate the hell out of you with Angst.
yeah, one shipyard level away from colony ships
Klumzeedragon pouses where in there mainly as a way to get cash and food. What do you mean by Angst?
and its stopped loading again
BACK TO WORK
whyie dis mowvie coooooooo lawlng
damn, didnt make it load
Back. With coffee
TheRandomkid321: "I hate you father , you never do anything for me and you're never home!"
flutterchu how old are you? Honest question.
FINAWWY
TheRandomkid321: im not telling you that
Klumzeedragon but I spend 75% of my game time in my house pretending to do taxes...
when i see flutterchu, i think sonichu
05well
05under 13
what has the internet done to me?
05you are breaking network rules
flutterchu why not? Obviously you are 12 or something. No offence.
05so you know
TheRandomkid321: i jusssssssssst want you to shut.......up
:<
TheRandomkid321: And if you get hearthfire, you'll have kids screaming at you while you're 'doing' taxes. :P
All the fighting =_(\
yeah, ogames mostly broke
talkin hawken with walken
So much rude. :<
Wat if he gots his parent's permission?
flutterchu I just want you to use correct taxes.
DAMNIT
Ponies47: Not fighting. Whinning.
as soon as i said that everything instafix
Klumzeedragon Can you buy them toys?
Klumzeedragon: Good point
Zis is whining!
All the whinning =_(\
05TheRandomkid321: flutterchu. cut it out.
TheRandomkid321: what does this had to do with my age?
Klumzeedragon: Epis Winning?
epic*
flutterchu I would tell you but Wrek is hovering above us.
TheRandomkid321: I don't know. It's not out yet.
The mods are ALWAYS watching us O_O
Klumzeedragon When will it happen?
come out I mean.
Ponies47: at least until they go to sleep
Whining
Wrek, yeah, a little detirum and crystal would help, i mostly neglected the mines for those as metal was more commonly needed
Gold_Demona: The worst impersonation is probably the best. :P
05Phase4: ill see waht i can spare
I once saw a crudely drawn r34 of Pinkie and the baby cakes.
Linked here
*sigh* too long
TheRandomkid321: It should be out now, but xbox live is down. :D
TheRandomkid321: I wonder if people will moan about it costing too much, I have 400k gold so money isn't a problem for me :P
PsychoticDoc: You never know. They may say they are asleep but they may not be sleeping O_O
Not always. But sometimes they like to keep VERY quiet so they can strike deadly.
05no u
MLP_Brovakiin How many MS points again?
Ponies47: mods asleep, post modds asleep related things
Klumzeedragon: LOL, as good an impression as I can get with my female vocal chords. XD
PsychoticDoc: :D
TheRandomkid321: 400
DONT
AIR
ANOTHER
ONE
shut up sonichu
05queueing another one becasue flutterchu asked me to
why the hate flutter?
Wrek: Queue all the videos. :P
Wrek: Yay! :D
Lol. Good ol' Wreky.
wirisme: it was too long
Tank ye Wrek the almighty overlord of my morning entertainment
flutterchu, if you hate Eddie Izzard so much, you can, i dunno, mute it?
Yeah I can afford that. Finally I was getting bored with the very few roleplay elements they had in skyrim... Hopefully you can purchase pointless items like sleepwear. No no. They should add in a sleepwear outfit that give you extra stats when you sleep with it equipped.
Gold_Demona: I would love to hear it, cause it's probably hilarious. :D
wrek u tried gmod 13 yet?
Gold_Demona: i dont even know what youre talking about
05dont use gmod
BUT
YOYU MUSTU
05no
05i msut nothing
05so shut up
ok
okayface.jpg
flutterchu: The comedian we've been watching for the last three hours? Eddie Izzard.
Is anybody else really excited about movie Night this week?
flutterchu do you just not find im funny or do you not like transvestites or something?
*him
so did that dragon thing get WMC?
XylemTube: Im more excited for the B movie than the A movie. :P
lol, all i hear from this is an echo and guitar
Yeah starship troppers was awesome!
is this even english?
aka Zerg: the movie
XylemTube: whats going on movie night?
TheRandomkid321: noo it's just that someoe is pretty much talking in a mic for 3 hourse
flutterchu that's entertaining.
TheRandomkid321: So it is a swedish band I think
JRP: they're playing Batman and Starship troppers
/me Takes a sip of his coffee
Troopers even
Wrek, why does no one colonize 1,2,3 or 13,14,15?
flutterchu: That's called stand-up comedy. The point is to listen to what he's saying because it's funny.
05Phase4: casue you need extreme tech to do that
NANANANANANNANANANAANANANNANANANANAAN batman
XylemTube: : Ha ha. I agree. Someone had told me it got switched to the Blues Brothers though. :S It doesnt seem like thats the case though.
ah
flutterchu I do honestly wish you could TRY to use proper grammar. No offence I just have OCD or something and grammar effects it.
too hot or too cold I imagine
ADHD
well my whole family says i have no humor
i believe them
Goal.
Schwing/
flutterchu well your one chanch on earth will be boring then... mayby when you come back as a memeber of the undead your run will be a little more entertaining.
are you banning me?
05he doesnt have that power
Oh please....
Klumzeedragon: WAT? nooooooooo
TheRandomkid321: What did Wrek say about fighting. Just be the bigger person and ignore it.
Wrek luckily for him at this aret I never will.
05now leave the kid alone TheRandomkid321.
Dabuck. I typed time and it turned out as aret
sonichu is just being a fail troll, just whatever it man
XylemTube: But they said that before the schedule was posted, but it's still up as Starship Troopers. So I don't know. :O
TheRandomkid321: Tired?
poop
I come back from lunch to fighting and... Sabaton? Wrek, where are these guys from?
sorry some glitched happend
Wrek i'll try... I just have a trolling habit... But that's against the rules.... So i keep it encased most the time.
I would like to take this opportunity to say that, Rainbow Dash is the best pony in the history of mankind
also ponykind
XylemTube: WRONG, its derpy than rarity than applejack then twilight
XylemTube: Every pony is best pony. :D
XylemTUbe That's an odd way to spell Depry Hooves
*Derpy
Pffft. If it wasn't for RD ther wouldn't even be a show. Just watch Ep 23
i could live without episode 23
That's Cutie Mark Chronicles, right? I don't remember them by number. :P
Yes Gold
:)
are we watching a whole concert of a band I have never heared before?
O_o
Im not even paying attention to the stream lol
05XylemTube: great to feel appreciated
i wouldnt pay attention, but i have to sit around for another hour or so doin nothing
O.O"
I didn't mean it like that Wrek :(.
50 bucks someone in that crowed is pumping his purple headed yogurt slinger.
TheRandomkid321 ...wut?
Nah. The show would have just taken a turn without the other ponies.
TheRandomkid321: :D what da fuq
I think he means dong
They would have gotten their cutie marks in a different way.
05next time you hit my nerves ill give you a 30 minute timeout TheRandomkid321
And maybe even got new ones!
Like, Applejack would have kept that job with Jubilee.
Ninjazz: Ikr
Twi wouldn't be in the show at all
And Rarity would ahve become a ninja and stuff. Or probably a model.
Wrek ... I best leave my reply at that.
Twilight would have gone crazy with power and pretty much destroy Canterlot.
Rainbow Dash... would probably... erm... never meet the Wonderbolts ever.
Scootaloo would fly.
uuuggghhhhh my eye's hurt
Ello there everybrony.
Ninjazz: she has proven herself to be mentally unstable at times
Hey, Malavolent.
Hello Malavolent
Malavolent: How it goin? :)
hey guys!
Hello Malavolent
Ninjazz: Pinkie would have been the best rock farmer in history and Fluttershy would have been the crazy 4th wall breaker :D
mentallyeffedguy: Hey man. :)
Klumzeedragon: Damn school. It's hard to get used to it again -.-
how are all bronies doing?
Hello Malavolent!
So Wrek may I ask you an honest, mature question?
XylemTube, Twilight? Oh most indeed. She wouldn't have been able to keep it together.
Hello mentallyeffedguy
Ohai mentallyeffedguy!
05if you do it properly
Hi mentallyeffedguy
MadSurge, yes. All my yes.
Tread lightly TheRandomkid321
Malavolent: Oi. :D Sorry to hear that.
TheRandomkid321: I'd give you a timeout for just asking me that. :D
00,10morning all
Klumzeedragon: I doubt I am the only one. How are you doing?
Wait. Fluttershy breaking the 4th wall. Not sure how that'll work out.
Morning sumica.
Hey, Sumica.
Sumica !!!
Goodmorning Sumica
Morning Sumica
Sumica: Hows it going Sumi? :)
Hello Sumica!

05im waiting TheRandomkid321
Dusty, you still there?
My school starts on thursday :(
mentallyeffedguy: I'm doing well. :) Yourself?
Okay WRek i'm just asking here. Why do you seem to hate me so much? It seems like you always have ever since the first time I ever saw you on chat.
inb4 banned
Malavolent: I'm doing swell. :D I should shower and hit the hay, but Wrek is streaming...
Perhaps, that would have been a something more suitable for a PM, mate.
Thunderclouds on the horizon
Morning Sumica!
Klumzeedragon: Who need sleep anyway.
Klumzeedragon: im better than yesterday, ive found my keys :D but i need too buy a new lock cuz a teacher fucking cut it of :|
Malavolent: Yeah! Buck sleep. :P
mentallyeffedguy: Aw. :D Well... that's good I suppose. Could have been worse?
Klumzeedragon: I think my grades in school will be worse by the end of the year. But who cares? :D
05First of, i do not hate you i jstu dislike your behaviour becasue it goes on my nerves. secondly you jump troll bandwagons and cant leave well enough alone for isntance with flutterchu after i had told you. hadnt i been so nice id give you the timeout the secodn you talked back at the kid again. 3rdly: it takes a shitload to get on my hate list. what you consider hate i consider mild
5annoyance. Besides you should know by now that i "hate" everyone equally.
Malavolent: Blame it on Bronystate and their awesome mods. xD
05so when you stop acting liek a bloody troublemaker, ill start acting a bit nicer towards you. but right now you are jsut walkign the thin line
Klumzeedragon: yea the locks arent too exspensive, but today is a shitload of homework waiting for me:[
Wrek: You're my man.
And this is just Wrek on a good mood...
hello everypony and Wrek, why the text wall?
I also hate everyone equally.
Wrek: im not a kid
So noone complayins.
Hey, BronyInstrumental.
Hello BronyInstrumental :)
Hey BronyInstrumental!
Klumzeedragon: I blame it on ponies in general.
00,10tell us how you really feel wreky.
00,10Dont hold back now

Hello BronyInstrumental
Hiya BronyInstrumental
Klumzeedragon: so.....a troll?
mentallyeffedguy: Yeah. :P You can do it!
suddenly *rubbs back of head* everypony on bronystate isnt getting along
Dat Wrekrage
Wrek okay then. Understandable...
Malavolent: That's my excuse for... nothing really. I can't blame them for being cootsie and wootsie.
BronyInstrumental: Pretty much. :) Wrek has had a long day of streaming and Im suprised at how tolerable he's been towards a lot of stuff today.
Klumzeedragon: Well you can only blame yourself for not being resistant to cuteness. I guess that's also my case.
flutterchu For once I agree with you...
Klumzeedragon: my word isnt wordking.......FUUUUU!!
Klumzeedragon: Ikr, Wrek is a pretty patient guy
Did the stream go down?
Ponies47 is for me
<3 wREK
so, there was a troll screwing with Wrek, that about right?
Malavolent: So true. :D
BronyInstrumental: Kinda.
i bet when i look into a mirror my eyes will be as red as and apple
Not really.
BronyInstrumental No well yes I am a troll but I wasnt screwing with wrek.
mentallyeffedguy: Oh my. :( Of all the luck...
BronyInstrumental: a certain someone bugging him costantly
Ponies47: It most certainly did.
oh okay, i get it
He just doesn't like being a babysitter
._.
flutterchu: know that feeling :D
Klumzeedragon: i fixed it, it was just abit slow and shitty, BUT IT WORKS! :)
You know what Wrek? Go on. Ban me. Give me a 24hr ban. I deserve it.
Did Wrek disappear? O_o
His name isn't on the roster...
MadSurge: Indeed he is. I would weild that ban hammer with extreme prejudice if I had to deal with half the crap he does.
/me Notices Wrek isn't in the chat
Lol, roster
He's gone O_O
Gold_Demona: maybe his internet went down
It's time I take responsibility for my actions.
MadSurge: Maybe
Wait Wreks gone?
Maybe his computer restarted, but he would stayed in chat then, wouldn't he?
Okay remind me to tell him taht again when he returns.
TheRandomkid321: no need to push it on yourself kid :P
TheRandomkid321: youre just ashamed of yourself for being yourse-is he banned already.DAMMIT

Yo, Ninjazz?
One is not a man when they are a certain age, one becomes a man when they choose to be.
You guys are digging yourselves deeper than need be.
Ah, okay. Thanks dragon.
Hey, Malavolent. :)
05as for TheRandomkid321: as you wish
:/
Wrek, don't be that harsh.
AdamTheDuck: i think the same way
Wrek wait.
Ninjazz: Hey :D So, I was thinking, how about we get some people for TF2 MvM?
05AdamTheDuck go sit in the corner
I need to say something
AdamTheDuck: He was begging for it
He asked for it, mates.
first
Let the man take his shot like a man.
I was looking for some TF2 also.
pony_9995: And he's lecturing some misbehaved foals.
Wrek: isnt role playing not allowed?
Malavolent, I'd love to, man. But I'm literally without a computer now. Not until the weekend. >.<
05flutterchu: roleplayign is not allowed on this channel yes.
Malavolent: Gosh darnit. If it weren't five to 12 here, I'd play with you. Sadly, it is. So I can't. :<
Malavolent: love to, but i'm on my laptop until thursday so, yeah
Malavolent: I would love to. But I can't ATM :<
Ninjazz: No problem with me, it can wait.
:)
Malavolent, I don't mind some TF2.
Geez guys, you're so nice :)
Wrek: you were just role playing
Wrek: is all this crap about him breaking that one rule? thats harsh and kinda funny :P
05also updatign flash before continuing
Malavolent, ikr?
Malavolent: I have tf2, I could probably play. But it's so late. :D
Wrek: well atleast trying to make someone role play
So Wrek May I say a few words before being forced to leave for 24 hours?
flutterchu: No he wasn't
But hey, if there are so many people wanting to play, why don't we try asking the mods if we can't have a tf2 event?
TheRandomkid321: He's waiting.
:|
Oh
TheRandomkid321, force? I recall you asking for it, mate.
00,10bah! you are all kids to me, well save for kencolt
05first off you arent forced you asked for it yourself so go ahead
05secondly, flutterchu: stop talkign out of your ass.

TheRandomkid321: You arew not being forced, you begged him to do it :|

Wrek: i think youre kinda funny. weid but funny :P
BronyInstrumental: why?
And flutterchu no longer exsisted...
seatsea: just sit back and observe, my friend
/me continues to sit in his corner. :P
Okay Wrek and other members. I know at times I have been immature well MANY times actually. And I feel as thoguh it is time to face my fate. Wrek incase you don't rmember I once said I did not like your streams long ago. That was literally my third time viiting the site. I believe taht our relationship from that point on has been affected by that even. So I apolagise. Now you may do what you can.
Just don't get on someone's nerves. It's not hard. You piss someone off, you apologize. Specially when you did something wrong. -_-
Ok. I gotta go now. Bye everypony.
all i see is stream that is off
Oh for gods sake.
05okai
Bye Ponies47

TheRandomkid321: long POST IS LONG!

05finalyl some calm
Buck school -_-
Malavolent: Depending on the Ping, I might be able to join up for some MvM.
05tiem to put the metal back on
Who just got banned? :<
Because what's some good calm without some metal?
05both of them
did i miss stuff?
Wrek: Thank you for being Awesome. :)
AdamTheDuck: Take a guess.
oh, who got banned
pony_9995: My ping isn't the best either when connected to the US servers, but I think MvM is playabla around 100ms.
what did i miss
Dark_Horst: Just a massive conflict :)
RandomKid because he asked politely and flutterchu because he/she couldn't hush or be quiet.
Buytoast: Read up, and take a guess.
did flutterchu have somehting to do with it?
Dark_Horst: yep
Just didn't know when to shut up really.
is their any video showing at the left? i paused it and it wont "start" again
that'S what i expected
