When I solo'd Adventure Mode, one boss that is fought twice, I killed both times by causing him to fly off the screen. He immediately teleported back to the screen for his post-defeat cutscene.

Finishing it once was good enough. @_@
Yeaah-

Loss of blood, my only weakness

Some of it is Swedish, the rest is made up words.
Don't forget to get the Blizzard Magick
technic?
it's a mod that adds oils, animals, and stuff- pipes and pumps and whatnot
I run a stable and a quarry-
It also adds millenaire, if you use the old 6.0.7 version
p
hehe yeah-

Kind of hard when you are both persistent but bore easily

Pretty good song.

gaping and staring at you -
That'd be an interesting encounter.

i'd probably freak out a little
AWw..
hehehe

You should invite some other people to join!

china is pretty large
That it is

I noticed we're not allowed to buy energy drinks from USA though-
I gotta go to America some time. :P
Don't they are freaking evil
No idea- thhinkgeek just said "We can't ship energy drinks"
My friend ships energy drinks constantly
hm- maybe it's just a site policy
Want me to explain?
Possibly.
hey guys
Haha, wow yeah-
/me .........
I usually drink one called burn, tastes kinda nice
I like Moster and Relentless.
Monster*
I tried the Purple Monster before they went off shelves. It was good
why was the purple monster pulled
I even have a shirt of the Monster logo colored Purple
alexxm*
Mm most energy drinks are just caffeine- at least the ones I've had
Yep, my friend has 2 energy drinks every day. I think he's addicted. >_<
Still- I prefer soda or watever over it--
water* not whatever

Milk is awesome, 'specially on it's own.

Mhm!
I-- kinda maybe want to be an accountant

:P
All I know is if I get a job behind a desk I'm going to shoot myself
Oooo

I remember work expirience... working with a filing system... never again.
Something smells odd- brb search for said smell
experience*
I've had experience working behind a desk. I think they call it school?
>,<
:D
bk
Brb getting myself some food
hehe
I am probably going to go back to school to get a more focused education
I took carpentry classes
Carpentry can be pretty cool
I find it fun
Yeah, Carpentry is awesome.
I kinda want to make guitars as a hobby, and carpentry would have helped a lot there
I like construction work.

Anyway, I g2g.

Bye!
Awkai, byee
bye

I had a certain desire to be a sexologist
but--I'm terrified of scary people
It's really interesting!
hehe
Well its not that perverted-
it's like..
Oh. Yeah it's kinda interesting but I'm nervous to find out such things
Yeah if that's how you feel
yeah-
I am a sort of minor expert in fetishes, which are we discussing? gore? insect? furry?
/me blinks
._.
Let's not expand that topic.
^
hehe
yeah-
Nvm, I'm back on an irc. :3
I don't blame you ._.
hehehe
'interesting'
Welcome back
well, we arent alowed to go over PG, most of the time
Lol, alrighty. :_:
Yeah xD
well none in specifics-
We're not talking about a certain type
xD
just- iot would be interesting to learn how they develop and such
O_o
I don't like where this is going :D
O____________o
hehehe
lets talk about crossovers then
This is quite humorous
hehehe
It iis
lol
but yeah Docto we were talking about jobs, and I mentioned I had a desie to be a sexologist-
now- HOW BOUT them ..spots team
00,02almost done
00,02this last one
DEAR LORD, MAKE IT STOP.
Lol, k
We're done! Honest
I didn't read it, though
/me is slow at typing on an irc
Hehe
Mmm WH40k
Was it good?
05FO:E is too much for me
it was f***ing hilarious
650k+ words.
Aww-
Well, I read it pretty fast- it was captivating
That'd be something.
thats about as bad as 40k
We do get to learn the fate of the mane six during FoE though, it's- yeah some of it was pretty epic and sad
Don't want to know
refreshing now
lolgiantrobotponies
like Timelords and Terror
which I <3
Tiemlawds.
/me Yawns
05daniel the wannabe timelord!
05a great star trek spinoff :P
mornin
MEEEERNEEEENG
xD
sorry!
brb.......gonna go to my mom´s house
i'll be back in less than a half hour
Though maybe pinkie would worship Slaneesh
hey guys
magitech
Like a slow escalation?
ahh turned off ipad as well
:3
05i dont have the time or dedication to write something good
Yeah-
I have the time and dedication just not the inspiration
I don't know the Deus Ex universe enouh to even attempt it
loldeusex
05i would like to try write in ponies in the deus ex universe rather than the other way around
and I didn't even know that particular pen and paper setting
whats mystara?
05casue theres nothing that even hints that any teleport or time equipment could transport someone from there
its, as i've gathered, a setting for dnd type games
05which is ratehr weak already
skulls for the skull throne
05its much more plausable say twilight teleport gone wrong
and it was prettygood
KILLL, KILLLLLLLL!
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DeusExEquineRevolution
05which is why i didnt enjoy it
05it suffers the same thign as the FO:E fic
05whic h i dont like
05and that is that the "real" equestiran universe turns into this mix of both
"real"
canon, if you prefer
dakka dakka dakka
sort of , yeah, that it developes into it, withou ever including actual characters from the other series
05aye its a taste matter
yeah,
05and the attempts are poor at best
I tried getting into FOE but found it a little repetitive plotwise
Aww-
05casue i realllllllly like the lone wanterer dlc
falls into the traps usual 'x meets ponies' does
...
Aah
hehe
magicka
^
00,02well that was fun
Good stream, man
00,02Wrek|Observiking, streams free
I can try, just a sec
cool, never heard of it
05it liek to see if it fits my needs
he my needs
its killing me
Thanks knighty!
05TheMaster: when i talked to him lastly he is really taking time to devise the continuation
excellent, I eagerly await it then.
05in the meantime reqriting the old chapters in between
05becasue hsi writing has improved a shitload since he began
05its a bit strange and some thign needs to be worked out
I suppose thats fair enough. He is one of about 3-4 fanfic writers that have made me laugh aloud
derpmoment
05but they are proving to live up to the first 15 chaprers
05now i have 3 episodes left on the star trek disc i have in the dvd drive
awww... i missed about half of he magicka run...
woo
i see infinite streams
lolNV
Okay I'm back! >:3
WHY A TROUT.
why not?
I prefer tuna.
I'm not hating on it or anything.
Gonna stay out of this one o_o
05then stop saying things that makes it look like you do
05thanks
I haven't read it, but it's got good ratings
05i tend to play the more RPG style games
lol
05nope
shame. Hm.
I've had it for years
so- I had it from beforehand
WOOT 4 desktop ponies!
Aww-
Ceasar 3 <3
05and liek that the capper wont pick up the stream
05probably not
05but i enjoyed playign them nonetheless
yeah-
I feel like a kid now ._.
Hehe
we were like..I dunno..10?
I was about 5
Mivix, I think
idk
alien nazis? those don't look like Daleks
Hehehe
doom <3
do you have doom 3?
I wasn't allowed to play Wolfenstein, but I was allowed to play Doom
05eeyup
05own all doom games
05even the lsot levels cahpters
Nice
Do you use doomsday when playing them?
I kinda liked Hexen and Heretic too
Yes, it is
05otehrwise i use doomsday
Cool
oh my...
I gotta buy Doom sometime =_=
HERESY?
05even did it on stream
Niice
05fuck it was hard but worth it :D
I was never GOOD at it, hehe
xD*
05then we have my ABUSE streams
05if youve seen one of those
Ii think I've seen one
hehe
Alien nazis, really, he hasn't even said EXTERMINATE once.
05published by bungie
Ooh, no then I haven't seen that
05developed by crack dot com
05the marathon series however
05is my childhood in a nutshell
05i fucking loved those games
Hehe
the nazis were assholes and all but damn did they have good uniforms
05i agree
^
also they liked Norse mythology
i think one word can describe this episode. DISCOOOORD!
and it..shows
05i was toying with the "what if" america allied with the germans against the russians
If something happens to the Nazis, I blame Fegelien
wow the enterprise looks pretty beaten up
05also i stripped the whole erradicate the jews thign they had going
twilight sure has gotten popular down there
05they fall asleep while she read them a story
05fell*
05then she kept reading to herself
05cause its cute as fuck
hehehe
08,01wheee
08,01i'm at work \o/
Hello workhorse
05btw saturn
05i shaved today
Saturn: yay~
hi Saturn
Hello, Saturn
08,01also, i got my bass guitar today \o/
05feeks great maaan
08,01Wrek|Observiking: that's awesome!
Hello guys 6_9
08,01but... i like stubble...
05facially yes
08,01ha!
05the rest could use a trim but not cleanly shaved
Aryans from the future?
^
08,01indeed
08,01shaving in that manner makes for itchiness
052 different aliens
creepy
08,01records being added to the db... i like this, this is good
all the database
they really thought this through
/me yawns sleepily
08,01what are you watching?
/me pets AttacktheAndalite's head
08,01more star trek?
Star Trek
05S4E2
08,01oooh!
08,01nice
08,01i wish i could watch, but i'm working
then why didn't russia stay allied with france and britain anyway?
08,01and i don't actually have a graphical display
/me 08,01is going all terminal today
08,01Vivix: Washburn AB10
05mayeb stalin didnt egt to the power
05and his totaliarism wasnt as pushed
05so the alliance to beat the germans maybe never took place
05henceforth the germasn had free roam in that area
My mind is blown
I can't remember all the prewar preperations
it showed on the map earlier that they had taken part of the us
I think..Germany used russia to build things that could be easily converted into weapons and tanks during pre war
^ yes. and free roam to train and learn doctrine
yes-
it was based on both countries being international pariahs
Ahh
... didn't we just do this plot, in reverse?
05stalin always wanted to capture the baltics and hold his totalitarian empire
05withotu those plans in the russians back head
i have that Amblem he has the skull
05its actually plasuable that the alliance never happened
then russia doesn't break up at all
05but not by stalin
05well
05stalin wasnt able to take power afterwards
05which may be why thigns went as they did
yeah-
hehe
xD
they just nationalized it all
the enterprise looks pretty beaten up
05please enlighten me
not sure if sarcasm lol
05so without stalin to nationalize it
05maybe they stayed capitalistic?
05wrong term
05maybe the NEP didnt break up the same way
yeah-
The menshiviks and the bolsheviks were convinced that russia wasn't even close to an actual revolution.
05actualyl yeah
05no revolution
then its just tzarist russia. which would have been allied to france and britain
which would have been a two front war for germany.
05but tzar russia has no reason to ally with them
Hmmm...
well I'll brb gonna play some Terraria
05thats why stalin allied in the first place
Weren't they traditionally allied?
05to reclaim parts of europe
05i jsut want to point out that we are discussing theoretical history
When the Tzar was overthrown, didn't the supporters and others escape to..france and britain?
I don't know the history between those countries
05why would russia be allied to france in the first place?
allies*
Aah-
05and sicne the first history change was 1916
05that still happened
And prussia ceased to exist in WW2 right?
Prussia formed into germany in 1870
that early? hm
after the Franco-Prussian war. Bismarck managed to crush france
Hehe
well feel free to ask
I've had my fair share of european history. It tends to be a popular subject
05by then WW1 had already ended?
1914, right?
well 1918 is when ww1 ended
1914 is the start date
11:00, 11/11
oh right
/me is taking notes of this discussion
Uh, its tricky since its such a volitatile period. I guess anything could have happened
True-
Did he have a son? I can't remember
Ah-
Heroes?
Star Trek
But The tsar had a brother. I guess he might have been able to be tsar if his son had died
and they'd had female leaders before. Maybe Nicholas' daughters could have become tsarinas
05but yeah somehow france and all of wentern europe fell to the nazis.
05russia didnt do anythign about it or they did but it didnt change eanything
05hitler began invading the US
05and thats were we are at now
Which is fine for Star Trek
05well they had to develop the weapons from ground up
05so as it is right now
05they have some prototypes and 1 or 2 divisions
05but its not like the aliesn have trusted the germans with it
05not in vast numbers
hhehe, I never researched it-
they thought they needed waaaay more enriched uranium then you actually need
I remember that eh- the H3O facility in norway was bombed, and the ship with h3o was also bombed
Aah
Yes. Plenty of sabotage and bombing
it never really went anywhere
05well norway was never invaded in a sense
dat bullet wound
05cant recall precisley
there was a shootout at..the kings hunting lodge
but yeah I think they just paniced--
The nazis did invade norway fully and took it over very quickly
no help from britain either
05well brittain were serving their own itnerest at the time
They helped us later- luckily
yeah
Whats on?
Oh wow
05which would bring us to the war aswell
wow. enterprise looks like crap
05while the germans wanted to bomb us cause they were afraid that we would side with the brits/US
05well
05not we didnt
05we awere very deceptful
i'm suprised the enterprise isn't wiping out those slow prop planes
05what kept the germans on our side was the allowande of out raintracks and oru ore
Star Trek
Great convo guys! /poof
dat Qaintem leap
hi everyone
05they didnt beleave us of course
05but then they finally did
05we said "todl you so"
is the whole "save derpy" war still going on or has the fandom dropped it by now?
I think it stopped when the hub kept showing the episodes unchanged?
I think only itunes changed it
wassent the enterprice damaged?
05yeah
05i can accept that some fans were angry about the change
05but takign it to the extent they did was wrong
05same thign with those emailing and saying derpy was an insult
05the fuckers need a smack across the head
05humasn eh?
05humans*
05yes
DAT CGI
05the CGi is fantastic for its time
when was this made?
2002?
05first scene was made 2001
05so say tech from 2001-2003
yea
05made adn rendered 2004
how many trek episodes have already streamed today?
051
at first I thought people were mad because they thought the voice was strange XD
05so i can see that
05but understand that there are people we are talkign about
05cant expect the mto act rationally
05and think before they speak
05sonicandmario85: yea finishing this DVD before i do some gaming
05can alwasy try
05i would think that people would take it too far
05like they always do
like good bad or what/
05it would bring good and bad things
05but in the end
0590% would not give a shit
05those that do are the noisy few
I understood both sides of the argument and found it alltogether a bit silly.
or atleast, the lengths they went
05but it all leads down to
05takign it too far
Little things are great.
oh yes
I loved that
that movie is amazing
05frankly
05most of the shit i hear comes form the US
its just a bunch of people posting angrily on twitter
which amounts to...nothing
05sure there is always atwat that trolls
05andy there are a few incidents for isntance trhe 15/16 year old being thrown out
05and some suicide attempts
15/16 year old?
wuit
05yes
i see
thats just sad
05EXACTLY
05and no its not a religion issue
05its a fundamentalist issue
05not today
05as for originating from 4chan
aahh to bad :(
05now
heh. I actually was there for the begining.
05many have joined that doesnt even know of the place
the community has expanded massivly from its origins
and is pretty unrecognisable from its roots
it must have been interesting to see it develop
minus its focus
I began in episode...3? I think
Was a lot of fun.
I have never been to 4Chan... (except for one time for about 1min to see how it actually looks like)
watching my little pony by candlelight
i never at all been to 4chan
uphill both ways
TIME TO GO LOOK FOR THE WEBSITE FCHAN
05season 1 had alreayd aired
4chan*
05not really
its hot over here
05bumped itn othe fandom on MMOchap about a month before that
just starting to settle with the community
05broguht some episodes with me on vacation
I think I'm pretty much at the 1 year point now, maybe 1 or 2 weeks aver it
05came back and became more familliar with the community post summer
05joined bronsytate around that time
my bronydom began a few months ago
thats recent
i think mine began s2e2
I learned more about the community and its history in that time than I thought possible
on*
Bye. glhf
BYE!!
in the beginning i had resolved to just watch all the episodes and not become a part of the community. that proved to be pretty impossible
my 1 year aniversery is this month

/me puts a bag of ice on his head
its a monarchy
...which board did you go to?
O hai
the pony one
its actually a diarchy but
not all monarchys are the same. Like Britain has a parliament
does 4chan still have a pony section?
yes
yup
I like the Pony section on memebase :)
05im guess more socialistic ratehr than kommunistic
Yes you do
ponies, ponies everywhere.
05d*
she reminds me of Lara Croft kinda XD
its a seperate image board
there are a lot of *chans out there
most of them worse then 4chan
05but few as popular and diverse
420, 7, 789
:D
the great pony war was among the worst
054chan is a pract example of the dickward theory
XD
Hey everypony

Leave. Now.
05andy it would do more harm than good
that bad?
Yep
ehhh....
well don't say I didn't warn you
05its jsut a gore story that sets out to gross. nothing more. its bad
walking into it blindly, yes it's bad
if you've heard plenty of it, it's rather meh
other then that, meh, i've read and seen worse
05its jsut a bad story, poorly writen etc
05but enough of this

/me is kinda away again
whoa
finally
I am now a Cyborg
not there

Beer!
WHERE
Whoops.
bastard has low ammo
How can Dawnguard be a rip off?
ok
Wait for the price to go down.
I'm back, ya'll
i'm back guys
Welcome back you two
CYBORGS ARE AWESOME
Nice.
Thanks
I wish I could tell him where to go
np
BOOM! shit just got real...
^
True- it's proably going to drop in price later, might pick it up then
That's....pretty much the thing worth hyping. XD
!
Aah
Maybe if Dawnguard went down about 5 bucks then it would be worth it
I like skyrim- buuuut..
I don't feel it is as free as.. lets say NV
in NV, I in an excruciatingly long and fun battle, killed Ceasar
I played NV, loved it
and why I can't join the dragons and doom everything
lol
It wouldn't be a GOOD choice for me, but I would choose it if I could
hehe
Nooot want to help the blades, not fight Alduin-
That guy's like "dun feel like turning around lul"
I just wanted to join the munks-
/me puts chocolate pudding hat on
Yeah
When you're sick of Skyrim, abandon all quests and turn off the compass. It's awesome to just explore
Yeah or kill some villagers >:3
hehe
Skyrim's set up in such a way that you can't just wanton kill everything.
And everyone
Bountys
Totally critic
that's one of my cons against Skyrim
And I am back. This the missing link?
Some Nords just want to watch the world burn
how in NV you can kill EVERYONE, and in Skyrim I can't even kill the guys out to kill me
The freedom is significantly reduced in Skyrim from its prior titles, where you COULD kill everyone (you'd just be theoretically screwed is all(
*)
Yeahh, like Morrowind
hehe
I never really played NV even though I own it though
yeah, same here
The scorpions scare me ._.
^
Same
The worst is deathclaws
In NV when you come across those radioactive scorpions they're huge and chase after you
Hehe yeah
I make other things do the fighting for me
Skyrim I'm an archer and explorer, mostly
Its entertaining to boot
But yeah, it's great to have freedom in RPG games
starting
Oh yeah-
why is he taking crates with him?
I shoot fireballs
I collect shouts ;3
Same
I can pick up crates
ok?
i headshot everything with arrows
Duex Ex?
yeah
I tend to shout at goats when I'm on mountains XD
I shoot everything in the knee
hehehe
Yeah
lol
Poor hunters
I hate coming across those crazy guys that just want to kill you I make sure they suffer :3
Mmmm... deer
Guess the have it coming though
/me cries and hugs deer
Hey everypont
/me has eaten a deer before
Pony*
I would never ear deer
Yeah- I've eaten deer too, not after I grew up though
eat*
Hmm, okay
i hate crates...
Hehehe
I'll be damned.
I admit I was grossed out at first, but, it doesn't taste bad.
We got some around here, but I just moved here
Hehe
I'm honestly afraid to pet a dear, they might kick me and stomp on me ._.
Deer caan be a bit spooky
I've never touched a deer, and I'm kinda scared of wild animals
am i the only one in engladn, where dear mostly stay away from towns?
Deers can be killed by cars, that makes them weaklings.
Bucks on the other hand, are fuckers
Horses are more scary as they have a kick that can kill you
hehehe
Yeah horses can kill, but they're usually nice
Also, stags are quite hostile too
My sister got kicked by her horse-
Unless you hurt them
But deer are pretty harmless
I found a deer trying to hide in my tall grass
get the*
Hello everypony :)
I hate when deer hunters collect the heads of their kill and mount them on the walls
hi
T-T
Helloo
They are like Francis: "I hate dogs" >:c
Yeah I hate that too-
I dunno, makes a nice decoration
lol Francis
Slightly more humane than head of their enemy on the wall
Guys i saw a newborn spike o_o
You can't trophykill a man :/
I'm a lover, not a fighter
Yeah- I just don't like it
I try not to---meddle in other peoples business
but I would never allow a girlfriend or boyfriend to bring that into my house
The only place that I want a deer in my house is either in the oven, the plate, or my stomach
taxadermy
/me eats dat hat
I have cyborg kittens
lol
I have a gun with a cat engraved on it
I once raised orphan kittens
Holla everypony! :)

I've had all my cats since they were newbord
Well, she saved you a couple quid
Aah-
....welp
that happened
our cats descend from a barncat

Dat music
Supposedly she was afraid the cats would have a disease. Pfft
Next cat I get in the near future, if it's a female I'm naming it either Trixie or Pinkie :$
Hehe
Mine is named Georg
My cat is named Butters :3
Mine is called Billy and he's a fucker
Hehehe
I'm gonna shoot his face one day
o_o
My cat's name is Meneno, it's made up I think
Hehe
Aww-
Cats are generally very loyal to the one feeding them
:/ sorry bout that
My cat tends to come when I call for him
but..only if he can be bothered
If I ever get a cat, I'm gonna name it Pinkie if it's a girl;
Mine doesn't. Mine's a stupid bastard
Well my cat completely ignoes me XD
ignores*
Hehe
He just stares and looks away ._.
Neat
Oh man. I just come back to jensen draging a body around. Oh man the luls

My counsins cat usually nuzzle me, then hiss at me

That was a good one
Masturbating a cat lol

Its the same...
:D
I think
:P jking

One thing for sure, you must take pictures

Really?

Equestria L.A. is coming up in November

Coo, cool
I haven't played live wihit my friends, but we played a lot of concerts during music school
I can play an Xbox, it that an instrument? :O
Nice
although i am a little sheepish on stage as i do 3 of the 5 parts in my band >.<
my favourite was eh..the live jam group, soo muuch noiiisee
aahh
on the live jam group we were three drummers, 2 bassists, 4 guitarists and a vocalist with pedals
I wish I could play an instrument but I don't know which one to choose
hello everypony
:P
TOY)PON3, any good at it?
Does that count?
goog
Ahh, yeah
I like playing..live focused
like if we lack a guitar, we don't write a guitar part
xD
Damn keyboard, the buttons are jammed
or am i totally confusing htose names?
Aah , cool
Pony Music is on the lost

Yeah lol
I really like voices that..aren't completely in tune
Never heard of him :P
HI everypony!

/me is listening to other music
what's he playing?
L.A noire is meh
wow
aww
Yeah but I'm patient :3
teehee, womens volleyball
I think it's really worht it if you like crime shows of the old sort
I like the Street cases
Like MASKED GUNMAN
hehe
Lotsa translucent figures
I liked it too, but I hated the bosses
Or THE SHOO-SHOO THEIVES. Shot 'em both in the head and they still call an ambulance
yeah
yeah. but they outsourced the bosses
Because with the rumors of them trying to take down season 3 vids, and me not being able to watch the hub, I'm hoping to find a livestream of the episodes.
DX1 had bosses of sorts but they were all optional not a requirement to fight
yeahh-
Great, bookmarking this site for season 3 then.
hi
Aww Yeahh
only 13 :(
Less episodes = less waiting = more seasons.
well, sort of, 13 episodes was said to be "for a special reason"
Only 13 MADE BY OTHER STUDIO
arent seasons usually every year
even simpsons had a few 13 episode seasons
yeah seasons are once every tv season
usually fall - spring
currently, I've got nothin'
yes
that doesnt sound pleasant
might be a movie or a tv special of some length
but i guess you cant rush these things
I'd rather not know
longer wait for each season if theres less episodes? doesn't make sense.
yeah, this is normal in tv
it's normal Delos
xD
well, comedy is 22 minutes
we probably wont get longer than that
but Wil said the 13 episodes is for a special reason, and that they are working on more seasons
I'm curious about the villain, the one 'leaked' from the quiz is apparently a possible villain.
I don't look at leaks
All I look foward to in season 3 is the songs
yeaah
^
Yeah
ofcourse I'm not saying we're getting 20 seasons, but I'm not worried
one of the longes running shows
Each episode should be an hour long :/
the longest running sitcom ever
20 seasons would be awesome though.. XD
xD
Oh yeahh, if they could keep the quality up- that would be amazing
as long as it doesnt descend into mediocrity
Definately.
I doubt they'd be able to
"This hour has 22 Minutes"
750 000 dollar
damn
idk
think about that when you download things
could the fandom go on without the series?
Yes
trekkies did
they both underestimated them at the peak of their goal.
but it would die a little
I hope they don't do that again, it would be dissapointing.
aww
;)
i agree
/)
(\

Yeaahh!
(\
hey, who's streaming?
another? /)
sure

(\
I haven't got missing link, I haven't even completed the maing story XD
woot! (\
main*
/)
(\
dont u mean mane?
Thats when you're refering to the mane 6 characters.
main, mane, whatev
And I'm talking about the main campaign for deus ex XD
usually u can use it whenever the word main comes into play
if you'd like, sure
it doesnt matter tho, to each his own.
just like how we say "Everypony"
I prefer to use it when I'm reffering to the task, really. But oh well, its personal preferance.
there is?
where?!?!
yeah, I'll get a link quickly.
personally, i think it's a bit over the top. but yeah, you can download it
or mac

I said suggestions twice,:P
Can you do that? :O
sorry, I'm
using a laptop
lets just say money isnt an issue
THIS THING'S KEYBOARD SUCKS!!!!
Oh, if that's really the case... hang on a sec.
well find the most expensive computer out there then
I'd say you spend around 15-1800
and I dont require mobility either
Ikr
money isn't an issue... just kill bond
Give me 1 billion dollars and Ill kill superman.
I say you just try to get a good factory set up
Hey bud, what's on?
no overclocked CPU or overclocked GPU
it's not worth it
thanks
Ooh.
if you can get a moderately sized SSD (not a HUGE one, you want it primarily for the OS + applications) go for it
SSD can be good, but it's rumoured that it can randomly wipe itself
I don't have any alienware PC's*
I run on a 5400 RPM disk, don't feel it's all that slow-
i trust in good old harddisks
they have was more rooma nyway
*way
sick-
Ponify looks cool
parts or no parts is highly subjective imo. if you like building, and can more regularly buy upgrades, parts can be nice... but it can be a hassle and challenging too
true-
if you're not comfortable handling parts, it might not be hte best idea
thats pretty cool
even if I haven't really been a nerd in that way for quite a while, I can still build a computer on my own
well, somewhat
he buit 5 computers
*built
Deus Ex?
Okay.
I remember putting in ram in my computer and instantly just smelling burnt computer
I had 96mb ram!
xD
WIN.
apparantely
Yeah, its also pretty fun to do takedowns on people.
Owned, biatch.
I think he's doing a no kill achievement
Well, stun gun is best on bosses in the campaign.
one time I wrote a poem 4 school, and at the end I just said "good enough" and handed it in. everyone kept likening it to dr seuss
I don't know the boss for this.
Ik, I was just wondering if he's reading this.
Hey everypony
lol
Lol
hai /Serenity
Ordered 2 pony t-shirts today.
we never had any dr seuss
my only knowledge from him is via simpsons

Mlponline?
I can't even play TF2
Not out yet, right?
Erm.. a 2d mmo, i don't want to be kicked for advertising.
Hah, barely.
Oh.
Unless I get permission from mods to talk aboutmlponline, I can't say anything.
eyup
I don't want to get kicked or anything.
That sucks.
that like an mmo or sumthin?
Fighting is Magic.
huh
Its ok
as well as games
And Ponykart!
I'm one of the spriters for MLPOnline.
I wanna play Ponykart!
To the batPC!!
Coo-
K I'm back lol
Wb.
yeah, but you know-
thanks :3
I want to play deus ex again.. I forgot how fun it is to sneak around on it.
most single purpose devices do
it might really cool though- I like buying software
ok
If only I had the money to buy software :D
Yar har...
Hehe
yup
not all software is too expensive- but when they are, you have themf or years
that would ping me
had i not turned them off
hehe
awesomesause
but! you can rent them for like.. 80 bucks a month
Aah
that looks AWESOME XD
huh
i dont remember this bit
in school you usually get a discount, or loan the school's license
this a DLC?
Yeah
it's more geared toward traditional animation anyway-
Wowee
Good boy.
Or girl, I guess.
there are alternatives, luckily
boy, yeah
Ok.
If u saw the plushie u would think it was worth it
yeah
must put plushie on to buy list when i start getting paid
Cool
like Cubase came with dvd's and cool box--and shit
Yeah, I've been watching a person on DA, hoping I'll get the money to buy one of their plushies.
They're amazing quallity, but start at around £80.
Wow.
but they would be worth it.
I'm in the UK, yeah.
Wish i can, but its a 4 hour drive alone, with traffic and costs, I can't go.
Erm.. yeah?
around nowrich, norfolk.
I wanna go to Galacon T-T
Yeah, 15 here too.
The same
being 14 is worse :P
I'm jealous of their gaming companies.
Being 14 is awesome
XD
ow my eyes burn brb
japan FTW
^
But at the moment, I'm starting as an indie developer.
level designing would be fun
Still working on my GCSE's. XD
ahh going that route
BEING 14 IS AWEEESOME
yea
I'm 23 and I still haven't bothered taking a license
Yeah, its a competitice area.
i wanted to be a programmer for about 12 years
and the industry did a MASSIVE shift in the last 2/3
I'm doing my finals next year too.
the reason for that is that 16 year olds need to be able to drive many places
to the point i dont see them making games anymore
yeah GCSE's
but at least, they don't let them drink :P
their citys dont allow for any other transportation
and the games are all crap atm
13http://i.imgur.com/urWey.jpg
13i have been here .-.
all the games are crap`? Indie?
which pack is that?
or is it a shader mod?
13painterly pack, with shader mod
hang on.... different coloured lights
HAAX
13the shaders are horribly slow though, trying to find one that's just shadows to add to the set i have running now
she could see out the side window
IKR
shadows are expensive
I wish miencraf wasn't java, and I wish it had shadows
sundials you mean
it has shadows
just not entity shadows
but to be honest, they really ruin the look when a mod adds them
hang on a sec
same as the high res texture packs
aah-
ALL of equestria.
but I want shadows for sundials-
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EU37kV-7e8&feature=relmfu
Oh, ok.. sorry.
whats the deal with the no vid links rule?
:(
eww hate motion blue in games
it's rude
no vid links while people stream
Ok, now I know.
same as DOF
brb
makes sense i guess
when there's no stream we can link anything that is safe for work
it does
both horrible things to have
o_o
I didn't know, I'm sorry.
is there a rules page somewhere?
s'alright
Lord of change
I haven't seen the rules page in a while, but for first time mods are nice and just tell you
Yup

Well that was easy.
This movie isn't unsalvageable. If they'd just sent it to a good editor to cut the Calpso subplot, make the characters' motivations more easy to follow, and get rid of the uneeded comic relief, this could have been a really good conclusion to the trilogy. Instead it's a muddied mess of plans and subplots and backstabbing and unlikable characters.
