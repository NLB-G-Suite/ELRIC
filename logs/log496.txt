Saturn: metalbending is just advanced earthbending, where you bend the impurities in the metal.
08,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: free electrons
Bend All The Things!
Metal Bending = I AM MAGNETO!!!
Metal Bending = Bender

whats an amon pony?
Asami rage
uh oh
That episode seemed a bit rushed
NO
i hate Nick's announcer
AANGMON
http://kevinsano.deviantart.com/art/Twikorra-299172616
found it
oh i just rememdered ive been looking up on devintart of diffrent version of media in pony form such as avatar :)
brb
dat maybe giveaway ;p
yes
this song
8,6lol
season finale is that soon? wow...
heres avatar pony http://fav.me/d4bnld1
of all songs
back :)
But then again, it's Amon
Proven in last airbender finally
Awwww... season finale. :(
wb Ponies 47
not likely
Amon is hax... all hax
amon is probbably a cyborg ;)
crashes every hour, on the hour basically
really, one would suspect Bloodbending to be nothing about willpower, unless you could .... counter bloodbend yourself?
kirzstyrfe umm, okay . . .
that seems like the best possible explanation
buff would have nothing to do with it
heres amon and twilight http://fav.me/d5156oy
00,10You are all wrong. it's iroh.
because it's actually said on Nick.com's background page that Tenzin is the only Airbender of aang and Katara's children.
I think I got diabetes
ok...i guess i gotta go finish from last ive seen avatar
/me bobs head
he left his daughter to reign as Firelord, and now travels the world as a peace ambassador
Twilight would die before losing her magic
OH BOY
WANT YOU GONE!
*sigh* already seen this
wow
well this should be interesting
00,10NullRadix cause much like metal bending, they have to feel the bits they can controll
oh did you think i ment you? :P
Amon doesnt have bending powers
How do we know?
