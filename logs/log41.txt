4Oh
4I thought DAMN was incoming
4And how do you know Ron Simmons?
11DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
11I posted a couple of DAMN responses in Ponychan.
4*secretly hopes Silver is a fan of WWE*
INFINITE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
11Not a *big* fan, but I watch it now and then for the enjoyment I anticipate after doing said activity.
11Sweetieception!
11We have to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
4I'm glad there's at least one person from the fandom that enjoys the show
12^^
Sweetie Belle, what have you done?
12Hi
ARTI! Hai
Did you divide by zero again?
11I like to laugh at how fake the punches look. But there's no denying it takes serious fucking skill to pull those aerial stunts and lift each other.
4Hah, I saved it as Sweetieception too
03Articuno
indeed
03have you heard Weird Al's new polka? XD
10Arti, I have a question about a thread
4I know Hip is one of the people that downright dislikes derelling
4Which is sad to me
why?
11Hipster: Is it any different from the SPiderman Spam you and I were doing?
12Nope
8yes
12and ok ^^
8its not as funny

03I need to fix this
4@Silver: absolutely. The punches can look really fake but it definitely takes skill to perform regardless
03this being gtsdll
4Funny?
4Just because you can apply text over a spiderman picture?
http://sebastianwolff.info/download/tron-legacy/Recognizer%20(orchestrated).midi <This too
8the spiderman image macros have variety and are generally funny, sweetie derelles are pretty much just the same pic with AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA written over it
06Night
11I agree though. Derelle is only funny when given the right context.
Night Espeon :3
12Yeh I'd lock it, it's so similar to "What's your favourite Pokemon", it just seems to be worded differently lol ^^

03LOL
4It's not just AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA by itself isn't the right wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAy to do a derelle
Open it in somewhere else?

4My sweetest friend

btw, how are we going to interview them when they flood the place?
:>
6One at a time?
4You opened yourself up for that one
6We could split them into seperate chats.
If there's nothing else that requires the mods here, I'm going to BBL.
That's what she said.
4Ask them all to fall in a single-file line
04meow
So?
4Dari, you can't leave
4Not yet
Hiss.
And just why is that? :P
No, not your line. :P
04I actually put in a cloud for my Flash :3
04:333
4Because the interview process
4Hip said between 4 and 7 PM EST
There aren't any more people to interview though.
4We still got an hour
4or so
That was an addendum to my last question. :P
So what should I do with this hour while I wait then?
Big major whoops
4Do what we're doing
4Loiter
No gas :p
I'm working on the Daily /oat/ post

10I could stare at that yellow all day
10But not too close

I thought we were gonna change it every week.
If I look at that yellow long enough I see orange
XD
03there
12Yellow never hurts my eyes
6*shrug*
03I just changed yellow into orange
03under mIRC colors

Alright then. works for me. :)

Yellow
Don't ban Skylands

8Whee
4Hopefully it won't be compromised if someone figures it out, but I doubt that'll happen
10I wish light green wasn't banned
10Teal~
;p
10Or if there was something brigther than the green (3)
12You can still use drf green XD

pfffff
silver: do it filly
I will, but not right now.
That's nice, but I don't really follow Dr. Seuss
hi Kosy ^^
having fun?
well
I think we should just
do it like we did the first time
recommend people we've interacted with before
i have 1 person in mind, but hes only come to 1 so far
is it !!PinkiePie?
no
4That would be pretty neat, though
i would ask, but i cant imagine she would have time between Ponychan moderating and IRL stuff
also, !!PinkiePie isnt a dude
yes, I figured that out
you mentioned "her" quite a bit
anyway
frankly that's what we're lacking
a female mod
WE'RE A SAUSAGEFEST
the person i had in mind is monsieur leflour
4WE NEED A FEMALE MOD
indeed
4But dude, what if she tries to take over or something -_-
mhm
7Hmmm...
7What should I name my female Shiny Aron? o3o
6I agree. We need a female mod.
6Add a question to the list of questions about gender? I think so.
Ghosties: it depends
if she has a nice ass, she can take over anyday, if you know what I mean
/me wiggles his eyebrows
/me is laughing his ass off

4Well

4Something went wrong
Hipster: how so?
4That's the message I receive
did you see when he came back?
he posted a link in a /meta/ thread that automatically set the creepy Pinkie Pie theme as your Ponychan background
and it would change back every time
had to clear my cache and cookies to get my Dash theme back
12Floof c:
4*snickers*
also, i calculated about how much time i spend on ponychan every week for a /meta/ thread
i am both proud and ashamed of the results

WELL

6WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHALE
6>>; wrong chat again...
lol
6I have like, 6 chats open.
4Just what are you guys talking about?
4In that other chat, Sprinks?
Now I have to edit your nick color again
STOP CHANGING YOUR IDENT GEEZ
Oh
my bad
6My mic sounds like a whale when it starts to fail.
:P
I think I'll stick with this one for a while
:P
so this should be the last time
6It's a failwhale.
my ident is boring
:(
Hmm
4This conversation is becoming increasingly bizarre
:D
Lol
That was my inspiration in fact
I tried to think of one of his summonings
i think just regular bizarre
right now I'm trying my best to make the actual chars on that generator
oh god, i want to make a handsome face derpy right now
muffins, i...
the dA one?
yeah
I made Apple Jack
looked pretty accurate
:D
Nice!
god, i wish i was decent at photoshop
it's hard to get the colors right
Yeah, I imagine that would be tough
just made fluttershy
:D nice
I think I did pretty alright
12crap
wait
we're in the wrong channel to be talking about this
XD
XD oh yeah
WHOOPSIES
NO ONE HAS TO KNOW
;D
ah well, RDX isn't here anyway
Sorry RDX!
:P
he can't hear you
Oh yeah
in that case
let us continue talking here
LET'S HAVE A PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
jk
/me calls up the one person who throws a party like no one else
*pony
"Yo, Pinkie, we got a job for you"
/me 7lols at Leafeon's last line lately.
who?
XD
6I wish I HAD photoshop
7Amazingly, that alliteration wasn't intended at all. O___o
Pinkie Pie of course! :D
im not good with anything that involves drawing or pictures
I'm back.
Hi, Silver
sup
11I'm back.
11I got something.
11http://i54.tinypic.com/2ey9d8i.jpg
11http://i51.tinypic.com/2553xhl.jpg
gotta feed all eleven of my dogs. I'll be right bacl
11Mimey Wisseu
back*
4o.o
4nope.avi
you know you guys
11eeeeyup
I'm about proposing to Barry to become a mod
lulz
6...why? Oo
11I don't know. How many BMNs has he been to? two, maybe three?
two at most i would say
11Sprinkles: why to me or why to Barry being a mod?
yes, but since he started coming, he has been a perpetual factor
maybe not now
but he definitely seems like someone who's always around
and that's one thing we need in our new batch of mods
silver: fukken saved
4perpetual factor?
I mean
he's always around
always
4For one, shouldn't he be interviewed at least?
most definitely
but I'm proposing asking him if he would like to be interviewed
lets give it another week at least
4I mentioned it earlier today *shrugs*
yeah
there's no rush just yet
you know
we should try doing the "interview" thing again
but instead of an interview
we should just develop a questionnaire
what about people we know from Ponychan who havent been to many?
the interested parties would fill them out and send them to the BMN mailing list
we review them and contact them accordingly
interesting
4Sounds much more efficient
actually, you know what, i like that idea
4Then we could actually probably interview the ones we like
we can narrow it down from that
SPIKE, TAKE A LETTER.
XD
then have a 2nd round of sorts where we interview them and do the pictures like we did today
4Well, yeah, that's what I said :/
i know, i was writing when you posted it
i dont look at my screen while typing
4Ah
4Gotcha
lets develop a questionnaire
we can put it in the pre-show announcements on friday and saturday
and i'll see if the mods will let me post a thing on /oat/ about it
yeah, a curriculum.
curriculum?
04XD
04nice Quan
/me also added clouds to his Flash
7Thanks?
7Ooh.
04They might lag >>;
7They move?
04unfortunately
04yep
04kinda in the same way as Black/White
7Yay, more details!
04but they're "expensive" clouds.
04I needed to add a blur to it and that costs some CPU power so on weak PCs it won't be pretty.
04Saved some power by blurring a gradient though; still eats up SOME space...
7o.o
7How does a DS do it in comparison to how you do?
12blah
actually, we could just put up a thread now, couldnt we?
04The DS uses a 3D field with animated textures.
04I'm using bloated vector-animating Flash.
Sorry. another computer crash
04Unfortunately Flash is the only not-exclusive-to-companies Vector animation program with a script language that I know of.
7Hrm.
7Can't help you there.
04:P
04You don't need to
04You asked a question and I gave an answer XD
interesting note
pretty much
you should also post in the FB and Twitter
>:
the RD-N group is pretty dead
that means matrix surround or quad can be kept intact with AAC compression at least
10Hi Chao
will do
hi chao~
so what should go on this questionnaire?
4Osha-Hello all!
4i'm sooooo happy! ^^
maybe
:<
11the same questions we ask in the interview.
i do know that with lower bitrates, yeaa, phase is touched
all of them?
4I think it shouldn't be too intensive
4my summer vacation has officially started!
<:
/me has been out since June 2
4Just keep with basic questions with a few "what would you do?" essay questions
4heh lucky
10All you late people
4well
4And then really hit them with more follow up questions in the interview
6The questionnaire should be basic.
4that's why we canadians are smarter :P
4Yep
I think the questionnaire should be intermediate
11 1. "what's your age" 2. "why are you applying?" 3. "How many BMN's have you attended" 4. "WHat's your thoughts on questionable material?" ect.
im not gonna do the essay questions in the questionnaire most likely
not too basic, not too intesnive
7Heya, Chao.
4What Silver put sounds good
we can save those for the in person interview
6lol age
to give us more ground to filter out applicants
also Silverscreen
11I haven't gotten anywhere on the pics yet
have you contacted the guys from the Fighting is Magic project?
4Hey man, I like to know with the age
11Been busy with the finals.
cause I got another idea for proposal
11Oh, no I haven't.
s'okay
just when you get the chance
11To be honest, I completely forgot.
make an appointment so they come here and we can talk
6I've been doing community research on the idea of a release party for it.
I'd like to propose a live-streamed Fighting is Magic tournament, as well
11There's an idea.
6And a lot of people say they would show up for it.
11Would we do it as part of a BMN or on a seperate occasion?
4OOOOOOOOH, DCD pretty much had a brilliant idea
6I think seperate occasion.
6And I agree with DCD
6May be a pain to set up, but would be amazing.
7Meepity.
4Yes, it would be awesome
4Beepity.
4I definitely wouldn't miss that
11So they'll actually have online fighting as a part of the game?
that' why we need to talk with them first, of course
they could help us, maybe set up a "spectator" app for us
yes, the FAQ establishes it has both Local and Online capabilities
6We really need to get into contact with these guys...
an appointment so we talk face-to-face with them would be best
6Definitely.
4Face-to-face?
4Screen to screen?
you know what I mean
yeah
Screen-to-Screen
4:P
that said
we could have a "debut" tournament
like those day-it-is-released tournaments for games in several stores
4Yeah
as well as a more serious tournament down the line
of course
4We definitely need to get in touch with these guys
we have to discuss prizes
beeping
beep
6Well, we'll figure that out when we get in touch with them.
11Selection of the next BMN movies and episodes of course.
6Well, yeah.
maybe a Madmax commission?
nah, too boring
we need something that makes even people from outside the BMN want to participate
it is, in a way, another way to advertise ourselves further
i like the madmax idea
how would we get her on board?
we could just pay her for the comission
hi aurora
most clear-cut method
>implying i have any money
11problem is that we'd need money to do it, unless we get her to be a part of this somehow.
yeah but we can't go just like HEY MADMAX WANT TO BE PART OF A PROOOOOOOOOOOJECT?
although
hmm...
I think
TGTF knows her
4Osha-Hello Aurora
quite well in fact
4i made up a name for my gargoyle today
I'll ask him to see if he could put word for us
when the tournament stuff is discussed
4Who's TGTF?
4Aeroanguis
11what's the name of the game?
7Sounds like Aeroangus. o.O
a bro
from #mylittlepony
4MLP: Fighting is Magic
The Good TripFag
4Ah
well
Hi, guys
we also need prizes for the other rankers
as well as different prizes for both tournaments...
i wish we had some kind of merch to give away
like a plushie or something
I wish I had a PO Box
8hi
4Barry you're always here, aren't you?
8sorry, we're kind of in our own little world lol
whys that?
oh
got the questionnaire written up
What is your age? What timezone do you live in? How many Brony Movie Nights have you attended? Do you have any previous moderating experience? Do you have any experience with IRC? Why do you want to become a Brony Movie Night mod? What kind of "questionable material" would you ban and what would you allow? Be specific (i.e. don't just write "No Rule 34
4i know
anything you guys want to add?
yeah, ever since I learned about this site, I've visited it everyday
4honestly though, i thought the latin word for snake would be something like serpia
4I think "Why do you want to become a Brony Movie Night mod" would be more appropriate for an interview, but that's just me
we can go more in depth during the interview
get a little deeper, as it were
7Alternate translations.
4What room does that leave for an interview?
4oh yeah
im not expecting people to write a paragraph for that question
4forgot about that
11Sounds good to me.
we can ask followups in the interview too
/me 4smacks his forehead
/me 7asdfs.
7I wish my Endeavor Aron worked outside of wi-fi matches. XD
4Well, I guess it looks fine
dcd? sprinkles?
4Are they gonna be sending their responses to the Brony State gmail?
yeah
6Looks good to me.
I fullheartedly approve
ok
also
when we get emails
hi Chao
and hi Quan :>
4don't know what that or asdf means
if you guys look through them, star any good ones so the rest of us know to look at them
7Hey, Aero.
6Sounds good.
how's things? ^^
7Look at where asdf is on the keyboard.
oh ok
tis where your fingers go :>
okie dokie loki, ill write it up and post it quick

"Hello, DevTeam. My name is Silverscreen and I'm speaking to you on behalf of Brony Movie Night and Brony State. The staff of BMN has taken notice of this game in development of yours and wish to make a proposal to you regarding both of our projects and a possibly involving others as well. If you wish to take us up on this proposal,
please send us an email at BronyState@Gmail.com so that we can schedule a meeting within BronyState.

havent seen anyone sign up since you posted that
also, this is exactly what i feared
?
the thread isnt gonna get a lot of responses, so it sank like a rock right off the bat
4Give it time
4He just posted it
4It really needs to be stickied, quite frankly.
I bucked it.
6Though the mods will likely move it when stickying it if it does get stickied.
Haha
Oh fox news
I like how they use pictures of the old toys
yeah
mods wont sticky it
okay guys
we need to
and if we ask, it will bring attention to it which will cause them to move it in all likelihood
acquire a site or program in which we can make the tournament ladder
what are you thinking
6Ladders are easy.
?
6I think I actually have something... one moment.
like a bracket or a ranking system based on points?
There we go.
hey prom haha
what the
http://challonge.com/tournament/bracket_generator
bracket
Yo.
Tada
8suddenly, people
You're not the only one who checks the threads on a semi-religious basis.
I was just seeing what this was since I'm not all cool and up to date on the pony community.
okay so
yeah I'm at work so I do anything but
PEOPLE!
what should we make it?
Hey SS
Single Elim, Dub Elim, or Round Robin?
hmm that's a bit WWII
single elim
more dramatic
and Anu haha
And Anu
6Single elim, would we do a battle for 3rd?
yeah
that
So... what is this
Monkeyjay: We host a weekly stream which hosts two movies and two MLP episodes which are chosen by our viewers.
4This is for the Fighting is Magic game right?
oh :)
yep
The stream happens every Friday @ 7PM EST and every Saturday @ 2PM EST
how will we seed?
we'd do a battle for the 3rdç
random?
I suppose Random Seeds would be it
We get as many as 300 bronies every friday. Saturday viewings are new, so we don't get as many.
wait
6Of course random.
I mean
everyone's gonna be a newb
would we be doing this as soon as the game is ready for release?
Hi, guys!
6Pretty much.
I was at one about a week ago.
Nice :)
gah, why was that?
ok, then random would be the way to go
Best Night Ever, Aladdin, Starship Troopers, I believe the lineup was.
That violate some rule or something?
That was the last one, yea.
haha that's some good movies :P
6Oh hey Prominence
4I'll just let you guys talk this out then, I'm not very good with brackets and the like hehe
Hello.
4Aha
4monkeyjay
4Wait
Guest8046788: The name is registered by somepony
i was thinking if we had more, we could have a series of matches leading up to the tourney to determine seeding
4Aren't are you the lead programmer on Fighting is Magic?
Correct.
we're the devteam
COOL!!
no I'm ONE of the lead animators
4Nice
6Well, that was fast.
this is where being a sports management major comes in handy :D
or part of the devteam
4Awesome
We heard you were making us an offer we couldn't refuse...
Well
Prominence is main programmer person
So we wanted to check you out.
well....that was faster than I expected.
And came to find out about it.
4Ahhhh, sorry about that mixup then
that'd be good for the actual srs Tournament
no prob. I'm jsut the most vocal
6Wow, they got here quick.
yo DCD
for the "Game Launch Tournament"
we'd have to go with seeds
the dev team is in the main room
Ah. I misread that statement.
he can't shut up. no matter how much we tell him to
cos I don't listen to the others telling me not to post things.
Thought it was addressed to me.
holy shit, they got here fast.
yeah
I have to spend the night in the brig
whoah that was really fast
hmm how do you change your name here?
02!pokemon'
8 /nick
6"/nick name"
02!pokemon
anon: /nick yournamehere
You need a new name derpyhooves..
02!setgen 5 off
Generation 5 is now off for your nick, Ray||MH!
02!pokemon
Ray||MH, you are a 11Grumpig.
Dj Derpy Hooves fine?
/me doesn't mind
thing is I use that for pretty much everything pony related
4I'm sure it isn't registered
6It doesn't accept spaces, just fyi
4So sure
What was wrong with DJ PON3? D=
Anon: it's used by someone else, aparently, so you have to change it.
DCD, you might want to use color in the main room
/me bows
well because I'm listed as Derpy Hooves in the faq
Just go HerpyDooves
4Anyways, it's great to see you guys here
although that has Herpy in it..
9Gentlemen. I believe business talks are in order.
4Yep
Indeed.
8Quite
Aye
DCD, I am disspoint.
It's Gentlecolts
6As might you, Silver
how dare you assume we are gentlemen
9I guess I'll go straight to the point.
guess this is what i get for going by an overused name haha
8Silver, i am disappoint
8no color
9I apologize, I am channeling Miles Edgeworth here
9in any case
11Touche
9to put it simple
11Niiiice.
11done.
9we'd like to organize a few events centered around your wonderful project.
9the most important one being a tournament
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 13Steelix.
9which would be streamed live, here. Hence why we wished to speak with you.
9to be more specific
9we wished to organize for you, first, a launch party, or as close as one could get to making one over the internet.
11The tournament would, obviously, be from your game. We were thinking of doing it as a special release event of it.
02brb
4seeya
9in the launch party, we'd like doing a "Game Launch Tournament", akin to those held in many game retail outlets once new fighting games are released
11We make streaming a serious business, yo.
fa sho
Is that so?
9at a later date, we'd also like to establish a more "serious" tournament as well
also, i can take the lead on organizing the event
Where has this research taken place, out of curiosity?
i have a background in event management as a result of my sports mgmt major
6Outside of ponychan, in small groups that I am a part of.
11I can design some sort of poster or something for it.
9of course, there'd be prizes for the winners, and we'd handle the organization of said event.
11An announcement flyer, perhaps
14So we'd just be... approving, basically?, or saying we support it?
9Now, we do not wish to brag, but we do get a pretty hefty amount of attendees to our current flagship event, the Brony Movie Night
8I have a background in event management, so I can take the lead on organizing it
9wellllllll...yes and no
6Well, we'd be giving you perks or something for allowing it.
I mean the thing is it's a fan game made for the community, so you can pretty much do anything you like with it once it's out!
9since it's a Launch Game Party, there'd be two options
Not to say we don't appreciate you asking us.
We're very honored by it.
9I was thinking of having the download link for the game be released here first, at a certain time, quite like commercial releases.
14Early release?
and it's probably far too early for us to yay or nay an exclusivity "contract" if that makes sense. and to echo prom - yeah we are still buzzing about the attention it's gotten.
8anukan, you have to switch to white
9additionally, there is also another thing we must ask you
0Okay
but he's not
11It's ponies. Of course it'll get attention.
8we have a script set to autokick after 3 color posts by non-mods
9we do know there's an online mode
9however, we must ask if there's a spectator mode
9as we'd be streaming this tournament
9I mean, tournaments
0There is
9ergo, we'd have a live feed of the tournament, right there to the left
0It's in our FAQ, I believe... unless I forgot to add that...
9perfect!
hehe yeah we weren't quite expecting 6 figure views on our tiny pre alpha vid though XD
9in any case, we wished not for an early release
It's REALLY hard to see your text, Anu.
it's white now!
9but rather, say that the game is completed on a certain date, and you will release it to the public
6We are aware that you may have some time before it is ready for release, which is why we wished to talk to you so far in advance about this.
0they told me to! D=
And then everyone screamed when they found Wheatley and Nightmare Moon in the car with tentacles.
Ohai
6You can make it black.
11lol
9the game is set to be released in, say, two days officially, at, say, 12 AM
4again with tentacles in a car?
6Hypothetically.
4tsk,tsk,tsk
8sprinkles, did you turn off the autokick script?
9we could have one of you devs take control of the stream and show us live footage of the game in action
6I did not.
6dari might have...
8it will kick him if he posts in black then
6It ignores black and white.
Tentacles in a car
8oh nm then
And perhaps whatever color this is?
9or you could have one of our expert streamers do it for you. Basically, to add a sort of "live hype" for the game, as the countdown to release progresses
8go ahead then anukan, my mistake
/me randomly stuffs Tentacruels into several cars
So I can post spoilers then?
0Huh. It automatically made it white.
Well I don't mean to toot our collective horns, but would it be a problem if say 1 or 2 thousand people turned up to watch? or 5 or 6 thousand? I few days ago I would say I was exaggerating..
6It likely wouldn't be much of an issue if a lot of people attended.
11It'd be a hell of a turbo chat.
6At worst, we would simply seperate them into multiple chatrooms.
11BUt we're used to that.
4Hopefully my net would be able to take it
I probably couldn't join.. being in NZ haha
but anyway
4But yeah, we'd probably separate into separate rooms for that many
4lol repetition -_-
I don't know about an early release, but some sort of launch party might be fine.
it's a cool idea :)
but.. so early that it's hard to thumbs up it for certain
6Yes, which is why we just ask you keep in touch.
11Our email is in the post provided, but here it is again anyway: BronyState@Gmail.com
I don't think that's unreasonable at all
yay they're all downloaded now
8quick question, do guys have any kind of ballpark figure for when it will be done?
except for boast busters
because that one was stupid
also of course we'll provide a unique dlc character for the winner
jsut kidding Anu :)
Which one was that one?
I was about to say.
4Pretty much, we realize that things are still early on but we wanted to give you guys the heads up about it. It would be a tremendous collaboration between our two projects and I think it would give us both excellent exposure
HAHA
was that the Apple Jack vs. RD one?
8thats what i figured
projects?
that was the one with TRIXIE DA MAGNIFFUHSENT
Sorry i joined late
oh yeah
11We've also discussed bringing others into it like some DA artists for prizes.
I agree
that was like
the worst pony episode
that one was one of, if not the, worst
so boring
as far as release date.. hmm
Silverscreen: y-your not a bot...
8specifically Madmax, if she is interested
9namely, madmax, but that's just tentative
Ballpark figure? We were hoping to get it done by the start of Season 2. The initial 6, at least. That's looking a tad unlikely at this point, however.
8GET OUT OF MY HEAD DCD
/me 11looks down at his flesh, "not that I remember..."
Unless we really get revved up.
I'd say this year would be as close as I'd estimate for the mane 6
So what are we talking bout here
8ok, i just wanted to get a general idea
Aye.
speaking of madmax
anyone know what happened to her?
you mean 'boxing' day
9well, that's no problem at all. I mean, of course we understand that a project like this will obviously take time
monkeyjay: *main ಠ_ಠ
I'm relatively confident we can get it out by the end of the year.
/me 4randomly takes them out
11Glass_Arm: Brony State wishes to do a launch party tournament for Fighting is Magic.
:o
A large portion of our issues have just been unexpected technical delays.
I meant mane haha. That's the accepted term. even though I may not agree :)
It's online game!
wow
I think that would be a great idea
9but that only gives us more time, Prominence, to organize everything
9here in BronyState...we're kind of early planners
9we're already organizing everything to have S2 simultaneous streams with the Hub
9for we have no viewer nor quality limit
Streaming the Hub?
6Live, yes.
I donzt agree
8for S2 episodes yes
Oh
...
Hmmm
nah
Hasbro loses money
8anyway
They deserve money for an awesome show
It's mainly for people who don't have the Hub.
ie most other countries
...
oh
8developers, is this going to be a freeware game or will you be charging for it?
Mexico doesn't get it. Without streams, FiM'd be GUIless.
free
Freeware.
8ok
Not like we could charge.
haha
We're not even accepting donations.
We'd get sued out of our pants.
9Glass_Arm: it doesn't work that way bro
8thats true
And drawers.
there's no legal standpoint where we could charge for it
and into new pants
Ok I'm with this idea
9Mexico doesn't get it. Without streams, MadMax and Ottanta would not draw stuff
There were 13 people in spyrochat today.
8i was going to suggest one of the prizes would be a copy of the game, but that doesnt make sense if its already free :)
I wouldn't be here without downloading it either
who?
9nor does Panama, so we wouldn't get me as a streamer
haha
8but anyway
9well
8we will work out the planning on our end
9if we want to go full retard
9I am pretty buddy-buddy with CustomAnon
WOW
9so I would ask her if she'd take a commission from me
8what does she do? art?
9she does the ballsiest MLP toy customs
8ah ok
8oh
wow
8before i forget
8our email is BronyState@gmail.com if you want to contact us about the event or w/e
Cute things
Got it already.
8ok, cool
Hipster_Brony: Thanks
4Osha-Hello Ray~
11DA is down, aparently. "Internal server error
Not for me.
9in any case, mon fréres! What do you think about organizing a release party? Should that not be within acceptable parameters, we'd go straight into organizing for the big tournament
7Hrm.
7Can I show you my sprite I'm working on and if you think I'm going overboard with the design?
6...suddenly dari.
8little late there sprinkles
it'll probably be back up soon
I fell asleep while waiting earlier.
DA seems to DA all the time
that, plus a special SHE'S MY CHERRY PIE banner for the tournament edition
good idea
02Hi~ Chap
*seems to be down
As long as it doesn't cost anything, and there's no profit involved, I have no objections.
02Chao*
8there wont be
02(Chap, lmfao)
11We've been running BMN for free for the past month
8Brony State is all volunteer
6Over that.
11No profit or anything.
yeah I can see you've kept it ad free
8hell, we'd probably get sued even worse than you guys if tried to monetize this
which is always nice
Fandom usually doesn't charge
8the RIAA is an angry group
11All the ads you see are from the web and chat server.
4may i see, Quany?
04Quan
04lookie
oh wait, forgot I have adblock running
11They need to learn about love and tolerance.
derp
8in any case
6There's only one ad. XD
8for the big tournament
go on
8we can set up some sort of ranking system
8put it online like the GET rankings
How many participants are we projecting?
8and then the top people get to enter the tournament
11Well, BMN on average gets 300 viewers on its own a week.
7It is slightly slower....
11So....possibly a lot.
8based on the viewership of the pre-alpha video, i'd say there will be a lot of people
The game got more hype than we planned with the Video, though... Not bragging, or anything, but it'd be a lot.
8A LOT
11wat?
7Was that bouncing HP there before?
I say elimination
11AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LOT!
11That's what we figured.
eyup
Ranking system, huh?
11Do it with a Tournament Bracket
a different banner to replace the Brony State one during the event
Brackets
6After the initial tournament. For a follow-up one later on.
8yeah
9I say Tournament Bracket, Double Elimination
9for a single reason
Wait, are the games 1 on 1?
9the excitement of a turnabout!
6We'll have brackets for the release. And a ladder for later.
8the initial one would have to be random seedings since people won't have played before, other than you guys
9derp I meant Ladder
4omg
4tabunne!
any way we can mute glass_arm?
We are so early in development we can't even really speculate on the final numbers. Interest might die off, it might pick up, we'll know as we get closer to the end and release more videos etc.
Oh good
I haven't played
6We'd have to mute the chat and give the others voice.
You added the motion blur L:D
HOW HAVE YOU GUYS PLAYED
8no one has except the developers
6>>;
9we haven't
9it's in development
9we're merely organizing
9for when it IS released
imokaywiththis.jpg
Like i say a lot we would have been out by a factor of 10 or 20 if we were asked to speculate how much attention our little thrown together vid would get.
Lol.
lets do it
Hipster_Brony: Who is 'you guys'?
hes derailing conversation
Yeah, at maximum?
us guys
I figured we'd get MAYBE 10K views.
glass
Largely due to EqD.
yeah haha
8you guys = developers
monkeyjay: Promo vid?
Hipster_Brony: Which devs r in here?
9well monkeyjay
<--
<--
6If he keeps up.
^
what does this mean!!
Chime should check for lag and music repeat
XD
...Thank you.
6Now you guys can talk with the channel muted.
ohhhs
9by the time FightIM is released yeah
04LL :D
9in any case
6Less interruptions.
8only the Brony State staff and the developers can talk now
/me strethes in the AC
9well
04and Quan I think so
hai Chime
9thing is
04and yes I told you
9by the time FightIM is released
oh right
04slightly slower cuz of the clouds
12ew weather
12EW weather
9we'll have a LOT of experience dealing with numbers in the quatruple digits
12>_<
04Either no clouds or clouds and lag
04Aurora :D
04hi
12hai Roara
9we've handled 300 viewers pretty well
12VVERY EW weather
12-V
9by the time we hit the thousand mark, we WILL find ways to handle them
I didn't even notice the clouds O.o
/me 12wrings herself out
So yeah, remove cloudies XD
I reckon we should set up an IRC server for that.
Well we'd have to put out some polls on our site or youtube channel closer to release to gauge numbers.
I'm sure there's a way to throttle messages if you're running the network yourself.
04Sure XD
Or add a option
9yes. By that time, we'll need to divide in rooms. As much as I hate to admit it, that's the most viable course of action
04well eh
04hm
also I'm more worried about the players than the watchers haha
It'd be the Website, Jay... Youtube'd give us fake numbers.
oh true
6How so, jay?
9we could divide the rooms and name them after Mane Six members
8glass arm ragequit after we muted him
well how many people would be playing?
04I'm thinking I don't just want this to be an HD Pokémon Black/White battle but a Pokémon battle based off of Black/White
LL! Hai!
*glomp*
:3
04With my own little touches
04:3 sound good?
12hai Chao
9how to divide the people into which rooms, now that is the million dollar question
11We can put a poll on the Brony Facebook page.
6A poll. Precisely.
I know there's one EVO player who's interested, at least.
Not sure what is the difference, but sure XD
Well I reckon we can get Behrudy to play. he seems keen and has a lot of followers (also seems like a genuinely nice dude)
My laptop is acting up right now
8are we talking about finding out how many people would play?
...
Wow, Jay.
Too synced today.
Flash lagger and Youtube
haha <3
but i have to keepcoming back to the haype lag
hype*
Still working on that HD Pokémon thing?
between the initial buzz and the final release
12o.o
4aaaaaa!
9Also
8we can help you guys a little with that
4Tabunne used a Full Restore :P
we are still reeling over what to do about the now tens of thousands of eyes on our project and how to release publicly going forward
11Well, if you continue to release update vids like the last one, we can show them at BMN preshow and keep the buzz going.
4i thought PKMN didn't know how to use items
/me 4flees
Heh
9big tournament should probably take place when a few DLC characters have been released
we also want to work on the game XD
8EQD will continue to post you too
2oops
04sheeeeeena
Yeah.
9if you need advertising
yeah i have a feeling we won't have a problem finding people to link us now
9believe me, that isn't a problem, and we'd be glad to help
At the moment, MY biggest concern is still having time to work on the game.
/me hugs
xD
haha
I'm at my actual job right now
not getting paid XD
11Prominence: meaning you're worried that the release date will keep moving back.
8i know that feel bro
well it's sorta why we aren't giving a release date..
Indeed. This past days have really distracted us from game. We suddenly have to go everywhere, plus we have our paying jobs and other duties
Sorta that, and sorta simply that we've been handling PR for a whil- yeah.
11I swear, I think I should have gone into business instead of filmmaking. XD
What Anu said.
Lies
8my recommendation is to not mention anything about a time frame for release
plus I keep replying to youtube comments
04okay that's it
!leafeon
which I swore I would never do
04wait
04>>
dang
04I SAID WAIT
...
Down that path lies only madness, my friend.
OK
Well, actually...
OK
04thank you :3
we might have given a rough estimate to a certain source already.
I swear there's a line in a film that's something like that.
Oh wait.
12o.o
8just work on it til you have it finished, releasing updates occasionally
11How about this: after today's meeting, you all just focus on your meetings, and let us handle the PR and advertising as much as we can.
04there
9well, if you guys are having so much time window troubles, again, we'd love to help you with everything related to PR. We could do at least that much.
/me now belongs to Aurora for 6 minutes
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 18 minutes
04X3
...
11DCD: Herdmind.
04!Aurora
9well, we can't do the PR by ourselves
/me hides
oh my god I actually love what I'm making
:>
!everyone
well you must see the possible danger in saying any sort of release date
D:
which owns a bree
8then announce like 2 weeks before you release that it is finished
:D
04you therefore win :P
!the world
/me forcibly owns everyone forever
especially this early in development
9since we need to keep close contact and follow the path in PR you guys wish for us to follow
therefore I own bree
04XD
/me owns the world for infinite minutes
8exactly
12o-O
2!ChaoAqua
no really I haven't felt this fantastic about a video in a while
oh my god
this is so good
4imagine that worked
8like i said, dont mention release date to anyone until you are done
Yay!
I can't wait to see it
8because if you hit a snag and have to push it back, people will lose interest
12OH
12anbsgfjdb
11You all make it sound so hard. There is a simple method to this: Show short vids and give vague info until you're ready to give all the news that you want to give.
/me 12unlocked boss Gauntlet mode
12o3o
It's a cat because it talks
8^pretty much this
Therefore, cats talk.
Meow.
11Game developers in the major leagues use this method all the time.
9but Silverscreen
12yes
12no
9they don't want to be Valve
12maybe so
9GAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNN
LL beat MQ already!?
o-O
11lol
speaking of gabe
We're actually having to tread carefuly with PR, since lack of information does us more harm than to a big gaming company.
9Most certainly
It's a delicate balance.
9that said
Now, if you mean advertising...
11There's a way around that too. Giving info and Giving exposure are two very different things.
11It's called Advertising.
9a good idea would be a Facebook page, which is a tried and true method for keeping people up to date with whatever development there is
12nono
Ugh. Never been a fan of Facebook. Thing is, you're more or less right.
/me 12only beat the Deku Tree thus far ^^;;;
12but
8heres what im going to recommend
11And then you'll have us to spread the news on what information you put up there.
12I beat all the boss challenges
12which were TOO easy
12 32min for Twinrova
8small, but fairly frequent updates like game footage and stuff
9the thing one has to do, is be honest
12honestly?
11Not to mention that I'm part of The Daily /oat/, which gives you even MORE publicity.
8maybe character builds, moves, stuff like that
12took me slightly less than 5
XD
9if there are no updates, well, "there are no updates for X and Y reasons"
12and Bongo Bongo
9we're busy, ecetera
9after all
12less than a minute
12|3
cause you're the master at LoZ games LL
;3
12:3
also a twitter as all the kids are doing these days
9you are not a professional company, and nobody would be bothered by some delays
12not quite
9after all
12at least
9DELAYS
9derp
12not YET
9I mean
9GIFT HORSES
9MOUTHS
9ECETEROO
12o3o
O_o
12and the 3 Heart Challenge
11Twitter isn't *as* popular as FB, as far as I've seen.
XD
9yeah
I guarentee you wont make the 3 heart challenge\
we actually have gotten fairly good advertising from TWitter word of mouth.
/me RUNS
9but of course we could give exposure in all possible venues
We don't have one, but the game video link keeps getting passed around in twitters.
11Yeah, but if that word of mouth reaches FB, you're sure to blossum.
12Orly
12my only nemisis
12*nemesis
Well, we got linked in two or three pony FB pages, and it didn't seem to do much for us, speaking honestly.
12will be the Iron Knuckles
11I'm feeling waaaaaay too optimistic about all this, for some reason.
8 125 likes on facebook, 3 twitter followers for us lol
8EQD is the key
12 4-Heart damage in a single hit ._.
12aka OHKO
XD
6XD
9the other key is it being SPECIFICALLY geared towards the development of your game
8and once it gets closer to release, you can probably get a sticky on Ponychan
/me 4wants Luigi's Mansion so badly...........
4*2
8quick question:
4who you gonna call? luigi!
I want Portal 2
8how secretive do we want to be about this tournament for the time being?
9open secret
9I mean
9no other choice
Moderately, I'd say. We don't to burn out the hype candle too much.
9since Glass_Arm already knows
9however, we just don't go around talking about it
for the time being yeah as prom says
6Well, we can't say it'll definitely happen.
9if someone asks us about it, we say "we're looking into it"
6Obviously.
11So it's just casual knowledge and word-of-mouth then.
the first game was amazing <3
6For the most part.
8for now
Luigi's mansion i mean
No direct mentions, though.
Confound has been taken over by bronies.
"We'll look at possibly setting up some kind of tournament at some stage" may even bee to un-vague
so you can't really mention anything
hell I joked about stuff and poor anu got like 16 emails
4yuu wanna know what i wouldv'e said to that?
6I've said nothing about a tournament in my researching, only asking about the idea of a release party.
9we don't mention anything. We just don't deny or confirm anything if asked.
8im going with, "we have fun and exciting events planned for the future"
8not gonna mention the game or the tournament or anything
9or we could ask Barry and Glass_Arm to keep quiet about it
9also
9another
9very important thing
that'd be confirming it.
yeah dont ask anyone not to tell haha
optimism can be quite a good thing
9another thing
9very important
9that we have to consider
is team t-shirts
I agree
9heh
12o.o
9well
6I like t-shirts.
8glass arm is a troll, if we tell him to be quiet, he will tell everyone
o.o
What.
9I actually meant
Err
6And if he tells, well, he's a troll.
You guys know I won't be here at all for the a week starting Friday right (no for real this time :P)?
9we have to consider how we'd like to handle the Release Party Tournament
Also LL, i havent played any OoT today D;
6Yes.
yeah
Ok, good.
9as well as analyzing how big the file for the game is
9and how to distribute it
9too many people dling at the same time
9equals slow dl speed
9unless it's a torrent
/me 4would've said: WHO CARES ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT!

04Why have I never heard of this game before
We don't have an estimate in sixe just yet.
4um
4beeeeeeeeeeeeeeecause
size*
lets jsut say if 1% of the viewers download it that's still about 700 gigs
/me 12...
12that title
12sounds familiar
very roughly estimating the size of the release. which is almost .. impossible
rendering the first pieces now; then I'll have to render them together since I started out in separate areas.
I would almost be certain it would be about 300megs
above******
above****
this is the pony AMV?
I'm so fucking proud so far
9also we have to consider how we'd like to handle the Release Tourney. Would we be announcing it before the party? Or announce it at the party so it's more spontaneous?
4looks alot like lego
YUPPPP
what song are you using?
/me 12lols
12it does
8heres what i think
9additionally, if we establish such a tourney, we would have to give a time window so the tentative participants manage to download the game
flawless - george michael
and practice.
well that's why I was concerned about who actually plays in the tourney..
8release on a monday
12inb4 it's released for 3DS
it's a zelda-esque rpg developed/published by Atlus made for the PS3
o
8give people time to download/practice with it
9no, not practice. That's why the "Release Tournament" is a beautiful thing
9it's like
Pony AMV is best AMV. :P
9"I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT I'M DOING AWW YEAH"
8ok
11LOL
8i see what youre saying
I hope you guys like it I'm so pleased so far
9like
12ah
9"GAME IS OUT. PREPARE FOR TOURNAMENT. NOW."
:D
9they're pretty common
9there were many of those when MK9 was released
9and it makes things pretty exciting
8it might be hard with thousands of people downloading though
9in any case it would make the two tournaments very different
oh also
my mom brought me home the snivy mcdonald's toy
:D
9well, that's why I think we should recommend torrent download
he's soooo cute
9more downloaders = possibly better speeds
I should get at least one of those
it might be fun to throw in some ringers who know how to play, we will probably have to reconsider our beta testing process considering the amount of people that we predict will use it.
But I never eat at McDonald's
8ill leave that stuff to the people who know things about computers
tomorrow, on my lunch break
like I said you don't even have to eat there you could go to mcdonalds ask to see the toys that they're selling and buy one for a dollar each
We were actually planning, And, I think it's in the FAQ, to offer more than a downloading system; Torrent was already considered, but it seems it just became our main one.
I'd imagine having a few members of the dev team could make it more interesting
oh yeah, you did tell me that
*participate
6Of course we'd love to beta for you. :p
4i hope mario will be re-marionapped in LM2
If I ever go there I'll have to get one
but yeah back to the tourney format. what were you envisioning?
9oh Sprinkles
9you card
can you ask for a specific one?
9well
I'll give you one otherwise
10 people? 100 people?
9basically when tournaments like those are held
which one do you want?
you can but they probably won't know the names
round robin? knockout? a by each?
you can ask like "number one or number two" etc
9we'd take all applying participants, single elim
or just ask to see the different figures and they'll show you
6Basic bracket format.
9well, I mean for the Release one
9for the Main one
then broadcast just he quarter finals etc?
9Bracket Format, for a few days, then finally a ladder for the higher ranking ones
right
9nah, we'd broadcast all matches.
well yeah that's what I mean haha
9by that time we'd have enough streamers to cover all the bases
it's a bobblehead
6Likely, jay, depending on how many matches there are, we'd broadcast all of it over a large span of time.
9simultaneous fights? Simultaneous streams.
10 people is 5 matcches simultaneous?
or the pikachu
...and a 24/7 stream going.
100 people.. ?
haha
his cheeks light up
cool
What does the Snivy do?
9believe us, we're pros, yo
There's a pikachu one?
you roll him on the table/ground/etc and his head goes up and down
D: then
8heres another option
Sorry guys, I was eating dinner
What's happened so far? Has the FiM team agreed to the launch party and tournament?
haha
cool
who was script?
Ghosties: pretty much
and of course I need snivy everything b/c he's the best
8we're discussing the release tourney, yes?
monkeyjay: Challenge accepted. :P
haha
6Though we don't know when, since they don't know when.
9well of course all fights will not be simultaneous
9additionally, accounting for the time limit
me and prom will commentate ;)
What's going on now, I see something about streaming 24/7
9we can have a good estimate of how we could schedule the fights
Alright, hold on.
6We're talking about how the release tourney will work with there possibly being a TON of people in it.
9great idea! we could have you commentating through Skype
9unless you wanna take a hands-on approach
9and have us teach you how to operate the stream
no idea. jsut a silly idea :)
9BronyState: the town bicycle stream
9well, for the ladder, it would be a great idea
First of all.
6Probably. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
HAHA
04That gave me an idea.
04Mario in that game
We're still not sure about this.
Any of it.
04with a sword
04XD
yeah
This is largely a discussion about the possibility.
04People already made Link models, LL
crossing bridges when we come to them
/me runs
yup "_
Depending on the situation, more like jumping off that brdige when you come to it. :P
While initially it sounds good, we're still getting starting on this. There's no particular commitments we can make in good faith.
11Which we agreed is a go for the time being, since there's still so many "ifs" involved
actually we should probably open a sign-up period a few days before the party
so we can schedule the fights
12O_O
considering a round lasts 90 seconds tops
yep pretty much nailed it prom
we can account for three rounds
yes
Advertising is fine. WHEN it's appropriate.
I gotta go for dinner be back in a bit to post that preview
plus I gotta get back to work I've alreayd cost my self about 4 overtime hours
270 seconds
At the moment, it isn't.
one thing we will absolutely NEED is pre-registration
ect.
3o.................k
9ONE OF THE MANY POSSIBILITIES
A tournament, also fine. When IT is also appropriate.
9OF THE PONYTINUUM SHIFT
which we can do via the brony state gmail account
but yeah. Great idea. we will be in touch. we need to do a lot more work first :) nice meeting you all! talk later I'm sure!
11We got it down as this: You guys focus on the game. We can help with your PR as much as we can without giving out too much info, and when we have more solid information we'll start talking about specifics.
once we know exactly how many people we have, we can figure out a format
Basically, we need to continue on our course, and judge how we're moving along in further detail before anything beyond those two things can be acertained.
prom and anu see you tonight if I get off work at a reasonable time..
9yes, most definitely. We're just glad we got to communicate these ideas to you
PR, I wouldn't say even that yet.
basically we haven't agreed on anything yet
Showing movies we release, perhaps.
because it's way too early too agree on anything
8at the moment, we're basically just showing you what we can offer for your project
Jay's the talkative one, but I'm the game's primary programmer and director. I don't want to pull rank, but I just want to clear some things up.
11We're listening.

04XD
9go ahead, my friend
11Nine brains in the room trying to bring more to the world of ponies.
11SO....AWESOME! /)^3^(\
Basically, while I like the idea in general, some of the specifics aren't as appealing. I've mentioned a couple of those before, but the big thing is the PR issue. At the moment, we'd feel better if it was done in house. Answering questions and responding and whatnot. However, a tournament which you advertise and organize, sponsored by us, I see no problem with.
That's the long and short of it.
9well, certainly
8of course
9the PR thing was just if you guys needed to get some weight off your shoulders
11What about us advertising for you and helping you keep people buzzed for this project?
6Or if you'd like us to stream videos you put out during our weekly streams.
9of course, if you need any help with PR, we'd be glad to help you at that moment, you'd just need to give us the word
8exactly
As I stated. Advertising via images and movies we put out? Fine.
Heck, I'd say that I wouldn't be too opposed to your own advertisements, provided they were approved by us.
In general, I'm cool with advertising.
So that, we're in agreement on.
8we have contacts and an audience, so if you need any help with advertising, just shoot us an email and we'll be glad to help
11We do our own advertisements and are doing pretty good with our PR since we've been doing it for a while now. Hence us offering it to you.
8if not, that's cool too
FALSE ALARM
The thing about the PR part of it is that a large portion of it so far for us has been answering questions about the game.
9well, most definitely, hence why I mentioned that before that we'd want to keep in contact when it came to PR, since, after all, as your project, everything we do must be sure to have your stamp of approval first.
3OMG!!!!!!!!!!!
9needless to say, we would never do any PR without it being approved by you first
11Prominence: Makes sense. We want to make LESS work for you, not cause more.
Understood.
9however, at this time, it is perhaps best for you to keep it in-house, as you said
3look at your hero, now back at me, now at your hero, not back at me
3is this an actual commercial?
11I agree with that.
9once you guys need help, though, just give us the word, and we'll scramble our resources
Alright then.
11I have control of Daily /oat/ at the moment. Brony State itself has grown to be quite noticable in the pony community, at least in Ponychan.
That's good to know.
11So yeah, we have connections and ways of getting info to people.
oo-oo
You'll be one of our important advertising channels, then.
o...o
9and we're glad to be such
As for the tournament.
I, as a fighting game aficionado, can't see much wrong with it.
/me 12stares
There might be basis for the argument of 'letting people learn the characters' first, but at the same time...
Heh.
11Except for all the details we've been mentioning, but that can wait for later.
Inaugral tourneys are hella fun.
9inb4 DAIGO OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE AND HE MAINS RAINBOW DASH
9yeah, hence why we want to make BOTH of them
/me 12glances at her 3DS...
waiting for that preview to process no
*now
3looool
i. want. a. 3. D. S. ;-;
9the Main Tournament (let's dub it the "Official" one for now)
8yeah, details are going to have to be worked out WAY down the road
9would probably be hosted once a couple of DLC characters come out
8Mane*
8fixed it for you
9....yeah
9Mane Tournament
3man, i gotta go
Silverscreen, I can assure you, we'll come back and hammer this out in more detail later on. We ARE interested. Simply, the timeframe is too fluid to really say anything.
9MANE FIGHT-IM TOURNAMENT
3i haff to go sleppy-bye
3*sleepy
But yeah, the tournament stuff.
3night night all
9of course
11Prominence: exactly. I think we all agreed on that. :D
bye
9suddenly DAIGO
Like I said, we WILL probably have at least one EVO known there. xD
8regarding tournament stuff, we wont even know format until we do registration and find out how many people are entering
9suddenly RAINBOW DASH PARRIES EVERYWEHRE
9ah, yes, that's another thing.
8so thats gonna be like, 2 weeks before maybe
I'd say a month.
Maybe 3 weeks.
A maybe for the maybe
Simply to get everyone who wants to be a part of it time to register.
Whoops
4Better
And THEN organize the rosters.
And the brackets and whatnot.
04oh btw
04LL
04I told my dad about my grade
8well heres what im thinking
04and now he's gonna get me Ocarina of Time 3DS :D
04(I got a 98% on my SOCIAL STUDIES REGENTS EXAM)
O_o
8you guys arent going to be talking about a release date until like 3 weeks before release, yes?
We won't be talking about a release date until we're at leas 95% sure we will release on that day.
8ok
Whether that's in 3 weeks or 3 days.
8because
the heck keeps happening to my internet
G'timing.
8i would say hold off on release until you have at least a few weeks to promote it
/me knocks on wood to stay connected this time
Too many ponies clogging it up
*too much pony
8even if you have it done, you might want to hold it to get more pub
I keep pinging out, so I dunno if I'll be here for long
:P
11Build up the hype for it before you let it go.
8but anyway
12nice :D
/me 12huggles
12congrats
/me 12glances at her 3DS again
12Liiiiiink
12sooooo tempting
/me 12|3
12I give
Hehehe
Lol, that's okay. I'm multitasking anyway.\
I don't see how anything more can be gained from discussing this further at the moment.
confound these drink, they drive my internet to pony
XDDD
9also, since we'd have to make the Release Tournament, we'd have to have the release time made for, say, something like 12 PM EST, so the tournament starts around 2 PM EST
8those 3 weeks or so will give us time to put together registration and get the word out
11Yeah, we pretty much covered all the bases we can for now.
9maybe not whole three weeks
That's what I was thinking Silver.
heh, 9:39 pm
9I'm sure that anybody with a completed project
I should probably eat dinner sometime soon
:P
9would want to get it out and recieve feedback as soon as possible
9as a writer/drawfag, I can understand that sentiment
;____-;
--
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yjh4yiu1_E
;___;*
We might hold it a week or so for final last minute tests, while hyping it at the same time
.
9that's why asking for three weeks is too much
9yeah
9I was going to propose a week
9it should be enough
8maybe
I don't see us holding it for three weeks after completion.
9 4 days for registration
9after all
12so...
12Master Quest or Boss Gauntlet...
9too many people registering would be
/me 12chooses
9quite a hassle, yes?
6God awful?
Agreed.
12Boss Gauntlet
9hence why will promote that the registrations will open soon
8yeah, that could get ugly
9and to keep their eyes peeled
I'd like everyone in on this, but that would be...
unseemly.
/me 8is imagining 500 people trying to enter
9then we open the registrations
/me 8shudders
I keep thinking Master Quest is something else
Another idea is simply first come, first served limited registration.
/me 9gets his GETTER RAPEFACE on
what do you think?
But again, that can be discussed another day.
Watching now.
still loading
11SO WHAT WE HAVE:
11Advertising for now. Wait until development is about, say, three quarters of the way through before we gather to discuss details. Start the registration about 3-5 days before the official release date, make the roster for the launch tourney as well as set up the bracket for the followup tourney.
D:
D:
8again, very preliminary
All parties in acceptance?
For now?
6Sounds good.
8yes
9first come first served seems a bit too unequal for me, but perhaps we should have limited slots, like say, 200 entries at MOST
Anu, DJ?
9but the Mane Tournament would probably take a few weeks, if not months
11I think it's too early to talk about entries. I mean, we don't even know how many would be interested in it, and it's too early to gauge.
6But this can be figured out later.
9true
6GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Done loading watching now
9this is all hypothetical
Oh my God, that's cool. Mic Spike at the start was flawless, absolutely flawless.
:D
Nice
Qualifications for tournament can really be discussed down the road, seeing you can't really present a "curriculum". But that'd be discussed if and when it happens. I'm in agreement with prom, really.
I loved Mic Spike too
9but it's a good thing to do like Batman and be crazy prepared for worst-case scenarios
It was "absolutely flawless" to say the least
:D
:D thanks guys!!!
Mic Spike was epic
XD
11DCD, we're talking about MONTHS until this thing is ready. I think we have the time.
Seems like it's a good enough deal for now
9true
9that said
Then we have an accord, I think.
9here's an idea I'll set on the table before we close
02g2g
02z-z
sorry, I'm trying to keep up with a few things at once at the moment
9should the Bracket Stage League phase of the Mane Tournament have too many entries to possibly stream
9we should draft volunteers as "referees" for said fights
9they will watch
9and will report to us the result of the battles
9so we keep tally of the scores
We'll file that idea away for now, then.
6...you are thinking so far ahead.
11It's a good plan, but again, it's too soon to discuss that.
8ok
9if that's the case, we can make a 64-rung tournament ladder or so, and will stream that
9well, yeah
the fifth season of Pokemon's TV show
8i think we will let you guys get back to developing and what have you
12...
9but it's always been a kink of me, thinking like five or six steps ahead
Alright. Thanks for having us.
8we'll handle the logistics on ou end
9surgical habit I guess
8our*
12rawr
We appreciate your time.
6Thank you for your time.
Well thanks for discussing it with us. (:
8and we'll keep in touch with you guys
Thanks for the offer, too.
9thanks for your time, friends! Please contact us should anything come up.
4Thank you for taking your time to join us in this discussion
11It's been great getting this idea out in the open. We look forward to making it happen.
We'll be back, and in touch in the meantime.
I'm out.
12>_>
11Hey.
/me 12slaps Mibbit
11Before you....too late.
8lol
9no need for this any more
11Eh.
I'm out too. there's some stuff that needs Answering.
4We hope that development goes smoothly and that everything comes out to a resounding success
9good luck!
Bye.
11Anukan, if you ever feel inclined, come on by to watch BMN with us. :D
Thanks. I will, if I find the time between so much work. :). See you later.
11Seeeya.
8good luck guys!
11 /shameless self promotion
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 14 minutes
8lol silver
12noooo
yessss
:3
perhaps LL should get mIRC
/me shot
12:/
12not my comp
12so
12what are you going to make me do?
Oh
12no can do
12etc
Hmm.
nothing out of the ordinary :P
11So......
11I think that went rather well.
I wonder if I can set up a script to update when people post new topics on ponychan.
that went REALLY well
11Are you serious?
11That script would go haywire within seconds.
6Well, Prominence was a little standoffish at times, but other than that, that went incredibly well.
Lawl, just a thought.
11He had good reason to be.
6But I can understand it. It's his baby.
11Like we kept saying, it's WAAAAAY too early to really iron out any details.
/me blinks
11And that, too.
yeah, i can see why he would want to protect it
/me scaly
12...
12w
12t
12f
11Especially if you wired it to /oat/
12what
o.o
now then
12are you surprised because i'm not playing OoT?
12I lost...
11The damn engine would explode.
one other thing we need to talk about
12in the weirdest way
also super preliminary
12on Phantom Ganon no less >_>
4I think I need t osit down
4*to sit
LMAO
12o-o
11I have a *little* experience with website making, but not a lot.
Maybe I could have it only message when "Brony Movie Night" is in the title of the new thread.
I can do pretty much whatever with computers.
ok, that's cool
11Look, Doc Brown, we don't need everything invented to suit BMN's needs. :P
12normally
Would be good to get other people in though, I think.
12I get him without a hit...
12this time
yeah, thats what im thinking
12I got hit five times in a row
12o.o
4dari's the chat room, so of course he'd know HTML coding
good lord, i have so many pony related projects im working on
But Marty, think of the possibilities!
6SO MUCH PONY!
12nono
/me 11brohoofs
/me brohoofs back
/me 12bad at tennis TODAY apparently
why does 36IStillLikeSpyro36 keep posting in pony threads if he hates it so much?
12._.
I don't get it
But still...
NOT ENOUGH PONY!
Which thread this time?
Pony Spam
I don't get it either apparently when people post in threads they don't like they're ~cool~
12lol
the spam or non spam one?
4Too much?
ah
Never.
never enough pony
12finally Danny D:
03Get on XBL
12Im there
03um
03appearing offline then?
12wait
12wtf

03oh
12no o.o
03Now I see you
03LOL

03wait
03no
12wait
03that's someone else
03it shows you as offline
03o.o
12it dc'd me o.o
03LOL
/me 12reconnects
12there
Ahh.
no mod applications yet
a legit website
with legit show times and announcements
we're gonna have to keep that thread bumped periodically
12my connection borked then
4I gotta say, it was a little overwhelming to see you guys and the FiM team talking about this project
4Especially DCD, who seemed to be foaming at the mouth for it. No offense, DCD
and legit other stuff
/me 12thought it was just Mibbit
lol "FURRIES R BETTER DAN MLP"
11Seriously though, If you get to the point where you feel like hitching a flux capacitor to the website, I think you need to slow down. :P
YOU THINK I WAS FOAMING AT THE MOUTH?
my ass
BITCH YOU DON'T KNOW FOAM
I WAS
I wonder if he'll answer my question
LOL
all according to plan...
SHOOTING LAZORS FROM MY MOUTH
FOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM LAZORZ
/me tents fingers evilly
or if he'll just be evasive like last time
yes, I'm a fighting games junkie
that said
4wut
What was your question? I'm in the middle of typing a reply
foam lazors lol
4Fucking shitty connection
it IS an interesting project that WILL help us gain more exposure while aiding them as well
"http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349606.html#349606
win-win
true
that, and the pony episodes
11Like I said before: We're a serious business, yo.
yeah for sure
we're gonna need a new website before ponies start back up for sure
might make us beome one of the most important outlets of the pony fandom
the problem is
real websites cost money
/me laughs maniacally
/me didnt think of that
/me is a sad pony
Hmmm, I'm liking the sound of this...
hence why my first suggestion was "ask !!Celestia for help"
although....
hm...
I need to talk with DeathSquad
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349608.html#349608
I was establishing a paintchatapp project, you see
because FlockDraw is too cramped
he offered server space for it
I think you can get domains for free.
what exactly do you mean by talk to !!Celestia?
he's the owner of Derpy Hooves
I'm sure I have some friends who've done that before.
*derpyhooves.com
and with !!Celestia...well, the /stream/ idea, but yeah, not good idea
12hmm
it would only make sense, given that we basically started as an offshoot of ponychan
6DO IT PONY
we all came over from ponychan
we're all regular users
but
plus then we might get our shit stickied
there's the whole "neutral nation" thing
only problem i see is
!!Celestia runs a legit website
which frankly is quite a dickish thing to do and might cause friction
yeah
we should prolly ask DeathSquad
I'll try to talk to him
In any case!
our stream is most likely a violation a copyright laws
there is another thing
at least how we get the movies is
when we actually DO start streaming S2 episodes
I'm sure our shit WILL start getting stickied
4Do you have any idea just how many people we'd need to moderate said event?
not sure he would want to be connected with that since he could be legally liable then
12there
12not a hit on me
NOW I gotta go for dinner be back later
6Already have all of that.
/me 12guesses it was just bad luck
8oh, here it goes...
thats another issue
Pinkie Pie is tied for 1st with "Silly, that's not how you spell EVERYPONY"
Yay Pinkie!
I voted for Pinkie
6...dari?
hence why we will probably need to establish the "Mane Six Room System"
we are going to have a SHITLOAD of people here for ponies
6...dari?
me too
I predict Rainbow Dash will win
6AAAAAAAAAAAAW HERE IT GOES!
Eventually
SHITLOAD doesn't just cut it
you mean
I'm back.
Yeah, she has a huge fanbase
a METRIC GIGAFUCKTON, scientifically speaking.
My fucking IP is pissing me off.
we'll need many mods
as well as
That's three times tonight I had to reset it.
we're gonna need to be actively recruiting for new mods all summer
I usually find extremely arrogant characters annoying
how I see it
8^win
RD isn't /that/ annoying, but she is at times
we'll need to split off in two-men teams of us, the originals
each group admining one room
Yeah
Rainbow Dash pony is best pony.
it's just her flaw, that all characters have
along with lower-ranking mods
under our command
Derpy is second best pony.
and so on
:P
11Damn.
hmmm, maybe we should keep bristle around now that i think about it
I dunno, all ponies are awesome though.
6If he decides to show up. >>;
Pinkie, Fluttershy, RD, Rarity, Derpy <- my top 5
11I haven't seen Bristle lately. At all.
for example, me and Hipster could deal with the Twilight Sparkle Room, while Ghosties and Silverscreen handle the Rainbow Dash Room, Dari and Sprinkles handle the AJ Room, ect.
indeed
he posted yesterday
if Spike counts, he's my favorite
11but...but I want Rarity....
philosophical question
6Yeah, but he's never HERE.
dealwithit.jpg
11meh.
thats another thing
does Spike feel left out when the others say "everypony"?
So the chat is being split into 6?
4AHAHAHA
we need to make sure our mods are going to be COMMITTED
11Not yet, but eventually it will.
4Hipster won't be in RD's room :P
12Volvagia down
okay.jpg
but
12nao...3? moar
for example, bronypeanut
Probably not
he doesn't seem to mind that all his friends are ponies
he does not actively monitor chat at all during broadcasts
or girls for that matter
of course
11We should put a not-so-active mod with a highly active mod to keep teams even.
hmm..what to do, play OoT moar, or
well, no I don't mean that
play some Super Mario 64 on the N64
the real question
no
would be
I mean does he feel left out because he technically isn't included in the word
12OoTTTTTTTTTTTTT
we need ALL of our mods to be active
How the hell do we make it so we have an even distribution of users?
lol
11this way we know we have at least one person watching the chat.
hmm...
11good question.
i suppose i could
/me is at a complete loss
dunno
I think you can make people be redirected to another room when a certain number of users a in a channel.
If he ever breaks into the real world, we can ask him
:P
if we give people a regular choice, the Rainbow Dash room would be like
So you'd have the first room, when that reaches a certain number, it'd redirect to the next room, etc.
hi, guys
all users LOL
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
XD
well, yeah
until he grows up that is
11There's an idea, Dari
that's probably the best course of action
8hi barry
the question is
how much people can we handle in each room?
You'd have to know exactly how many people are going to come though.
11Just direct them to each one until it reaches a certain point, then redirect anyone after that.
Seems Dari wants Sprinkles to take everything but the kitchen sink, doesn't it?
To get an even number in each room.
brb
11I'd say between 150-200 people per room.
8we arent gonna be in the mane room a lot right now, we've got a ton of business we're dealing with right now
I'd say 300, akin to the Movie Nights
11If not less.
right
well
because we will have MORE than 200 x 6 viewers, most likely
I'll be going to bed soon, anyway
its gonna depend on the actual numbers
6Dari, could you potentially set it up so that it would automatically deposit people into each room?
11DCD, you gotta take into account that it'll only be 2 mods per room.
not to mention we have to study just how we can divide
no no, you misunderstood me
I meant
two HEAD mods in each room
we will need more mods
LOTS of more mods
so at least we have two more "Underling" mods in each room
for a grand total of four mods
it balances the odds
erm...i really can't decide what to play tonight :<
also
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349611.html#349611
like i said earlier, we have to make sure our mods are going to be fully committed
6...why is dari not fullops, btw?
.....good question
11I dunno.
4Make him full op
one thing that has been annoying me is that bronypeanut is frequently posting in ponychan during BMN and ignoring the chat
I thought it was perfect for this situation
6I would, no idea how to give ops
11Might want to confront him about htat then.
hmm...i wonder, how hard is Majora's mask, just randomly wondering
11that*
6He has been kinda... out there.
im going to this week
There
4In any case, I'm gonna be AFK right now since my internet connection is really shitting out on me
ill pm him on friday
Monitoring chat during new pony episodes means we'll miss most of what's going on, the sacrifices we make. XD
the only thing we can do now
back
Ok then Ghosties.
is to go out and recruit people we know we can TRUST for our teams
12rather
as our underlings
D;
XD perfect
LOL underlings. XD
hmm..well i wont get taht game then
11XD
so everybody go and bring one person they trust can help us with that
well
I dunno
6MY MINIONS
Ward?
some other word
yeah
:P
11MINIONS!
oops, that was supposed to go in another window
XD
11I just like to say "staff"
I do wanna play OoT, but i havent really gotten anywhere at all yesterday to be honest
11More people for our staff.
I have lots of people I trust on IRC, though I never know when they're getting on.
staff
11I honestly have no idea who to consider. I don't really pay attention to one particular person when moderating.
im going to be looking at people in Ponychan too
yes
the origin of the person doesn't matter
this is
of course
11True.
separated from the OTHER mod applications
so by then we'll have a pretty large staff
we need people who are going to be committed and available on friday and saturday
which will help us handle the challenge quite well
hopefully
also, we need to keep this chat open at all times
we still havent received any applications
11Dari's always on.
11and with the application list, we know who'll want to be a part of it without having to be on here.
I think I'm going to look into whether any of our problems can be fixed by running a network/server ourselves.
11Dari, you're like the damn tech guru of BronyState.
XD
6Dari is our code monkey. :D
OK, posted a Pokemon
Problems with your internet, Ghosties?
Oh boy
Terrible problem
goodnight everybody
this is a tough one
updated FB status with /oat/ link for mod application
12nini
I bet it's one I don't even know
but here goes
LOL I said on twitter that OoT is better than Majora's Mask and someone replied "lolwut"
XD
11Cool.
12they disagreed?
6Update twitter? Update twitter.
yes
I feel your pain.
12also wheee
dari, how many people do you think you will need to help with putting together a legit website?
/me 12finished all 8 OoT bosses in slightly more than 15min
X3
|3
03x.x
that's what I thought about some of the others
6I know a good bit of html... though I'm a bit rusty.
03and what is it with you guys and being cyclops
12Morpha did things to me >_>
12that took time
o3o
Well let's say 2 other people to help would be good.
I guessed Regigigas
just start guessing and you'll get more hints
12Danny
12stop
12I'm listning to it
12and yes
12I remember this song
And no one is saying anything
Oh wait
I'm in the main room
Wow
Seriously
11I could help with the designing aspect of said website.
This is fucking pathetic
/me 12huggles back o.o
6lAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwl
11Seems we're all experiencing the dumb today.:P
LL look at this reply: "Reknoc
even ponychan is derping
Of course it'd be a good idea to outline with all of you first what it is you want to see/expect from the site.
how do i reply to this o.O
To give some basis to work with.
11Ponychan's derping, DA was derping, I accidentally the grammar, Hipster and ghosties had the dumb.
11It's an all around Derpy day.
well
12wut
and now I guessed regirock
:P
12WUT
4Okay, listen, since everybody is in here at the moment let me just say that my internet is realllllllllllllllly shitty right now, I don't think I'll be able to keep up with the chat tonight. Hopefully, I'll have this mess sorted out before Friday, but if not, then I don't think I'd be able to make it.
I know right
Reknoc's nuts
he seriously doesnt know how good OoT is
we could do a homepage kind of like what silver put together in flash
got it
Yay!
11It's cool, ghosties. We all have those days where our internet just wants to be an ass.
Oh wow.
i need a way to shove it in his face XD
OoT?
I must be rusty with my pokemanz.
:P
I hoped that would be hard
:p
12maybe he was introduced to MM first?
OHHHHHHHHHHHH
12and lolfail
I thought I was wrong
with both answers
OoT is awesome
Evan is sitting right next to me and posting
I just completely guessed
/me 12nods
I thought he'd get it right away
but he looked at it and had no idea
12and as for MM
but i need a reply for this tweet
:p
12the time thing gets in the way a lot
someone make a witty one for me
XD
11A homepage with info on the current event. A history page with a list of the past BMN showings, a mane event page like this one, and an ABOUT US page with info on each mod and a link to the Email if they want to get in contact with us.
I've suggested it
Well, I just thought of what would be heavy and have a ghost type move and I completely guessed the regi-things
then we would need a video player and chat client
he doesn't want to
Aww.
12tell him that theres no need to worry about time in OoT and without OoT there would have been NO MM ;3
pretty much what silver said
I told him I guarantee that he won't think it'
*it's terrible
12the latter being the spotlight
Yeah, I know
brb
12also lack of Adult Link D:<
no offense taken
:P
he's pretty stubborn
11The deeper we go, the bigger this thing gets.
brb for me as well
I want 36 to come back so I can make fun of him some more
Ok.
/me carries around with him a 3 foot Link plushie.
11We have a PR program (manely myself and Hipster), which branches into an advertising program that I pretty much head. DCD is like our proprietor, we have a reliable staff which we are actually hiring for, we have connections to all major Pony sites, we’re collaborating with other projects, and now we're looking at getting our own website and chat server.
/me walks down a dark ally
dari, I posted a review of ponies in my dA journal
We should really have a list of all the things we need to do somewhere.
he replied "I still refuse to have anything to do with ponies"
Google; you liee
lol
shame
just tweeted it
XD
waiting for his troll reply
11Can do.
trololololololol

12as for a reply
/me 12hmms
11A month and a half.
6Multiple streamers and streaming days aswell.
11That too.
11Alternative streaming days and additional streamers.
04mew
and this is even before new pony episodes
as well as alternative streaming events
11All this on top of keeping the regular BMN going, including the weekly raffle.
speaking of whic
which*
im putting the thread up tomorrow morning
6It's going to be for Saturday this week, yes?
yes
11yes.
6Oh yay I get to stream it again.
Nice
got it right away
6What all info?
11So that we don't have them receiving, like, five emails each time?
oh
right now
we need to finalize the order
Are we streaming reruns of the new pony episodes too?
11Sprinkles: The email update update I send out on thursdays.
that one was easy
lets go with this:
6I know.
spiders web
For those in different timezones, or if they couldn't make it to the first run, etc?
feeling pinkie keen
se7en
fall weather friends
6Sounds good to me, Hipster.
I know we're streaming live, but aren't we restreaming the new episodes during the week before the next new episode again?
hehe, well, I guess I have to make it harder then next time
alright
11Yeah, get the horrible movie out of the way.
6We probably could, dari, but again, that bridge when we come to it.
11Nopony would stay long if that was the last one. XD
lol my tweets can only be 140 characters long XD
/me shot
11So is everyone alright with that showing order?
11If so, I can write the draft for the email now.
11...it suddenly got quiet in here.
also
I'm thinking about gauging interest for a stream of Kaiji
because ZOWA ZOWA
sorry, im writing up the op for the thread so i can post tomorrow morning
11ah.
12lol
6I'm busy doing absolutely nothing.
I can just tell primeval12345 is going to be annoying
11I'll go write up thursday's post then.
yeah, he reminds me of O:
dunno how
but he does
probalby all the "which is better thing A or completely unrelated thing B"
12Hey Aurora
and the lack of punctuation
whats bad about MM that i can mention XD
yeah
or something to get him back for that tweet XD
You know, I've just realised that I don't really like anyone on the forum.
dcd and sprinkles, you were both able to find that spiders web movie, right?
Ahem
What about us?
D:
I don't know why I bother checking there.
And you guys don't count of course. :P
oh
:P
haha
:P
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349627.html#349627
I know how you feel in that case
04o-o
04oh yeah Aurora's here XD
11As if anyone would want to put that thing available for downloading. XD
Me too, SF doesn't have any particularly cool people, present company excluded
And the only people I do like (not from IRC :P) aren't really regular posters.
12I could tell because of all the floof~
6Yes. Though I have to wait until tomorrow to dload it.
I can't think of anyone there besides people I know on IRC and real life that I actually get along with
6The wifi here SUCKS.
Especially not Aura24
Aura24 is mah bestest fraaand
jk
I know I complain about her all the time, but seriously
post*
She's one of the most annoying fantards I've ever met
What happened to Vicious Verpy Pink Pole, now that I'm reminded of him. XD
Yeah, she is
flooooooooooooooooooooof?
hre?
where is the floof?
Because she thinks what she's saying is intelligent and she's so smug about it
here
The internet does that to people like her
oh yeah XD I forgot about Verpy
He was a mod at one point
who's Verpy?
wonder what happened with that
He was a mod? XD
Floooooof!
/me huggles
ah
You wouldn't know him
I do know of him now that you say that though
Yeah, around the time of the second rebellion
who was made a mod to replace me
We started calling him Verpy, because he we always said he was perv. :P
-he*
I don't know where "vicious," "pink,"
He used pink text.
12lol, I've been watching one Best Wishes episode after another XD
*or "pole" came in
Ah, that's right, he did
12SS
but how was he a pole?
how was he a vicious pole?
12the fact that the time runs out at the worst moment?
was he viciously dumb?
/me 12hides
How can a pole even be vicious?
I think because the text looked like a pole.
XD
A pink pole.
And vicious because he was pretty feisty. XD
PFOKN FOR MODERATOR!
I wasn't able to dl movies till today
just finished dling Se7en
hahaha

BOBOBO BOBO BOBO
EWW BEST WISHES
I miss those times
ive made nearly 730 tweets o3o
tweet tweet
tweet tweet
spyrochat was so active
I don't get what happened, I swear it was really active, then one day suddenly not active.
And it stayed that way.
12Too many Ew 5th gens and you’ll get yourself a place on my ignore list
I remember it was active at the end of my last year of high school
6DCD, would you be able to just email me the files? It would likely be faster than dloading them otherwise, and I'd be able to get them tonight...
nah
I choose you Chandeliermon.
I just hate the 5th generation TV show
and the 4th
I dont care about 5thgen, I dont even knwo what they are to be honest
Seriously, what kind of a pokemon is that (I don't know that actual name).
and the 3rd
After school ended I was still banned from the internet by my parents, so I couldn't use it most of the summer
so I cant hate what i dont know :P
then I came back when college started
12Well, at least you don't not like the games
and it was dead
inb4 someone turns that statement on me
6Oo This DnD I'm in just got REALLY weird.
the creatures I don't like much though
plus that time based crap
12brb
I suppose it doesn't really help that SF is dead.
well
here's the Se7en I got http://btjunkie.org/torrent/Se7en-DvDrip-1995-Eng-hiest/43580da891427926ea0d6c5ed767fa78f36555bad80a
11Guys, I just put a list of all things needed to be done in that Tasks tab on the GMail account (this damn thing is useful)
also LL, any games after OoT, what LoZ games would you recommend i get?
6TP and Majora's mask
yeah
11I put it in order of urgency/importance/when it needs done.
heh
Although most of the regulars didn't use the forum much
I will most likely get TP
but MM idk
Yeah.
6mM is amazing
6it just stresses me
let's see, there were
Maybe they got older, and didn't have as much free time?
TP for GC or Wii?
6I prefer GC
guyes
does anybody have a link to
Spider's wEB?
Same graphics?
6especially since they mirror the entire game for wii
Cause I can't find it
6same, just EVERYTHING is reversed
Oh
11I have noooooo idea.
goldfish gerpy
so GC is the original TP then
lol
has the*
Gerple.
6plus, I didn't think much of the wii fighting style
SR I suppose
Can't believe he was on earlier today. XD
6I understand what they were doing, but I enjoyed GC more
6yeh
although he didn't talk much
HE WAS?!
o.o
6Link is left handed, they had to mirror it for the wii's controls
Yeah, all the people we just mentioned were.
13 people in SC.
damn
6I found it on bitsnoop
6http://bitsnoop.com/spider-s-web-a-pig-s-tale-q9368505.html
ah
did they have a reunion and not invite me? :(
11If worse comes to worse, you can simply download it in parts from Youtube.
12o.o
well Ill buy teh GC ver. then
6And I meant I need the actual file. I can't use torrent from this wifi.
for TP
MM idk if ill buy it
I don't know why there were so many people.
12blah
6either way, gc controller > wii
/me 12was away
XD
6It considers it "hacking/proxy avoidance"
12yush
12TP
12WW
12etc
6Which is why I asked for the email of the file.
12and MM
ah, you know what
6never played WW, want to
6but I personally hate PH
12lolz
6and ST just didn't catch my attention either
although I'm never on MSN, so...
I haven't used MSN in years now. XD
heh im really close to making the Zelda special earlier than usual, not saying this week tho
12D:

I havent decided when tho LL
12agreed Roara
heh
12tho

a s ingle leecher
it's dead
12ST had a good sountrack
^
Well clearly most/all the people are still on the internet, so they just left for some unknown reason. O_o
6lol
They lazy.
/me pokes Light Latias for a piggy back ride
I have mostly all original LoZ OSTs
Because everyone else left and it got boring
I guess
6I can't see it's leechers, ust know it's there.
6*just
all the*
Well if people were lurk-pros like me there'd always be people there.
yeah
that leech's obviously you

I wish I could do that
as dead as disco
whomever chose this movie wished to provide us with bodily harm
I will be online constantly for the next two weeks because my grandparents don't block the internet at midnight
so I'll finally be able to leave this on
Oh, that's good,.

Even though there were a lot of people in SC, it still wasn't very active.
When it was, it was mainly Icy and C7 talking.
11lol
11It's just that bad off a movie, DCD
Icy having an actual conversation?
Impossible
Well, his version of conversation.
I swear
I can't find anything
anything
6...me neither.
C7, Icy, DSD, and Uxielover are the most regular people on there.
Now.
DSD is on pretty much permenantly, Icy has been on most of the time recently too, and C7 has been on a lot.
Do what Silver said and download the parts from youtube.
got the OP done
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno hits
Or I suppose you could just open up all the parts of the film in youtube beforehand and let them buffer.
i'll email sethisto tomorrow
Then play the parts on youtube instead.
yeah, probably the best course of action
it's just THAT bad
okay brb
also, question:
should i check again if we can get a sticky on /oat/ just for fridays?
heh hope you likes mah remix ;3
/me Shot
11Draft for the Tomorrow's email update has been saved.
11Our to-do list is saved in the tasks panel of the Gmail account.
11Hipster has the selection OP written up
cool beans
im gonna go to sleep
11And we pretty much have the Fighting Is Magic thing handled as best we can for now.
im probably not going to be available a ton tomorrow due to a paper
11I say it was a damn good day.
anyway, ttyl
11It's cool. See you friday, then.
Do my eyes deceive me?
Woah I actually made it in
Hello
how's Louisiana been for you?
Your eyes are notg decieved
pretty good
really hot though
wb :3
haha, yeah I bet
so enjoy it while you can
:P
6This movie is NOWHERE.
Haha
I've never met DSD or Uxielover
I definitely will
Are they forum members?
oh hi
I dunno. DSD works on some wiki somewhere.
6Also, DCD, could you email me Se7en?
11I'm telling you, nopony would WANT to put it up for download.
yesterday we have a tornado warning
I can't use Icechat
XD
*had
Didn't notice you were here until just now
O really?
ya rly
11Just get it in bits from Youtube and stream them in a row.
Did a tornado ever touch down?
no, thankfully
11It'll probably get a laugh from the chat.
6We're going to have to...
Uxielover I think is one of those people who calls you "a hater" and not "a true Spyro fan" if you don't like the look of Skylanders.
it was called due to cloud circulation
lol
11"This film was so bad, we had to use Youtube to get it."

Well friendship, that's got to be about sharing kindness.

We're all friends here
You guys are going to be shot
XD

lolololol
Hahahaha
I have no idea what to say next

I hope this doesn't scare Evan into ever coming here again
if he figures out what the reference is
:P
XDDD
When you have all of that, man you just know you've got some complete friendship
still it's pretty fun to watch
watch rdx suddenly ban us all

XD
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
True dat.
LOL
Because she just is

I dunno, I'll ask her for the recipe.
thanks
Wow my typing really sucks...
Rarity. XD
I had some rainbow cupcakes the other day
my sister made them

:P
I am in tears
he has no idea
hahahaha
03LOL WTF
You know you can add edible sprinkles to them that sparkle.
:O
where do you buy those?
Was going to say, they sparkle in the dark, in the twilight.
But it's too obvious. XD
Holy crap, no way? I think my suster might've spiked the punch she made to go with the cupcakes
I fell asleep immediately after drinking it
I don't know if he knows the names of the poines
*ponies
Just from the super market.
But I'm surprised he didn't get the cupcakes thing
*sister
I mentioned it to him once
speaking of sparkles
it disgusts me
The next movie is coming out soon
Yeah, she got over her crush on the twilight sparklepire
agh
I almost want to buy a ticket just to see how the fans react
Isn't she like my age...?
Oh wait.
a god*
She's a year younger than you
Right?
I guess a lot of high schoolers liked twilight
My sister?
she's 17
12http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-autocomplete-me-since-when.jpg
12lol
My sister only had her CullenCrush for a little while
Twilight sparklepire
hahahahaha
12i feel like drf planted that one
it was around a year ago
:P
That's more understandable I guess
03LOL
I won't judge her unfairly then
My sister fluttered around with Twilight for a bit, she was pretty shy about it though.
NOOOOOOO
Did you see the shirt she was wearing, Evan?
.I have a sudden craving for applejacks....do they still make those anymore???
He so totally did
Yep...
"Only Vampires can love you forever"
Lol
03"It's nice to be the nation's largest minority but could they at least leave one d*** soul station in the desert?"
This is the most fun trolling I've had since flying real low at Neopets
I ate it at the hotel
ONLY VAMPIRES BANISHED FOR 1000 YEARS TO LIVE WILL LOVE YOU UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD
tahnks for stealing what I was just going to say
12lol george lopez

12sabrina the teenage witch didn't get old to me

Bwahahaha
XDDD
12but apparently the network did because they cancelled it lol
03LOL
Haha
Yeah man I drink up those Apple jacks like you wouldnt know
12?
:o
That's how I got blocked by SR
What gives you the idea that I'd do that?
I made a joke
Oh yeah, 21 is the legal age in the USA.
Oh hey, speaking of alcohol, I haven't seen the Double Rainbow video in a while. I should dash on over to youtube and watch it again
and he took it personally
speaking of underage drinking dari how's gilda doing
George Lopez ftw
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
03George Lopez was cancelled too, but they still show reruns
;3

Oh wow, oh my god

4Huh, I guess it's working now
Pretty stupid joke if that's what he's doing
4Well, it looks like I missed the end of the meeting : /
4Oh well, I caught the gist of it
4most of it
dumb little kid
Please tell me I had more sense than that when I was 16
Oh wait, I was busy starting rebellions against forums when I was 16
please tell me I'll have more sense than that when I'm 16
So no, I didn't
XD
" do i really seem that stupid to you?" Yes. Kthxbai
when I was 16 I thought I would become a motorcycle builder
lol
Too bad I can't actually say that
Why not?
so I was DEFINATELY that senseless
Wait what?
Although I considered just quoting "why are you guys taking this so seriously" and responding "lol irony"
12brotherboard

You think that's how you spell the name of the owl? :P

.
W3 W4Z B07H Y0UN6 W3N 1 FUR$7 $4W U

I barely gave a single thought to "career" when I was 16
I didn't know until I took computer programming in 11th grade
then I knew
I'm sorry
lol I earned my cutie mark before any of you did you just all got owned
I must leaqve
Unless my parents were annoying me about deciding on a college
I bid thee adieu

hahaha
OH MY GOD
I AM WATCHING THIS VIDEO
4Sprinkles? You're still here?
AND MARITIME STARTS PLAYING
Sprinkles is always here.
/me has a squee moment but it's over now...
:(
6*lurklurk*
Who/what is maritime?
4Hehe
6XD
it's a BAND
oh my god
4Dari finally got full ops
4Nice
6You can kick all the other mods too. XD
this song started playing and it's like my favorite one on their new album
6Yeah, I said something to DCD about it.
/me turns into a bird
Nice
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU7W9J5mnt8
6And he was just "Good question..."
6And gave him full ops
Lawl, thanks. XD
4I remember, my net was good enough to see that bit of the chat
6Ah.
6Was not sure if you were there.
WE TRY TO BREAK IT OFF SO WE DANCE ALLL NIGHTTT WE WERE WARRIORS IN THE MOOO0000OOO0000OOO000oOOOOOOoNLIIIIGHT
so now I'm saying fuck it to that video I was watching and turning on my jam
6How do you unban...? Oo
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURD
ps it's snowager time
4I said something about it, but I guess my net didn't go through with it
4In regards to dari being full ops, that is
and I got blasted
because the snowager's a dick
Same as ban, just -b instead of +b
4You know, this feels almost...right
Haha
that's neopets game, right?
*a
4What's that?
6It's what it normally is.
no it's a part of neopets though
sometimes you can get an item
4What is R though?
6NO IDEA
Lol.
http://www.neopets.com/winter/snowager.phtml
6Recognized, I think?
12o-o
4Ah
6I tried to unban my trolling acount. XD
6...Uh...what's going to happen now?
Hmm?
Oh, he shot me
4What do you mean?
4Sprinks, it's so amazing
6lol
6What is?
Mwahahahahahaha
:P
6What did you do?
Oh.
It didn't work.
It's supposed to strip colour codes.
So there are no colours.
Maybe it doesn't work on ops/admins.
3Colour?
Hmm.
4I remember when dari was regarded as nothing more than the hobo of the chat, just a guy that stayed around long after everyone else had left. And none of the mods had the nerve to kick him or tell him to go to bed. And now, he's pretty much the master super computer for BMN, working around the clock to do the most awesome things for our channel and affiliates
Well, I am disappoint. I can't troll you by removing your precious colour, Sprinkles. :P
6XD
Lol Ghosties, that transition, you made it sound epic. XD
4Thank you
6Also, I think the +s set the channel to secret...
4SECRET?!
Oh, whoops.
4So
4Does that mean that we're keeping secrets right now?
The network has to be on unreal.
Which this one isn't.
Or this server.
6Yeah... it's not.
And it's meant to be +S
To strip colour codes.
6Also +R makes it so only registered members can enter...
4Quick, someone respond
4Say something to me
Uhh. Hello Ghosties?
alright guys I'm headed to bed
Ok.
Cya.
See ya

I will be back some other time though

I understand the o3o face now. It's a "SOOOOOO AWESOME" face.
6I dislike that there is no flood command.
Hey.

6That works, that is.

D;
I'll stay in Baldwin thanks
12~
12Floof
12you don't even go to the nearest city to you?
/me kills over from so much floof
6THERE'S NOT EVEN A DECENT HELP SUMMARY
i havent left baldwin since school ended :P
6So... how 'bout that Tacowiz?
Ohai Ghosties
12get out
12enjoy yourself
12:D
4Yep, I'm back. Hi dari
Baldwin?
I have
4Stupid connection -_-
4What were you guys talking about?
6<SirSprinkles>: So... how 'bout that Tacowiz?
Lul.
I suppose it's possible that it could have gone worse.
6lulz
4I can't read what it says at the bottom
6You can set yourself to away.
4That's probably the one thing that I'll remember from that interview
6I saved it in a word document.
6It was THAT bad.
4I just loved that reply. So much wrong in that picture, as a mod, but the one thing he comments on FIRST is the text he can't see at the bottom of the picture
4Is the text honestly important when you have two halves of the same pony making out?
6He was just... so bad.
12yes
12bald land
12where the bald win at everything
4But his biggest problem was knowing when to stay quiet and stop talking
4Oh god, I'm watching the first ep of the original Power Rangers show
Wow...
4It's been since my time as an infant?
4Wait, not infant
4At least when I was...6 or 7
I haven't seen that in forever.
lulz
6I shouldn't mess with stuff.
4The black power ranger was dancing during his roll call in the opening
4Needless to say, I lol'd
That's pretty awesome.
6Okay, I'm done messing around with code.
4What code? Sprinkles, what are you messing around with?
6I was trying to change my colors.
6Wanted to make the bacground that silver color. XD
6*background
dragon wut
4How do you know the code?
Thunderday is better D:
6mibbit wiki
4Well, just don't destroy the mibbit
4Or make the background a wonky color for everbody >_<
6I'm being good. XD
12Hi Umbreon
lmao Umby
i made that phrase up first
:P\
What sort of theme would our site have?
Light, dark, colours, etc?
12yes
12dragon day
No preferences? :P
4You'd have to take it up with the rest of the mods
4I think variety would be nice, but professionalism is what we're going for
6I set up a flood bot.
4But we don't want people to think we're fuddy duddies
4A flood bot?
6A SPAM kicking bot.
4What's the script for it?
6Hmm...
6The most posts I can set it to is 6 lines in 10 seconds...

4Sprinkles, maybe you should leave the technical stuff to dari?
6Well, dari tried figuring it out before...
6dari, don't you have a bot set up?
Nope.
6Ah.
6We need a bot on the channel...
I was going to make the one that worked by voicing/devoicing, but I thought that'd be too spammy.
I wasn't sure if everyone else agreed with a kick for spam.
6Well, if we create a bot, I have a command that will kick.
4command that will kick?
6Kick for spamming.
4If dari creates it, isn't he creating all the parameteters?
6More than 6 lines in 10 seconds.
6All of the Bots on the BotList have their access denied. >>;
Well I don't have a bot on, I just run the scripts on this client.
4Denise Milani
4me gusta
6We need a servadmin to set up a bot we can use. >>;
What do you mean?
6None of the bots on the botlist have permission for me to access them.
6And I can't create a bot.
Lol, you don't need them.
You have me. :P
4*ahem* You guys think we'll ever get a female mod?
6Perhaps.
6on *:TEXT:*:#:{ inc -u4 %spam. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] if (%spam. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] == 6) { ban -ku300 $chan $nick Don't Spam! 5 Minute ban. halt } }
6Found one for you.
6No idea how to use scripts.
Meh, I'd write one using hostnames instead of nicks myself.
That way if we get a clever spambot that auto changes to random nicks it still gets kicked.
6Easy enough to change.
Also, that bans instead of just kicks.
6*shrug* Just something we need to eventually find.
6...ponychan! COME BACK TO ME!
4...are any of you guys hav
4Wow
4I was just about to ask if you guys were having a hard time getting on Ponychan
6XD
6It's 502ing...
4Yeah
4I can't even get to the front page
6Me either...
I need 9 people to help me speed up a project. Who's interested in helping out? Its pokemon related, and everyone who helps will likely benefit from it.
4I'm sure they're just having net issues at the moment

WELP
I'm bored and a search engine
In need 9 people to help me with some, and I'm not going to tell you what it is till you've agreed (He's going to steal your kidneys).
I*
something*
God.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? >_.
Yeah pretty much.
OH MY GOD
>_>
6lol yay
Worst case scenario, who needs kidneys?
4I'm thirsty
6Do you have it set to eventually kick?
Eventually kick?
6>>; ban
6I can't brain today. I have the dumb.
Nope, I could write that in I suppose.
6That would be awesome.
How many kicks till ban? How long should the ban last? How long till the number of times you've been kicked by the flood filter is reset?
6After the second kick.
6So, third kick = ban
And for the other questions?
6Permaban. If they don't like it, there's an appeals channel.
6And at least a day before it resets.
!calc 60*60*24
I've got a calculator script on my bot.
I love it.
XD
6Got the script written?

4Huh, this doesn't look good
Wait.
Sprinkles, wait. :P
4It seems Ponychan is down
6XD
6I NEED MY PONY FIX!
4*hopes that lulzsec didn't attack Ponychan*
6I would kill somepony.
4Nothing on their twitter about it
4Let's see what /co/ is saying

Oh wait.
6This would work better if my i.e. didn't lag.
4What's wrong, dari?
Ok.
4Also, /co/ understands that Ponychan is down as well; they're expecting an influx of posters
Go Sprinkles.
a
a
a
a
a
a

Ok.
Good.
6Yep.
It's funny that I can ban Sprinkles from the channel, but not kick him.
4How many times can you be spam kicked before a ban?
6 2
6Third is ban.
4And the script doesn't work on mods?
No.
4Cool
Hash tables are win.

6I skipped the middle part there...
6Well... ponychan is down... my DnD just ended... and I've seen every PMV on youtube I could ever hope to see today... I think it's time for sleep.
6Or to patiently wait for ponychan to come back online...
6Not sure which.
4Go to /co/ *trollface.jpg*
6I can't stop watching "Sexy Naughty Bitchy Rarity"
Lulwut
I must see what this is.
Oh wait.
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1FE7yHGcAw
I saw it when you streamed it.
6Yeah.
6But, I can't stop watching it because my character in DnD got RAEPed by her.
O___o
Lawl
6Royalty + High Manners + High Charisma = Raped by Rarity
6...I got the most experience today. XD
4Remember how I said earlier in the day that this conversation was becoming increasingly bizarre?
4We finally hit it
6XD
4We finally hit bizarre
6Try imagining having to ROLEPLAY it happening.
God ponies are so awesome.
6I couldn't stop laughing.
6And we were doing it via mic.
TOO MUCH AWESOME.
TOO MUCH!
Can't handle this much awesome.
My brain is going to explode.
4*opens video, watches about thirty seconds of it* "meh..nope.avi" *goes back to listening to 90's shoegaze*
6I love the embedded video. :D
6Got a good application for mod.
4Who?
6SoiPony
6I've seen him about the chat.
6In fact, he's one of the regulars before and after hours.
Well I work on a basic layout for the site.
Looks are easily customised afterwards anyway.
For now everything shall be black and gray.
XD
6Basic html is quite simple, really.
Yeah, I'm making a CSS layout.
6Also, a countdown clock until the stream on the main page would be amazing.
6One for the Friday showing and one for the Saturday showing.
Easily done.
6*home page
6Mane page will obviously be the stream.
Homepage is the stream?
I would have though it'd be news and general site stuff.
thought*
6Homepage is news and stuff.
6Mane page is the stream.
6>>;
Ok.
6I know, confusing.
6I'm just going to call them Home and Stream. With the Info page, too.
6*Info pages
6YAY PONYCH

Hello?
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
12i was looking for you D:
?
12well i was just hoping "i wish you were here"
12where did you get the name Kaycia?
Furnet lol
12i knew it XD
It was the first name I entered that was avaliavbl so yeah XD
12Kaycia is a gryphon though D:
avaliable*
12XD

12doesn't matter :)

12i'm alright
12hi absol
hello
12:)
meh, i should sleep
4I also will take my leave. Have a good night, dari
Ok, cya.
12night Absol
12D:
Hey.
should
i'm reading not always right at the moment
x.x
this motherboard is causing bluescreens
Hey hey
i see
Hey there.
Cqis!
hi
Hey :)
how is you?>
xD
?
;o
I'm okies
you Cqis?
tired
/me nods
o-o
what happened?
12Good night.
What?
you can use +f
I don't want to kick them though.
Nor does the network the channel's on have +f.
What IRCd?
UltimateIRCd
ew...
okay it's not that bad
not too sure, sorry
I was more thinking if I had a server set up though, because I'm trying to work out how I could limit the spam with over 250 people in one IRC channel.
o_O
ah lol
and ultimateircd does have +f
I tried it, it doesn't.
"f is unknown mode char to me"
o_O
What raw /raw version output?
what does*
Because ultimateircd and unrealircd have pretty much the same modes
-
SAFELIST SILENCE KNOCK FNC WATCH=128 CHANLIMIT=#&:30 MAXLIST=be:60 NICKLEN=30 TOPICLEN=307 KICKLEN=307 CHANNELLEN=32 are available on this server
EXCEPTS=e CHANTYPES=#& PREFIX=(aohv)!@%+ CHANMODES=be,k,l,cimnpqstAKMNORS STATUSMSG=!@%+ NETWORK=IRCHighWay CASEMAPPING=ascii STD=i-d are available on this server
Ah
It's an old version of ultimateircd
and yeah, they have no +f from the CHANMODES
Don't think you can
But if I set up a server could I do it?
Ultimate?
Nah.
Unreal?
Yeah.
Hm, iirc +f only kicks
Is it possible to add new channel modes?
Yeah
install unrealircd modules
Oh, I'll write it myself then.
have fun
bbl
12noooo
anyone there?
I made a +f mode generator on http://www.systemnet.info/mgen.html
+f can only kick/kickban though
not really block messages
to block, you need the /mode #chan +b ~T: extban module
eh?
ocean has that module installed
Doesn't that just block some words? Not block the user?
Yeah I have it installed on island
I have most of your modules installed
hmm, I see, didint scroll all the way up ;p
xD
nothing like that exists for unrealircd, might for inspircd though o.O
unrealircd isn't particularly flexible
yeah
ew inspircd :x
inspircd/atheme networks
/me explodes
Unreal is the easiest to setup that I've tried. XD
/me chuckles
12spoke D:D
you'll just need to rely on unrealircd's default fixed throttling of users of a 10 short line burst
or rely on +f kicking them all the time
unreal is so easy to set up
even i can do it
:V
lmao
Lawl, that's why I like it.
12yay
it's pretty much just ./Config && make
lmao automatic config generators
they're boring
besides, the unreal sample conf is full of useless comments
better than being full of no comments
it's quite lengthy, though noce at times to have that inline-documentation for those new to it
nice*
True
UnrealIRCd takes like...5-10 minutes at most
to configure...inspircd takes like 15-30 minutes :x
speaking of lenghty ./MODE #Channel +AOtnSyNTVKcCDiGpsdmMzRAOuQlLjkf 30 #overflow 5:10 derpderpderp [5c#C15,5j#i15,5k#K15,4n#N15,20m#M15,7t#k]:15
http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/koma-comic-strip-the-i-evolution.jpg
theoretically one of the more insane mode strings you can have ;p
lmao
Hahaha.
That's pretty much all the unrealircd channel modes amirite?
Or the ones you can set without others going poof
except +beI, and a few extras provided with modules
and also barring the op/halfop etc.
yeah
I see p and s, which cancel, so that mode wouldn't fully set
/me cough
lmao
that's true, plus there's a double O in there
and an A
+u is interesting
yep
+u on chary basically makes everyone speak as anonymous XD
it's awesome
o.o that sounds fun
wait it wasn't chary
Can't remember which IRCd
but yeah, when it's set everyone speaks as "Anonymous"
12i know
interesting ;p
12?
ah right it's inspircd
Apparently it's +a in RFC2811.
I don't know what builds go by that though. O_o
most don't
some really old ones do
most go by 2309 or 2903 or something
pretty sure unreal goes by 2309

4we can get medals here :D
4i have to ask, how many days of vacation do yuu guys have?
4i have about 60 days only
10Dunno, but at least 2 months
/me runs
10I go back mid-August, so at least 2 months and about 3 weeks
06About 2 months
13I've still got 3 and a half weeks of college to go :<
06.-.
4:P
13And yet you still say vacation
13so you're silly either way :3
4lol
4once i confused english and french
4i was writing a story for my french class
4but i wrotes vacations instead of vacances
4i was working on it with someone, and he didn't even tell me i wrote it wrong
oh
not good ;/
10Hey Shi-shi
Hey Sky
06Hi Shyny
06Shiny
Hey Chao and Snugglesilk
4lol Snugglesilk
my bouncer is dying in a fire.
.-.
04NO MORE REGENTS
04THANK GOD
04Hi :3
/me hugs
13ohai :3
04Shiny: Is the demo actually WORKING this time?
04If so *goes downstairs*
I didn't know there was a demo lmao
04actually I'll check
10Hi Chimew
04hi
04gonna play the SG Demo
04:3
You just said that hedghogs have been running for 20 years and then you started running
So I figured that you were trying to chase after em
4geez, brb
13Just noticed the phone that's supposed to be in the living room downstairs is up here again
13I hate when my mum switches the phones around and doesn't put them back ;;
04LE DEMO
10At least she admitted to it
04IS HERE
04YES
Lol Sky
10I found it as soon as I went on dA and typed in 'Reshiram sprite'
06And I'm afraid about employing sarcasm because I can't make it obvious enough
I'm laughing at this all really
Sarcasm doesn't work on her :<
!espeon
06I know that if I go "That's real mature" even THAT won't be noticed as sarcasm <<
10Think I should forum PM Arti with the logs? Just in case she doesn't see them
13I got a pasty while I was putting the phones back where they belong
4i'm baaaaaaaack~
13it was quite cold downstairs o-o
06Yeah, that's why I didn't delete everything she said afterall.
10Or I'll wait until she reappears to notify her then
She won't appear for a while, or does she only come to the chat at night?
10I'd feel like too much of a tattle tale sending it now :P
wb Chao
4yayz
4thankz Shiny
That's how I partially felt last night
Np :3
4i woke my sister up
4\oops
4-\
lol
Mmn
4as in
She was banned for a reason
4one night before now
10PM me here the details?
lmao Chao
And guys,
4i am suffering the consequences
Heh
/me 4is quoting his sister
4"I was asleep, then i hear the door go BANG!"
4"Then I go back to sleep and the door goes BANG!"
13that's what's up
13|D
/me 4flees
Ah
She's... a total space case.
/me hides
13Not deserving of legendary status
10I think you guys should've just ignore her by the way, it's only adding fuel to her fire
/me runs
10Reasoning with her is impossible
13and people keep calling trying to sell stuff >:/
I could go on
/me RUNS
06I'm just saying what I mean so I don't feel like I'm sitting there ignoring everything that happens, I'm quite aware that she only hears what she wants to hear.
Just... ignore her
She's a gone case
BAN HER.
/me RUNS
4ban who? ignore who?
4OSHA-WHAT'S GOING ON!!?!?!?!?!?!!?
Yeah, I know that posting there is adding fuel to the fire, but I also know that just sitting there watching isn't really a chat box.
06And now she's saying that she has been doing it on purpose / "trolling" or something.
06Typical last-resort defense.
/me adds 30 Pink Floyd tracks to his current playlist.
13|D
Meh
Imma not even caring this conversation about her
Just looking at MLP:FiM fanart while listening to the song from the Battle: Los Angeles trailer
13!espeon
13I'm eating a pasty with mayo and I have an espeon
13I win :3c
06=D
/me hides under Snugglesilk
I'm on her bad side now ;v;
10We all are, probably
13It's almost like you're supposed to care :D
4um
06Well, I won't do anything permanent unless Arti and such agrees, but I think that her current "rage" calls for a 24 hour one at least...
4am i allowed to know what we're talking about?
06From the cbox, she's obviously quite mad at the moment and we can always dream that she thinks of what she has done
13she should be grateful she got a second chance in the first place
/me 4gives up and flies to the nearest volcano
13some mods/admins don't even allow that :B
I'm gonna say no Chao
It really doesn't matter though
06Yeah, but 1 day ban now. Should take it up with Arti because what Sky said.
06For a solution that's not beating around the bush and 23rd chances .-.
06Anyway
10More than a second chance, Espy XD
13Beating around the bush sounds so suggestive
13|D
/me sprawls out over Sky
/me pets Shiny
06Second chance was like the first day she was around, when she revived ancient threads just to snarl at those not happy about 5th gen or something.
Beating around the bush...y tail?
06Bushy tails
06:3
4Who thinks Fall is the best season?
13I prefer Spring
10I do
06I like Spring
I hate people who hate 5th gen as wel;
13everything DIES in Autumn
06because everything
13;;
*well
06comes to mind
06life
I like fall
06what
But
I don't thread bump
And I think I like Summer
06Well I hate people who hate things, but she went like "YOU HAVE NO TASTE" when people said "I prefer nth gen" or something
13Though I'll be honest, Autumn's my second favourite season because the leaves are pretty at that time xD
06oh well
13Summer is too hot, Winter is depressing
13so yeah
4Summer too hot, Winter WAY too cold
4Spring to wet
10I am a winter-fall person
4Autumn brings the wind
10Spring is bad allergies for me, summer is too hot for my tastes
13Nothing wrong with being too we- *shot*
Man I miss my bold blue :<
It's summer all the time in Singapore
we don't get to choose >>
06Silly Espeons
10Why can't you use it, Shiny?
I'm on the mibbit chat
mIRC is being a pain
13You can celery font colours to use on mibbit too o-o
13and wtf celery

I AM SO INCREDIBLY LONELY.

/me joins in the hugging :3
I've been spamming Facebook and twitter with my randomness cause I have seen no life anywere and I need to stay up cause my uncle wants to take me to a store but then he just sat on the couch and started playing with his iphone thingy and I was like way
So then I'm like sitting here and trying to stay up and also I'm trying to beat my itunes library, which has like two days left in it before it reaches the end
10o.o
I sneezed. I think I'm allergic to him ;o;
IT'S FRIDA-Oh wait, no it isn't.
The prince is dead? Long live the prince.
I'm alive!
Hi everyone.
Lovely.
10Hi Ecco
Greetings...dolphin *whirr*
I just found a place were they peddle used DVDs and stuff. =b
o-o
Got Death Race 2000 and a Criteron Collection of Carnival of Souls. Excellent.
04meow
That sounds cool.
04HOW IS IT ONLY 1:12
0413
14
HAH
Eyup.
10Stop complaining about how slow the days go, Chimew :P
They were in the process of moving though. So I'm not sure if I'm ever going to stumble opon them again.
Also it reminds me that Sprinkles and DCD could only find the spider film on youtube - it's that bad.
Did you ask them were they were moving to?
Eyup.
/me wants days that go slow when he doesn't have to work but go fast when he does have to work!
^
same with me >:
But I'm poor with adressess. I don't exactly know the city like the palm of my hands.
Add to that a glass and a half of fortified wine.
04lol Ecco
04and Sky
04I'm not complaining
What was the name of the spider film? :P
04I'm just going "WTF It's dark out and it feels like 5:00 PM D:
04"
Haha, I understand that, I've never been that great with locations under the best of circumstances.
10k
Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale
I think it's a remake of a film based on a book (or the version I saw was a remake).
10Seen it
(late) hi ecco
Hey Nick and not too late!
I saw a DVD of the movie that A Pigs Tale probably borrowed liberaly from when I was grocery shopping.
Charlottes Web or something. Idk
Yeah, that's what I've seen before.
Unless films based around spider-pig relationships are more common than I'd thought I would have thought this film was based on the same sort of thing.
floof
10Shiny
10:3
Cute
;D
Hey. It's on Netflix
gotta go out for 15 mins to shop bbl
Move out of the way Pixar.
There's a new kid in town.
Hahaha.
Only on YT huh? That'd make streaming kind of awkward.
Yeah, I'm not really sure what they decided to do in the end.
If it goes wrong. You could allways show Dead Heat. ;D
Hahaha.
Some day Turni, I'm sure you'll win, then we'll watch Dead Heat. :P
I want that day to come soon. I got more in my bag of tricks. ;P
Like Rats: Nights of Terror and Idle Hands.
Idle Hands is also really fun.
And I guess it could be concidered throwing a bone to the stoner bronies too.
Heheh, it's that strange?
Well. It's more the fact that the main characters are stoners.
Ahh.
I saw some film with Tim Roth where the main characters were drug addicts.
Gridlock I think.
Never saw it.
Not really "into" drug flicks. I was just really drawn in by the premise.
Alien Hand Syndrome basicly. ;P
When a films come on TV and I happened to be watching whatever was on before it I usually end up watching the film. XD
I can't help it.
04Floofpreon
04also EW BIEBER
04but lol that image
Any good ones?
More often than not they're bad - that's how I ended up seeing "The Wikerman" remake.
Oh.
Never even seen the original. I wonder if that one have BEES too.
XD I haven't seen the original either.
But someday I'll end up seeing the remake. I'm sure.
Infact. My sensors indicate it will be picked for a B movie sooner or later.
Yeah, for sure.
But hopefully not before Dead Heat. ;D
So when is the OFFICIAL ENTRY thread up?
04no wonder it's so dark out
04Storm :|
Ouch :(
The weather is too good here

Hmm, I don't know.
04rain is light yes, but thunder and lightning signifies storm
04and heh, humidity is 84%

04Also why is it that the pressure here is 1029mb
04but we have storm
04o-o
04hey Dari
o
...
Hey.
04OH LOOK
04POWER SURGE
04this ain't pretty
o.o
Horry shit!
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130867445520.png
Awesome.
How do I not have this picture?
idk. Maybe it's new.
I'm not even a big fan of RBD or anything. But that was fantastic.
Rainbow Dash is best pony :>
04dang the lightning is close
Actually. Rarity is.
SCIENTIFICLY PROVEN FACT
Pfft, how? :P
Because she's fabulous, High class, intelligent and funny. Plus her episodes are the best.
Will you die?
:o
Rainbow Dash is consistently the most awesome pony, and without her all the other ponies would have had crappy lives, and been blank flanks FOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEEEVEEEER
Oh, you mean that Mary Sue shit in the Chronicles thing?
Yeah...
Rainbow Dash is alittle too jerkish for my tastes.
Meh, all the ponies have their flaws.
Pony thread - post Spiderman. I like it.
Hell. In Sonic Rainboom, my sympathies was with Rarity. And that was before she was my favorite pony.
04HML no, why would you ask that o.o
Lightning is dangerous :(
Rarity was just as bad as Rainbow Dash can be, showing off her wings, entering the flying competition.
Showing off her wings. Well DUH. What would you do if you got wings for a day?
Entering the competition? That's just bitchy.
04yes but more dangerous when you're outside
04not when you in a framed household :P
That's not bitchy, come on.
*Go to support, end up competing against*
Nice one.
Job well done.
Did he died?
Allow me to shed tears for the overconfident jerk then. ;P
She wasn't confident at all.
That's why they went there in the first place. :P
Not when she finally got some competition , no. But otherwise.
Then Rarity comes along and makes her feel even worse.
The whole episode is because Rarity notices how nervous Rainbow Dash is, and makes Twilight get them to the competition.
Once again. Once in a lifetime opertunity for someone who normally can'y fly.
04?
Then suddenly she forgets her friend is very nervous and how important it is to her, and competes against her.
Could be a once in a lifetime chance for RD to meet the Wonderbolts. :P
Nope.avi
Did someone say Galla?
Just because they're going to be there doesn't mean RD will get a chance to meet or talk to them.
Like if a famous musician/performer/whatever goes to play/perform at a festival, concert, etc, you don't get to meet them. :P
That was what she was banking on since she wanted to be there.
/me runs
She hoped she might get to, it wasn't a certainty. :P
04LOLwhat
04HML why do you hate me x3
Well, she did.
HML is evil
:3
10I was joking, but does he? o.o
Even wrecked shit and the likes trying to get their attention. :P
Not really :p
04I dunno
04hence why I asked
04k
04XD
You might say she's an... attention horse. Har har har.
Just stay away from mah Skylands
/me hides
/me pokes Skylands
/me looks at HML
XD
/me pokes Lightlugia
11I'm not going to be on for long
meep
04HML
04Maybe :3
/me runs
10HML is an overprotective boyfriend :P
Not really ;3
11It's very late, and I need to get some sleep, soon
BURT BURT BURT
You're boyfriend with HML? 0__o
I mean, hey
YES
04orly
10Patrick is slow
04and XD
Slow
04yes he is
XD
Actually, I knew before
11I've spent all my free time at the wiki, trying to help out
04Slow like...
Lies
04like...
04LIKE...
Slowbro
04TAILS
11Okay?
;)
/me runs
No, Magiderp is slower
10Maybe I should make a public announcement when everyone else is around
10Then no more "WTF U GAIZ TOGETHER"
lu told me before =P
YEAH
Good idea Sky :3
/me whistles
10I would think the WB message is enough
Yeah
hey pattyrick!
Yo =D
But let's agree to disagree
Ok.
12Hey
13Messy liiiines
10Ohai Espy
13didn't even realise until I zoomed out
11I cannot be on, much longer, Icy. It's very late here.
13ah well, can't be bothered fixing now |D
13and hai Sky :3
12Ooook
the lines are the only things messy?
13Of course, the lineart is always the hardest part xD
04AE :3
04hi
13ohai :3
10I like lineart more than colouring
10Colouring takes forever
11Sorry
10Unless it's digital
12It's ok
sheesh, I thought this chat would be a suitable place for gutterburd comments, but seems not :P
13I prefer lineart when doing traditional, and colour when digital :3
hmmm
Nope, not really Lakorv ;p
10Me too
13Especially colouring eyes
13my favourite part
13|D
10Sarcasm?
That is when DRF and the others are on :p
I guess.
That's when I be trollin'.
Not really :p
hey

I don't know, what would it involve doing, does everyone record themselves separately and send it in to be put together, or do you do it all in at the same time in the same place or something?
bleah the wii is DEAD this year. hardly anything has come out.
Same time in the same place? U mad?
12Well, the wii u is coming out...
Yes. Record ourselves seperatly.

5And then for dessert you can have
5ICE CREAM AND CAKE
XD I was JUST about to write that!
I need to zleep.
5'cause ALL OF THE KIDS LIKE ICE CREAM AND CAKE.
cake and cake~
I like ice cream, but not cake
10We don't have cake, but surely popsicle counts as ice cream?
None of them underwater movies then.
cake..
CAKE
CAAAAAAAAAAKE
/me implodes
if it's sea salt flavor, sure ;>
sea salt flavored ice cream
or cake?
shoudl've had them return it XD jk
it's a KH reference XD
5THE CAKE IS A LIE
oh
7O_o
The Pie is the spy!
/me 7gnaws on fishy crackers.
Hey, she didn't blink =P
Well. Leviathan was a alien ripoff that was sort of passable. The Abyss was hella long but some lovely underwater shots.
:O :O
7Speaking of, watch Valve's YouTube channel.
fishy crackers!
5Popsicles do not count as ice cream because they're not milk-based.
can I nom on some too, Quan? :>
12I wanted to try it, and just like wii sports, it was fun for about 5 min
fudgicles are though
7I suppose. o3o
7I might brb soon to deal with this lag.
ahh ok
I'm hoping Sphere will take me away into a magical land were the underwater threath isn't humans or aliens. But the freakish deep sea monsters from real life.
/me strongly dislikes lag o3o
fish crackers are good, but I prefer White Cheddar Cheez-Its
OMG
I love those too! <3
They're the best
bleh wii sports.. didn't even bother with that game.
Same here :p
Go cheese
But probably not.
12It was all I had when we first got the wii
10Golfish crackers
my love for cheese is cheesy <3
10Goldfish*

ohai GL :3
5Hi! :3
5I just found this really cute t-shirt with a Pikachu on it. x3;;
You know Weird Al linked to PMVs twice on his twitter?
Pikachu is ok, but Lucario is teh awesomeness
5http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/p_10151_10104_002B7906000P?prdNo=7&blockNo=7&blockType=G7
TEH awesomeness
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-truck-parking-fail.jpg
5I guess it's sold at Sears~ I might head down there since I'm planning on taking my bike again anyways.
That's allright.
5(Oh the joy of living less than a mile from a mall~!)
Onward to Sphere for me.
lolz
my closest mall is a 45 min drive
10Cute shirt
03like a 10 minute drive here
03but EW MALLS
eh, malls are ok
03why would you pay like 3x the intended price for something
03just buy stuff online
5Omigawd, Aero, I would die from mall estrangement. ;~;
03it's so much cheaper
lol rp4l
5DRF, because you need to learn how to find CLEARANCE RACKS. xD
Malls are only convenient, but not so cheap and easy to shop at
5I live off of clearance racks.
03I can guarantee you that even with the clearance stuff, I Can find it cheaper online.
lots of walking and lots of people
you sound like one of those preppy girls that NEED to get a new pair of pants every day XD
12First game I got was mario tennis, and transformers 2
5Not easy maybe but it's fun~
13Ew, shopping D:
5Aero, I actually don't buy new stuff that often.
/me runs
http://www.rebelrockrunners.org/gallery/d/27727-1/fail-1.gif
5I muse over it for at least a week or two before deciding on anything.
Shopping is boring
P:
ahh
that's coolio then :>
5The only thing I will impulse buy is related to Star Trek or RUSH.
03well, I don't find it fun, if I go to the mall the only store I stop in is GameStop and even then I tend to just take pictures of stuff I want and then buy it somewhere cheaper
12He did? lol
5I like hanging out at the mall by me because it's pretty much dead so I know everyone who works there. :P
Yeah, he linked to this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhOlAU4t9Hs
03I'd much rather just be on IRC :P
03and eh
5And there's this really cool costume shop; my friend's mom co-owns it.
And I think another one.
think i had sonic and the secret rings, super smash bros brawl..
03I know some people go to the mall to pick up chicks, but I don't need to do that XD
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/internets-daily-needs.jpg
5I got a pretty neat 'Trek costume from aforementioned store last year that I wore at a con. xD
03I wouldn't abbreviate it as con if I were you, it makes it sound like something illegal :P
I would be one who would say internet =P
12Sonic...
Are you in the US?
12Awesome
5CONVENTION
5geez
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-oddly-specifc-lread-bears.jpg
12Yes
03LOL
5Like anyone's watching
Do you have the Hub?
LOL
5WHY WOULD I WEAR A STAR TREK OUTFIT IF I WAS A CON ARTIST
5xDD
I knew what she meant :>
03I dunno
cause I cool like that *puts on shades*
03Nick from Left 4 Dead 2 is a con artist and he wears a suit :P
12Ah, yes
5That's because con artists are /supposed/ to wear suits
5so they look fly~
am nor
not*
03LOL
03Wrong Nick :P
Lucky, no ponies on TV yet for the Eurobronies.

12Oh, they don't have MLP on TV in Europe yet?
Nope.
5Pfffffft now I'm online shopping. D: Lol checking Hot Topic to see if they've got any new RUSH stuff which of course they probably won't because they only advertise lame things like Twilight and Justin Beaverface.

5On sale though.

03have you ever seen mattresses NOT on sale? :P
Oh, apparently it starts airing on the 4th of July.
12That's good
03so buying something just because it's on sale is dumb
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-school-uniforms-fail.jpg <- OMG AWESOME
2 days before my birthday, that's a nice present.
5But it's cheap compared to everything else RUSH.
12Oh... it's released today lol
5http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Music/Apparel/Hoodies/Rush-Starman-ZipUp-Hoodie-195878.jsp <--- Like this completely overpriced hoodie.

Yay :D
Nice Uniforms
03wtf $48
03heck
03I was at a Weird Al concert and even then the t-shirts were only $25
03which is a lot by my standard
5If I've been looking for something or wanting something and it happens to be on sale I'll strongly consider it.
03especially since it's a concert
5DRF yeah but HT is overpriced almost always so :P
03Most my shirts cost between $5 and $10. LOL

12lol, that’s actually a pretty awesome name xD
5No, the starman is not STEPPING IN AWE or whatever. The figure represents standing against the oppression of society and choosing independence over following the crowd.

03it's one of the new original ones off his new CD
12Hmm is the 360 any good?
5I love watermelon. <3
lol
I think it's gross
I'd like the 360 so much more if you didn't have to pay for online.
10Too watery
but watermelon candy is good
indeed!
XD
10Yeah, the candy is exceptionally good
It's kind of a moeny, because sometimes I use it a lot, but other times I won't use it for a month.
if you have a ps3 not really since most games are multi plat but earlier mumtiplats were better on the 360 nowadays its not really that big a deal
03watermelon is prolly my favorite fruit second to pineapple
So the fact that it's paid for annoys me.
03LOL
03"Rebecca Black's Birthday was yesterday, Today she is 14, last year she was 13, Next year she will be 15, and 16 comes after that."

10Speaking of Rebecca Black
10Anyone hear her music video was taken down?
03yes
Is the party on Friday? She going to get down on Friday?
03like a week ago
Yeah, you told me
12Same
not planning on using the 360's pay services, since i'd rarely if at all use it.
12Indeed
12But it was worth it id go for it
5So, for her, what now? o-o

That way you can tell me how you'd want things to look too (I just put the colours to grey pretty much for now).
well I won't be around long today though, got some studying to do
I could check it tomorrow before the stream starts though?
Where you want the navigation bar, and what it should look like and stuff.
Could you just check to see if you can see it?
sure
I'm not sure if it'll work.

7Indeed.

Ohai Sprinkles.
6Hey dari
thankies C:
I was just showing DCD what I've got so far for the
6brb
site.
hnghng does anyone have a pressure tablet?
7Nope.avi
Tablet what?
yes and it's pretty damn cool yo
6back
6Show please?
its like, ...
86.22.93.170
Go there in your address bar.
its so damn hard to explain anything ;-; wish i were better in english
Ah, lovely weather over there then. :/
but. its a tablet what reacts to the pressure you put on it
6lol I love GOD DAMN NEWS
aka how hard you press with the pencil
Should the countdown go on the front page?
lighter touch=lighter line
6Yes.
Where, at the bottom or top?
6I say two countdowns, one for each. At the top.
Aah, those things XD
6Thoughts, DCD?
Nah, I never have had a tablet/drawpad
I could just have it automatically countdown to the Saturday showing when it hits 0 on the Friday showing.
good idea
one countdown's better though
that switches, I mean
flrrp
also
I just had the BEST IDEA for a video
and my scruff is dead.
Should the countdown timer go by the user's computer time, or shall I try and set it to get it from a server online? It'd be much easier to go by the computer's time.
What's that DCD?
What scruff? XD
HBADJNS
back of your neck
an Ace Attorney Investigations parody vid
Aah XD
I CANT TALK
Odd term, well, kinda
in which instead of discussing a crime
YES YOU CAN
I JUST FAIL AT SLANG
i'll make my own languake
the CROSS-EXAMINATION/REBUTTAL consists of Edgeworth and Lang fighting over who the best pony is
obviously Edgey vies for Twilight while Lang vies for Dash
LOL
Awesome.
and teach my clan members in the ways of Annikenglishfinnish
Annikan

5 Waitwhat?
complete with spams of OBJECTION! and NOT SO FAST! and HOLD IT! and TAKE THAT!
/me 5just missed everything
Haha, I can see that in my head.
and THIS SONG http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dorU0Rpmr7E&feature=related
6I have found something worse than the FOX news thing.
5I have a Bamboo Pen
5It's supposed to have pressure sensors
O=
5but it doesn't work. x__x
pfft
I didn't even think the FOX new thing was bad.
also sup Peanut
5Well
The one guy said we had nothing to be ashamed of.
i have this itsy bitsy wacom
5I haven't tried with SAI
5SO IT MIGHT WORK THEN LOL.
02brb
12 Hello, Quack|2 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
but i bought brand new huge tablet today
hmmn?
The other guy was pretty old, and old people are usually quite stuck in the way they think, so he probably thinks it's wrong, but meh, I don't care.
it was... little black bamboo fun
5Like Bamboo..?
5Oh, yeah.
or still is
lol
5When did you get it?
2-3 years ago
I don't get why people thought it was so bad.
5Because mine is a pretty late model but I wasn't too happy with it. It works though and I can't find the pen to my old tablet. xD
Dx aww
6*shrug*
5I mean it /works/ but.. I dunno. /shrug
6Well, I'm streaming this radio show's reaction on Saturday. It's just... argh.
5And it works better and is more reliable than my Genius.
In fact, the other people seemed against what the old guy was saying.
06Wb~
5Welcome back. :3
Reacting so badly to it makes us look bad. :/
welcome bach
C:
13Hai.
13Thanks :3
5BACH IS DEAD
Hey.
/me 5is shotted
13So did I miss anything important like I usually do?
Great message to come into. lmao
10DDD''':
5OH LOL
10Teal user
5Yeah bad timing.
10WELCOME
10oh, hiya =D
Teal
I LOVE TEAL
XD
5BROWN
The Teal Twins
13I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO!
5HAUAH
13=D
*SHOT*
And only Skylands can use Teal
:P
5what colour is this?
10Brown is too muddy
5I don't use purple though 'cause that's Roara's. |3
14Best colour ever
10I like to think of it as maroon
I could never figure out how to change colors.
5This? Maroon? Maybe.
well
11Hello
yesterday you sort of did
10Manly, what IRC program client you using?
Urgh, bad idea
5COLOUR EYE BURN
10-program
5CYAN NUUUUU
6You missed the worst mod interview in history
lots of discussion of future projects we'll be working on the long run
CYAN MADE MYST
:D
5my character has black, purple and that... blue? teal?
that too
108PROBLEM?
Nice
06Purrple
06That is all
5Wait what character? xD
5owww
8,11Nice
Black. That is all.
5No fail.
5that yellow really kills my eye- YAAGSHDJ
5@HML
:(
:D
5well, not really character
5dragonsona
Trololo, problem?
5oAo
Uhhh, mIRC? lol
5Oh ha~ Now I remember, Annika. :3
13Oh
Really no point in changing it, though. Once everyone has a different color, black becomes special, haha.
but the most important thing was the future projects
Dragonsona, ah :3
5and i have those colours in my every form
10Do Ctrl + K and select a colour
5I don't have a sona. Unless you count the little character girl I use in all my forum avatars.
Could I see a picture?
since it's something we have to work in long-term planning
Control Kool
10Except then you'll have to keep doing that
10Unless you make script
13Well. I'm more of the person who comes in and does his job and leaves and tries to avoid all little extra projects
13:3
Engrish
Black is the best colour anyway.
13But I'll join if it's mandatory
13<3
I make script!
5i''ll quickly finish my first drawing with this drawing asd
13Also I should be here for job interviews probably.
Sauna?
Oh, sona
I would use orange, but it's probably too bright.
Sona Sonic
well you should probably be informed about it
Sonic Sona
Hrm
5SAUNA
5SO NICE
5<3
cause it's gonna change how our jobs take place
10Orange isn't too bright
10Also, there's an FAQ for it
Someone else uses orange here
5Oh gawd now I want to be in one.
10http://www.lugia.us/faqs-chat.htm#3
10Simple steps
5Kyu?
10@ Manly
People who think they own colours make me lol.
I swear some people have a Sauna fetish at times
!shipping
Derp
13I've never been in a sauna, but they don't sound appealing o-o
13Alright.
So complicated.
13You just sit in a pool of your own sweat in a hot room for a while
13and sweat isn't appealing D:
5Saunas are kind of relaxing but not like a jacuzzi, which are like "I could stay in here foreeeverz"
10Like a hot tub?
10But those are nice :3
13Also. new mod channel again?
13Or is it the same?
13Hot tubs are nice, though it takes a while for me to get used to the hot water xD
13can't remember the last time I went in one though
Posted this on the fox news video:
I don't understand why there was such a big negative reaction to this.
Looking at it, I saw it mostly as positive, other than that one guy, but
why does it matter what he thinks? He's entitled to﻿ think that, just as
we are entitled to watch and enjoy MLP. Please guys, grow up, stop
making us look bad. (:
13probably about 10 years ago or something
13Ah alright same one
10I do, whenever we stay at hotels
10Most hotels have hot tubs
13Mmm. Fox News wont listen
I would die in a Sauna
So I never go near therre
Meh, they're just trying to get laughs out of their average viewers, people who think that adults liking MLP is strange and funny. :P
*there
5Welcom back HML.
Whee
5**Welcome
Thankies XD
**WaCom
But something
10HML, what about hot tubs?
Never been in one
But they sound...fun
5D:
Mainy because it is so stupidly hot here
5But it's like heaven!
10I need to stop saying HML :<

10DOMINOES
OH U
6Listen to this.
RAAH
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFZ-adsKc8
13Hungry :<
Well, I have been in a hot tub before, a large one
/me thinks of Bad Romance by Lady Gaga with 'raah'
10!espeon
I got hurt badly after I came out :p
/me now belongs to Skylands for 18 minutes
Raahaaa~~
/me now belongs to Skylands for 16 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 19 minutes
06I get somewhat uncomfortable in a hot tub really fast .-. in case that didn't go through <<
5Really? o-o
5saunas are awesome :O
5i just came from one
Yeah, same here Espeon x.x
LOL
13Lol, I'm uncomfortable when I first get in
I love that reaction.
5For me it's getting in in the first place that's worst. Because it BURRRRRNS but then it feels niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice....
"Wuuuuut?"
13but once I get used to the temperature I could stay in there all day |D
10Also, right after getting out of the hot tub, jump in the pool
/me hides
"Please no!"
10Very cold water x.x
5Lolno Sky. D:
I perfer to keep my body in temperatures below 100F, thank you very much
5Hey Feather~ :3
10Thirded
Fourthed
6It's just... so ignorant.
Fourthed
6I actually laughed through most of it.
Oh, same spelling
Odd word
XD
5HML, it's not like it's going to make you sick. o-o At least I've never heard of that happening.
also
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ULBrmCqUYI&feature=related
Heatstroke
OH GOD STOP HAVING SEX WITH MY EARS
It can and will happen eventually :D
I perfer to stay on the safe side :p
5I think you're more likely to get heatstroke watching a baseball game in Nebraska.
5Or Florida rather.
6*turns on VAC in order to listen*
5Since baseball's bigger there.
5Or any southern state. xD
Florida
That place
5HAS CRAZY TRAFFIC
Has weather just like here, quite hot
Humid too
5Sounds like Nebraska during July and August
5except for today
5because it just hit 72 a little while ago
Well you've got to learn to laugh at yourself, it's just part of life. Anyway, you've got to admit if you'd never seen MLP before, you'd probably think that adults watching "My little pony", the most girly toys that you remember from your childhood, is pretty strange.

6If you don't have anything nice to say, and whatnot.
Haha, that comment makes me laugh so much.
5Didn't you mention that in one of the forum threads? xD
/me throws several hundred at RP4L!
6?
Not because what the guy is saying is funny, just because it makes the guy, and all the radio hosts look so stupid.
5 /PELTED
5DDD:

I've actually played it RP4L
6Just, complete stupidity right there.
5OH PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME BE

5Was it really as bad as you said? D:
6That's the point where you're leaving decent discussion and just becoming a raging buffoon.
Ahahaha, way to make yourself look like an idiot. XD That's hilarious.
oh yeah...
thing with atari is there's several game modes which adds new features, game mode one has the FBI agent and Scientist chasing after you, the third one has none
I need a shirt which says "I love ponies" with all 6 on the front, and the the back trollface with "Problem?".
on the*
5Weird...
so the gmae is potentially too annoying and hard with the two goons and too easy without them.

13Wb again :P
its a pain in the neck when you have two phone pieces and I have 9 reese's pieces so I can call elliot to bring me a piece, only to have the scientist constantly chasing you so you never get a break, falling down holes getting out then when you think you have a moment to breathe...
the fbi guy appears at the bottom screen and takes a phone piece away and vanishes.....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
5I always thought it was a relatively new thing to make video games after movies and the like.
well the atari 2600 was a very old console and I think ET was one of the first game adaptations ofa movie
5Or maybe they only made that because ET was a huge blockbuster hit.
6I need one that says has the Collective Internet Hug picture on the front, with it saying "The Friendship is Hitting the Fan" and on the back the Orbital Friendship Cannon with it saying "And it's Painting the Internet Rainbow"
5But generally I've found that movie-based games are horrible.
except goldeneye 007 and spiderman 2 :3
Hahaha.
5I think I had Spiderman 2.
in fact the cars 2 game got an 8/10 from IGN o.o
Spiderman 2 was fun
5Or maybe that was Spiderman (the first one, for PS).
3rd one meh
o.o
5I know it was for PS. >__>;;
5Rather than PS2 I mean.
Spiderman 2 was great, it was actually the first spiderman game to have spidey actually swinging through a free-roaming NYC and his web attached to buildings instead of thin air
No new pony episodes, still ponies, everywhere on the internet, and bronies all over the media.
and it was a movie game!
5What console was it for?
Next series. MFW AAWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH.jpg
well I had it for PS2, most likely on GCN and xbox too
06Spiderman 2 oh wow I remember that
5Hm. Then I probably didn't have it lol.
06It was fun
6XD
5I sold almost all my video games.
I has Spiderman 2 for the PS2
5There's a kid who wants my N64. He's offering me $150. I am stubbornly refusing him.
o-o
holy crap!
.-.
5I guess they're considered "retro" or something and since mine's in pretty much perfect condition (it's just dusty lol) he really wants it. Probably to keep and sell later. xD
I'm sorry I broke things don't hurt me
5I don't get why he doesn't just go to Gamers or Gamestop and get one himself.
Only one thing to do at a time like this.
5As for me, it holds too much nostalgic value to let go. xD;

Are you sure?
12up to its death
12and even then
He hasn't even attended any BMNs.
12I would NEVER give away

12Captain Falcon XD
12I was part of a rather amusing match with 2 CFs
12and then one with Liiiink o3o
Falcon ftw! FALCOOOOON PUUUNCH!
best Smash bros move...ever
12lolz
12GANONDORF PUNCH!
5I should try to get a Wii because then I could wifi battle. But again the wiimote is annoying. :|
/me 12shot
CLONE
/me uns
which is sadly true :\
12XD
/me 12nods
12as is Falco to Fox o3o
13RP4L, just use a gamecube controller o3o
^
O3O
o3o*
12or a Classic Controller
13I've forgotten how to adapt and play as other characters
12actually
5Really? You can?
/me 12nods
12actually
5So you can just take an N64 controller and plug it in? xD
/me 12has never tried using a Classic
13Hence why I just play as the same two characters all the time xD
12no lol
13>Mfw I'm barely qualified when reading the app
12just Gamecube
5lol
13xD
5Oh I see.
/me 12sighs
12since OoT was remade
5Personally I've always loved the PS2 controller. N64 comes in second.
Cubie~
12now a Kirby 64 3D title needs to be done
I loved the PS2 and GC, SNES was fine
12>:|
N64..meh
I disliked it
12D:
5MEH
5MEH!?
12*GASP*
5MEH!?!?
5 /shot
MEH
12be still my beating heart
TERRIBLE I MEAN
12why Hyper?
XD
6I actually hit every single question that we ask, including the ones in the interview.
5That console was my childhood! That and the GBC.
6justthatawesome.jpg
Too many different ways to hold it
12the SNES was mine ^^;;;
12lolz
And my hands are too big
5........lolwut.

12ADAPT DARN IT
/me 12flees
5That is a really pathetic excuse.
NO THANKS
IKR>
/me 5flees as well.
I think it looks terrile
*terrible
And then the joystick feels bad
Silly ridges
:P
13How I got modded: At first BMN, come to second one early. NewDCD: "Want to be a mod?" Me: "Lol sure!"
12THAT I have to agree -.-
12but Kirby 64 doesn't use it |3
5Joystick what? You mean just the little toggle joystick on the controller right?
People bagging on the N64 controller? I laugh.
5^
6How I got modded: Show up REALLY early and stay REALLY late for every one starting the third.
06People bagging on any controller? I laugh.
12lolz
I laughed again. lol
5xD ^ Even though I do
6I showed up to all of them though. XD
06Unless you're mini-me or some kind of giant then one can adapt .-.
5It's a silly thing.
06And by giant I mean like
13I've only missed one
06cooking pan palms
06or something
12me? :D
/me 12flees
13and it was the Monty Python one
13D:
6I missed Space Jam. My comp died. ;-;
6But I got to see Mulan... so...
06Not just tall but.. I won't explain, anyone can adapt to any controller if they want ~~
I missed half of Monty Python, since you guys decided to start early. :P
The fat Xbox controllers were the best. ):
Xbox in general is bad
5"Aaaa brilliant Red Baaaaaaarchetta from aaaaaaa better, vanished tiiiiiiiime~" /loves "Red Barchetta" fabulous song <3
/me hides
6Monty Python wasn't started early... was it?
Not when you have friends to play it with.
lol
5wind in my hair -- shifting and drifting -- mechanical music -- adrenaline suuuuuuuuuurge!!!
That's my point, I have no friends </sarcasm>
That's what I was implying. xD
Plus friends = jerks normally ;D
Yeah, the movie night started 2 hours early that time.
06HML are you sure that you're not related to Francis from L4D?
So I got there early, but had still missed a lot of the film.
06You seem to dislike everything at times.
/me hides
Well, early by the previous time.
6Oh yeah... that's when it got moved to 7 PM officially.
IKR about L4D?

10You killed all the females

10No gameshark needed
10But it requires cloning one of your Pokemon too
Or a couple of seconds.
5Hm. That's true.
5I dunno.
°³°
10Too much effort, IMO
5It just occurred to me I never checked if my Shiny Gyarados was male or female.
10But hey, it's an option
5I think it's male though.
10For desperate people
12LOL Role
12you check? :P
12have you NO SHAME? D:
/me 12shot
5But I don't use the shiny, I have another Gyarados which knows all the water-based HMs so it's the only one I use.

I think Hydry is better

06I wonder if it has fur.
06.-.
/me battles Skylands with his Skitord
12WTFWTFWTF
12in this Master Quest
Yeah it does.
12LINK IS RIGHT HANDED!!!!!!
/me 12._.
so was he in TP
10o.o
12no
4Osha-Hello all (late)
In the Wii version, he was right handed. lol
12that was to accomidate (sp?) all the right-handed people playing the W#ii
:
12-#
:|
/me had the wii version then
12*accomodate
And all the right handed people on the 3DS
12no
12he was left handed in the first part
12but in Master Quest
12o.o
x.x
Vivamus ACE homines
Silly nintendo
12they flipped everything then
Senatus populusque Romanus has two definitions people follow
12the map
12the dungeons
The Senate and People of Rome
12and his arm strength
or the Senate and Roman People
so, yes, it can be translated
10wat
12also
The whole of the Aneid is in Latin.
but you just have to add articles like a,an, and the
And it is translated into English.
12Sakon is the White Rabbit
well sure a book can be translated
I'm here.
You didn't follow what I was meaning.
11DCD, are you active?
And what of the Proto-Romance languages?
Earlier he said: [20:32] <NewDCD> well I won't be around long today though, got some studying to do
That are derived from Latin and ultimately Latium
What did you mean then?
11Figures.
6lol
There's multiple translations for sentences/words.
So?
6Silver, you see the application I starred in the email?
...
That's for alot of languages, actually
10Loltiming
12lol
In Chinese mandarin you can just say "Wo baba" to mean "my father"
Bay ;3
which translated is actual I father
And BBL, swimming
3is it normal that i kepp disconnected from chat everytime i change tab?
11Yeah, though I merely glanced over it. Trying to get several things done at once.
Michael
instead of wo de baba
12kay Hyper
6Only problem I have with it is his availability on Saturdays.
Depends
meaning I of father
3*keep
12not that I know of, Chao
12and x-x
4because i was here
I didn't say it was only for Latin
12this flipped map
4i change tab and when i get back here
12has my mind mixed up
True, just pointing out :P
I was just making a statement.
Though, yeah you are right
6Also, I know that feel bro.
Mainly because Latin doesn't have any articles and the 'literal' translations are just odd
4maybe my computer has a rotom in it..............
12o.o
11I have a mock up of the new BMN banner.
11http://i56.tinypic.com/2m7c4uu.jpg
11Er, Brony State
Imagine the sentence Puellae sunt ex Agro
mhn?
mhm
*
11Yeah, the lack of showing up on saturday is bad, but he does have experience with being a mod.
11And it's pretty obvious that Fridays are going to be more filled than the Saturday viewings.
12Mushroom Mural wtf...
12that's a bizzare edit
11Dari, I'm going to be coming up with some designs for our website this weekend. Is that alright with you?
*
The sentence may have multiple translations, but it would have had multiple meanings if the language was actually being used, they would have used context to decide how it was meant, so that's what you have to do for translating to English.
Yeah.
I set up a basic layout that we can play around with.
hurray for articles 8D
lmfao
11BLARG!
Indeed.
11What program did you use for it?
I have no idea what's going on right now.
I just wrote it.
HTML and CSS are simple enough.
11Oh, I see.
5No one really does either, Manly. =/
Ohai Turni.
YES! Finally a underwater movie that was really good. =b
Oh, nice.

7Who here knows a bit about competitive battling in pokemon? XD
I do.
Not all that much, though. . -.
06define a bit
06xD
4i gues i know a little
7Eh, just to know what's a good counter to Excadrill.
7Nothing? :P
/me 12idles
12time to play with Danny :3
O_o
I didn't need to hear that.
03we didn't need to hear your ponies either
03but did that stop you? :P
Lol, why did you bring that up?
03because I could
I haven't done anything since.
Nor was what I was doing before unreasonable.
03It was just annoying
03and too much is too0 much
Yet I still conformed to the frankly idiotic rules you decided on.
4i'm not telling yuu
4yuu'll use it against someone :P
4Osha-Hello junh1024-X2
4Quany, what exactly did yuu mean by counter?
4*cough*Oshawott*cough*
/me 4flees
7What can threaten to defeat an opponent Excadrill (preferably in midst of Sand Rush)?
4hmm
/me 4puts himself upside down to think better
7o.o
Feeling lonely? Add more Turni in your diet.
06Night o.o
06!shipping
4 Espeon is paired with Ray
What, eat you? :P
4is there a water/ground type pokemon?
7Yep.
7Swampert, Quagsire, Wiscash(sp?), Seismitoad...
7I think I'm missing one.
06I kind of want to say Gliscor, as it's more defensive than ever. But I have no idea about the 5th gen metagame so eh xD
7Whiscash? Is that how you spell it?
06But yeah, good night
7D:
lol
12BBL
7Gliscor could be an option, but I have a physical wall on my team already.
7Then again, seeing Gliscor's stalling capabilities, it might outclass it. O_o
!pokemon
I a fish
/me swims around
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 6Flygon.
:D
!pokemon
Leafeon, you are a 2Absol.
whoa what
7Nice. :O

7!pokemon

7o3o
o.o
wow Ecco suits you!
yeah.mp4
Hehe, yeah!
/me randomly flygon hugs someone
/me 4hugs Pichuyails
7o.O
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 7Ho-oh.
You have some weird and disturbing fetishes apperantly. ;P
/me 7assumes Nick's hug was at her.
anyway
/me 7bristles and paralyzes Chao.
Lawl.
o_0, wow, the bot is being nice today with the pokemon
4Quany, a counter for Excadrill would probably be a water/ground type
7Hrm...
4they're resistant to steel, rock
7Eh, Earthquake is the main concern.
So what's up?
4does it haff to do with hitting adjacent PKMN?
7No, it's just powerful.
Not much, leaving in about 7 hours to go to the airport.
7Gliscor is immune to Earthquake and physically defensive enough to counter its other moves...
4hmmm
Then you'll be kicking in the front seat?
hello. Sorry for not being on. Had to do an entire house mop-down
4does excadrill know any special moves?
7Not any ones of notice.
7But for coverage, it gets Return and X-Scissor.
The house is 2-stories, too
7The one thing about Gliscor versus my other tank is that Excadrill is immune to Toxic. D:
Mr. Moneybags
Nah, I'm renting it
I don't actually own it
Why not rent something smaller?
4well, focus vlast is strong but not against gliscor
4*blast
4do yuu know excadrill's hidden power?
It was the only thing available at short notice two years ago
whoops forgot this was open
7The opponent's? O_o
Can it pierce the heavens?
I had just lost another house I had to a fire, and was looking for a place to stay
7Gah, gotta go brb.
*shrugs*
I'm getting tired...
Imma go too
Goodnight er'body! =D

7Assume you can't outspeed it.
12o.o

7Assume everything that's not a tank or resistant to all its attacks is OHKOed.
Hmm...I really dont know if i should play OoT today D;

I can't tell if it would be a pain for me XD
I hope I find a friend with a 3DS
8probably a b movie
12It's never a pain for me. I just prefer 2D sometimes
12I hope the price drops so others can get it o.o
well me personally *not talking for everyone else* i dont like disney movies
12It will
I doubt anybody here can afford the 3DS locally here x.x
12eventually :|

03I suppose I could
a long long time ago
03I have all the ISOs on my hard drive
ok
ok, talked to Darunia nao wat
03you gonna DA the P-O encode?
about a month or two ago in fact
no, i'm making my own because
days go by like years for me
everyone's not satisfied until they do their own encode.
03LOL
03I just want a HD English encode
& >internets
03if it's DoR, fine
Dari: You're probably right
03I'm just too lazy to sync up FMA's encode LOL
...
>_>
didnt expect THAT one
Damn you!
XD
do you know how to figure out AV sync in audio editor?
03no
hahaha
Jenna said she'd watch the second one
>lazy, but
>no
:D
>mfw
woot!
what is this i don't even.
it took until episode three that I liked it
But she made sure she pretended to look disgusted when other people walked into the room
03LOL
03as in
and until 4 or 5 that I stopped denying liking it
03if I was less lazy I'd figure it out :P
oh
Yeah, you have to get the first two out of the way
They're not bad, but they're not indicative of what the rest of the series is like
anyway, i should be able to upload my DA'd copies llater on this year to mU
which is actually kinda funny in a way
because that's exactly what a pilot should do
and MLP doesn't
for the better
Lauren Faust wanted the series to be one continuous adventure
but everyone else thought that wouldn't work
So she got two episodes
then it became like most shows, where each episode is a new adventure

/me won't stop backstabbing D:
At least do it in PM
:P

If you do it here
you will earn yourself a kick next time
w/e
>.>
I'm not kidding
