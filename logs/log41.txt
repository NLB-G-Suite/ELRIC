ARTI! Hai
Did you divide by zero again?
4Hah, I saved it as Sweetieception too

4I know Hip is one of the people that downright dislikes derelling
4Which is sad to me
why?

hi silvernite :3
That's nice, but I don't really follow Dr. Seuss
having fun?
well
I think we should just
do it like we did the first time
recommend people we've interacted with before
no
4That would be pretty neat, though
yes, I figured that out
you mentioned "her" quite a bit
anyway
a female mod
WE'RE A SAUSAGEFEST
4WE NEED A FEMALE MOD

and it would change back every time
4*snickers*
also, i calculated about how much time i spend on ponychan every week for a /meta/ thread
i am both proud and ashamed of the results
7o.O
12Hi
6Pronychan is eating itself, I think.
7Heya.
6Also, wasn't this the most productive series of interviews ever?
still working fine for me
lol
6It's in and out for me.
It's working fine for me now.
4That's surely a plus, yes?
4So guys
4How do you feel about laptops?
I don't use mine to often, but it's usefull when I'm away for a long time.
BRB
6I only have a laptop...
I like the customizability and lower price tag coupled with more power of a desktop
10!pokemon
i only use a laptop

i wouldnt mind having a desktop though
/me 4also has a laptop

7How does Fenori sound as a name?
Ha
Fenric
7If it does, it's coincidence.
Must've been from something random
It's a nice name
4I don't have a skin for mine

Are you writing something?

yeah
I made Apple Jack
looked pretty accurate
:D
Nice!

I think I did pretty alright
12crap

I'm back.

gotta feed all eleven of my dogs. I'll be right bacl
11Mimey Wisseu
back*
4o.o
4nope.avi
you know you guys
11eeeeyup
I'm about proposing to Barry to become a mod
6...why? Oo
11I don't know. How many BMNs has he been to? two, maybe three?
two at most i would say
11Sprinkles: why to me or why to Barry being a mod?
maybe not now
but he definitely seems like someone who's always around
4perpetual factor?
I mean
he's always around
always
4For one, shouldn't he be interviewed at least?
most definitely
but I'm proposing asking him if he would like to be interviewed
lets give it another week at least
4I mentioned it earlier today *shrugs*
yeah
there's no rush just yet
you know
we should try doing the "interview" thing again
but instead of an interview
we should just develop a questionnaire
the interested parties would fill them out and send them to the BMN mailing list
we review them and contact them accordingly
interesting
4Sounds much more efficient
4Then we could actually probably interview the ones we like
we can narrow it down from that
SPIKE, TAKE A LETTER.
XD
then have a 2nd round of sorts where we interview them and do the pictures like we did today
i know, i was writing when you posted it
i dont look at my screen while typing
4Ah
4Gotcha
lets develop a questionnaire
yeah, a curriculum.
curriculum?
04XD
04nice Quan
7Thanks?
7Ooh.
7They move?
04unfortunately
04yep
04kinda in the same way as Black/White
7Yay, more details!
04but they're "expensive" clouds.
7o.o
7How does a DS do it in comparison to how you do?
12blah
actually, we could just put up a thread now, couldnt we?
04The DS uses a 3D field with animated textures.
7Hrm.
7Can't help you there.
04:P
04You don't need to
interesting note
pretty much
you should also post in the FB and Twitter
>:
that means matrix surround or quad can be kept intact with AAC compression at least
hi chao~
4Osha-Hello all!
maybe
:<
11the same questions we ask in the interview.
all of them?
4I think it shouldn't be too intensive
<:
/me has been out since June 2
4Just keep with basic questions with a few "what would you do?" essay questions
4well
4And then really hit them with more follow up questions in the interview
6The questionnaire should be basic.
4that's why we canadians are smarter :P
4Yep
I think the questionnaire should be intermediate
not too basic, not too intesnive
6lol age
to give us more ground to filter out applicants
11I haven't gotten anywhere on the pics yet
have you contacted the guys from the Fighting is Magic project?
4Hey man, I like to know with the age
11Been busy with the finals.
cause I got another idea for proposal
11Oh, no I haven't.
s'okay
11To be honest, I completely forgot.
I'd like to propose a live-streamed Fighting is Magic tournament, as well
11There's an idea.
6And a lot of people say they would show up for it.
11Would we do it as part of a BMN or on a seperate occasion?
6I think seperate occasion.
6May be a pain to set up, but would be amazing.
7Meepity.
4Yes, it would be awesome
4Beepity.
that' why we need to talk with them first, of course
they could help us, maybe set up a "spectator" app for us
yes, the FAQ establishes it has both Local and Online capabilities
6We really need to get into contact with these guys...
6Definitely.
4Face-to-face?
4Screen to screen?
yeah
Screen-to-Screen
4:P
that said
we could have a "debut" tournament
like those day-it-is-released tournaments for games in several stores
4Yeah
of course
4We definitely need to get in touch with these guys
we have to discuss prizes
beeping
beep
6Well, we'll figure that out when we get in touch with them.
11Selection of the next BMN movies and episodes of course.
6Well, yeah.
maybe a Madmax commission?
nah, too boring
we need something that makes even people from outside the BMN want to participate
it is, in a way, another way to advertise ourselves further
i like the madmax idea
how would we get her on board?
we could just pay her for the comission
most clear-cut method
>implying i have any money
11problem is that we'd need money to do it, unless we get her to be a part of this somehow.
yeah but we can't go just like HEY MADMAX WANT TO BE PART OF A PROOOOOOOOOOOJECT?
although
hmm...
I think
quite well in fact
4i made up a name for my gargoyle today
I'll ask him to see if he could put word for us
4Aeroanguis
7Sounds like Aeroangus. o.O
from #mylittlepony
4MLP: Fighting is Magic
The Good TripFag
4Ah
well
Hi, guys
we also need prizes for the other rankers
as well as different prizes for both tournaments...
i wish we had some kind of merch to give away
like a plushie or something
8hi
4Barry you're always here, aren't you?
8sorry, we're kind of in our own little world lol
whys that?
oh
got the questionnaire written up
4i know
anything you guys want to add?
4honestly though, i thought the latin word for snake would be something like serpia
we can go more in depth during the interview
get a little deeper, as it were
7Alternate translations.
4What room does that leave for an interview?
4oh yeah
4forgot about that
11Sounds good to me.
we can ask followups in the interview too
/me 4smacks his forehead
/me 7asdfs.
7I wish my Endeavor Aron worked outside of wi-fi matches. XD
4Well, I guess it looks fine
yeah
6Looks good to me.
I fullheartedly approve
ok
also
when we get emails
and hi Quan :>
7Hey, Aero.
6Sounds good.
oh ok

ahh, coolio!
4how about Aeroexcetra?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHNi7N-5klM LMFAO
havent seen anyone sign up since you posted that
?
4Give it time
4He just posted it
4It really needs to be stickied, quite frankly.
I bucked it.
Haha
Oh fox news
I like how they use pictures of the old toys
yeah
mods wont sticky it
okay guys
we need to
acquire a site or program in which we can make the tournament ladder
6Ladders are easy.
?
6I think I actually have something... one moment.
like a bracket or a ranking system based on points?
There we go.
hey prom haha
http://challonge.com/tournament/bracket_generator
bracket
Yo.
Tada
8suddenly, people
PEOPLE!
hmm that's a bit WWII
single elim
more dramatic
and Anu haha
And Anu
6Single elim, would we do a battle for 3rd?
yeah
that
oh :)
yep
we'd do a battle for the 3rdç
random?
I suppose Random Seeds would be it
wait
6Of course random.
I mean
everyone's gonna be a newb
Hi, guys!
6Pretty much.
I was at one about a week ago.
Nice :)
gah, why was that?
ok, then random would be the way to go
Best Night Ever, Aladdin, Starship Troopers, I believe the lineup was.
That violate some rule or something?
That was the last one, yea.
haha that's some good movies :P
6Oh hey Prominence
4I'll just let you guys talk this out then, I'm not very good with brackets and the like hehe
Hello.
4Aha
4monkeyjay
4Wait
i was thinking if we had more, we could have a series of matches leading up to the tourney to determine seeding
4Aren't are you the lead programmer on Fighting is Magic?
Correct.
we're the devteam
COOL!!
no I'm ONE of the lead animators
4Nice
6Well, that was fast.
or part of the devteam
and the sub programmer
4Awesome
We heard you were making us an offer we couldn't refuse...
Well
Prominence is main programmer person
well....that was faster than I expected.
And came to find out about it.
4Ahhhh, sorry about that mixup then
that'd be good for the actual srs Tournament
no prob. I'm jsut the most vocal
for the "Game Launch Tournament"
we'd have to go with seeds
the dev team is in the main room
Thought it was addressed to me.
yeah
I have to spend the night in the brig
whoah that was really fast

/me doesn't mind
thing is I use that for pretty much everything pony related
4I'm sure it isn't registered
6It doesn't accept spaces, just fyi
4So sure
/me bows
Just go HerpyDooves
4Anyways, it's great to see you guys here
9Gentlemen. I believe business talks are in order.
4Yep
8Quite
Aye
It's Gentlecolts
how dare you assume we are gentlemen
9I guess I'll go straight to the point.
8Silver, i am disappoint
8no color
9in any case
11Touche
9to put it simple
11Niiiice.
11done.
9the most important one being a tournament
9which would be streamed live, here. Hence why we wished to speak with you.
9to be more specific
02brb
4seeya
6Having done a bit of community research on the subject, a good few ponies say they would attend.
fa sho
9at a later date, we'd also like to establish a more "serious" tournament as well
also, i can take the lead on organizing the event
Where has this research taken place, out of curiosity?
11I can design some sort of poster or something for it.
9of course, there'd be prizes for the winners, and we'd handle the organization of said event.
11An announcement flyer, perhaps
14So we'd just be... approving, basically?, or saying we support it?
9wellllllll...yes and no
6Well, we'd be giving you perks or something for allowing it.
Not to say we don't appreciate you asking us.
We're very honored by it.
11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- <drfsupercenter> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ANDROID <drfsupercenter> LOL <drfsupercenter> Good for you, you know how to abuse scripts
14Early release?
9additionally, there is also another thing we must ask you
0Okay
but he's not
11It's ponies. Of course it'll get attention.
8we have a script set to autokick after 3 color posts by non-mods
9we do know there's an online mode
9as we'd be streaming this tournament
9I mean, tournaments
0There is
9ergo, we'd have a live feed of the tournament, right there to the left
0It's in our FAQ, I believe... unless I forgot to add that...
9perfect!
9in any case, we wished not for an early release
0they told me to! D=
11lol
6Hypothetically.
4tsk,tsk,tsk
8sprinkles, did you turn off the autokick script?
6I did not.
6dari might have...
8oh nm then
And perhaps whatever color this is?
8go ahead then anukan, my mistake
/me randomly stuffs Tentacruels into several cars
6It likely wouldn't be much of an issue if a lot of people attended.
6At worst, we would simply seperate them into multiple chatrooms.
11BUt we're used to that.
4Hopefully my net would be able to take it
I probably couldn't join.. being in NZ haha
but anyway
4But yeah, we'd probably separate into separate rooms for that many
4lol repetition -_-
it's a cool idea :)
6Yes, which is why we just ask you keep in touch.
11Our email is in the post provided, but here it is again anyway: BronyState@Gmail.com
I don't think that's unreasonable at all
except for boast busters
because that one was stupid
also of course we'll provide a unique dlc character for the winner
jsut kidding Anu :)
Which one was that one?
I was about to say.
4Pretty much, we realize that things are still early on but we wanted to give you guys the heads up about it. It would be a tremendous collaboration between our two projects and I think it would give us both excellent exposure
HAHA
projects?
that was the one with TRIXIE DA MAGNIFFUHSENT
oh yeah
11We've also discussed bringing others into it like some DA artists for prizes.
I agree
that was like
the worst pony episode
that one was one of, if not the, worst
as far as release date.. hmm
8specifically Madmax, if she is interested
9namely, madmax, but that's just tentative
Ballpark figure? We were hoping to get it done by the start of Season 2. The initial 6, at least. That's looking a tad unlikely at this point, however.
/me 11looks down at his flesh, "not that I remember..."
Unless we really get revved up.
I'd say this year would be as close as I'd estimate for the mane 6
Aye.
speaking of madmax
you mean 'boxing' day
monkeyjay: *main ಠ_ಠ
I'm relatively confident we can get it out by the end of the year.
/me 4randomly takes them out
:o
A large portion of our issues have just been unexpected technical delays.
I meant mane haha. That's the accepted term. even though I may not agree :)
wow
I think that would be a great idea
9but that only gives us more time, Prominence, to organize everything
9here in BronyState...we're kind of early planners
9we're already organizing everything to have S2 simultaneous streams with the Hub
9for we have no viewer nor quality limit
Streaming the Hub?
6Live, yes.
I donzt agree
8for S2 episodes yes
Oh
...
Hmmm
nah
8anyway
They deserve money for an awesome show
ie most other countries
...
oh
Mexico doesn't get it. Without streams, FiM'd be GUIless.
free
Freeware.
4Osha-Hello Creideiki
8ok
Not like we could charge.
haha
We're not even accepting donations.
We'd get sued out of our pants.
And drawers.
there's no legal standpoint where we could charge for it
Ok I'm with this idea
There were 13 people in spyrochat today.
I wouldn't be here without downloading it either
haha
8but anyway
9well
9if we want to go full retard
9I am pretty buddy-buddy with CustomAnon
WOW
9so I would ask her if she'd take a commission from me
Oh, and nintendofreak.
8ah ok
9http://customanon.deviantart.com/
8oh
wow
8before i forget
8our email is BronyState@gmail.com if you want to contact us about the event or w/e
Cute things
Got it already.
8ok, cool
Hipster_Brony: Thanks
4Osha-Hello Ray~
Not for me.
7Hrm.
7Can I show you my sprite I'm working on and if you think I'm going overboard with the design?
6...suddenly dari.
it'll probably be back up soon
I fell asleep while waiting earlier.
DA seems to DA all the time
good idea
02Hi~ Chap
*seems to be down
02Chao*
8there wont be
02(Chap, lmfao)
11We've been running BMN for free for the past month
8Brony State is all volunteer
6Over that.
yeah I can see you've kept it ad free
8hell, we'd probably get sued even worse than you guys if tried to monetize this
which is always nice
Fandom usually doesn't charge
8the RIAA is an angry group
4may i see, Quany?
04Quan
04lookie
04http://chimerareiax.deviantart.com/art/WIP-Pokemon-HD-213059805
oh wait, forgot I have adblock running
derp
8in any case
6There's only one ad. XD
go on
8we can set up some sort of ranking system
8put it online like the GET rankings
How many participants are we projecting?
8and then the top people get to enter the tournament
7Ooh, subtle clouds.
7It is slightly slower....
11So....possibly a lot.
8A LOT
11wat?
I say elimination
11AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LOT!
eyup
Ranking system, huh?
11Do it with a Tournament Bracket
Brackets
6After the initial tournament. For a follow-up one later on.
8yeah
9for a single reason
Wait, are the games 1 on 1?
9the excitement of a turnabout!
6We'll have brackets for the release. And a ladder for later.
8the initial one would have to be random seedings since people won't have played before, other than you guys
9derp I meant Ladder
4omg
4tabunne!
any way we can mute glass_arm?
Oh good
I haven't played
You added the motion blur L:D
HOW HAVE YOU GUYS PLAYED
8no one has except the developers

9we haven't

9it's in development
9we're merely organizing
9for when it IS released
imokaywiththis.jpg
Like i say a lot we would have been out by a factor of 10 or 20 if we were asked to speculate how much attention our little thrown together vid would get.
Lol.
lets do it
hes derailing conversation
Yeah, at maximum?
us guys
I figured we'd get MAYBE 10K views.
glass
Largely due to EqD.
yeah haha
8you guys = developers
monkeyjay: Promo vid?
Hipster_Brony: Which devs r in here?
9well monkeyjay
<--
<--
6If he keeps up.
^
XD
...Thank you.
6Now you guys can talk with the channel muted.
ohhhs
9by the time FightIM is released yeah
04LL :D
9in any case
6Less interruptions.
/me strethes in the AC
9well
9thing is
04and yes I told you
9by the time FightIM is released
oh right
04slightly slower cuz of the clouds
12ew weather
12EW weather
9we'll have a LOT of experience dealing with numbers in the quatruple digits
12>_<
04Aurora :D
04hi
9we've handled 300 viewers pretty well
12VVERY EW weather
12-V
/me 12wrings herself out
I reckon we should set up an IRC server for that.
I'm sure there's a way to throttle messages if you're running the network yourself.
04Sure XD
Or add a option
9yes. By that time, we'll need to divide in rooms. As much as I hate to admit it, that's the most viable course of action
04well eh
04hm
also I'm more worried about the players than the watchers haha
9we could divide the rooms and name them after Mane Six members
8glass arm ragequit after we muted him
well how many people would be playing?
04I'm thinking I don't just want this to be an HD Pokémon Black/White battle but a Pokémon battle based off of Black/White
*glomp*
:3
04With my own little touches
04:3 sound good?
6A poll. Precisely.
I know there's one EVO player who's interested, at least.
Well I reckon we can get Behrudy to play. he seems keen and has a lot of followers (also seems like a genuinely nice dude)
My laptop is acting up right now
8are we talking about finding out how many people would play?
...
Too synced today.
haha <3
hype*
Still working on that HD Pokémon thing?
12o.o
4aaaaaa!
9Also
8we can help you guys a little with that
4Tabunne used a Full Restore :P
11Well, if you continue to release update vids like the last one, we can show them at BMN preshow and keep the buzz going.
4i thought PKMN didn't know how to use items
/me 4flees
Heh
9big tournament should probably take place when a few DLC characters have been released
2oops
04sheeeeeena
Yeah.
9if you need advertising
chimeraaaaaaa
yeah i have a feeling we won't have a problem finding people to link us now
9believe me, that isn't a problem, and we'd be glad to help
/me hugs
xD
haha
I'm at my actual job right now
not getting paid XD
well it's sorta why we aren't giving a release date..
Sorta that, and sorta simply that we've been handling PR for a whil- yeah.
11I swear, I think I should have gone into business instead of filmmaking. XD
/me still belongs to FiveYearOldDamos for 31474 more minutes
Lies
8my recommendation is to not mention anything about a time frame for release
04okay that's it
!leafeon
which I swore I would never do
3[4!Chimera vars 4reset3]
04wait
!chimeras
04>>
dang
04I SAID WAIT
...
Down that path lies only madness, my friend.
OK
Well, actually...
OK
3[6!eXAKR1 vars 4reset3]
04thank you :3
we might have given a rough estimate to a certain source already.
I swear there's a line in a film that's something like that.
Oh wait.
12o.o
8just work on it til you have it finished, releasing updates occasionally
04there
3[4!Chimera vars 4reset3]
04X3
...
11DCD: Herdmind.
04!Aurora
9well, we can't do the PR by ourselves
/me hides
:>
!everyone
D:
which owns a bree
8then announce like 2 weeks before you release that it is finished
:D
04you therefore win :P
!the world
especially this early in development
9since we need to keep close contact and follow the path in PR you guys wish for us to follow
therefore I own bree
04XD
/me owns the world for infinite minutes
8exactly
12o-O
2!ChaoAqua
4imagine that worked
8like i said, dont mention release date to anyone until you are done
I can't wait to see it
12OH
12anbsgfjdb
/me 12unlocked boss Gauntlet mode
12o3o
It's a cat because it talks
8^pretty much this
Therefore, cats talk.
Meow.
12yes
12no
9they don't want to be Valve
9GAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNN
11lol
9Most certainly
It's a delicate balance.
9that said
Now, if you mean advertising...
11There's a way around that too. Giving info and Giving exposure are two very different things.
11It's called Advertising.
12nono
12but
12I beat all the boss challenges
12which were TOO easy
12 32min for Twinrova
9the thing one has to do, is be honest
12honestly?
11Not to mention that I'm part of The Daily /oat/, which gives you even MORE publicity.
12took me slightly less than 5
XD
12and Bongo Bongo
9we're busy, ecetera
9after all
12less than a minute
12|3
;3
12:3
12not quite
9after all
12at least
9DELAYS
9derp
12not YET
9I mean
9GIFT HORSES
9MOUTHS
9ECETEROO
/me 12has 3D MQ and Oracle of Seasons to go
12o3o
O_o
12and the 3 Heart Challenge
11Twitter isn't *as* popular as FB, as far as I've seen.
XD
9yeah
9our Twitter page has few subscribers
9the FB one has substantially a lot more
I guarentee you wont make the 3 heart challenge\
we actually have gotten fairly good advertising from TWitter word of mouth.
/me RUNS
9but of course we could give exposure in all possible venues
11Yeah, but if that word of mouth reaches FB, you're sure to blossum.
12Orly
12my only nemisis
12*nemesis
Well, we got linked in two or three pony FB pages, and it didn't seem to do much for us, speaking honestly.
11I'm feeling waaaaaay too optimistic about all this, for some reason.
8EQD is the key
12 4-Heart damage in a single hit ._.
12aka OHKO
XD
6XD
4*2
8how secretive do we want to be about this tournament for the time being?
9I mean
9no other choice
9since Glass_Arm already knows
9however, we just don't go around talking about it
for the time being yeah as prom says
6Well, we can't say it'll definitely happen.
9if someone asks us about it, we say "we're looking into it"
6Obviously.
11So it's just casual knowledge and word-of-mouth then.
6For the most part.
8for now
Luigi's mansion i mean
No direct mentions, though.
"We'll look at possibly setting up some kind of tournament at some stage" may even bee to un-vague
9we don't mention anything. We just don't deny or confirm anything if asked.
8im going with, "we have fun and exciting events planned for the future"
9or we could ask Barry and Glass_Arm to keep quiet about it
9also
9another
9very important thing
that'd be confirming it.
yeah dont ask anyone not to tell haha
optimism can be quite a good thing
9another thing
9very important
9that we have to consider
is team t-shirts
I agree
9heh
12o.o
9well
6I like t-shirts.
o.o
Yes Silvernite
9I actually meant
Err
6Yes.
yeah
Ok, good.
9and how to distribute it
9too many people dling at the same time
9equals slow dl speed
9unless it's a torrent
/me 4flees
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXmPOIW4TV8 <-- Lawl
We don't have an estimate in sixe just yet.
4um
4beeeeeeeeeeeeeeecause
size*
lets jsut say if 1% of the viewers download it that's still about 700 gigs
/me 12...
12that title
12sounds familiar
above******
above****
this is the pony AMV?
4looks alot like lego
YUPPPP
/me 12lols
12it does
and practice.
8release on a monday
12inb4 it's released for 3DS
it's a zelda-esque rpg developed/published by Atlus made for the PS3
o
8give people time to download/practice with it
9no, not practice. That's why the "Release Tournament" is a beautiful thing
9it's like
Pony AMV is best AMV. :P
8ok
11LOL
9like
12ah
9"GAME IS OUT. PREPARE FOR TOURNAMENT. NOW."
:D
9they're pretty common
9there were many of those when MK9 was released
9and it makes things pretty exciting
8it might be hard with thousands of people downloading though
9in any case it would make the two tournaments very different
oh also
:D
9well, that's why I think we should recommend torrent download
he's soooo cute
I should get at least one of those
But I never eat at McDonald's
tomorrow, on my lunch break
like I said you don't even have to eat there you could go to mcdonalds ask to see the toys that they're selling and buy one for a dollar each
We were actually planning, And, I think it's in the FAQ, to offer more than a downloading system; Torrent was already considered, but it seems it just became our main one.
I'd imagine having a few members of the dev team could make it more interesting
oh yeah, you did tell me that
*participate
If I ever go there I'll have to get one
9you card
can you ask for a specific one?
9well
I'll give you one otherwise
10 people? 100 people?
9basically when tournaments like those are held
which one do you want?
you can but they probably won't know the names
9we'd take all applying participants, single elim
or just ask to see the different figures and they'll show you
6Basic bracket format.
9well, I mean for the Release one
9for the Main one
then broadcast just he quarter finals etc?
right
9nah, we'd broadcast all matches.
9by that time we'd have enough streamers to cover all the bases
it's a bobblehead
9simultaneous fights? Simultaneous streams.
10 people is 5 matcches simultaneous?
...and a 24/7 stream going.
100 people.. ?
haha
his cheeks light up
cool
9believe us, we're pros, yo
you roll him on the table/ground/etc and his head goes up and down
D: then
8heres another option
haha
cool
and of course I need snivy everything b/c he's the best
8we're discussing the release tourney, yes?
monkeyjay: Challenge accepted. :P
haha
6Though we don't know when, since they don't know when.
9additionally, accounting for the time limit
What's going on now, I see something about streaming 24/7
9we can have a good estimate of how we could schedule the fights
Alright, hold on.
9great idea! we could have you commentating through Skype
9unless you wanna take a hands-on approach
9and have us teach you how to operate the stream
no idea. jsut a silly idea :)
i think we should divide into sub brackets
9BronyState: the town bicycle stream
9well, for the ladder, it would be a great idea
First of all.
6Probably. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
HAHA
04That gave me an idea.
We're still not sure about this.
Any of it.
04with a sword
04XD
yeah
This is largely a discussion about the possibility.
crossing bridges when we come to them
/me runs
yup "_
Depending on the situation, more like jumping off that brdige when you come to it. :P
12O_O
considering a round lasts 90 seconds tops
yep pretty much nailed it prom
we can account for three rounds
yes
Advertising is fine. WHEN it's appropriate.
plus I gotta get back to work I've alreayd cost my self about 4 overtime hours
270 seconds
At the moment, it isn't.
ect.
3o.................k
9ONE OF THE MANY POSSIBILITIES
A tournament, also fine. When IT is also appropriate.
9OF THE PONYTINUUM SHIFT
once we know exactly how many people we have, we can figure out a format
prom and anu see you tonight if I get off work at a reasonable time..
9yes, most definitely. We're just glad we got to communicate these ideas to you
PR, I wouldn't say even that yet.
basically we haven't agreed on anything yet
Showing movies we release, perhaps.
because it's way too early too agree on anything
11That'll make it easy. Just do another Group list like we did for the subscribers.
Jay's the talkative one, but I'm the game's primary programmer and director. I don't want to pull rank, but I just want to clear some things up.
11We're listening.
04osheet
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t4M1qsdCT4
04XD
9go ahead, my friend
11Nine brains in the room trying to bring more to the world of ponies.
11SO....AWESOME! /)^3^(\
9well, certainly
8of course
11What about us advertising for you and helping you keep people buzzed for this project?
6Or if you'd like us to stream videos you put out during our weekly streams.
9of course, if you need any help with PR, we'd be glad to help you at that moment, you'd just need to give us the word
8exactly
As I stated. Advertising via images and movies we put out? Fine.
11We do our own advertisements and are doing pretty good with our PR since we've been doing it for a while now. Hence us offering it to you.
8if not, that's cool too
FALSE ALARM
3OMG!!!!!!!!!!!
9needless to say, we would never do any PR without it being approved by you first
11Prominence: Makes sense. We want to make LESS work for you, not cause more.
Understood.
9however, at this time, it is perhaps best for you to keep it in-house, as you said
3is this an actual commercial?
11I agree with that.
9once you guys need help, though, just give us the word, and we'll scramble our resources
Alright then.
That's good to know.
11So yeah, we have connections and ways of getting info to people.
oo-oo
You'll be one of our important advertising channels, then.
o...o
9and we're glad to be such
As for the tournament.
/me 12stares
There might be basis for the argument of 'letting people learn the characters' first, but at the same time...
Heh.
11Except for all the details we've been mentioning, but that can wait for later.
Inaugral tourneys are hella fun.
9inb4 DAIGO OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE AND HE MAINS RAINBOW DASH
9yeah, hence why we want to make BOTH of them
/me 12glances at her 3DS...
waiting for that preview to process no
*now
3looool
8yeah, details are going to have to be worked out WAY down the road
9would probably be hosted once a couple of DLC characters come out
8Mane*
8fixed it for you
9....yeah
9Mane Tournament
3man, i gotta go
9MANE FIGHT-IM TOURNAMENT
3i haff to go sleppy-bye
3*sleepy
3night night all
9of course
11Prominence: exactly. I think we all agreed on that. :D
bye
9suddenly DAIGO
9suddenly RAINBOW DASH PARRIES EVERYWEHRE
9ah, yes, that's another thing.
8so thats gonna be like, 2 weeks before maybe
I'd say a month.
Maybe 3 weeks.
A maybe for the maybe
Whoops
4Better
And THEN organize the rosters.
And the brackets and whatnot.
04LL
04and now he's gonna get me Ocarina of Time 3DS :D
04(I got a 98% on my SOCIAL STUDIES REGENTS EXAM)
O_o
8you guys arent going to be talking about a release date until like 3 weeks before release, yes?
8ok
8because
G'timing.
8i would say hold off on release until you have at least a few weeks to promote it
Too many ponies clogging it up
*too much pony
8even if you have it done, you might want to hold it to get more pub
:P
8but anyway
12nice :D
/me 12huggles
12congrats
/me 12glances at her 3DS again
12Liiiiiink
12sooooo tempting
/me 12|3
12I give
Hehehe
Lol, that's okay. I'm multitasking anyway.\
I don't see how anything more can be gained from discussing this further at the moment.
XDDD
11Yeah, we pretty much covered all the bases we can for now.
9maybe not whole three weeks
heh, 9:39 pm
9I'm sure that anybody with a completed project
:P
9as a writer/drawfag, I can understand that sentiment
;____-;
--
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yjh4yiu1_E
;___;*
.
9that's why asking for three weeks is too much
9yeah
9I was going to propose a week
9it should be enough
8maybe
I don't see us holding it for three weeks after completion.
9after all
12so...
12Master Quest or Boss Gauntlet...
9too many people registering would be
/me 12chooses
9quite a hassle, yes?
6God awful?
Agreed.
12Boss Gauntlet
8yeah, that could get ugly
9and to keep their eyes peeled
I'd like everyone in on this, but that would be...
unseemly.
/me 8is imagining 500 people trying to enter
9then we open the registrations
/me 8shudders
I keep thinking Master Quest is something else
Another idea is simply first come, first served limited registration.
/me 9gets his GETTER RAPEFACE on
But again, that can be discussed another day.
Watching now.
still loading
D:
D:
8again, very preliminary
All parties in acceptance?
For now?
6Sounds good.
8yes
9first come first served seems a bit too unequal for me, but perhaps we should have limited slots, like say, 200 entries at MOST
9the Mane Tournament would have unlimited entries and a large subscription period
9but the Mane Tournament would probably take a few weeks, if not months
11I think it's too early to talk about entries. I mean, we don't even know how many would be interested in it, and it's too early to gauge.
6But this can be figured out later.
9true
6GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Done loading watching now
9this is all hypothetical
:D
Nice
Qualifications for tournament can really be discussed down the road, seeing you can't really present a "curriculum". But that'd be discussed if and when it happens. I'm in agreement with prom, really.
It was "absolutely flawless" to say the least
:D
:D thanks guys!!!
XD
11DCD, we're talking about MONTHS until this thing is ready. I think we have the time.
Seems like it's a good enough deal for now
9true
9that said
Then we have an accord, I think.
02g2g
02z-z
sorry, I'm trying to keep up with a few things at once at the moment
9we should draft volunteers as "referees" for said fights
9so we keep tally of the scores
We'll file that idea away for now, then.
11It's a good plan, but again, it's too soon to discuss that.
8ok
9well, yeah
the fifth season of Pokemon's TV show
12...
9but it's always been a kink of me, thinking like five or six steps ahead
Alright. Thanks for having us.
8we'll handle the logistics on ou end
9surgical habit I guess
8our*
12rawr
Well thanks for discussing it with us. (:
8and we'll keep in touch with you guys
Thanks for the offer, too.
11It's been great getting this idea out in the open. We look forward to making it happen.
We'll be back, and in touch in the meantime.
I'm out.
12>_>
11Hey.
/me 12slaps Mibbit
8lol
9no need for this any more
11Eh.
4We hope that development goes smoothly and that everything comes out to a resounding success
9good luck!
Bye.
11Anukan, if you ever feel inclined, come on by to watch BMN with us. :D
11Seeeya.
8good luck guys!
11 /shameless self promotion
12noooo
yessss
:3
/me shot
12:/
12not my comp
12so
12what are you going to make me do?
Oh
12no can do
12etc
Hmm.
nothing out of the ordinary :P
11So......
11I think that went rather well.
/me climbs on Glacymr's back and sleeps
that went REALLY well
11That script would go haywire within seconds.
6Well, Prominence was a little standoffish at times, but other than that, that went incredibly well.
Lawl, just a thought.
11He had good reason to be.
6But I can understand it. It's his baby.
/me blinks
11And that, too.
yeah, i can see why he would want to protect it
/me scaly
12...
12w
12t
12f
11Especially if you wired it to /oat/
12what
o.o
now then
12are you surprised because i'm not playing OoT?
12I lost...
11The damn engine would explode.
one other thing we need to talk about
12in the weirdest way
12on Phantom Ganon no less >_>
4I think I need t osit down
4*to sit
LMAO
12o-o
11I have a *little* experience with website making, but not a lot.
I can do pretty much whatever with computers.
ok, that's cool
12normally
Would be good to get other people in though, I think.
12I get him without a hit...
12this time
12I got hit five times in a row
12o.o
12Light_Latias is bad at tennis
6SO MUCH PONY!
12nono
/me 11brohoofs
/me brohoofs back
/me 12bad at tennis TODAY apparently
12._.
I don't get it
But still...
NOT ENOUGH PONY!
Which thread this time?
Pony Spam
I don't get it either apparently when people post in threads they don't like they're ~cool~
12lol
the spam or non spam one?
4Too much?
Never.
never enough pony
03Get on XBL
12Im there
03um
03appearing offline then?
12wait
12wtf
03oh

12wait
03that's someone else
03it shows you as offline
03o.o
12it dc'd me o.o
03LOL
/me 12reconnects
12there
Ahh.
no mod applications yet
a legit website
with legit show times and announcements
we're gonna have to keep that thread bumped periodically
12my connection borked then
4I gotta say, it was a little overwhelming to see you guys and the FiM team talking about this project
/me 12thought it was just Mibbit
11Seriously though, If you get to the point where you feel like hitching a flux capacitor to the website, I think you need to slow down. :P
YOU THINK I WAS FOAMING AT THE MOUTH?
BITCH YOU DON'T KNOW FOAM
I WAS
LOL
all according to plan...
FOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM LAZORZ
/me tents fingers evilly
that said
4wut
foam lazors lol
4Fucking shitty connection
"http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349606.html#349606
win-win
that, and the pony episodes
yeah for sure
might make us beome one of the most important outlets of the pony fandom
the problem is
real websites cost money
/me laughs maniacally
/me didnt think of that
/me is a sad pony
Hmmm, I'm liking the sound of this...
hence why my first suggestion was "ask !!Celestia for help"
although....
hm...
I need to talk with DeathSquad
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349608.html#349608
I was establishing a paintchatapp project, you see
because FlockDraw is too cramped
I think you can get domains for free.
I'm sure I have some friends who've done that before.
*derpyhooves.com
I could ask for a subdomain in his server, give 'im credit when credit's due
and with !!Celestia...well, the /stream/ idea, but yeah, not good idea
12hmm
6DO IT PONY
we all came over from ponychan
we're all regular users
but
plus then we might get our shit stickied
there's the whole "neutral nation" thing
only problem i see is
!!Celestia runs a legit website
which frankly is quite a dickish thing to do and might cause friction
yeah
we should prolly ask DeathSquad
I'll try to talk to him
In any case!
our stream is most likely a violation a copyright laws
there is another thing
at least how we get the movies is
when we actually DO start streaming S2 episodes
4Do you have any idea just how many people we'd need to moderate said event?
not sure he would want to be connected with that since he could be legally liable then
12there
12not a hit on me
6Already have all of that.
/me 12guesses it was just bad luck
8oh, here it goes...
thats another issue
I voted for Pinkie
6...dari?
we are going to have a SHITLOAD of people here for ponies
6...dari?
me too
6AAAAAAAAAAAAW HERE IT GOES!
Eventually
SHITLOAD doesn't just cut it
you mean
I'm back.
Yeah, she has a huge fanbase
a METRIC GIGAFUCKTON, scientifically speaking.
My fucking IP is pissing me off.
we'll need many mods
as well as
That's three times tonight I had to reset it.
I usually find extremely arrogant characters annoying
how I see it
8^win
RD isn't /that/ annoying, but she is at times
we'll need to split off in two-men teams of us, the originals
each group admining one room
Yeah
Rainbow Dash pony is best pony.
it's just her flaw, that all characters have
along with lower-ranking mods
Derpy is second best pony.
:P
11Damn.
I dunno, all ponies are awesome though.
6If he decides to show up. >>;
Pinkie, Fluttershy, RD, Rarity, Derpy <- my top 5
he posted yesterday
if Spike counts, he's my favorite
11but...but I want Rarity....
6Yeah, but he's never HERE.
dealwithit.jpg
11meh.
thats another thing
does Spike feel left out when the others say "everypony"?
4AHAHAHA
we need to make sure our mods are going to be COMMITTED
4Hipster won't be in RD's room :P
12Volvagia down
okay.jpg
but
12nao...3? moar
for example, bronypeanut
Probably not
he doesn't seem to mind that all his friends are ponies
or girls for that matter
of course
11We should put a not-so-active mod with a highly active mod to keep teams even.
hmm..what to do, play OoT moar, or
well, no I don't mean that
no
would be
I mean does he feel left out because he technically isn't included in the word
12OoTTTTTTTTTTTTT
we need ALL of our mods to be active
lol
hmm...
i suppose i could
/me is at a complete loss
dunno
If he ever breaks into the real world, we can ask him
:P
if we give people a regular choice, the Rainbow Dash room would be like
hi, guys
all users LOL
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
XD
well, yeah
until he grows up that is
11There's an idea, Dari
that's probably the best course of action
8hi barry
how much people can we handle in each room?
You'd have to know exactly how many people are going to come though.
11Just direct them to each one until it reaches a certain point, then redirect anyone after that.
brb
11I'd say between 150-200 people per room.
8we arent gonna be in the mane room a lot right now, we've got a ton of business we're dealing with right now
I'd say 300, akin to the Movie Nights
11If not less.
right
well
its gonna depend on the actual numbers
11DCD, you gotta take into account that it'll only be 2 mods per room.
not to mention we have to study just how we can divide
no no, you misunderstood me
I meant
two HEAD mods in each room
LOTS of more mods
for a grand total of four mods
it balances the odds
also
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349611.html#349611
like i said earlier, we have to make sure our mods are going to be fully committed
11I dunno.
6I would, no idea how to give ops
11Might want to confront him about htat then.
11that*
6He has been kinda... out there.
There
the only thing we can do now
back
is to go out and recruit people we know we can TRUST for our teams
12rather
as our underlings
D;
LOL underlings. XD
11XD
well
I dunno
6MY MINIONS
Ward?
some other word
yeah
:P
11MINIONS!
oops, that was supposed to go in another window
XD
11I just like to say "staff"
I do wanna play OoT, but i havent really gotten anywhere at all yesterday to be honest
I have lots of people I trust on IRC, though I never know when they're getting on.
yes
the origin of the person doesn't matter
this is
of course
11True.
separated from the OTHER mod applications
hopefully
we still havent received any applications
11Dari's always on.
11and with the application list, we know who'll want to be a part of it without having to be on here.
I think I'm going to look into whether any of our problems can be fixed by running a network/server ourselves.
XD
Oh boy
Terrible problem
goodnight everybody
this is a tough one
updated FB status with /oat/ link for mod application
12nini
I bet it's one I don't even know
but here goes
XD
11Cool.
12they disagreed?
6Update twitter? Update twitter.
yes
12also wheee
/me 12finished all 8 OoT bosses in slightly more than 15min
X3
|3
03x.x
12Morpha did things to me >_>
12that took time
Well let's say 2 other people to help would be good.
I guessed Regigigas
just start guessing and you'll get more hints
12Danny
12stop
12I'm listning to it
12and yes
12I remember this song
And no one is saying anything
Oh wait
I'm in the main room
Wow
Seriously
11I could help with the designing aspect of said website.
This is fucking pathetic
/me 12huggles back o.o
6lAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwl
11Seems we're all experiencing the dumb today.:P
how do i reply to this o.O
To give some basis to work with.
11It's an all around Derpy day.
well
12wut
and now I guessed regirock
:P
12WUT
I know right
Reknoc's nuts
he seriously doesnt know how good OoT is
got it
Oh wow.
i need a way to shove it in his face XD
OoT?
:P
I hoped that would be hard
:p
12maybe he was introduced to MM first?
OHHHHHHHHHHHH
12and lolfail
I thought I was wrong
with both answers
OoT is awesome
Evan is sitting right next to me and posting
I just completely guessed
/me 12nods
I thought he'd get it right away
but he looked at it and had no idea
12and as for MM
but i need a reply for this tweet
:p
XD
11A homepage with info on the current event. A history page with a list of the past BMN showings, a mane event page like this one, and an ABOUT US page with info on each mod and a link to the Email if they want to get in contact with us.
I've suggested it
he doesn't want to
Aww.
12tell him that theres no need to worry about time in OoT and without OoT there would have been NO MM ;3
I told him I guarantee that he won't think it'
*it's terrible
12the latter being the spotlight
Yeah, I know
brb
12also lack of Adult Link D:<
no offense taken
:P
brb for me as well
Ok.
/me carries around with him a 3 foot Link plushie.
dari, I posted a review of ponies in my dA journal
We should really have a list of all the things we need to do somewhere.
he replied "I still refuse to have anything to do with ponies"
lol
shame
just tweeted it
XD
11Can do.
trololololololol
WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER
STATECEPTION
Speaking of people, WHERE DID DFOKN GET TO?

He came back and I missed him. >___>

11And that's only six weeks into doing this.
12as for a reply
/me 12hmms
11A month and a half.
11That too.
04mew
as well as alternative streaming events
11All this on top of keeping the regular BMN going, including the weekly raffle.
speaking of whic
which*
6It's going to be for Saturday this week, yes?
yes
11yes.
Nice
got it right away
11Question: Is everyone alright with just me sending the update info to our email subscribers?
6What all info?
11So that we don't have them receiving, like, five emails each time?
oh
right now
we need to finalize the order
11Sprinkles: The email update update I send out on thursdays.
that one was easy
lets go with this:

*or "pole" came in
12SS

how was he a vicious pole?
12the fact that the time runs out at the worst moment?
was he viciously dumb?
/me 12hides
How can a pole even be vicious?
I think because the text looked like a pole.
XD
And vicious because he was pretty feisty. XD

Hmm?
Oh, he shot me
4What do you mean?
6lol
6What is?
Mwahahahahahaha
:P
6What did you do?
Oh.
It didn't work.
It's supposed to strip colour codes.
Maybe it doesn't work on ops/admins.
3Colour?
Hmm.
6XD
4Thank you
4SECRET?!
Oh, whoops.
4So
4Does that mean that we're keeping secrets right now?
The network has to be on unreal.
Which this one isn't.
Or this server.
6Yeah... it's not.
And it's meant to be +S
To strip colour codes.
4Quick, someone respond
4Say something to me
Ok.
Cya.
See ya

You know they key on #bronystatemods?

Because chanserv doesn't stay in the channels on this server, when everyone leaves the channel.
6That's... dumb.

The next person to join enters.
To set up the channel with whatever topic/modes it has.

12enjoy yourself
12:D
4Yep, I'm back. Hi dari
Baldwin?
I have
4Stupid connection -_-
4What were you guys talking about?
I suppose it's possible that it could have gone worse.
6lulz
6You can set yourself to away.
4That's probably the one thing that I'll remember from that interview
6I saved it in a word document.
6It was THAT bad.
4Is the text honestly important when you have two halves of the same pony making out?
12yes
12bald land
12where the bald win at everything
4But his biggest problem was knowing when to stay quiet and stop talking
Wow...
4It's been since my time as an infant?
4Wait, not infant
4At least when I was...6 or 7
4Needless to say, I lol'd
That's pretty awesome.
6Okay, I'm done messing around with code.
6I was trying to change my colors.
6*background
4How do you know the code?
6mibbit wiki
4Or make the background a wonky color for everbody >_<
6I'm being good. XD
lmao Umby
i made that phrase up first
:P\
12yes
12dragon day
12SilverSonic you didn't say it yet
No preferences? :P
4You'd have to take it up with the rest of the mods
4But we don't want people to think we're fuddy duddies
4What's the script for it?
6Hmm...
6The most posts I can set it to is 6 lines in 10 seconds...

6Well, dari tried figuring it out before...
6Ah.
I was going to make the one that worked by voicing/devoicing, but I thought that'd be too spammy.
I wasn't sure if everyone else agreed with a kick for spam.
6Kick for spamming.
4If dari creates it, isn't he creating all the parameteters?
6More than 6 lines in 10 seconds.
6All of the Bots on the BotList have their access denied. >>;

Lol, you don't need them.
You have me. :P
4*ahem* You guys think we'll ever get a female mod?
6Perhaps.
6Found one for you.
6No idea how to use scripts.
Meh, I'd write one using hostnames instead of nicks myself.
6Easy enough to change.
Also, that bans instead of just kicks.
6*shrug* Just something we need to eventually find.
6...ponychan! COME BACK TO ME!
4...are any of you guys hav
4Wow
4I was just about to ask if you guys were having a hard time getting on Ponychan

Eventually kick?
6I can't brain today. I have the dumb.
6That would be awesome.
6After the second kick.
And for the other questions?
6Permaban. If they don't like it, there's an appeals channel.
6And at least a day before it resets.

Oh wait.
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1FE7yHGcAw
I saw it when you streamed it.
6Yeah.
6But, I can't stop watching it because my character in DnD got RAEPed by her.
O___o
Lawl
6Royalty + High Manners + High Charisma = Raped by Rarity
6...I got the most experience today. XD
4Remember how I said earlier in the day that this conversation was becoming increasingly bizarre?
4We finally hit it
6XD
4We finally hit bizarre
6Try imagining having to ROLEPLAY it happening.
6I couldn't stop laughing.
TOO MUCH AWESOME.
TOO MUCH!
Can't handle this much awesome.
My brain is going to explode.
6Got a good application for mod.
4Who?
6SoiPony
6In fact, he's one of the regulars before and after hours.
Well I work on a basic layout for the site.
Looks are easily customised afterwards anyway.
XD
6Basic html is quite simple, really.
Yeah, I'm making a CSS layout.
6Also, a countdown clock until the stream on the main page would be amazing.
Easily done.
6*home page
Homepage is the stream?
thought*
6Mane page is the stream.
6>>;
Ok.
6I know, confusing.
6I'm just going to call them Home and Stream. With the Info page, too.

how is you?>

?
;o
I'm okies
/me nods
12Ascendant's fault D:
12Good night.
you can use +f
I don't want to kick them though.
Nor does the network the channel's on have +f.
UltimateIRCd
ew...
okay it's not that bad
not too sure, sorry
I was more thinking if I had a server set up though, because I'm trying to work out how I could limit the spam with over 250 people in one IRC channel.
o_O
and ultimateircd does have +f
I tried it, it doesn't.
o_O
Because ultimateircd and unrealircd have pretty much the same modes
UltimateIRCd(Tsunami)-3.0(02).m5 zhadum.de.eu.irchighway.net RelStatus=RELEASE ServOpts=CiIp(TS5ow)-SSL Proto=3000

It's an old version of ultimateircd
and yeah, they have no +f from the CHANMODES
Don't think you can
But if I set up a server could I do it?
Ultimate?
Nah.
Unreal?
Yeah.
Hm, iirc +f only kicks
Yeah
install unrealircd modules
Oh, I'll write it myself then.
have fun

anyone there?
I made a +f mode generator on http://www.systemnet.info/mgen.html
+f can only kick/kickban though
not really block messages
to block, you need the /mode #chan +b ~T: extban module
eh?
ocean has that module installed
Doesn't that just block some words? Not block the user?
Yeah I have it installed on island
hmm, I see, didint scroll all the way up ;p
xD
nothing like that exists for unrealircd, might for inspircd though o.O
unrealircd isn't particularly flexible

That's pretty much all the unrealircd channel modes amirite?
Or the ones you can set without others going poof
except +beI, and a few extras provided with modules
and also barring the op/halfop etc.
yeah

10I hope Haii isn't expecting us to keep giving her more chances, we're just about done playing games
/me 4gives up and flies to the nearest volcano
It really doesn't matter though
06For a solution that's not beating around the bush and 23rd chances .-.

And I think I like Summer
13Though I'll be honest, Autumn's my second favourite season because the leaves are pretty at that time xD
06oh well
13Summer is too hot, Winter is depressing
13so yeah
4Summer too hot, Winter WAY too cold
4Spring to wet
10I am a winter-fall person
10Spring is bad allergies for me, summer is too hot for my tastes
13Nothing wrong with being too we- *shot*
It's summer all the time in Singapore

Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale
http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/218/0/b/oh_my_gawd_its_justin_bieber_by_LugiaUmbreonPower.jpg
I think it's a remake of a film based on a book (or the version I saw was a remake).
10Seen it
(late) hi ecco
I saw a DVD of the movie that A Pigs Tale probably borrowed liberaly from when I was grocery shopping.
Charlottes Web or something. Idk
http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/043/6/0/Shiny_Umbreon_by_Thunderclap12.png
Unless films based around spider-pig relationships are more common than I'd thought I would have thought this film was based on the same sort of thing.
floof
10Shiny
10:3
Cute
;D
Hey. It's on Netflix
gotta go out for 15 mins to shop bbl
Move out of the way Pixar.
Hahaha.
Only on YT huh? That'd make streaming kind of awkward.
Hahaha.
http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/117/d/a/justin_bieber_by_paxtofettel-d3f17tu.jpg
I want that day to come soon. I got more in my bag of tricks. ;P
Like Rats: Nights of Terror and Idle Hands.
Idle Hands is also really fun.
Heheh, it's that strange?
Well. It's more the fact that the main characters are stoners.
Ahh.
Gridlock I think.
Never saw it.
Not really "into" drug flicks. I was just really drawn in by the premise.
Alien Hand Syndrome basicly. ;P
When a films come on TV and I happened to be watching whatever was on before it I usually end up watching the film. XD
I can't help it.
04Floofpreon
04also EW BIEBER
04but lol that image
Any good ones?
More often than not they're bad - that's how I ended up seeing "The Wikerman" remake.
Oh.
But someday I'll end up seeing the remake. I'm sure.
Yeah, for sure.
Ouch :(
The weather is too good here

http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130867445520.png
Awesome.
How do I not have this picture?
Rainbow Dash is best pony :>
Actually. Rarity is.
SCIENTIFICLY PROVEN FACT
Pfft, how? :P
:o
Oh, you mean that Mary Sue shit in the Chronicles thing?
Yeah...
Rainbow Dash is alittle too jerkish for my tastes.
Meh, all the ponies have their flaws.
Pony thread - post Spiderman. I like it.
04HML no, why would you ask that o.o
Entering the competition? That's just bitchy.
04yes but more dangerous when you're outside
04not when you in a framed household :P
That's not bitchy, come on.
*Go to support, end up competing against*
Nice one.
Job well done.
Did he died?
Allow me to shed tears for the overconfident jerk then. ;P
She wasn't confident at all.
That's why they went there in the first place. :P
Not when she finally got some competition , no. But otherwise.
Then Rarity comes along and makes her feel even worse.
The whole episode is because Rarity notices how nervous Rainbow Dash is, and makes Twilight get them to the competition.
04?
Then suddenly she forgets her friend is very nervous and how important it is to her, and competes against her.
Nope.avi
Did someone say Galla?
/me runs
She hoped she might get to, it wasn't a certainty. :P
04LOLwhat
04HML why do you hate me x3
Well, she did.
:3
10I was joking, but does he? o.o
Even wrecked shit and the likes trying to get their attention. :P
Not really :p
04I dunno
04hence why I asked

5In that second one.
5I saw Mewtwo like three times. |D
5That's meeeee~
5But that's because he's been getting fewer and fewer cameos as time goes on
5so
5:C
12The only real replayabilty in games nowadays is multiplayer
5The last good one was the.. 10th movie.
03the 10th sucked
mainly why i player older games now

10Like a hot tub?
10But those are nice :3
13Or is it the same?
13can't remember the last time I went in one though
making us look bad. (:
13probably about 10 years ago or something
13Ah alright same one

12LINK IS RIGHT HANDED!!!!!!
/me 12._.
10o.o
12no
4Osha-Hello all (late)
In the Wii version, he was right handed. lol
12that was to accomidate (sp?) all the right-handed people playing the W#ii
:
12-#
/me had the wii version then
12*accomodate
And all the right handed people on the 3DS
12no
12he was left handed in the first part
12but in Master Quest
12o.o
x.x
12they flipped everything then
Senatus populusque Romanus has two definitions people follow
12the map
12the dungeons
The Senate and People of Rome
12and his arm strength
or the Senate and Roman People
10wat
12also
The whole of the Aneid is in Latin.
but you just have to add articles like a,an, and the
And it is translated into English.
well sure a book can be translated
I'm here.
11DCD, are you active?
Earlier he said: [20:32] <NewDCD> well I won't be around long today though, got some studying to do
That are derived from Latin and ultimately Latium
11Figures.
6lol
There's multiple translations for sentences/words.
6Silver, you see the application I starred in the email?
...
That's for alot of languages, actually
10Loltiming
12lol
In Chinese mandarin you can just say "Wo baba" to mean "my father"
Bay ;3
which translated is actual I father
And BBL, swimming
11Yeah, though I merely glanced over it. Trying to get several things done at once.
12kay Hyper
6Only problem I have with it is his availability on Saturdays.
Depends
meaning I of father
3*keep
12and x-x
4because i was here
I didn't say it was only for Latin
12this flipped map
4i change tab and when i get back here
12has my mind mixed up
I was just making a statement.
Though, yeah you are right
Mainly because Latin doesn't have any articles and the 'literal' translations are just odd
4maybe my computer has a rotom in it..............
12o.o
11http://i56.tinypic.com/2m7c4uu.jpg
