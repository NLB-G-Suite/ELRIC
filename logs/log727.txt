don't get me wrong, being a teacher is an extremely hard job. I sometiems see that my teachers sometimes want to rage quit on my classes soemtimes.
well it also depends where you teach
That's the good thing the higher you get in the system
more people are there by choice rather than "Just cuz"
And it shows.
Wait..
My teachers are actually good this eyar though, but in middle school, I had some pretty bad teachers.
Have you seen blackboard Jungle? That movie made me hurt inside- poor teachers
Doom 3 was AFTER Quake 4?
Like doom 3, the engine is fantastic as long as you don't look too close
Doom 3 was first silly
No.
South Bend.
It's a hellhole.
Oh nice. Quack FO'
I think doom3 was 200..6-7?
I basically took this job because "it's a job" originally, because I too believed in the logic of "any job > no job". But that was before this place.
Now I've changed my mind.
woah really?
Sucks
it flies like a bitch-
with wings
:3
EPIC QUAKE MUSIC GO
Guys, Doom 3 was released a year earlier before Quake 4.
hehe
Bangbangbangbang
Hooooly crap that's old
Our school is only "good" in the district because we rarely have violence against our teachers. But that's about all I can say.
wow-
Some of our teachers have been assaulted or threatened with weapons or whatnot
now I feel old
:D
pfff
In a related story, I sympathize wholeheartedly with the Republican platform of "enough babying the kids, hold them to standards and pick winners/losers instead of everybody-wins-mentality".
There's zero discipline and everybody fails. :D

Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
But the "tougher standards" We need some kind of standard, but when it's getting to the point that kindergartens don't have playgrounds, you have a problem.

Seifer = Mid hard boss person
MIND BLOWN
It's like saying Twilight is good. :P
F1 has a story and time line that is canon, that is not related to player choice
And that's assembled by tons of aspects.
he's discussing the story and the canonity of it
XD
why did link win
that is fucking bullshit
but idk about link
LAWL
Pfffft Sephiroth is overrated\
Because Link defeats Ganon everytime, over and over, in a same-dif way

Hey

I think I need to stop, not feeling well...

Holla everypony! :)
Jetsons Movie. :)
Anyone here got Halo 4 yet? :P
When'd it release
I don't play Halo. Sorry. :D
I don't had any Halo games either.
wait... jetsons? isn't that the family from the flintstones?
That 1 good?
Dude...
That's the ANIMATION
=P
it has to be the same canon
it happens after the events of ff7
they directly mention it
Movies and such get streamed here also right?
Makin miis lol
BMN?
Which day
Not a Story writer. :P
Woooo time to make some plans
Apples*12
its kind of the same thing really
:P
hey everypony :)
Whens the movies start tomorrow?
7PM EST. :)
*top-left
Thanks
*stream
13you would be wrong but you could
yeah
I have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY
:)
this isn't a story
that was a horrible one
I see
NOTHING
About being designed to "Look the strongest"
...
Want more facts? brb
00,02i wish all games came with their soundtrack
COME ON
I DARE OYU
Don't get riled up and stupid
lol wha :D
I still don't see how this relates to the other examples, if a team member has said something about that regarding somethign they have been told or told to do, it can't be held as canon, but if its linked further in the story, such as the movies, it is
when did that even happen
and neither is he able to cause the end ofthe world
aaaaand?
00,02DSL is old and unmaintained
Here the script is writing itself
I don't even have any emotion invested in this- it's just such a straaange argument
Not prepared
Script is not canon anymore?
=P
Okay, fine, you win, script doesn't mean canon.
that's--totally stupid
Bitch don't know 'bout my galactus

Bullshit.

But I didn't realise it was streaming
?
Newb.
Accidental stream
crap i shouldve kept quiet and spied on dabi
It starting streaming by itself
It's never done that before
I hax'd it
*know
my stream is streaming on it's own
I have no stream
about the planning?
Different thing
^
hello all
i couldnt find anything either
well i guess ubunto for now
releespartyyyh
ubuntu*
well he did beat sephiroth right?
Really?
Hi everipony!
!cd
1 day
ONE DAY
egh
hge
hey hey
The...creator?
but there's a strange kernel there
wtf you on about?
Kitase was the revisioner of Sakaguchi's work
if a writer or team of writers states something that was never expressed, it can't be fully canonized
yees but the interpretation of a product might not always be canon either
hence fanon
I'm impatient for it
http://i.imgur.com/MkeWX.jpg
Or hte movies for that matter
it is more important than fanon in most cases- but it's a sticky mud issue
it's like crippleloo and deerboy-
POPCORN ANYONE?
that would be a great comic
Stream is up
Crippleloo and Deerboooyy
Oh thanks dari
:P
:D DAT IMAGE
can you point to those aspects?
oh no the heralds of the end
:O
well the specific points that show his strength over sephiroth
they echo across the plains, bringing the force of reckoning
he was in the ground and he couldve just stabbed him
Oh
in the heart
but he stabbed him in the shoulder instead
Okay
to torture hi mm
*him
Yep
*r
Kk
Oh oops, WE FORGOT that part
/me sighs and facepalm.
*you're
Okay, hm
floof
Well I'm pretty sure they're both mortal
but..probably
"He never showed"
And you're trying to justify it's canon
To me, laughing mad>serious mad. That's it
When never existing?
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, dont install it with wubi, burn it to a dvd and install from there
Aaah
/me slaps self.
Canon > HeadCanon
Thats me :D
sadly, unofficial statements can't really be said to be canon-
it's sticky
Headcanon are things that aren't really but it's stated to be, but they are not made therefore it's headcanon of the creators.
lol
:P
unless I'm not in a good mood but then I shouldn't be here if I was
NO
*oops

Yep
Kind of a coincidence you came back here today then lol

it hit bad south of here
Back in my day PMV's only used show animation.
Get off my yard.
Problem with the whole "RD is gay" thing is that it's a lazy stereotype.

Going okay. Just looking in to see if anything was streaming
I say Vacuum you say...?

atoms have mass, right? I haven't had physics in- ages, and even then I didn't pay much attention

I thoght vacuum was caused due to the two states of the atoms difference causes vacuum to be formed?
"Previously, before oops"
And then we go into energy, which is even more convulated

xD
Hair gel enforces hero-puwahs
He whipes it back into his hair
Hasn't he ever heard of showers?
Too busy killing peopel
people*
Argument is invalid. You can kill people in the shower.
He must smell like baked rat sprayed with compost.
Only if they're in a shower when you kill them
And he's attacking my point of it, which is in favour of Wiki
Oh look
11,01George Takei is in this? Nice.

He can mend things.

Hence she'll shortly be out of that chair.

She's got nice wheels.
I don't like that implication dari.

Scooby Doo and the witch <3
Does anyone remember that one movie where Scooby and the gang go into Cyberspace?
Or whatever it was called
Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase
Can't remember the name of the van...
Not only it screams "Scooby Doo is filmed before LITTERALLY a live studio audience", the whole movie is great too, IDK why!

I LOVED Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase
<3

alien
you know
Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghist?
First thing scooby related I ever saw
with the exception of the leather, this is probbably how Rarity makes saddles too :)
YES
I loved that one too.

Would Scooby Doo movies be 'A' or 'B'??

I don't get it. Why oes everybody hate iTunes?
does*
I have no issues with iTunes
I have converters that fix the flac and wma problems.
Also iTunes has a thing now where they can convert wmas into mp3s
i have ALOT of music, cbf converting it
I convert EVERYTHING I download into mp3s, just because mp3s are universal and can play just about anywhere
i have 114 allegedly
i hope they are all good american songs
Only use I've found for flac is to make good cds
once its mp3 you loose quality :/
about stealin' and killin'
And I own no devices
none
WHOO!
by the fact that I can't set my own ringtone
I have to "buy" one.
Wat.
wat?
You loner.
