I don't usually like these kind of movies, but shit... This is interesting. :D

skynet defense, ctrl+f+u
0,14dat klaxon
Before anyone else complains about time travel: remember that Time may seem linear from a limited point of view, but from a complete, non-objective point of view, it's a ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey ball of..stuff.
Time travel isn't necessarily difficult to write, it's just a complex idea that you have to define well as quickl as possible.
fucking changelings
Gutted.

0,14'MURICA
FLAMETHROWER?!?

that was dumb
NO!!
no not france
lol "she got the shaft"
The last self-aware system was smelted!
skynet is self aware, because why not
lol
dem machines
/me is wet.
13this brings up another stable time loop
13skynet is self aware because skynet was self aware
13what if TX is the whole reason skynet went evil in this movie
0,14^
this came out like 2 years ago didnt it?
All the machines are fully armed all the time?
132004
11,01Shizuka: I thought that when I saw this movie.
0,14it's possible
you know, if they change the future, robots wouldn't exist
11,01What if the T-X corrupted Skynet?
in first place
11,01With that phone call?

This is an alternate reality
badazz

Skynet is just trying to share friendship....with bullets

WELL NO SHIT

and yes, Ahnold has said he'd be willing to do a Terminator 5

0,14also, this is the first Terminator movie where Ahnuld isn't in it
Dat plothole.
and Bruce Willis is also willing to do 2 more Die Hard movies.
0,14and then that's when Skynet's problem is
I saw arnold
Target is a synonym for plot?
13then just kill him, forget the time travel
YOOOOUUUU
13why doesn't skynet just blow up the room connor is in
:3
Because Skynet is a dummy.

0,14...ah forget it

And him breaking open a casket filled with guns :O!
LOOOLLL
i have to go in 30 mins
Judgemetn Day was my fav
13like i said before... it's call of duty the movie
Kyle Reese looked fucking awesome
13which is sad cause cod is already practically a movie..
partially for those 5 notes in the theme
Comewithmeifyouwanttorehash/10
And I mean the first one :P
As in, guns = pieces
13this movie wanted to be bayformers
back
what's next?
can we skip credits?
inb4 we stream bayformers
Never skip credits.
13adobe illustrator is the photoshop of vectors
bayformers 1 was good
wuts next
NO BAYFORMERS
13though i hear inkscape is good, and free
NOP
credits is best part though
BAD
11,01CoD 4 actually was good for being interactive and ground in reality. MW2 threw realism away.
11,01CoD has jumped the shark.
13might show bayformers sometime.. for all its issues and boy does it have a lot, it still has some kind of story progression
Night everypony.
Only time we fast forwarded through credits was the Biber song in Karate Kid
inb4 bum review!?
nighty night

gnight
13yeah but at least there's some change :3

CANON IS NOW LEGAL!
that's creepy
that's really creepy
11,02I think Universal would be slightly more upset about us streaming the movies than streaming this ride :)
LOL.
eh it's the uploder's problem
lol
8,6they're finally removing the Jaws ride at the Orlando park
SKYNET.
/me has never been to California or Florida
DUN DUN DUN
11,01I'll never get to ride those fun rides.
11,02Shame I didn't watch The Terminator while it was played this week...never saw any of the movies before ^-^;
*inb4anonymous hacks the database*
surely it won't betrey humanity
evil
?
Power Rangers theme?
I've been to California once.
my thoughts about this
WHEN SOMEONE GET'S THE KEYZ
11,02Dark92Enigma: Terminiator 2: The Ride in 3D...or something :P
creepy
11,02...isn't Skynet the name of that one ISP?
DUES EX SCREEN MUCH.
the stream's been hijacked!
11,01Rotating pyramid.
...
i shall re-read the rules. :3
Is that the real actors?
crap, how do I change back without refreshing?
I'm kinda curious
...
Yeah
Are those the real actors?
|Pudge this is the pre-show before you saw the show
11,02So...The Terminator is about machines taking over the planet?...
akimbo model 1887's moment. :)
mind=blown
Um, wasn't Arnold originally sent to KILL the Connors?
and back to commercial
Lol
is this a rollercoster ride?
11,02StupidSexyCJ: I'm sure it is advertised as that ;)
zuma!
ooooh, ok!
I've been at this place before, I'm like an hour away from Universal
And now for the real show
We should show Beverly Hills Cop on here someday...
Wait
is this from Hollywood or Orlando?
*lolfallout3flashbacks*
OS!
It's next week
time to move in my chair like a real ride
wht is this
the terminator thingy. ;3
Yeah, Beverly Hills Cop is actually being shown on here :D
wtf is this
Is today the anniversary of Terminator or something?
11,02WOOOOOOAH IT'S LIEK ALL COMING OUT AT ME AND TRYING TO HURT ME BUT IT NEVER DOES
Everyone must move in their chairs like a ride
kabewm
boom headshot
8,6what you're missing with this is that it's actually 3 huge screens with actors running across the front during parts of it
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
11,02Uh oh...I might need to fast forward
gotta be realistic
lol
That's all there is? Wow...
STILL MORE REALISTIC THAN JAWS
oh sh*t its the popo!
It's a snake manticore!
xD
/me Has never seen Jaws or Terminator
the fuutre? wha?
Jaws 3D is a masterpiece of cinema
dodging is hard
Got disconnected for a sec.
11,02COME ON ARNOLD, DON'T LET THE "BUDGET CRISIS" HIT "CALIFORNIA" IN THE BACK THERE!!
no he came from a message board
How long is this?
11,01Because Skynet is a pretty pyramid.
11,02This is about 45 min
Really?
11,02*15
you'd think that pyramid would reach the sky
lol
8,6not quite long enough to justify the 2 1/2 hour wait in the summer heat it took to get into the room
11,02kirzstryfe: ikr...except I never been on the ride before O.O
You can see how low budget this was
8,6it actually looks good on the ride
8,6yeah, I saw this before fast passes were invented
the tour was literally the best ride
Have you guys ever been to the Dells?
Dont they have actual roller coasters?
Maybe I should have linked that one but oh well
back
Dodge the tiny planes
How low was the budget for this movie?
It's nothing like Bush Gardens or King's Island I'm guessing
11,02Dell is a cool OEM :<
I've never been to Wisconsin
Wow, dat CGI is amazing
The most exciting part about the Mummy ride, waiting in line
:D
I know that people live in Wisconsin, but that's it.

That was hilarious xD

8,6and then they wandered into TRON
That was really bad.....
Basically they had stunt actors running back and forth on and off stage to make it look like the characters were running in and out of the movie
That is a cool ride

I might score a doughnut in a minute or two...
I should go buy something to eat myself, but it's raining and I'm lazy
yes! those doughnuts aren't going to the training room - they're being put out for us~
I'm pretty certain doughnuts were invented by unicorns
they are delicious and they fit onto horns well
yep
if they weren't designed for unicorns, why else would they have a hole in them? it'd make no sense
mmmm unicorns
The doughnuts are being put out in just a moment! Best part is that only half of the interns are here and only like 2 full time employees are here
the hole is essentially just a pointless lack of doughnutness in the doughnut
they are clearly designed to be carried by unicorns
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4ycykLExI1r3xauuo1_1280.png speaking of donuts

i dont want skyrim
I hope this isn't because Skyrim has bugs.
don't even know if I shouldn't accept her as some kidn of background attention supplier
that is 1 2 and tactics
why is there no stream?
Man, I really don't have a lot of time or money for games. Probably more time than money. But I bought Terraria last night, and I'm playing that.
but...doesn't matter
Later, dudes :)
i need to play on hardcore

ponystaat cool i think cool
I can't hear you over the sound of dolan.
kills the character if in vincinity
gooby pls
I didn't really like energy weapons. They didn't have that satisfying sound you get if you use a normal weapon.
i dont understand dolan
... awkward silence
I have been a /b/tard too long to be surprised by anything dolan does
but..newfriends
The thing is, dolan didn't become "popular" before at least 1½ year after its invention.
this is normal
Think about how long it took rickroll to take off...
Probably, but I still think the entire thing is silly.
i know someone named river and his brother is named rain

when i woke up my arms were as cold as ice is this normal?
yes
right...
applejack is....special
yse he is
Applejack is underrated.
Very
Applejack is just being humble
apeljack is cool he can kikc a three
heh
yes
farmgirl is...ancient
but applejack is cool nonetheless
No arguments there.
I kinda like the not-so-texan accent.
i like applejack she cool
And, of course, Applejack is MLG pro.

Hmmm, is there any way to edit the desktop ponies sprites? I might make my OC a sprite. :3
