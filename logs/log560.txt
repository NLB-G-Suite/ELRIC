lol
Nittany_Discord: 72 miles
Shizuka only twice? Aww
Nobody else on the road noticed the bullet-ridden hearse. Yup, logic.

00,10did they just reffrence troll 2?
Oh my gooooooooooooood.
0,14Yep
13i missed it what was it
11,01emangamer: Let's get together on Skype and meet up.
Sumica hellz yeah
Shizuka: rewind?
on snap they did
wait if she kills his lueghtinents, how did she know who to kill?
"Sometimes things happen."
and then they're gonna eat me!
Great Scott
Let us take a moment of silence for Scott
Nittany_Discord: we can try, but work keeps me pretty busy, but I hope so~
GOOD COMFORT.
13nah then the ponies who have been quiet until now would be all omfg what's wrong with stream
Scott would have died from dooms day anyway

13and then arnold was a demoman
13not the best counter for a pyro
Canadian_Brony: yes yes we should
11,01emangamer: Even on weekends?
WAIT
WOAH
lol
emangamer!!!!
Nittany_Discord: especially on weekends
oh hai emangamer
Whereve you been?
11,01Ouch.
RAWRity: I'd believe it
. . . or we could completely ignore my unfunny joke
11,01Like my brother.
Shizuka: I beg to differ. It's a glorious counter...against pyrocars, at least.
what is a counter to pyro?
Canadian_Brony :l
13pyrocaaar it's the pyrocaar
13Spectrum_Rush|Awake: honestly, heavy
Nittany_Discord: I work at an ice cream store....it's really buys on the weekend
13unless we can pull off a flank and get an ax combo in, we're hosed against miniguns
Spectrum_Rush|Awake Jarate
11,01emangamer: Are they hiring?
emangamer: What? no hello to me?~ :P
Nittany_Discord: no.....I wish
Shizuka: >:3
there's a whole lot of paradox problems in the movie
Is the Terminatrix in the BDSM Canadian_Brony
0,14YOU GET A SHUTDOWN
Shizuka: Then it's a question of skill, so the matchup is neutral.
Oprah HA
0,14AND YOU GET A SHUTDOWN
GarettBrony . . . dude, I'm 15
i am the iron-pony!
Shizuka: i'll keep that in mind if i ever play against you
she lost all of her power when she made her own network
Canadian_Brony dude I am 17
/me hands Shizuka his giant cup full of ice cream
I AM THIS MANY
See, there's a core problem with this movie's entire concept. If Skynet sends a T-X back to kill John Conner's "helpers"....then every time it kills one, that INSTANTLY changes the future. Yet the movie attempts to insist that the future can.
dude im 12!!!
13mmmm
*can't be changed.
XIV
So how the hell did they get Skynet back? They killed Skynet.
Shizuka: it's chocolate soft serve
emangamer what are you, an ice cream man?
Dken2021: yes
GarettBrony nevermind. I'm just going to walk out of this conversation and do my best to forget everything
13CriticKitten: everyone in the movie is an idiot, but skynet is worst for inventing time travel
11,01emangamer: Keep me updated.
DUN DUN DUNNN
South Band and Down
CriticKitten: welcome to the world of shitty, phoned-in writing.
yes
13if the computer is smart enough to work out time travel, it's smart enough to work out causality
hey who asked for Dken2021 earlier hes here?
Destiny child...ha
And I'm back from TF2. I need to cut back on much I play 6_9
Nittany_Discord: I will
Shizuka: No kidding. It's a damned idiot. The T-X is especially stupid. ._.
I guess I am here, hai TheHoodyNinja!
you can't change time john
hai Dken2021
Shizuka: question how is time travel done in this series, i dont think i've seen it been explained at all
Cakulate
Shizuka: So if I'm smart enough to know how to use a lawnmower, I'm smart enough to know how the motor works?
13by killing lieutenants skynet guarantees that new lieutenants must take their place, in order to prompt skynet to send a tx back to kill lieutenants
only 83% ?
OohShiny: then why does robots try?
I don't know
13Reikim: well, gas goes in, power comes out :3
but dr who explains it
Shizuka: yeah....time never changes
8,6good evening everypony :)
Shizuka: When does skynet from the future of skynet send a terminator back to kill original skynet?
Shizuka: Gas goes in? Huh. That's off.
11,01Shizuka: But the new ones will be shittier.
Allo kirz..

Canadian_Brony are you in Manitoba or Ontario?
because sync fail
lol
GarettBrony BC
I LOST THE GAME
Skynet is ASSUMMING DIRECT CONTROL
Evening, kirzstryfe
13if anything it might mean the lieutenants get better
oh
Skynet is a shitty computer if it takes this long to take over the world's networks.
13or there's only one lieutenant skynet can't kill, or whatever
Shizuka: Exactly. And the movie's insistence that the future CANNOT be changed....means that the new people who fulfill the role must achieve the same historical goals with equal competency
Oh! Brainwave!
kirzstryfe my sister was at the MLP fair in Orlando.
alright, icecream is going away
I would take the suicide
he went to politics afterall
11,01I have to say that the nuclear war was a retarded idea since Skynet lost a lot of communication infrastructure.
Making the murders of these leaders POINTLESS
11,01And power.
11,01Unless the core is in a bunker.
you're gonna have sex
lol
The reason Skynet takes so damn long to take complete control...is that some time along the way, it stumbles upon 4chan, and spends several hours staring in complete horror before deciding to kill humanity.
anyway
hehe chocolate mess
The future says we do it, so we do it
alright
bye everyone
lol
Reikim: seems legit
hah
13well they suggest skynet is a virus that took over the internet, but even then global nuclear war would still cripple the internet pretty good
reikim you should have said fyb facj
bye emangamer
11,01Reikim: It decides to kill humanity because of 4chan.
13especially if the backbones go
bye emangamer
seeya emangamer, havvefun with the ice cream
"Well that sucks." What kind of an answer is that?!?
13YAY!
my mom just got back from the doctors she does not have diebeetus anymore
Nittany_Discord: Well it certainly wouldn't decide to kill humanity because of ponies.
11,01The internet was designed to survive a nuclear war.
He killed you.
Gutted.
um wut
11,01Yeah.
nice to hear Starchaser
?
Starchaser hooray!
I'm confused.
Internet is already full of cockroaches.
bye Nittany_Discord
Starchaser: ...what
13Nittany_Discord: well it's distributed yes but it's explosions all over the world, even the internet has a finite number of nodes that would be vulnerable
11,01Cya emangamer
11,01Shizuka: Yeah.
Starchaser cool and sorry for all of the diabetus jokes on this site
>Diabetes
Whee!
>Doesn't have it anymore
HEY GENIUS IDEA: SHUT DOWN YOUR GODDAMN SYSTEMS
11,01I know the internet was designed to be redundant.
XD
>um...no.
11,01And decentralized.
Starchaser: Good tell her to stay away from those ponys from now on. Too much D'awww and bam instant diabeetus
11,01XD
is this mst3k?
Sorry I'm spelling well today
what
13and then kevin was a demoman
Jspang1 no but the same guys
KABOOM!
the guys who created the plot didn't study the time system
11,01It can maybe survive MAD.
Jspang1 same guys from it, though it's called RIfftrax
Question: Why are these military computers connected to the Internet anyway? Aren't the nuclear launch computers on a closed system, specifically so that this DOESN'T happen?
11,01Just very limited.
GarettBrony: good enough for me, i always liked the riffs more than the skit anyway
Reikim: *shrugs*
11,01Reikim: Another good question.
lol
he just stinked the moment
Reikim you would think, but I think nukes can be remotely activated
dat ass
How the hell would Judgement Day happen if the Self-Aware Computer System was destroyed?
OohShiny: It's not so much that. Rather the core problem is that the movie operates under "future can't be changed". Which means that traveling back in time to change the future is a STUPID idea and entirely POINTLESS. Thus this movie defeats its own purpose.
lol
11,01IRL, silos are still human-controlled.
11,01I think.
11,01If they haven't updated the controls.
Nittany_Discord: we hope
CriticKitten: Mindblown
11,01Just two people and a key box like the 80s.
CriticKitten: ever played Chrononauts? (its a card game)
Skynet is self-aware now?
WTF?!?
yup
ikr
Yeah, it's already self-aware.
For those of you confused as to why this movie's time travel is stupid: see the Time-travel arc in "The Adventures of Dr. McNinja"
The last self-aware computer system was smelted!
> super-powerful AI gets into nuclear launch systems > first reaction is NOT to reboot system
I don't usually like these kind of movies, but shit... This is interesting. :D
Point in case, there's a concept of certain details are relatively irrelevant and malleable, while others are set in stone
LOL
time travel is always complicated to write about
SparklyWaffles: this is the terrible one in the series :/
That thing looks better at her job than she does.

Before anyone else complains about time travel: remember that Time may seem linear from a limited point of view, but from a complete, non-objective point of view, it's a ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey ball of..stuff.

For instance: Star Trek '09 focused on time travel and covered the whole idea in 5 minutes of exposition.
that was dumb
Reikim Time travel won't make sense till some one invents it
NO!!
Shizuka: You need to give her some pyro tips. Has she heard of air blast??
no not france

The last self-aware system was smelted!

skynet is self aware, because why not

Whoever programmed Skynet and forgot to put in sufficient fallbacks for keeping control of it should be pulled out into the street and shot, then pulled back out into the street twenty years ago and shot again.
/me is wet.
13this brings up another stable time loop
Reikim: I'm willing to accept time travel if you establish it right. This movie clearly states "future can't be changed", yet Skynet keeps sending shit back in time to change the future when it should KNOW it can't do that.
I wonder if they ever tried to have fun with the Disembaudio.
crush, kill, destroy
13skynet is self aware because skynet was self aware
isnt this the third one? why are the special effects so bad
13what if TX is the whole reason skynet went evil in this movie
0,14^
this came out like 2 years ago didnt it?
im not in the mood to be insulted right now everyone i see doesnt understand me my brother isnt a brpny anymore im in a tent A TENT now im back to square 1 *falls down on road* all i have left are my little ponies

0,14it's possible
For a bad example: Men In Black 3 establishes its time travel rules, only to shit upon them in the last 15 minutes with no explanation.
you know, if they change the future, robots wouldn't exist
11,01What if the T-X corrupted Skynet?
in first place
11,01With that phone call?
so I said, there are a lot of paradoxes
RAWRity: i still liked it a lot better than i thought it would bbe
okay, I think I found out how this is possible
What if Skynet actually wanted to be friends and has corrupted language files?
what if no one made this movie?
This is an alternate reality

Great Scoot.

Shizuka: Because of reason

Reasons.

Oh, so they really did get the Higgs Boson? Either it will be completely useless or we will have FTL travel soon. Want to place your bets?

Nittany_Discord: Well in any case, there goes one of the things I was planning to do with my life. *shrugs* Guess I'll have to settle for one of my other insane goals.
because the plot demands it to be

00,10but yeah he had been planing to blow it up all along
11,01Sad. Rifftrax didn't make this movie much better.
John had a BACKPACK, guys. He was carrying the explosives in there.
00,10they were on the table in the RV as well
13not much can save this movie
Reikim who's side are you on?
Sumerpan could save this movie.
13the riffs get better when bill is in, they can play off each other more
13when it's just mike and kevin or mike and bill or bill and kevin it's a little more flat
Nothing can save the movie execpt burning every copy
Canadian_Brony: Logic's.
dem military grand kids
Sumerpan is best hero
Meanwhile the hero bronystate needs
I was alright with this movie without the riffing.

Reikim: That means ponies are also evil
Put da cookie down. NAO!
lol
YAY PONIES ARE EVIL1
Although if the Internet became self-aware, I think we'd be in a bit of a strange situation. What with 4chan and ponies and God know what else in its head.
Xaiden: It got a 4th ending in which you can deny the choices given, but if you do, your army always loses.

So I give this movie a fuckcausalty/10.
just because of those 5 notes
I give this movie a paradox/10
13i like this version of the theme cause it makes up for the *horrible* pacing of the theme
Whatkindofendingisthis/10
Normally that would be a pretty awesome rating, but not in this movie.
11,01Hopefully, EA's board will fire John and start shit anew. I'd say good riddance to EA either way.
I know that the rights for MST3K are kind of fucked up atm, so it wouldn't happen anytime soon, but I'd love it if they brought back the MST3k style skits and characters eventually.
I give 8/10. :l
Hey Nittany, want to see a funny joke?

LoGaN..then go fucking watch youtube and stop complaining..
Canadian_Brony: On top of that, if it was ever in Korean (because Nexon is Korean) their localization team made at least a hundred mistakes with it. For some unknown reason, translating something into another language means screwing up the game code.
what movie?

Shamroc: mssed it then
Happy birthday RX-78-SweetieBot! :$
I really want a muffin...
CriticKitten no, Combat Arms. It came out 3 days ago. It's a Free-to-Play FPS I found on Steam
i think ill get banned if i complain again is that right kirzstryfe ?
CriticKitten: Not ARMA 2. Combat Arms. Different game.
Reikim: That bad eh? How hilarious. I used to play a F2P MMO that was run by incompetents, they got taken over by Nexon. I found that hilarious.
anyone wants some bananas?
No point in me playing TF2 then if something is actually going to be streamed. Oh wells.
Where was Gondor when Indian Stallone was best Stallone?
Wait is another movie coming up? I missed the beginning so I didn't see that list
Thanks for the happy birthdays everyone.
JESmith71: yes..

It's the B movie isn't it?
0,14Gondor was being amazed by Indian Stallone's power
Happy birthday, RX-78-SweetieBot. This calls for a party
RX-78-SweetieBot: Happy Birthday! =D
CriticKitten: You have no idea. For some reason, when they want to localize something into English, they have to screw around in the game's code.
Galidor is best 90s/early 2000s sci-fi
happy b-day RX-78-SweetieBot ! :D
oh it's yout birthday RX-78-SweetieBot? Happy birthday you silly pony

It's Friday over here.

0,14also, after this intermission, we're doing the rifftrax for Terminator Salvation
CriticKitten: Which means either the game was programmed by incompetents or localized by the same. Possibly both.

Shizuka: But in essence getting rid of sompeony who is causing trouble doesnt fully solve the problem your just pushing them somewhere else so your just spreading trouble so you must terminate yourself! *plugs ears to avoid head exploding from paradox*
TheHoodyNinja: or Alex Mason

why don't they have any flying drones?
what are those robots made of, anyway?
Ohhh nice shot
killing humans isn't that hard
So why was that robot capturing people?

OohShiny: made of the finest polygons
13from what i can tell they're harvesting humans to build the new looks-like-a-human terminator, namely arnie, to send back to kill sarah connor et al
That axe is gonna have a key role
they take bazillions of shots, and they still aren't destroyed
Was this directed by Michael Bay? No wait... not enough explosions
Canadian_Brony: That's brutal :P
XD
and no, I'm not gonna get over the fact that we apparently can take out the super powered robots that destroyed humanity with some god damn auto repair tools.

Dat Arnold
"You missed a buss -3-"

So Ahnald is gonna be in a new movie soon
oh...so the skin on t-800 was harvested from a real person

0,14also, this is the first Terminator movie where Ahnuld isn't in it
Dat plothole.
and Bruce Willis is also willing to do 2 more Die Hard movies.
13why do they want to kill john connor, he's not the leader of the resistance obviously
0,14He will be
0,14and then that's when Skynet's problem is
I saw arnold
Shizuka And it's obvious the fight will continue, no matter what
Target is a synonym for plot?
13then just kill him, forget the time travel
SaxyPretender: well in person
YOOOOUUUU
13why doesn't skynet just blow up the room connor is in
Shizuka Cause he is -
:3
im serious dose any pony want to be my new best friend
Because Skynet is a dummy.
Explainlol
Need to find Kyle? Theres an app for that.
She has a weird mouth.
13i mean, if it's a human evil organization, fine, you can have stupid like that
13but AI doesn't make mistakes like that
therainbowvortex we are all ur friends
Funfact: the upcoming 5th Die Hard movie will seriously be titled "A Good Day to Die Hard"
Shizuka uh, yeah, AI makes mistakes
trolls hacked in
13it can mispredict
and ruined it's AI
Fried green tomatoes?
therainbowvortex: yeah, we're all already your friends :)
lol
I never watched battlestar galactica :/
13but something as simple as "kill the guy in this room in YOUR OWN BUILDING"
Meanwhile yea, it's a movie
13when skynet had already blown up the earth
robot vs trolls, trolls win
13there's just no excuse
Welp.
bye!
Ponies47: sevral
trolls always win
yah i have friends:):)
...So...Uhm...yeah. That plot line went NOWHERE
unless its against sensible people
I really, REALLY want the final Die Hard film to be called "Old Habits Die Hard"
W-wait, what?
WO
kill... with love
Ponies47: dat futurama joke
Wow they finally built a stealth model
Fake arnold in 1, 2, 3,
Oh hey Shizuka, Skynet was listening to you.
Kind of.
Here's ARNIE
Its obvious that he didn't, since the human's are still fighting back
OH GOD
LOL
wazzup arnold
0,14also, hai not real Arnie
Arnold is born!
Ubercharge'd.
Interesting fact this is CGI arnie
Not actually him
nekked Arnold
0,14at AL
Yeah, it's kind of obvious
0,14*ALL
HAY
lol
SaxyPretender: not surprising
Why have him in the skin if he isn't even back in time?!
13ow.. ow...
13ow ew ow..
0,14my bro and I got hyped
0,14;__;
SaxyPretender be kinda weird to cheer for a naked CGI person
omg the arnold was in this movie:O
"I know what I am....I'm a Na'avi"
0,14but awesome semi-cameo!
Inception horn :P
SaxyPretender it isn't a cameo :p
TERMINATOR SALVATION<'''''?????????????????????????
Dken2021: evryone cheered for arnie in T2

0,14semi cameo
It literally could be anything!

hi moopy
and arnie is no more :(
ARNOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!
Arnold NOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh, I thought that was the one that was sent back in T2 & 3
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
another issue with this movie: The first 2 terminators were awesome for their practical effects and the way they only used CG when necessary, and utilized it sparringly. Here, everything's CG and it all feels rather...weightless.
:'(
CGArnold.
So uhm...The robots are going to send them back through time?
they are built on an assembly line
RAWRity: still more wait then T3
freaky
Glad i've been just in time, to see Arnold in action
one last time
erasing arnold's junk
what is that?
Spectrum_Rush|Awake: I would hope so, this is, what, 15 years after the last one?
0,14fun fact: the Ahnuld that was shown just now, was created via CGI and use of Ahnuld's body double
Oh it's Arnie's fuel core
in the future, they have terminators, but no flying cars?
THIS <------ Is why i consider Terminator 2 the last of them all
ikr
Yup.
Soul eeyup
the cores that goes boom?
IT"S ARNIE
lol
Soul the terminators were too busy terminating to invent the,
"I"m JSUT A SWET"
man some of the statements he says actaully sound like its the movie saying it
isnt a flying car just an airplane?
SHIT
0,14weeee
PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN
LOUD NOISES
YELL YELL YELL
Forget flying cars, if the future doesn't have magical talking ponies I want no part of it :/
Give me that cookie
/me I'M BACK

A-Ah....
So he does the nasty in the pasty with his own daddy's mommy, which makes him his own grandpa...
Oh, that's not what's happening?
Sorry, my bad :p
Arnie's gonna come back
when a guy sneaks up on the villian, and right before trying to kill him he yells "AHHHHHHH!!!!" and gives himslef away
plz dont make a t5 cuz this was realy bad
heey gize ima tak lik dis
*himself
Soul IKR? Bad writing
Kyle Reese is not John Connor's son. He's his father, and Connor rescued him so that, later on, he can go back in time, fuck sarah connor, and thus lead to the conception of John Connor.
lol
it didnt have any ponys :[:[:[
RAWRity: but imagine the twist!
inb4 Does this bug you? Does this bug you? Does this bug you?
Rawrity, Sorry it's just I thought John conner made Kyle Reese :p
AND ITS JOHN Connor
/me John Connor's just screwing around with the places stereo.

And the budget

Ghost30k: dat terminator is arnie
Canadian_Brony: .... *stares akwardly*

Soul IKR? I prefer Terminator II A WHOLE LOT MORE
oh look, something from the secoind movioe

Well fuck.
Jaysauce: (\

0,14:3
WOO thx hatch

why am I laughing at the donuts?
Canadian_Brony: Oh. I feels you. :S
Deadlypon3: well, this movie more or less says T3 isn't canon.
Why bother with the scars?
DAT SONG

Here's a request: How about streaming Chester A Bum's Terminator Salvation review...........?
Yoouuub-b-b-b-baaaaaa

Shizuka: welcome to modern cinematography
Shizuka: didnt you hear real is brown

13it's like T3, not much can save the movie
Press the B button
13it is why i don't want to get twilight
Here's a request: Terminator Salvation's BUM REVIEW
Shizuka EXCEPT AHNOLD
Isn't that the girl who plays as Rue from the Hunger Games?
i just got back from /b/ :'(
13the concept of the books offends me enough i can't imagine anything saving it...
i think so
boom!
epic BOOM!
BOOM
can outrun the EMP from multiple nukes.
Shizuka guess ya don't like Battle Royale :P
ghost i wuz just bout to say that!
wtf BOOM
will Twilight be a part of the summer trilogies by any chance?
Shizuka IKR? All I need is the book's concept to hate it
Chester A Bum review after this?
Shizuka: as somebody who has read all 4, they not only can't be saved, the execution makes them WORSE.
StupidSexyCJ: If it is I'm leaving this site.
and basic story, too
is someone going to die :'(
the first movie was ok, I saw part ofthe second, and turned it off the first 30 mins
Dark92Enigma: no, stop asking.
RAWrity Ok....:(
0,14fun fact: this is actually an alternate ending
13it is?
SaxyPretender: O.O
yea
SaxyPretender really? Cool
0,14the original ending had John Connor die of his injury
sexy fish in the sea
wilight teaches kids "love makes ok"
Meanwhile: you know you love you some gloomy sparkly vampires
*twilight
0,14and Marcus would've worn his skin more or less and become John Connor
Didn't the original ending end at the second movie
13ew..
ewww
manly tears will be shed
0,14...unfortunately, this ending got leaked and so they changed it to this one
Twilight reinacted by ponies
rumer has it season 3 is coming in september...:O
MANLY TEARS! THEY HAVE BEEN SHED
R-Really?
13but.. if you follow what little logic the movie has...
B-BUt that is such a Stupid ending.
Eulshy yes. Yes it did, but this happens in an alternate reality
13if connor dies, and marcus lives, maybe marcus can be the leader
lol
september is my birht month
0,14yeah
lol
13skynet doesn't have john to send timetravellers to kill anymore
field hospital. heart transplant. sure!
*birth
13humans eventually win
Eww this shop is playing the most ear raping song ever
13good end
rifftrax, you bitch
11,01Marcus would have reskinned himself as Conner?
0,14yep
you ruined my manly sheds
Mine is in January

JRP2234[iPhone] katy perry?
13but not with marcus reskinning as connor.. that's just creepy... and skynet wouldn't be fooled
pengus
Pudge: Mines too. What day?

D'aw moment.
Dken2021 even worse .. Jousting beiber
uncle exoskeleton :D
Lol
8 days
13dem bookends
this made me cry many royale tears....
I still don't get where Marcus came from.
This movie takes place all before Connor sends back anyone?
Wut?
Shizuka and it ruins the point of the entire movies...
this movie also has an issue of not having established or developed ANY of the characters.
; - (
Thank u autocorrect
13well yeah
Mah birthday is December 6th :3
I missed the nod
Ikr RAWRity.
13but the movies ruined themselves
13may as well jump all the way over the shark
mine is November 10th
LOL
0,14am I the only one who liked this movie? >.>
Shizuka except the second one...that was pretty good :P
Shizuka: Have you guys shown the Jaws movies yet?
mine is september 15th
13second was good
john connor, y u no die yet?
It's Friday the 13th
SaxyPretender: i liked it
THIS JUST IN: The Nostalgia Critic listed Terminator 2's theme as the #8 in his ''Top F*** YEAH movie themes''
13i don't remember the first
T2 had Sarah learning that her vendetta against Skynet was turning her into a monster, and she had to deal with her fear of losing John.
Shizuka Neither do I
dat sunset
manly tears shed
Shizuka why don't people just say they TRIED to jump the shark but end up falling and getting eaten alive?
Pudge: Yeah. But it sucks waiting until the end of the year :/
oh yeah it is friday the 13th
Stan WinSTON!
Shizuka The second one was the BEST.
screw you john calvin
11,01What did they do to Marcus?
im gonna go to bed
Isn't there a final scene of Marcus walking away?
John more or less was the moral compass for the T2, and he became moer of an adult in the process.
night LoGaN
nite LoGaN
Those 5 notes
The movie's theme: "fuck you, T3, we're going back to the theme of making your own destiny"
Screw You John Calvin/10

and of course, the T2 became more or less like a human and saved them, sacrificing himself to protect humanity.
yes. making your own destiny... by finding the guy who is predestined to go back in time and saving him =/
Good night LoGaN
11,01Why did he need a heart transplant?

Screw You John Calvin/10
Im kinda new here
thank you Shizuka
0,14all in all, Terminator Franchise would've been perfect if it ended at 2
Mmhmm thanks for the stream Shizu
Thank you Shizuka
2 gruff manly voices / 10
sooo wats paintchat?
13Nittany_Discord: they just really really needed sam worthington to get out of the movie
0,14but Salvation >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 3
Thanks for that Shizu.
In this one...Marcus blows stuff up and dies. John saves some people and never changes. Kyle...gets taken hostage than saved, and everybody else just sort of stood around.
Ninjazz: noobie
still haven't seen the first one/10
Arnold saved the film / 10
thanks Shizuka even if i only saw the last bit of it XD
Jaysauce welcome! I would send you a link to Pinkie's Welcome Song, but no video links during stream
Thanks for the stream, Shizuka
Sam Worthington's in it/10 ^^
13there is that too rawrity... there's no character progression at all...
Wasnt watching the movie/10
SaxyPretender: But no they had to keep going -_-
11,01Sam Worthington?
5/10
Jaysauce: its like a multiplayer version of MS paint
only seen the second one/10
13guy who played marcus
goin to the bathroom
13also the lead in avatar
OohShiny TMI, bro
0,14also Alex Mason in Black Ops
0,14>.>
Shizuka the only thing that happened in this movie was that John Connor got some scars on his face.
brb
confused the whole time/10
silly SaxyPretender
Is paintchat still not fixed?
the characters were basically jsut there to move us between action scenes and to press the buttons on detonators/pull gun triggers. THere's nothing here to make us care about the characters, or humanity in general.
inception horn
paintchat works for me
Okay, uhm.../10
13this is one of the riffs i have that i almost never watch... the movie is just not that good..
SaxyPretender: YOUR LIKE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO"S NOTICED THAT!! BROHOOF /)
SCIENCE(!!!1!!1)/10
I thought Paintchat was working ???
13even t3 is more watchable..
0,14(
13probably because it has a little more color
The II IS THE best one, but i might give this one another chance, and try not to be confused *:O*/10
0,14* (
Shizuka at least that has AHNOLD in it
:D
13that too
0,14...ah forget it
It all just feels so hollow and useless, that the movie comes off as boring and uncaring about its own story.
lol SaxyPretender
SaxyPretender: Lawl
never seen T1/10
Paintchat gives me an error message saying application failed to run
And him breaking open a casket filled with guns :O!
13t3 is still bad, but salvation is just.... dead....
Deadlypon3 that was cool
Dead inside.
LIKE A ROBOT!?
Shizuka (sighs) Hard to admit, but i agree
LOOOLLL
i have to go in 30 mins
Judgemetn Day was my fav
13like i said before... it's call of duty the movie
Kyle Reese looked fucking awesome
13which is sad cause cod is already practically a movie..
partially for those 5 notes in the theme
T3 had the issue of trying to emulate the first 2 and failing miserably. This one has the issue of trying to emulate block-buster CGI action fests and STILL failed in that regard.
i was bored the whole time
Deadlypon3: RIP = Rest in pieces
Comewithmeifyouwanttorehash/10
Call of Duty Modern Warfare is awesome, right SHizuka?
And I mean the first one :P
Shizuka: You mean Battleship?
As in, guns = pieces
As much as I dislike T3, it was atleast trying to rip off GOOD movies.
13this movie wanted to be bayformers
somepony wanna paintchat with me?
back
so
what's next?
kirzstryfe what program is good for vectors ?
13i don't know ask super filly
StuffCrusader: i would if it worked atm
StuffCrusader: paintchat gives me an error message
can we skip credits?
inb4 we stream bayformers
Never skip credits.
13adobe illustrator is the photoshop of vectors
Soul no. No we cannot.
Not sure which one sucked more, T3 or that. It's actually hard for me to be sure.
bayformers 1 was good
wuts next
NO BAYFORMERS
13though i hear inkscape is good, and free
NOP
credits is best part though
BAD
11,01CoD 4 actually was good for being interactive and ground in reality. MW2 threw realism away.
CriticKitten Did it have Ahnold in it?
Deadlypon3: Funny the MW series is basically like Terminato: 1st one: AMAZING 2nd one:EVEN FUCKING BETTER 3rd one: WTF IS THIS SHIT
11,01CoD has jumped the shark.
Well, it's 7AM and time for bed.
13might show bayformers sometime.. for all its issues and boy does it have a lot, it still has some kind of story progression
I do agree with everyone. T3 and T4 just don't have the same feel as the first two.
Night everypony.
nite Meanwhile
Night, Meanwhile
Only time we fast forwarded through credits was the Biber song in Karate Kid
inb4 bum review!?
goodnight Meanwhile
They're both bad in their own ways. T3 fails miserably in concept, and Salvation feels soulless.
Night Meanwhile
haha i love bum reviews
nighty night
CriticKitten this one was worse. Too CG, not enough human Terminators which is what makes it cool
JESsmith71 EEEYUP, that song ruined the movie
Shizuka: story progression? eh...sort of. The characters DO change..it's just that they get worse.
Shizuka: i would enjoy that, since i've never seen any of them
i feel like this was a huge rush
gnight
JESmith71: Why would someone want to stream the NEW karate kid, it sucked balls
13yeah but at least there's some change :3
You want Trilogies?
night
Shizuka: if you do show bayformers could it be with rifftrax?
Honey I shrunk the children
13ofc
we should do a Matrix trilogy :$
13only way to watch them
time for SuperBrony64 shenanigans
13also the only versions i have..
lol
silly Shizuka
JESmith71 .....and made us WISH for the rapping dog
OOOH MY GOD, THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVIE I EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!
Ghost30, because someone voted for it. I don't know why
13i only have 1-2 though, haven't bothered getting 3 yet
did we ever finish back to the futer trilogy?
We did
cratorkid yes
13haven't double checked the rifftrax torrents to see what's new
yup
I have to scoff at people who say that the new Karate Kid is terrible. It's not perfect, but if anything it did stuff better than the original.
11,01cratorkid: yes
oh i mised the last two
OOOooh! Robocop!
So, what's next?
we need to watch a spanish soapopera
Actually I think the second time they played it Dark they did play the rapping dog
Bayformers 3 is at least better than 2
HatchetRyda: Calm the fuck down, kid. Wasn't that special
HatchetRyda......i see SPOILERS!
so intresting
Bayformers 1 was the best the rest were garbo
8,6vectors?
What's Bayformers 3 like? I haven't seen it.
8,6I use Inkscape
RX-78-SweetieBot: that's like being ore fragrant than a septic tank. not hard.
I missed Parts two and three, as well. Good thing I have the DVDs :3
Why do people hate on the Micheal Bay Transformers movies? I like them.
8,6yes, the free part is good :3
11,01There were formers that bay.
RX-78-SweetieBot: true. but both feel like bay is trying to stab your ears out with robo shrapne
13the bayformers movies are.... brr...
AttacktheAndalite: Did you see the first or second? Then you've seen the third
Ghost30k IKR? He doesn't even learn karate, which totally ruins the point of the movie. Some stuff was better, but the original is just . . . better.
meow
AttacktheAndalite: imagine 2, but longer and with Leanord Nimoy
/me doesnt know what Bayformers is
AttacktheAndalite: sorry, was quoting Chaster A. Bum lol
11,01Those baying formers.
meow
AttacktheAndalite that was a Chester A. Bum reference (TGWTG)
AttacktheAndalite Did you ever watch "Transformers: Robots in Disguise"? Its kinda like that.
I'm still waiting for a Harry Potter marathon
13robot design that goes the wrong way for realism and sacrifices what the robots are supposed to be... namely characters...
meow
bayformers 1 was the only one i could sit through
Can I request a movie? I think Act of Valor would be a good movie to play! :3
13not background pieces
Eddmario: Because I wanted to see a movie about giant transforming robots, not a movie about a kid and his parents.
0,14I still need to see 2 and 3 in their entirety
Dark92Enigma: Ohhhhhh
Nittany_Discord: those faying bormers
Canadian_Brony: ...learning Karate is not the point of Karate Kid at all you fucking putz.
intermission!
I actually pissed my friend off by predicting the ending to the third Transformers movie less than halfway through the film.
13nope
Dark92Enigma: when you wish upon a SPOILERS
13sign off
we should watch mallrats
11,01Hole.
thanks for streaming Shizuka
Trilogies : Honey I shrunk the children, Robocop, Lord of the Rings, The monkey Trilogy(Planet of the apes chronology)
thasnks Shizuka
11,01Good stream Shizuka
well thx for stream Shizuka
Shizuka, do you HAVE to play this EVERY time you end your stream?
13yes
AUDIO SURF!
ooh this one again
LOTR!!
Leaned over and made a bet with him about the ending, then watched as it happened. XD
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka
13because i made it and worked hard on it
Thanks for the stream Shizuka
HatchetRyda EXPECTO-----SPOILERS!
stream was awesome Shizuka thank you
Still waiting for a Harry Potter week. :)

Thanks for the entertainment, Shizuka!
kk must learn to draw with a mouse ...
is it wrong i like the intermission more than the actual movie?
pong
PORTAL!!!
so who is next streamer?
Thanks for the stream Shizuka :3
13i have harry potter 1-4 presynced and 5-6 with riff mp3s
So, the creators of Audiosurf are working on a sequal
13maybe sometime
RAWRity no, but it's still stupid because the name is KARATE kid, and he learns KUNG FU. There is a HUGE difference between the two martial arts
8,6it's easy with vectors, hard with bitmap
Pudge: One HP movie per day, except deathly hallows. that would have to be shown in the same day
8,6opposite is true with a tablet
HatchetoRyder BLEH, i want to suck your SPOILERS!
Karate Kid was a coming-of-age story about Daniel learning to become more confident, centered, and mature, while eventually showing up the Cobra Kai gym and defeating them through his training with Miyagi.
Blackreach in Skyrim was a pain in the ASS before the Dawnguard DLC came out
harry potter maraton?
It would be great
Someone Ping me when something interesting comes on
RAWRity well said
Dark92Enigma: The Wizard of OMG A Zombie Ate Toedoe

Canadian_Brony: bad title doesnt make a bad movie

StupidSexyCJ no, but it's misleading
hi IshBestPony
Thanks for streaming, Shizuka. Good fun as always. :)
Shizuka: they nust be punished
minecraft
allo IshBestPony
Shizuka That's becuase this vid kinda gets annoying after you've seen it at least once.
What do you mean, Shizuka?
:D
/me HatchetoRyder (Harry Potter tune) da da da da da da SPOILERS
WHO IS COMPLAINING :[
/me is not complaining
/me always enjoys this video cause of music
why am i seeing all my favorite games in a tralier
why haven't I gotten the newsletter yet?
/me isnt complaining
dont get your noodle
This is NOT annoying
/me nods
dat was whag
complaining about what?
swag*
this is awesome
that was cool
/me doesnt think shes complaining, is she?
Karate Kid remake was more focused on Dre bonding with Jackie Chan's character, and the forming a father/son relationship, earning one another's respect and helping to deal with their emotional baggage. It's different, certainly, but at least it honestly had heart and was willing to try something new, rather than trying to tread old, tired ground like so many other remakes.
does shizuka actually streamed minecraft?
#swag?
THIS IS AWESOME!
/me Checks TiaraWhy's TUMBLR page while he waits for the next stream
HatchetRyda: some people cant handle her demo reel
13sometime i will play that half speed both to troll the whiners and because it sounds pretty cool the way media player slows it down
Pudge: ahhh ok
RAWRity: agreed
so yeah, people who say that the Karate Kid remake is bad simply because it's a remake? Piss off.
Yeah, this is not annoying. Whether or not something is annoying is the audience's problem.
Shizuka, you ever think about redoing it with more/better clips and a different choice of music?
Thanks for the stream Shizu <3
13:<
Shizuka: What does your name mean? I just know the 'Kami' part, which means God
13why you dis my music

TheRareP0N3 have you read the story "Late Night Pudding" on FimFiction.net?
We at Torchhoof are the best innovators of Equestrian technology.
No, therainbowvortex. Don't pay any worth to the haters and trolls. Striking kind of does that on its own.
We have to love and tolerate the haters
right. :(
Canadian_Brony: I try to refrain myself from reading fan fictions. lol
Canadian_Brony ha there's a fic of that?
Canadian_Brony: than again, my brother forced me to read my little dashie. >.<
/me So, the movie starts by showing the title......TERMINATOR SALVATION.....And the people were like, "HOORAY!''......And then it says who's in the movie, and then it shows the title again! ......TERMINATOR SALVATION

11,01Rotating pyramid.
kirzstryfe: i won't get kicked? ;c
Nyx, you can change back to Eddmario now.
8,6Nyx, you can ghost it if you're identified
...
i shall re-read the rules. :3
So why did Skynet turn all murdery?
Is that the real actors?
I would rather take death free, thank you very much
crap, how do I change back without refreshing?
I'm kinda curious
/me will use italics again, but will no longer make the same mistake
Nyx, use /nick
SuperBrony64: how is this a ride?
...
YAY!
Yeah
Are those the real actors?
|Pudge this is the pre-show before you saw the show
...what is this again.
11,02So...The Terminator is about machines taking over the planet?...
SuperBrony64 uh, yeah
i guess so...?
so.... someone followed the Conners around with a professional camera?
akimbo model 1887's moment. :)
I know next to nothing about The Terminator :S
11,02How original :P
mind=blown
Um, wasn't Arnold originally sent to KILL the Connors?
I wasn't here for the trilogy so...
SuperBrony64: its THE robocalypse film
and back to commercial
Lol
is this a rollercoster ride?
11,02StupidSexyCJ: I'm sure it is advertised as that ;)
zuma!
StuffCrusader no, this is a video
StuffCrusader: its more of a pyrotechnics/3D show
ooooh, ok!
why would you want a robot butterfly anyway?
I've been at this place before, I'm like an hour away from Universal
And now for the real show
We should show Beverly Hills Cop on here someday...
Wait

Everyone must move in their chairs like a ride
stupid ad on mah screen!
ah yes i remember moving chair rides
Polydunami is a happy filly :3
kabewm
Okay for some weird reason the guy who made the vid put this as an intro
boom headshot
so this video is just the 3D video part? not the part with the shotguns and junk on stage?
8,6what you're missing with this is that it's actually 3 huge screens with actors running across the front during parts of it
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
I wonder if anybody has thought aboutmaking a Timesplitters movie...
WHAT THATS NOT EVEN HALF OF THE VIDEO
11,02Uh oh...I might need to fast forward
Eddmario: yes..yes..yes..yes
Everyone move in your chairs, it totally matters here
gotta be realistic
lol
dat classic WMP :3
That's all there is? Wow...
STILL MORE REALISTIC THAN JAWS
Well I was trying to find a good video of the whole ride but the screen quality sucked
oh sh*t its the popo!
It's a snake manticore!
xD
Dark92Enigma: You mean the Jaws after the 3rd movie? The first one was good
what are we watching?
/me Has never seen Jaws or Terminator
MOVE IN YOUR CHAIR LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT
the fuutre? wha?
Jaws 3D is a masterpiece of cinema
OHH SHEET ITS KNIFE HANDS
AttacktheAndalite Exactly my point
... If you say so
I'm the one who requested this, but this was the best quality one I could find. There was one that had the live stage parts but the camera was crooked and you couldn't see the full movie screen
oh crap its Slenderman
dodging is hard
Didn't Slenderman come from an MLP: FIM fanfic?
Got disconnected for a sec.
imma get some water brb every pony!
11,02COME ON ARNOLD, DON'T LET THE "BUDGET CRISIS" HIT "CALIFORNIA" IN THE BACK THERE!!
no he came from a message board
Could've just given John the Shotgun
How long is this?
11,01Because Skynet is a pretty pyramid.
11,02This is about 45 min
Eddmario couple minutes
Really?
11,02*15
you'd think that pyramid would reach the sky
lol
8,6not quite long enough to justify the 2 1/2 hour wait in the summer heat it took to get into the room
SuperBrony64 For a second I was gonna say "So it's like an episode of Doctor Who?"
Dodging in my chair is so totally worth it
11,02kirzstryfe: ikr...except I never been on the ride before O.O
Doctor Who, huh? Sounds like a medical show
You can see how low budget this was
Polydunami|Reading: lol
8,6it actually looks good on the ride
kirzstryfe you waited 2 1/2 hours? I had an A pass, so I got in with only a 2 minute wait
8,6doesn't translate well to video
Basically what happened before this that wasn't shown in this video was that there was stuff on stage in front of the movie screen. Two live actors playing Arnold and John Connor ride on stage on a motorcycle and "ride" in the time portal and end up in the future on the movie screen
11,02I love how Universal Studios Hollywood sucks at being a theme park.
8,6yeah, I saw this before fast passes were invented
the tour was literally the best ride
No, I'm teasing. I'm watching the First Doctor era currently.
Have you guys ever been to the Dells?
Dont they have actual roller coasters?
11,02I've owned a Dell one time.
Maybe I should have linked that one but oh well
back
Pudge: Like one or two maybe
11,02wb StuffCrusader :)
Dodge the tiny planes
SuperBrony64 So you know they're crap when you upgrade the version of Windows on them
How low was the budget for this movie?
I own a Dell laptop... is that what you were asking?
Pudge: the ones they have suck
Pudge at Universal Hollywood? Yes. "The Mummy" ride
It's nothing like Bush Gardens or King's Island I'm guessing
I meant who here has been to Wisonsin Dells?
11,02Dell is a cool OEM :<
i've been to disney world
I've never been to Wisconsin
Wow, dat CGI is amazing
The most exciting part about the Mummy ride, waiting in line
You can tell this was 3D with all the stuff flying at you
:D
Pudge no, but it is cool. It shows off with special effects. More like "Adventure" rides
I know that people live in Wisconsin, but that's it.
Hello everypony :)
When I got to amusement parks, I'm looking for G forces
hello
oo hai DivinePony
hi DivinePony
Hey there DivinePony
hi DivinePony
Howdy DivingPony you've been well?
First livestream from here :)
ka-boom
You guys GOTTA go to Wisconsin Dells. Specifically, take a duck tour. A duck is those tour botes that can go on land
That was hilarious xD
College Roomate
LOL
wuts with all the terminator stuff
lol
NAILED IT
^^
i wish i could had seen this
8,6it was also cheaper to go to the parks back then too
StuffCrusader That's what I wanna know as well.
Man how long is this?
Who thinks this should have been Terminator 3?
Pudge: 15 mins or so
i do
i wish we could see an episode...
What the buck is this?
What happened to da co
Some kind of Terminator pre-show.
Blow it up
StuffCrusader: Episode of what?
mlp
Okay there's the live stage stuff right there
Kencolt this is Terminator 2 the ride at Universal Studios Hollywood
Arnold Shwarzeneger is so good at acting emotionless
StuffCrusader: they're showing 2 tomorrow
Kecolt Some Universal theme park show that ripped off Timesplitters
yayz!
holy sh*t
1 million?
oh god Slenderman
Eulshy the T-100000
this is hurting my headphones
I knew something was off when he called a term skull his college roommate.
That's a stunt guy pretending to be Arnold down there
dog and pony show and feeling pinkie keen i believe
Ghost30k I just keep it kinda low
this the hole movie?
StuffCrusader this is the entire RIDE
o hai live actors
Canadian_Brony Grow a pair and do what I do: Have your volume at max, but wear headphones at all times
11,02GREAT SCOTT
ooooh
StuffCrusader, this is not Holes.
2:45 am and still goin strong
lol sorry
:3
I'll Be Back
8,6and then they wandered into TRON
HOLY SH*T!!!
That was really bad.....
Basically they had stunt actors running back and forth on and off stage to make it look like the characters were running in and out of the movie
That is a cool ride
Anybody know when the next Tron movie's gonna be coming out?
wow xD
SuperBrony64 WTF did you do to the audience?
Skynet and clue shipping
sh*t just got real
dat picture
Next tron movie?
Thanks for running that
That's done, then?
There is no next one
StuffCrusader: i c wat u did thar
lol
Eulshy Yeah, Tron is confirmed to be a trilogy
Lol
stream over?
Bah.
Made by disney
'-
Eulshy Who else? They made the first 2.
pineapple
Eddmario really? I knew they have a TV series, but a 3rd movie too?
And Monsters Inc is confirmed to have a PREQUEL
Have you seen the first tron?
wait there was a tv series?
Dark92Enigma WTF?!?
Canadian_Brony Wait, there's a Trn TV?
*Tron
SuperBrony64: You done streaming?
Cartoon
Eddmario StupidSexyCJ there either is, or will be, a Tron TV series.
at this one movie place near me, they're showing finding nemo in 3D
on the Disney channel
Canadian_Brony Look Up: Monsters University
Why not stream The Tick here?
Oh. In that case, I have heard about it. Doesn't it have Elijah Wood in it?
i am skeptical about a monsters inc prequel
Dark92Enigma *jaw drops*
Or is he too busy doing Season 10 off RvB?
*of
StupidSexyCJ there will be in 2013
/me manually closes jaw
Ahem.
... Yeah, we don't need a prequel to Monsters Inc.
AFRO CIRCUS!
Wait, is SuperBrony64 done streaming already?
an more streamin'?
Canadian_Brony: skeptical about it being a good prequel i mean
Canadian_Brony IKR? I'm uneasy too......it's completely unnecessary
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wi8Fv0AJA4
Eddmario eeyup. StupidSexyCJ not ATM
they're making catching fire
Eddmario, that sounds REALLY familiar...
I can barely remember the storyline of Monster Inc.
i'm listening to mario elevator music to pass the time. very fitting
So, there's apparently a Toy Story FOUR in the works
so was that it for the stream? or is more coming up?
Basically, little human girl shows up in monster town and is not afraid of the big scary monsters.
they meet a girl and they discover you dont have to scare people the end
Eddmario: wait, why?
Polydunami|Reading: eh its pixar it'll be decent atleat
Syn_Virtu Monsters Inc. in 5 seconds
nice
something to do with doors and yellow snowcones
/me Has not seen Up either
up is great
yep
Up is a really good movie
Up was good but perhaps a tad overrated
/me never scene up
Pixar will find a way, I'm sure. But I'm still skeptical of there being a good Monsters Inc. prequel.
i luv the bird
I believe the last Pixar movie I've seen was Wall-E
11,01What about Down?
theres going to be another iron man...
SQUIREL!
the first ten minutes made me feel like crying, but then everything after was just okay
Nittany_Discord: or left
Nittany_Discord That's the Brazilian rip-off
hmm?
and thor...
Monsters Inc was great, and deserves to be a standalone film...........i might give the new one a chance, but i'm not sure........the jokes were funny in the trailer, but i guess that's the highlight of the film
Watch the first ten minutes of Up and then you can go and leave the theatre.
and how to train your dragon 2...
Waiting to si Wreck it Ralph
Anybody remember the animated movie "Home On The Range"?
Polydunami|Reading IKR?
Eulshy YES! Same here.
Pixar is the Valve of Movies
another hobbit...
HELL YA RAYMAN
Also, don't forget your tissue box.
Eddmario yes! dayum, how old is that?
yay atream!
wooo Rayman!
/me has never played Rayman
SuperBrony64 is streaming im guessing
SuperBrony64: playin orgins?
Haven't seen Rayman in a while, SuperBrony64
scary moviw 5...
Canadian_Brony I believe it's around 5 or 6 years old.
good morning everypony
Eddmario It wasn't that great.....the songs were more memorable
movie*
/me has never played or seen any footage of Rayman
Who cares rayman
Rayman . . . I remember playing an old Rayman PC game sometime ago
I remember the old raymam
Eddmario really? I though it was older
Rayman
it's fluttershy!
I want to play these games.
Canadian_Brony Probably is.
TO GOOGLE!
I remember like playing a tiny bit of the first rayman game
Right, back to reading.
lol rayman how do you swallow with no neck
that feel when you wanna play Majora's Mask, but your N64 controller is borked and stores dont sell replacements anymore
lol
Amount of fucks given:
Eddmario "Home on the Range" was released in 2004, which makes it 8 years old
duh fuq?
Canadian_Brony Wow, I'm old.
lol
Eddmario I'm 15. Remembering it makes ME feel old
yay! gameplay!
/me remembers Rayman: Raving Rabbids
steam ftw
TO THE FIRST WORLD
Who remembers the VIDEO GAME Tak and the Power of Juju?
So who's streaming?
me
jiggly
i remember it
Tak kinda sucked
/me cringe
Crush
Eulshy The show? Yes. The game? No.
Eddmario: I remember Tak: The Great Juju Challenge. Loved that game as akid
how do you stream?
I'm digging this music alot
8,6with a computer
did this come out on 3DS?
8,6:3
The first one had a MAJOR bug if you used a certain cheat code too early...
Canadian_Brony: Music only gets better too
yes
dat music
So who's streaming?
DAAAAAAAAAAAAMN!
SuperBrony64 is
WalkerPony89 :D
POMF
Sexy fairy
Pause menu be trolling us.
thx StuffCrusader
np
Canadian_Brony: Game gets satanically difficult by the end though >.<
Ded
Failure
ded
WalkerPony89 alot of games do.
and I always end up playing them
Ok......i'm off everypony.......next time, i guess you won't fret next time i RP Chester A Bum, right?.............................Ok, bye
Canadian_Brony: Not really, and not to the level that this game does. Hell, I'd say Rayman: Origins is more difficult than Dark Souls
nah Dark Souls is more harder
Cya then Dark92Enigma
WalkerPony89 close?
g'night Dark92Enigma
Maybe it's because I suck at platformers, but still
good night Dark92Enigma
night Dark92Enigma
Canadian_Brony: What do you mean by "close"?
11,02Anyway, my computer isn't really up to the task of playing a game and streaming it at the same time :/
WalkerPony89 does it com close to being as difficult as Dark Souls? . . nevermind. I've never played it, so I wouldn't get the comparison anyway
SuperBrony64: aww
I wonder if the classic Spyro or Crash Bandicoot games will come to Steam at all....
SuperBrony64 at least you trued, and that was pretty cool!
*tried
I'm putting that game on my wishlist
SuperBrony64 I have a similar problem with gaming while recording with Fraps.
Canadian_Brony: Once you get use to Dark Souls and learn its ins and outs, it's difficulty level goes way down. Rayman didn't have anything like that, so I struggled through it. Especially trying to get all the lums and electoons in Rayman
i wish i could stream my minecraft survival but i don't know hoe to stream
gotta be a mod to stream
awww...
WalkerPony89 that sounds like it could get difficult
11,01Heading to bed. I hope to get some good sleep.
butter nuggets
I wonder if any of the mods have ever gotten kicked...

YES
I feel like changing my name
It's 20 bucks now Edd
Or would I be wasting my money like I did with Sam N Max: Season 1?
At least on the consoles
11,02On Steam, it's a little over $6 now :)
pause?
i'd rather just watch the movie
JESmith71 It's on consoles now? Might try the demo this weekend then
I'd rather just watch the actual movie
pause for dramatic effect
It's been on consoles
i think Marty just crapped himself
mother of celestia
. . ?
But like Super Brony said it's cheaper on Steam
the hell did that dog do?
SuperBrony64: I didn't know you had Steam :O
Dat Dog assassinated his father
He...let loose the trolls?
6,24€ on Steam - for T-minus 1'46'
Ponies47: he always had it xD
Oh wait
It's not Fox. But it is Lloyd
well the nuts gone, oh well back to normal life. lol

another reason id rather just watch the movie.... movies dont have load screens
lol
Eddmario smart kid. I'll watch them later
i'm back
wait that title was in one episode of mlp fim
hi StuffCrusader
I actually had an idea for the plot ofa fourth BTTF film BEFORE the game was announced
movie is better though
Not: missed em...they were shown monday-wedensay....
man i wanna watch the movie again
whatawe whatchn?
we just saw them
The plot was that it was about Marty's kids
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: i know, i missed them all
im sure you can find them online for free same place you can download other illegal stuff... you know the place.
StuffCrusader this is "Back to the Future: the game" streamed by SuperBrony64
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I never knew. To bad bucking Steam won't let me add friends until I have games in my Steam account. Which I do bucking have by the way! Well just TF2 but still I got a bucking game on my Steam! :[

wait, according to the movies, WHEN is this?
wt
punch em in the face
Really that response?
Lunar_Brony: never...its an alternate timeline thing..
Lunar_Brony a few months after the end of Part 3
Looks like he took some Iron Will training
This takes place seven months after BttF3
it's not with the movie, it's pretty much a sequal
Though they stated it's non-canon, but an alternate timeline
yes say yes
Shamroc Eddmario k, thx. I haven't seen any of the movies
Lunar_Brony: after them
oooh hes got you
/me spits out drink
oooh
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN TEM?!?!?!

00,02i'ma stop streaming for a bit
00,02friend wants some help
/me holds onto Phase4's tail.
SlurryMoon: I have a suggestion. Banana on toast.
XAX how about toasted banna bread
banana on toast sounds really nice :o
I'm a bad example, I just ate a cookie...
alexxm: ...mmmNah I don't think that would be the greatest. Worth a try though.
I might score a doughnut in a minute or two...
I should go buy something to eat myself, but it's raining and I'm lazy
yes! those doughnuts aren't going to the training room - they're being put out for us~
I'm pretty certain doughnuts were invented by unicorns
they are delicious and they fit onto horns well
yep
if they weren't designed for unicorns, why else would they have a hole in them? it'd make no sense
mmmm unicorns
The doughnuts are being put out in just a moment! Best part is that only half of the interns are here and only like 2 full time employees are here
the hole is essentially just a pointless lack of doughnutness in the doughnut
who wants to see an awesome pic? your going to have to pm me though
they are clearly designed to be carried by unicorns

Not looking good on morning news - neighborhoods on the opposide side of the creek is under water - I'm on the higher side - havent gone to check out the roads to see if their visible yet - sound quiet outside - not very many motors on the street, hearing from my front porch

Cypresswolf: Don't die, dying is bad.

Drove around a bit late last night - police were still driving around and blocking off flooded roads
Cypresswolf where abouts?
Mutterguy: It's Saturday, Saturday. Gotta get down o- oh wait
the roads on the way to my Grandma's were still flooded in spots
first pony to pm me a song via youtube video will have me listen to it for the next while on repeat (maybe an hour or so)
Cypress region along 290 and the creek areas

/me rehugs
bye guys
see ya alexxm.
good news...I have a stalker now.....should be in the bad news section----but...wtf? this might become interesting
derpy_pony: how did you uncover this stalker?
derpy_pony: bats are good tools for kneecapping people
always around....no matter whioch city district....hard not to notice
Wait, what type of bat?
here it is like....two stations with the metro and you are in another city.....another milieu, another income and education background...
but...she was always there
Chocobunny: any, more or less
creepy
PonyNegZero: I lol'd, so very hard.

>Buy Skyrim
>Price set down 33% next day
thats what you get for buying a shit game Kammerjunk
o u
im still trying to figure out if i should buy new vegas
well decide whether or not too
you could have gotten new vegas as well as skyrim (plus 2 others and some dlc stuff) for 50 bucks via the bethesda softworks pack
i dont want skyrim
it is a shit game. i just want new vegas to complete my fallout collection
oh, sorry, I thought Kammerjunk wrote that...
I hope this isn't because Skyrim has bugs.
Do you have the original two?
Because it's a Bethesda game.
don't even know if I shouldn't accept her as some kidn of background attention supplier
Sundaysmile: im going to buy them all together causet he fallout collection is only 10 bucks
that is 1 2 and tactics
whatever...it's friday evening...too tired to think...and too drunk
then new vegas is 25 bucks
why is there no stream?
derpy_pony: cause you clop at night
Man, I really don't have a lot of time or money for games. Probably more time than money. But I bought Terraria last night, and I'm playing that.
no question about that
but...doesn't matter
if i play new vegas
Later, dudes :)
i need to play on hardcore
I've been watching the Steam Summer Sale. No "Today's Deals" I want to buy so far.
see ya MegaMoonShine
helo ponystaat how ar yuo dong?
>YFW New Vegas hardcore mode isn't hardcore
how long's it on for? a week or so?
so far i bought the half life collection
20 minutes left until the moskovskaya is in the bloodstream
just 20 bucks
if anyone feels insulted then, he probably deserved it anyway
Bronysith: Seriously, there is no hardcore mode.
Kammerjunk, do you already have Terraria?
Kandarihu: Eeyup.
Kammerjunk: on new vegas?
Bronysith: Yeah. All it does is add thirst and hunger.
helo ponystaat?
and make things harder to kill and makes it harder to heal
was is los?
www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3czWApWuDE
Sundaysmile: Well, yeah, but I think that's an improvement.
never said it wasn't lol
yea
what fun is there in easy?
NONE
whatever...having a stalker is new...dunno if she is more interesting if I react or if I don't
Get out of here, stalker.
no
easy is walking into town with a Fatboy and aiming for the civillians. You have now technically completed all their quests
i dont want new vegas
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0S_WoFmpm0 Top ten
Sundaysmile: Mininukes are way too much fun.
derpy_pony: do something like stand near something and ask her to take a picture of you with it
new vegas was nice...just don't take sides...mr house is vulnerable
sweetiebot is best filly
i like This Day Aria rewritten. the singers are actually good
we were in a bar....she acted distanced...
derpy_pony: Independence is best faction.
I didn't ask her what the fuck she is doing there
yeah
derpy_pony: Not sure if story, or just song lyrics.
I only watched the two first episodes of FiW. I liked it, but I just couldn't be arsed.
I disliked the end. Courier walking away. He had control over NV and a robot army and all power sources in the region
I am terribly lazy.
and he walks away...wtf?
terror regime!
However, Lonesome Road was goddamn awesome.
/me returns with a popsicle
never tried it
hai everypony!!!!
hi there
wodka kicks in....
hi Hrafn
howdy, Hrafn
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx_yEt-0sKw Tombstone's own sexy dance
^ :D
y everybody sayin hi to Hrafn and not me
hm...
hi LoGaN
yay!
geht doch
I've seen you a few hours ago here
Salve, LoGaN et Hrafn.
actually new vegas was actually pretty good
i just didnt level right
ponystaat cool i think cool
energy weapons is overpowered....from 70 or so you can take a perk that makes averyone explode
I can't hear you over the sound of dolan.
kills the character if in vincinity
gooby pls
Kammerjunk: be ashamed
I didn't really like energy weapons. They didn't have that satisfying sound you get if you use a normal weapon.
* twitch
derpy_pony: Oh, I hate dolan, I think it's a terrible meme.
i dont understand dolan
I love dolan, but I tend to have a very immature sense of humour :P
like what is the point?
i understand logan
... awkward silence
I have been a /b/tard too long to be surprised by anything dolan does
but..newfriends
The thing is, dolan didn't become "popular" before at least 1½ year after its invention.
this is normal
Think about how long it took rickroll to take off...
Probably, but I still think the entire thing is silly.
i know someone named river and his brother is named rain
all the memes they use on 9gag and facebook and similar sites now got bring 2 years ago....yust not on the mainstream sites
wy somwon talking to me not
+o
LoGaN: I know a Cadance in real life
hhaQ!
agh! brainfreeze!
candece is cool
LoGaN: sorry, Cadence
i cold
I'm true to my name - Kasper, means "hoarder" or "treasurer". It kinda makes me a bit of a hipster, so I don't like it when people in my class say "trolled" or whatevs.
I liked the cadence joke the musician made. Ingram
derpy_pony: What? BBBFF ending on a Deceptive Cadence?
helo
yes
derpy_pony: indeed, almost everyone knows about it
hi Ford_Focus
That was pretty neat.
nerd joke ^^
helo man
now, everyone knows it, yes
flim flam brothers had a song. CMC had 2 songs. Cadance had her own song... WHY NO APPLEJACK SONG?!
when i woke up my arms were as cold as ice is this normal?
yes
right...
Bronysith: I really want to see an Applejack song. Even Dashie got half a song with Find a Pet.
applejack is....special
yse he is
cmc Bronysith
oh, today is friday - breaking out the pony belt
Kammerjunk: everyone and their mother had their own song before applejack
Maybe she just doesn't like to sing
Applejack is underrated.
Very
she doesn't even fit into the audience culture...I mean, who wants a redneck in the rpg 6?
Applejack is just being humble
apeljack is cool he can kikc a three
lauren faust liked the character, that's how it survived
Bronysith: yeah she sang good in winter wrap up now give her a song of her own god dayum it
Ford_Focus: lol 'he'
heh
yes
farmgirl is...ancient
apeljack has e appel on his back
but applejack is cool nonetheless
No arguments there.
I kinda like the not-so-texan accent.
i like applejack she cool
And, of course, Applejack is MLG pro.
Applejack is a pretty cool guy, seh bucks apples and doesn't afraid of anything.
Jim: Guy?
guess I'm too drunk to see the finer nuances here
gal*
MUST...TOLERATE...VOCAB AND GRAMMAR....
derpy_pony: if you admit your drunk your not drunk

why, back in my days we didn't have any of these fancy broadbands for our computing machines! we had to carry our kilobytes in wooden buckets
aaaaaand bought
"wodka"?
Hrafn: I lol'd.
we had wooden chariots for our 12 kilobaud modems
ill play new vegas after i beat half life 1
Hrafn: I'm not quite that old, but my first computer was MS-DOS....
well wating for 6 games download is going to be a pain :|
mobile internet
my first computer (well, my brother's computer, but I got to use it) was an Amiga 500

LoGaN, I know you're twelve and all, but the question marks doesn't make your question better.

only Celestia and Luna at the moment
creepy song www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLWmwxDOJAs
Heeey
LoGaN: just twilight and rainbow dash
Chocobunny: it catched your attention though
ah, good old C64 <3
if three of them land, they get a tank and kill you
LoGaN, Yeah, because it clogged the chat.
but...no...the first one was snake...when I was 5 years old...
I just had a terrible realization - I can't quite read C#...
holy... that's a lot of Pinkie
I lived in the soviet zone, but my mother worked in the party central for the district...and they had computers for message encryption
ALL THE PONES
and for games ^^
At the end of my workday, I really want to see what my work computer can do...
Hmmm, is there any way to edit the desktop ponies sprites? I might make my OC a sprite. :3
I fell in love there
Chocobunny: there are plenty of instructions
imma see what happens if i put 2000 pinkies brb
someone put in his oc, Chocobunny
inb4 crash...
there is a way
brb
/me prepares for the pinkopalypse

LoGaN: What did I do?
good i having a b day sleepover
who should i do 1000 of next?
I'm waiting for the euro night myself :3
since the 11th doctor is non existent. is it because he is a bad actor or just terrible writing?
I don't believe in gods or spirits or the like, so Friday 13th was boring.
LoGaN: What about her? D'ya dislike her?
she a little wierd
imma see 1000 sonic rainbooms on screen
yeah!!!!!!!!
LoGaN: She's not weird!
blah blah b lah

derpy_pony: a NORMAL pillow with ponies on it would be fine. Those are... egh :[

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WteF0j5gYGk&feature=related
derpy_pony: Lotsa' spaghetti.

MadSurge: Nothin' much. Either solitaire or Sims 3. *needs more games*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs&feature=relmfu
AttackAndalite|Games: steam sale~
AttackAndalite|Games: Sims 3 isn't a game for me <:3
so much linkage
For it is written, only Link can defeat boredom.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wblE8YYLyQ0&feature=relmfu
RoboGerbil: I know, I'm trying to get some work done, but that's apparently not going to happen
quick everypony post a random link for PonyNegZero
Meanwhile: I find it fascinating. Humans are like they are.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=plcp
www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-P16lz_NM
Geeeehphc
derpy_pony: Thinking about humans being like they are makes me more depressed than fascinated tbh.
Meanwhile: true statement is true
only if you expect anything from them, Meanwhile
www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH4DT_eLblo
derpy_pony: I think it's hard not to expect a certain amount of something from ones own species.
amateurishly domesticated apes who fall from the tree all the time and still think they were the center of the universe....so cute <3
I love them
I don't see myself as exception here ^^
I try to love them, but then they do something silly.
why not?
d
if it gets dangerous, they will fix it
they are good at fixing hopeless situations
mm
give ten of them a rope and say "pull!", two pull, three push, 2 try to eat it and two try to have sex with it
normal

/nick Mutterguy|SLP
0.O
Has anyone here seen that Tin Tin movie... My father forced me to watch it for some reason...
it was ok
Eh, Anthology I was better than II imo.
no i liked to better becuse it was a hour long
2 better not to
/me Waits 30min to Upload his song to soundcloud... finds out he uploaded wrong version :(
The second Anthology is way too long. It also has too many PMV's
must find lollipop chainsaw game...
What Malavolent said.
I got bored of II within twenty minutes.
I liked both parts
But there are some great videos in II.
RoboGerbil I heared creepy hacker nerdy dude who you should always wear gloves when making contact with something he has touched is selling a hckec copy...
i like long youtube videos i like them even more when they have ponys in them :D
TheRandomkid321: uh.. what? was that english?
long videos like that are great when you're bored and have lots of time to kill :P
RoboGerbil... No...
and im always bored and have a great anount of time on my hands
amount*
MarDoWell: Then learn something new.

Oh no you didn't.
MarDoWell Don't have one... And is that typo in your name intentional?

Intentional name typos are stupid.
Morning everypony! :)

*they will never find me at 4chan muhahaha*
/me shines a spotlight on Lil_B.
Well, at least we know how to calm the chat :D
I'm not getting anything done right now... screw it...
PonyNegZero: Your bosses must not have a keylogger on any of the computer where you work at XD
AttacktheAndalite: ehh.. I doubt it
then again, there is all sorts of crap going on...
we have a group conference and people are just posting random crap
for example: one person is using wingdings, one person is flipping tables... etc
PonyNegZero: Your job seems awesome. Considering how much you're on here during work, you'd be fired if it were a regular cubicle prison job
Well, now that I have the songs finished... I can go to my next goal... making a Desktop Pony :3
AttacktheAndalite: I'm not arguing with it, it is quite fantastic - but I have never used C# before so it is a bit of a learning curve...
PonyNegZero: Sweet.
some of the others go on reddit and facebook as well - i just choose to be here instead
PonyNegZero: Best job ever.
AttacktheAndalite: including a kitchen (which is stocked with food quite often) and everything like that - yes, this is a fantastic job
I probably should work a little harder, just in case
im back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hi LoGaN
Hello, LoGaN
sup
oh my, I've been at work for 3 hours and I still haven't gotten anything done yet...
i bored no 1 streaming!!!!!!
LoGaN: there are a lot of things you could be doing...

Malavolent: Randomness

Typo.

I have learned that if you torture your cpu and threaten it

Ewww Family Guy
O_o
I hate Family Guy
Eddmario: tmi
Whats wrong with Family guy? D:
And pretty much every show on Adult Swim that isn't anime
It's a poor excuse for a comedy
"(V)_(º,,,º)_(V)" zoidburg!
Sry 4 asking but who's the 2 guys in stream?
05,15I liked the South Park Episode that made fun of it.
In the words of Galvatron: "This is bad comedy."
I like the original Family Guy, but The Simpsons kick ass
I also hate South Park
/me claps
O_o
I dont mind South Park
I pretty much hate any animated adult comedy
dont really look for it tho
RaveBrony: ಠ_ರೃ yes, quite

Hey StuffCrusader
ohai StuffCrusader
both of you
05,15Old Simpsons was good. Now it tries to be like Family Guy, which is strange.
Hello StuffCrusader
The old episodes of anything are always the good ones.
05,15WindWhistler MLP
umm sure about that?
This is what happens when you want good shows to run longer
my little pony G 3.5 was not good
MLP is an exception.
Though I like all generations. With the exception of G3.6
You 2 should sing this day aria
is G 3.5 newborn cuties
that is what i say
G3 as a whole was only bad because of the bad writers.
<3 this song
StuffCrusader: No, that's G3.6
they call the rising sun!
/me Guessed the song
oh, cuz newborn cuties was horrible
gtg everypony!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
05,15House of the Rising Sun is playing?
ohh what happend to the live stream thing? :3

Okay, I'd appreciate for at least one person to answer me this time...has anyone ever played De Blob?
what happend to the live stream? did you change livestream.com to the new source?
WindWhistler: no
/me has never heard The House of the Rising Sun
^
^^
WindWhistler: assume silence is a resounding no
PonyNegZero: Well that sucks. It's a good game. How about Elebits?
....another resounding no. D:
back
Geez. These games get too little attention.
nah. have you played portal 2 WindWhistler? it's one of my favorites
StuffCrusader: Yup.
do I see a little Sat there in the background :D
SNAP CRACKLE AND POP
dragons!? where!?!
I think my favorite part of that game is the defective turrets
05,15You've never heard this song? Next thing you'll be saying you don't know who Chuck Berry is
i see a slenderman in the background
jk XD
play us a tasty lick lol
fluttercry: I only know the mainstream artists. And the Beatles and the Beach Boys. And Earth, Wind, and Fire.
i was joking lol
n evil monkey in the closet?
Invi: Yes you do
05,15WindWhistler....Chuck Berry is one of rock and roll's biggest legends
lies! Slenderman only appears at night!
AttacktheAndalite i remember that mane :D
I WAS JOKING
Slenderman, slenderman everywhere
fluttercry: Oh.
i know that song!!!
Invi: who doesn't? And that voice, and that laugh~
I wonder why my dad has never mentioned him...
hi Invi
which is night in my time... *looks out of window*
AttacktheAndalite :D
he's a huge nostalgia person.
hay Lil_B ^^
It's currently 12:04 PM here.
1:05pm
it's 1:05 here
12 AM here
You should see all the old newspapers he has in the basement.
10:05 am here
He even has some from when JFK was assassinated.
AttacktheAndalite: you live on the east coast?
well they said that he was part of a photo shopping contest to make creepy things i think and one of them was slenderman so boom hes fake XD
05,15Slenderman is real bro! He visits me
I absolutely HATE Slenderman...
05,15He's pretty chill though.
He's an abomination
fluttercry you may want to get that checked
were did slenderman originate from?
That he is.
Woop, new steam deals
yes ur streaming
05,15StuffCrusader A Something Awful forum
StuffCrusader: A forum contest about making paranormal pictures.
ooooooh
planning to take moar requests soon?
StuffCrusader: Yep
I guess a man who eats children counts as paranormal?
05,15Do people actually visit SA anymore?
Hey, should I take my mouse pad with me?
/me came back
XD
StuffCrusader:he was part of a photoshopping contest and part of a creepypasta series
Eddmario: It'll make using the mouse much more bearable.
he should sing the unicorn song
/me waves his lighter back and forth
Do a ponification of "Grease Paint and Monkey Brains"
Dad:BACKFLIP Son:BUT DAD THAT WAS A FRONTFLIP Dad:DONT QUESTION ME!
Hi guys
I know sat but who is the singer? ^^
hay SpadeMagnes[R]
Hi SpadeMagnes[R] :)
hi SpadeMagnes
Hey SpadeMagnes[R]
I just relized my Ds is really old
I had my Ds since launch
/^\ :[ /^\
i got a 3ds for my b-day. i want the purple pn thlough
i think slenderman actually might be a de-formed human being who kills children but if it was part of a photoshopping contest its fake
And despite it having screen scratches the L button being broken, and a peice of the hull missing it STILL WORKS
what we watching?
05,15dude. Nobody ever thought Slenderman was real did they?
Why would someone believe he is real? :D
some dude singing Darkts
fluttercry: he
Never cared for slenderman
Same reason some people believe werewolves exist?
he is only real if you think of him fluttercry
Herobrine is real o.o
Invi: Hush, no he isn't.
Hi everypony
hello again
herobrine (Shiver)
I am back
Myths only exist because some people believe they exist
herobrines only real in minecraft XD
05,15Just like people who think Cthulhu exists and that Lovecraft was some kind of prophet
Meanwhile that is what they want you to think :u
I am excited about today's mocie night!
Myths would not be around if people did not believe they existed
"movie"
fluttercry: Wait what? oh dear.
me too
Thats why they are called myths
Fun Fact: Slenderman was created.... BY A MESSAGE BOARD
or legends
Hi Meanwhile and MegaMoonShine
05,15Meanwhile I kid you not...
TRUE STORY
Livestreamers! Sing this day aria!
fluttercry: That's tragic.
I always knew people were insane, but this is just ridiculous...
i beleve the thylceine still exsits
sing this day aria
ya! this day aria!
Siiiiing iiiiiit!
how does a this day aria acoustic version sounds like?
pinkies brew? :3
I thought myths were based off of real things? Is slenderman based off of cannibals and pedophiles?
Some day I want to go to the moon
SpadeMagnes[R]: Why wait?
WindWhistler: Slenderman was never based on that
yay!!
spam flavored muffins?
/me kicks SpadeMagnes[R] really really hard into the sky
Weeee!
/me starts throwing muffins at MegaMoonShine
Then do BBBFF if you can
how do you do italics?
05,15You know, it'd be interesting if there was a world where EVERY MYTH EVER was true
fluttercry: The Secret World?
fluttercry: we would die because of it then
I'd make a myth about ponies
fluttercry: It's called Fantasy World
My sister thinks you are cute
When was the first final fantasy made anyway?
05,15Isn't The Secret World the game with the uh...interesting induction ceremony?
StuffCrusader /me <message here>
I have no idea. :I
thanks!
fluttercry: who knows
One of my friends hates Pokemon for THE dumbest reason ever.
05,15SpadeMagnes[R] I think like 1985 or 87
SpadeMagnes[R], 1989
now sing!
Because it "ripped off of Final Fantasy"
05,15or 89
05,15I was close
Wasnt it called Final Fantasy because the company thought it would be the last game they would make?
WindWhistler: U srs? :|
MegaMoonShine: No joke.
SpadeMagnes[R] yes
WindWhistler: :D Wow, what?
WindWhistler well that is the first time I have heard that.
i know the words!!
i think slenderman is fake because at night when i was younger i decided to explore the forest and i didnt see him at all just trees and when i was done i went back home the end
yeah i hate pokemon as well pokemon is for little jack offs
05,15I've never finished a FF game, yet I've played 6 of them
All because the Pokemon seemed to have similar appearances to some FF monsters or whatnot, AND because they have some of the same move names.
wait... final fantasy and pokemon is related? that explain FF XIII-2
I dont see how
no kingdom hearts and FF are realated
valoreins|Drawing: My god :O You're right
Pokemon sucks
No wait, maybe it was just because they had similar names for moves.
Kingdom Hearts <3
WindWhistler: wow he's dumb
Like Bubble Gun
missing no dosn't
xxMoopyxx: Pokemon is fun
My sister thinks you are cute singer person
Wait no, not Bubble Gun...
WATER GUN
No wait, fluttercry was right, it is 87
lol I'm an idiot
I respect opinions provided they are decent reasons
xxMoopyxx: the only reason why pokemon sucks, is because they add more and more pokemon into the show
:D
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: She must be passionate about FF.
No dude pokemon sucks major balls
150 was supposed to be the original number
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: GOD FORBID THEY ADD NEW THINGS
perfect
05,15My issue with pokemon is that it got boring after a while
THEY CHANGED IT NOW IT SUCKS
they suck dick
i bet theres at least 400+ pokemon now
inb4 "I could care less" argument... if we get this far XD
05,15xxMoopyxx you need to calm down
DarkSkyes over 600
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: 600+
OMG
I liked the two first generations of pokemon
Way too many imo
im not mad im just saying
Jim: ^
I personally like the new Pokemon. But Gen 3 is always my favorite.
jeeze bro
649 to be exact
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG currently at 649
05,15Well you can "just say" without being so extreme
Genesect is the last in the national dex list
Got bored of Pokemon after Gold.
Do BBBFF after this!!!
I wonder what they'll make for number 666...
xD dat sat
That's over 4 times the original
WindWhistler: I love Gen 3 too. I can/t for White 2
BBBFF!
Actually I think there were going to be more than 150 to begin with
can't*
WHERE'S MY RUBY/SAPPHIRE REMAKE?!
Ok ok. So I fell asleep .... again. ^_^ Woops.
Gotta Catch Em All........... Before we add more
Well.. that was fun...

But the ones that didnt make it got put in Gold and Silver
Yeah.. I had problems with this song too XD, sudden Rhysthm change in the middle of the song :/

howdy, FairysHuff! :)
05,15There are only 150 pokemon. WHOA WE JUST DISCOVERED A NEW CONTINENT!

05,15Fun Fact, the regions in Pokemon are shaped like the japanese islands

How about Winter Wrap Up?
Arent all the regions except Unnova based off of japanese regions?
05,15except for the Black and White one, that's shaped like NYC

Invi: wow...

Sneaks, I think we get it.
Surf ALL the places!

05,15Yeah pretty much

Invi: from a nuclear radiation mutation
Electrode is the laziest idea for a pokemon ever
Invi: Yes they all become mutated after all the nukes in ww3
yes. yes he is
05,15No, that title goes to the ice cream cone
can we get back on to ponies?
05,15or the trash bags

Oh by the way happy Friday the 13th
Hi everypony
Hi
who is the man on the left?
idk
the other left
that is Sketchy Sounds
hey ^^
even though he's a Scot
This is a very interesting stream
Sketchy is scairly found of dueling banjos... >_>
SOUPS ON EVERYPONY!!!!!!!
what's wrong with dueling banjo's?
/me licks soup off of everypony
dat cover
/me reads that post
....
"A potential Octavia/Rarity duet"
Yay
Such an inefficient way to serve soup.
why doesn't this stream play?
If that doesn't happen now, I'm lighting EQD on fire.
:|
wait...Fluttershy dragon?
what?
WHAT!?
Sounds fine
Trixie and Fluttershy Dragon?!?!
okay that could mean one of a few things
thats why i cant watch it
1: Fluttershy gets her own baby dragon
Fluttershy dragon, but no fluttershy tree? :(
what did you guys think when derpy talked?
2: She get's transformed into a dragon
I have never heard this before
3: I don't know.
pony_9429: it was a great nod to the fandom
Flutterage:[
Trixie has been confirmed for season 3.
and so bronystate goes totoal nuts over three lines :)
Meanwhile: where?
And my rage has been confirmed simultaneously.
Sagas: Waltzing matila is one of the most famous songs ever
derpy_pony: Check the last EQD update.
im also on ponychan & equestria daily:)
You want an ever more uknown one? Be prepared - Gepetto, OST of Hoodwinked
dat Season 3 info, OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... cough
I cant wait till season 3
me nither
Apparently there's a Twilight/Spike duet.
:P
Trixie better be set on fire in that episode.
teasers for S3, still no date
just seen it, Meanwhile. they pander to their fans too much. this never works out well.
:[
Meanwhile: enope, she get's a redemption I bet.
Meanwhile: <.<
otakon: Probably. BUT I CAN DREEEAAAAAM
Ryunosuke: WERE ARE TEH TEASERS!?
Trixie and Diamond Tiara will work together to get revenge against Ponyville.
Meanwhile: yes, yes you can.
WindWhistler: what revenge?
Tbh, trixie isnt ... *BAD* .. big ego maybe, but not bad per se
otakon: Revenge for humiliation.
im at the grad galloping gala, and it's not what i dreamed
season 3 trixie will be heavily flanderized
WindWhistler: at worse, Trixie is cross with Twi. DT has NOT been humilated however
Trixie isn't evil, but she /is/ a huge jerk.
Excuse me, what season 3 teasers?
MadSurge: check out EqD
I could learn to like trixie provided she reigns in the ego
Dat highlight?
hi everypony
SpadeMagnes[R] I think that is why there are fan fics that do just taht.
copy pasta, for the linky
hey fluttershy4960
um hi
cant watch :c
Octavia and Rarity... I think my heart's stopped working...
hello fluttershy4960
No spoils in chat please guys. :P
oh hi
umm
The fuck does the second thing mean?
im very shy.
Lawl, nothing is revealed in the link
inb4 people complain that it isn't Octavia and Vinyl Scratch
So nope.
WindWhistler: Ikr.
Fluttershy dragon, the hell does that mean?
and we aren't spoiling as much as hypothosizing :)
WindWhistler: Tis Rarity, not Vinyl
Dueling Banjos?
i cant even watch it....
welp I got ten minutes left on the library PC
sagas: I know. I'm saying people will complain that it's not an Octavia/Vinyl Scratch duet.
Spoilers: Princess Dari is British.
so, probably gonna go soon
damn, that was a quick hour
I wonder what Octavia sounds like...
WindWhistler: Like hell they better not complain!
00,10best of luck otakon
I'm imagining a regal voice.
thats not a Nittany_Discord, no colors :0
hi otakon
11,01She sounds like a horse.
00,10still say reset the power
Does anyone even know what the hell the second thing in what was revealed means?
umm
Sumica: thanks, if I'm lucky the net will be back by the time I get back to the house I hope
the fluttershy dragon/
Fluttershy dragon, that is the most vauge thing ever
SpadeMagnes[R]: Probably Fluttershy turning into a dragon.
either a) Fluttershy
err
I bet it's exactly what it says on the tin.
[insert TV Tropes link here]
Isnt there allready a fic about that?
Take care, otakon
Fluttershy's pet dragon, or b) a new character for spike to be... with that is fluttershy-ish
what hell are we talking about
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yeah, but it's Twilight instead of Fluttershy
and chat derped
Im pretty sure theres a fic where flutter shy is a dragon
I forget the name though
well that's fantastic
flash crash
I KNOW there's one with Twilight as a dragon.
RAGE over the fact the stream has a cap
fluttershy is not a dragon
is anyone else unable to watch the stream?
turning fluttershy into a dradgon... is possible...
MadSurge: dude, USE THE SITE EMBED
oh
Fluttershy isn't a tree...but now she'll be a dragon.
I bet she'd be the cutest dragon ever.
WindWhistler: what better way to deal with your fear than becoming it eh?
Also the worst dragon ever, since she's shy.
Maybe fluttershy gets her own dragon.
Oh wait, theory three
inb4 she'd look like Crackle
And its about time Two's Company updated
Fluttershy the Dragon Fic: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24071/Family-Secrets%3A-The-Reveal
Fluttershy and Spike SWITCH BODY TYPES!
11,01Spoiler: Sumica is soft.
fluttershy is a halfdragon in fiw
(Or at least one of the better ones that used the concept)
00,10hehe
WindWhistler: and then it will just be Fluttershy trapped somewhere with a dragon and she'll have to win her fear
dragonness is recessive btw
the sandwicvh version iof this song is one of the reasons I watched My little Pony :/
Spike becomes pony(and tries to hit on Rarity) and Shy becomes a dragon of equivalent age.
Ohai Nittany_Discord!
I hate it when they give such vague spoilers that we come up with something awesome, and then the real thing isn't...
00,10so would that meen FiW predicted somthing yet again?
im back everypony :D
11,01Hi MaidSurge.
im a new brony
Dammit, I'm at work...
FiW?
Sumica: maybe, or maybe B Studios took something from FiW.
00,10Friendship is Witchcraft
WindWhistler: Friendship is Witchcraft
otakon: Oh boy, that would be interesting its allready been done in fics...
NFSW? song?
WindWhistler: that's why I don't believe spoilers made by fans :D
Friendship is Witchcraft , a parody series
ah
SpadeMagnes[R]: doesn't suprise me.
Is this about the time I burned your bunny?
Because that was a test

Into the bunny fire you go

Who will hug me now!
Unnr: I can feel it, it's THAT loud.

Panda: no net, I (sadly) get my net from next door. Router is sending out a signal but I can't connect to it.
Sumica: Pretty sure I looked and it had no informaytion on the soundcard
00,10SpadeMagnes[R], one of the talking heads on headline news
I need a driver for it
otakon :/ hm... what are you connected to now?
/me hugs Shizuka "Welp, not gonna be here that often in the future, so WUB!"
Very_Silly_Filly: "sisoft sandra" is a decent hardware diagnosis software
Panda: I'm at the public library
derpy_pony: Okay, I shall have a look
Panda: I can get up to 4 hours of PC time here, I've used 1 already before you came in
http://derpy.me/l5i4P I loves this mash up so much
00,10Very_Silly_Filly, windows should still be able to see it and load basic drivers
Panda: so, probably not gonna be here for the BMN either.
otakon hm.... have you tried rolling back the drivers on your laptop?
And whats BMN? otakon
00,10BMN = Brony Movie night
BuperSrony63: not sure if ban or lol...
11,01BMN is our main event.

God I love Open Your Heart
Anyone else going to do that adventure pony challenge today?

Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like bannana.
otakon hm... plug everything in, cause a grandscale black out and the router next door will be reset ^-^
the stream is getting a bit repetitive
Sumica: I installed a new OS recently, and it was working perfectly beforehand, so I know it's the OS
I still say nothing beats Live and Learn
...what next?
WindWhistler: http://derpiboo.ru/27035
Meanwhile: All fruit throw different to bananas :P
Sumica: no, just won't connect is all. It's happened before for varying amounts of time. Sadly, it might be two weeks till it's back to normal
Becuase bananas are not aerodynamic
Very_Silly_Filly: Looks like you missed the joke.

TheHoodyNinja: no evidence
Spectrum_Rush|Awake: doesnt work with her :/
lock her into the closet first, and then smack her
08,01no locking anyone in a closet
TheHoodyNinja: unless you use a sock full of sweet Florida oranges, then it won't leave a mark :3
Or I'll pull out my gun
and if you successfully do that, I really want to know how you did it
smack the closet and then lock it in her
PonyNegZero: I need Robin powers
08,01thakn you for your consideration
smack the closet
Say, what films are we watching tommorow?

Very_Silly_Filly: the same that we're watching tonight.

Meanwhile: I don't know either
But I meant tommorow because British

first star gate series, Very_Silly_Filly
Has anyone been following the Shafilea trial in the UK?
This show is Stargate: SG-1 as opposed to Stargate, the movie, or Stargate: Atlantis

FairysHuff: No. What's it about?
Is bronystate having problems sending the newsletter again?

IshBestPony: yes, using last weeks again

08,01Sumica: shush you, stargate universe was AMAZING

FairysHuff: Yeah heard about that
otakon IF they are found guilty
I'll try to be here for the lottery today, but I haz a lot of homework today
FairysHuff: if? IF?
otakon: Yes, Id.
FairysHuff: sounds like they ADMITTED to it.

00,10yeah it was amzing howmany othere shows they riped off
otakon Yes. IF
otakon: I mean, If. :D
I'm introducing a new law in this world, anyone caught committing suicide will be sentenced to death!
gasp Tripod?
I had completely forgotten about SGU
...yeah, that was terrible
O_O ??? Stargate??? I left for a min, come back and here we go SG1 O_o
otakon No, the parents are both pleading not guilty
Very_Silly_Filly: and thus you have proven your nick well.
Ohey GilDash! :$
08,01Sumica: well, they pretty much only ripped off BSG
08,01and Lost
FairysHuff: well, I really hope they didn't do it then. That is just...dear God.
BSG was good :)
lion king moment
08,01BSG was AMAMAMAMAMAZIZIZIZIZINGINGINGING
otakon if you're not here, who is Bjornfot going to molest. Won't you please think of Bjornfot.
BSG was *very* good.
Okay, wahetever, the point is, I liked it
otakon The evidence so far is stacked strongly against them.
I want to buy the Blu-ray set when I have a blu-ray player. :D
/me has a sudden urge to watch Farscape
Oh yeah finally made an OC http://imgur.com/6pjib
uh oh
And hi Very_Silly_Filly!
worlds where everyone is happy are always cruel, static police states
LOL.
I used to have a PS3 to play Blurays, but it got robbed by some theiving bastards 4 years ago
Ahaha, I remember Farscape and it's crazy swear words.
IshBestPony: dude, I got no say in the matter. My neighbors router is not working right, it needs a hard reset.
lol.
BSG has silly swear words
fracking
yeah I would NOT eat the food there
om nom nom
looks like pizza tbh
No! I need to watch more Farscape now too. :(
poptarts
what am i watching (just joined
Holy carp
not suspicious at ALL
SG-1
00,10Farscape was awsome. Shame it never got a proper ending.
mcgyver
Man, Farscape how did that end anyway? good I hope.
otakon your neighbor's. So you're a leecher and don't legally use your wi-fi. For shame.
GilDash Farscape ftw
Sumica: eeyup
Lol :D
TheHoodyNinja: Nice OC. What are you going to name him?
lol
Agreed
lol
Lotus Machine ep?
Sumica: Still, better than (yes, you know it's coming) ME3
otakon: indeed, looks like pizza
ME3 was good
it probably is a pizza
fluttershy yays are back!
Soooooo who like Warhammer 40k? :)
IshBestPony: I KNOW DAMMIT. But dammit everyone else going up to town HAS net goddammit except my mom. which makes NO sense.
ME3 ending I meant
Single player
ohh right
lol good gould
everything is evil there. the bgm never lies
Very_Silly_Filly: the EC improved it greatly
jiggle jiggle jiggle
But anyway for those of you who haven't been following the Shafilea trial you may want to google it. Its quite controversial and could potentially change the law in the UK depending which way it goes.
AttacktheAndalite: damnit i just made him and i had to use the hubs creator and idk yet and im freaking out D:
so, Lotus Eaters much?
Soul: that means Sumica is streaming :D
i sold the game lol
they are cannibals
oh ya lotus eaters
Something is really wrong in this place.
lotus eaters?
I want a Lotus
FairysHuff sorry but how would it change the law
What's a lotus eater?
i know, its so awesome
They look cool
IshBestPony: besides, no net means no ponies... and without that I'd be depressed. I mean seriously so.
I assume they eat lotus?
TheHoodyNinja: There's nothing wrong with that. It's a good start for if you want someone to draw your OC for you, or if you want to draw it yourself
Meanwhile: yes, their sense of fashion :D
Lotus eaters are ppl that ate plants that drugged them into thinking this is paradise
sexy dance
FairysHuff: I'm all for diversity, but I don't want that shiara law stuff here. :S
derpy_pony: old greek myeth, ook it up
