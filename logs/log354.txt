It does for minecraft. I never watch playthroughs so it just feels wierd watching.
*closes porn*

xD
Haha!
Yeah mine StickySyrup

A video looks like its there... but its black screen
Never close MLP videos. They make the world go round :D
^^^
*reopens mlp*
how did the world function before mlp?
it didnt
^indeed
So, Uh, How about if you dig a hole so you can, you know, Fall in it...?
last logged into runescape 83 days ago aparently
They had to deal with gen 3. *Cringes*
oh, so it was all one big illusion.

the world didnt start until mlp
SB: put on the mine little pony mod!
I logged onto runescape about a week ago, everything has changed and i didnt like it O_o
The mod has been updated...
Loved that game back in 2005-2006 xD
Oh, I see you have a hole.
It used to be my life
A hole you can fall in.
Then i started World of warcraft
now ponies have taken over.
So... Watch out
Then I quit that on cata so now im addicted to ponies and xbox
Ah, Pfff.
Same, ColgateSparkle :P
It's one thing or another, Isn't it. -_-
First, I was addicted to The Sims.
ColgateSparkle: Ponies, xbox!!!! FTW
Then, I don't know what.
Sb stop breaking all the stuff :D
COD Bronies are the best! No doubt about it!
Any video game in 2003 to 2006 when I got my 360?
After that, Xbox...
Halo bronies aree the best!
Until May last year when I got my driving learner's permit.
^
At that point Xbox felt like a waste of my life.
Lol my black ops emblem is Vinyl Scratch :)
Sorry.
thats so epic! xD
then I got depressed in July because I couldn't stop playing games even if I wanted to...
"Must stop playing minecraft..... BUT CAN'T"
And then

StickySyrup: we totally need to make sure we meet up at the next one

Gumri, google 'ukofequestria'

oh yeah but what then
I can't send the link because I'm at school and the page is blocked
That's why I brought my own net stick.

http://ukofequestria.co.uk/members/pinkamena-diane-pie.12/ this guy makes and sells them
Why are you on bronystate at school :D
Also, ScootaChicken, use a proxy.
Gumri, because I'm a baws
I'm also at school right now, but it's not like we're learning anything.
Kammerjunk: been there, done that, but it takes effort I can't be arsed
if u message him, im sure he will sell em to u
pfft, learning
ok then
ScootaChicken: I took a day off... got a bad case of 'skiveitus'
the guy running the ukofequestria site is a pretty good friend of mine
hence why I was at the very front
Our teacher is playing games on FaceBook.
lol
ScootaChicken: we met at the meet as well.. nice guy
dohoho
What kind of school are you at :D
I'm doing homework
and by that I mean procrastinating until it's far too late
Well, I'm off school now.

Dken2021: Oatmeal, are you crazy?

I'm his younger sister
nice to meet you ^_^
interesing
I'll prove it one day when he is home from college on stream c: I'll get him to let me draw. lol
Nice to meet you too ScootaChicken c:
DoctorTimeyWimey: SB's already showed me some of your drawings :3
Do you draw? :3
So yell if he comes on before 8am Pacific time tell him to go to bed c:
really? c:
I am trying to upload more to my DA account but I need a scanner :c
Oka I need sleep. Goodnight people. I'll probably come on later today. Night/Morning all c:
Cya later
Should i go to a meetup in April or should i just go to the Bronycon?
in the same month
why not both?
i could...
Gumri, there's a meetup at MCM
I like in the UK
Gumri, MCM is in the UK
live*
oh
well wtf is MCM
Gumri, a sort of gaming/anime/cosplay/other stuff expo kind of thing
oh
the last one was in October, there was a brony meetup there
You see here is the problem: I am 16 and still living at home. My mum does not understand my bronyness and then i tell her i want to go to a con for a couple of days...
She will be wierded out.
It's a tough situation.
have any friends that can accompany you?
nooooooo
Gumri, its only one day, you can just say you're meeting a bunch of your friends
thats what I did last time
and plus, its technically true....
Ah but the con is overnight.
Confound these ponies, They drive me to avoid sleep...
and I am helping sort out the con so i really want to be there.
Actually, I exaggerate... If I went to bed 10 hours ago I would have slept.
I need an excuse of some description.
yup it is
no we are starting a small one in Manchester.
:O
Gumri - the more you try to hide it, the worse off it will be when your parents find out
Gumri, link nao
I need to be there
/me was just assaulted by two friends of my brother
No site yet but i'll tell you when there is one.
you'll be better off in the long run talking to your parents and finding out what their concerns are
You think
yes
if you try to lie to your parents and they find out, you'll have hell to pay
I can tell my pals but my parents is another thing alltogether.
aagh!
do your parents know you're a brony or do you just think they won't understand if you come out of the stable?
Gumri, why don't you say you have a sleepover or something?
You could always move out
im 16 Jim :D
he's 16 btw
I know people who moved out when they were 16 :P
and those people were probably prepairing for it since they were 14
or just say you're going on a road trip or something, no need to mention your bronyness
Well they know i enjoy MLP but they do not approve. I ordered aa Derpy shirt yesterdat.
oh
Ooh, which derpy shirt, may I see?
right, so talk to your parents and find out exactly WHY they don't approve
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=1627
then do your best to allay those concerns
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?" The poster bearer cried.
lali-ho Kammerjunk
"Listen son," said the man with the gun, "There's room for you outside."
oo, that's an awesome shirt
But they don't approve already. When i tell them im going to bronycon... good lord.
Gumri: Celestia bless you that fateful day.
DON'T tell them you're going to bronycon yet
for that matter, don't get your hopes up that you'll be able to go
You should show them Ballad of a Brony first.
yeah...
if you can't get them to at least respect that you enjoy MLP, you'll never make any progress
Kammerjunk: so I herd u liek Pink Floyd?
step 1 is to make them accept that you like it and respect that decision
step 2 doesn't happen at all (possibly ever) if that doesn't happen
or i could be going to a friends sleepover... I could go by train!
ScootaChicken: I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
just like I said Gumri...
no, I think ScootaChicken's right on this one
Gumri: When I went to my first meetup, my parents didn't know I was a brony.
and again... lying to your parents will cause more hell than you know
I know... it's not a good idea but i think it's the only idea.
I just told them I was meeting some online friends in Odense.
Secrets and lies, these ponies are nothing but secrets and lies.
Keep in mind that Odense is a completely different island here in denmark.
I could say it is a con but not what specificaly!
hey everypony
aha!
ohai emangamer
Hey emangamer
lali-ho emangamer
Avê, emangamer.
thought I'd stop in before class :)
I thought I'd stop by in class, but then class ended.
I am shaking just thinking about this. Celestia watch over me.

/me brohoofs Gumri
That's the spirit
/me brohoof
That's what I had going through my mind when I told my parents. They still think I'm a little weird, though.
When's BronyCon?
Then again, they just generally do that.
Good morning everypony :3

Good Morning indeed.
ohai PinkiePie101

I should have done that but now I feel like going through the day without sleep.
You know who else liked sleeping? Hitler.
Gumri: You know who don't sleep? Celestia.
Or maybe she does.
I don't know, really.
who know's
Gumri: you know what, fluttershy` is going to bronycon
BUT
You know who doesn't sleep?

he lurks here
every day
ScootaChicken: no, GODDAMMITDARIBOT doesn't sleep, Dari does however
he's here eight days a week
nope emangamer, I would know

ScootaChicken: O.o o///o

Berry_From_Mars: Remind her you are a brony!
ScootaChicken: what?
SHe knows.
Well.

ScootaChicken: You're an egghead!
Sort-of...
Remind her.
I never told her much about the fandom.
um,mlp is on on the hub and their not puttin it on?WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!
She knows I like the show though, I've seen every episode with her.
Berry_From_Mars: Show her Ballad of a Brony!
oh
No, you don't want to do that :D
sonicrainboomer259 - if you're referring to our streamers...
Never mind, then.
1) no one is on with access to the stream
Ballard of the brony is an hour long Kammerjunk :D
2) we don't play MLP episodes that air on a day-to-day basis
lol
Gumri: That's irrelevant!
show paleo's thing instead.
Don't we play the MLP episodes at 10 AM saturdays or something?
i know,im messin around
yeah 10am pacific
It's saturdays, yes
Gumri - EST
oh
I've told my Mom about a little bit of the fandom...
Well..
lol
I'm in the EST ._.
eastern time
That was mostly just telling her about the Fandom's interpretations of some background characters.
It's on 4 pm saturday for me ^^
Why would you tell her about the fandom!
I've shown my grandmother some of the drawfriends, she's impressed
That is silly!
YAY I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL!!!!!!
Ehehe, She knows about Berry Punch...
And Lyra...
/me facehoof
fannon berry punch?
Yes.
lol
Why shouldn't she be told about the fanhood?
lol indeed
I told her that Berry is the fandom's alcoholic.
Just show her cupcakes and all the .MOV things :D
And she's seen my current desktop background...
omg
Oh me oh my..
Oh my god.
Do NOT go there
please no
DO EET!
oh,boy
She would NOT like those .mov files.
AT ALL.
You'll get kicked for talking about that stuff
Trudat.
Mods are asleep, post ponies

mods are asleep post .MOV
she won't like MOV'S!:O
Mods are asleep, post humans.
I think oly for the recent one, apple.mov ok, not sure about the other two
Post humanized ponies.
show SHED.MOV
i think we're allowed to talk about apple.mov and dress.mov
I do not care for the latest MOVS
Dress.mov is still acceptable...
I haven't seen Shed.mov.
Yet.
inb4 GLASS.MOV
i only care for APPLE.MOV
I don't care for any of the .MOV's.
oh god they are horrible though
My Mom has seen it.
what's that? post human ponies? will do: http://fav.me/d3dhn1k
APPLE.MOV is still my favorite
Well, That drawing is well done.
I like the other .MOV's too though

Dken2021: I approve this picture.

Do you know what's funny? Nearally everyone i know is now a brony hater... I suck at conversion.

Gumri: I kind of drive them in with stuff they'd like otherwise.
To begin with.

In which Barney got a dog that he tried to train to catch a criminal.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=A7q2Ta9T778
Aw man, I'm enjoying this cover of the Zombies song "She's Not There"...
Now I want to buy Zombies music and Yardbirds music...
thats probably why u were kicked,u used a youtube
link
i like linking though
Everyone who believes in telekinesis , raise my hand
TrixieMuffin: It doesn't matter. Anypony with a Trixie related name are forgiven for everything in my books.
you can only use image links
really? oh ok
Back
Hello moop
hi
That only applies when a stream is going on.
I really like this star trek online game.
lol good example
Else, you can link YouTube.
hold on,brb
O U Jim
The moment when you realise your best friend is a brony hateing jock.
checked rules if u like linking,gotta get permission from mods
Yes, but another rule is no caps, which isn't mentioned on the rule page either.
it's ok, don't think any are on atm
All I ever get told by mods is that video links aren't allowed during streams.
thiss is only on movie night or ponyday though
i believe
plus there's no stream atm so go
and it said no video or outside links6_9
During stream, yes, because it's considered impolite to the streamer
you are allowed pics.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=krOQzrVCNSE
well since there's no activity atm, there's nothing wrong with linking a video
I can see that actually: "This streamer is boring, youtube is better"
see ya,gonna play lord of the rings
uuugh
lord of the rings
moop: LOL. I love that video
also, still need to walk dog
me too
oh god it loops
Gumri: Well, I do that anyway, but that's because I don't like things such as Final Fantasy or Mario games.
lololol
But I see your point.
omg ezio pony
Oh sheesh, my facebook got spammed
PinkiePie101: All the "When I'm..." videos do that as far as I know.
Oh wow
parasprite pony:D
Anypony play Star Trek online here?

Star Wars is full of Sith Lords with an attitude.
Well...
Star Trek is awesome
9:21 Am.
Same here.
I wouldn't know, I'm afraid of getting into it.
I've literally been in the chat room for six hours.

Liking star trek more than MLP? :D
moop: We never met AJ's parents either.

Derpy cant be in again because of copyright

Why do you think
ERP is bad and you should feel bad.
Berry_From_Mars: lol
ERP?
Oh, JOY...
Sorry it took so long. Blame my shitty internet connection.
TheBronyShotz: Err... You should probably look it up on Urban Dictionary.
I signed out of my Youtube account to see if that Reverend Horton Heat song popped up right below the "When I'm Drunk" Berry Punch video when one searches for "When I'm Drunk"... And it does!
Nah
Whee!
Back to homework :(
Berry_From_Mars: I wouldn't count on it.

Whyy do people hate bronies:'(?
Why do ponies hate brobbits?
They don't understand, therefore they choose to hate
Why do 13 year olds seemingly hate everything...?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9N6cZ-fjcI&feature=related
im 13 i like EVERYTHING
because they are in middle school and it's cool to hate
apart from all the bullies that bully me
probably cus im uncool
TheDerpyShotz: all bronies are cool :D
Hey, you like ponies, you're cool to us.

RD has a petface
if anyone hasn't noticed, the derpy thing is like eggman/robotnik and griffith/drummond all in one
^
/me comes in.
but derpy was our derpy:'(
Hello everybody...
You're going to be so disapointed in me...
Hi Ictiv
why?
Well... I was continuing my catch up with Doctor Who
Ictiv what did you do you naughty colt!?
I reached Season 5, aka the first season of Matt Smith
Doctor Whooves*
people complaining about the voice and name, it's stupid really
and well...
You didnt fall in love with Matt did you? :o
I kind of like Matt Smith
I've just noticed that Daring do has RD's hairstyle, but greyscaled
thats ok Ictiv
Rain: :|
to each their own ^_^
Daring Do's pretty much a recolor of dash
No I mean seriously. If copying Tennant was the goal then he failed miserably, yes
She /is/ a recolor of dash
but every single doctor failed at copying the previous
Did you even SEE what he was like in the first incarnation?
Ictiv we honestly dont care if you do or do not like Matt silly. To each their own ^_^
I know.
I kinda like Matt too. Mostly because I just like Doctor Who and dont really care who is acting. :p
But I'm upset that people call him a bad actor
First doc was DR4ADFUL
He's doing a great job, just not Tennant's way
His script is crap, that's all the problem is.
Ictiv it is oppinion. Dot get upset about people with differing ones please. ^_^
Fazana: Try watching episode 1 of Season 4
Favorite doctor?
Rain: I'm not upset about their opinion. I'm upset that they tried to make me NOT watch season 5
I never even tried to bother with the earlier doctors
He's not that bad
in all honesty, the only thing that I dont like about Matt is his face :p
The earliest I know by heart is Tom Baker.
Fazana: Do your self a favour: Bother with them
Espicially 4th
^
Especially*
Tennant is best Doctor
Tennant is fucking awesome
but the other docs do good too
Yeah Tennant is awesome... But he doesn't have *single teardrop* The scarf
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL837883F65F45179A&v=Jkmy0bq9jk0
6) Waiting for the next installment of *book series*
if you try to compair the docs to the best doc then of course you will think they are bad. I just watch the show with a smile on ^_^
Rain thats not a smiley face :P
7) Sleep deprived like me
yes it is. ^_^
the mouth is not curved
Cypresswolf: are you posting that to the right channel?
:)
moop: the curved version of that looks wierd. Also, I smile without curving my mouth irl
Rain: There is no Best Doc actually. There is "Most Bad Ass Doc" "Wisest Doc" "Scarfiest Doc" " 'So then, who wanna jump into a black hole with me'--iest Doc" etc
you can smile without using your mouth if you are good enough at conveying emotion ^_^
i cant smile unless im watching FiM
yes...I posted earlier (12 minutes) I was thinking up ways Screw Loose went crazy :)
ah ok then Cypresswolf
I'll stop if its considered spamming
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=bmxyd6co6Qw
Cypresswolf: 8) She had a conversation with me.
Curiously enough 8 is also my lucky number
Ictiv that is true. But the best doc is the doc that can get the closest to as many of the catagories as possible
and I just got in on time
First 5 incase you missed them...
Jump in the line. Rock your body on time. Ok I believe you.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zdAGVp7K-H4
:p
Rain: That may lead to a Mary Sue at times

@Coolmeter Yellowquiet
6 Yellowquiet is 56% Cool. (1016)
Look at the first Doctor for example. If you took his acting and put it next to Tennant you wouldn't know they are the same character
I'm sorry, but have you seen his pathetic delivery of lines.
i rule
20% cooler than 90%?
He manages to make what should have been funny lines either annoying or just pathetic.
That's 110%
He can't have any serious situations either.
Im going to take a nap and then study some more...its going to be an all nighter tonight :|
If it's supposed to be serious, he's still trying to play it as though he's some cartoony 'derp derp I'm so funny' character.
Without yelling that is
Sweet Dreams Cypresswolf
Good night Cypress
And as I've said before, I saw an episode of the series he was in, because it was rumoured the next Doctor was in it.
/me explodes due to madness. (And no, it's not sparta.)
That's Tennant teritory
I didn't even think for a second it would be him, because his acting was vastly outshone by this black actor in the show, who wasn't even the main character. I thought he would be the next Doctor.
Smith didn't stand out at all, I barely even noticed he was there.
hmmm, wouldn't mind a black doctor
A single one?
I thought FOR SURE they must have gone with the vastly superior actor.
You call him a bad actor over ONE episode?
No of the new series.
Not*
Of Doctor Who

Of a different show Matt Smith was in
Before Doctor Who
ah
FUCK! i just watched the animated version of cupcakes!
I've seen 2 whole series of Matt Smith.
That's why I hate him with such vigour.
moop you are mad
i can never watch that
i am sad
never talk about
it
/me revives himself
And Doctor Who always has both comical and serious moments.
That's nothing to do with Tennant.
don't be sad, there are ponies to cheer you up
huh? What happened? :o
But Smith can't pull off either.
IMO
well its not as bad as that time i came across BestGore.com

for the sake of celestia
09,01brb
"But for god's sake do NOT go around saying he's the worst thing in history"
I'm saying that you shouldn't out right say "don't watch Matt Smith"
I can say that if I want.
I missed out the word "please"
It's what I believe.
let's just say opinions are opinions
back
k
what happend moop
Some of the writing for his episodes are just terrible too, worse than pretty much any of the previous new who series.
my grandmother would like to watch a movie, but she be rather happy if it starred a black person, just her opinion
The new angels episode? Fucking ruined them entirely
One of the best villains from Who, and they were just ruined.
Then suddenly the sonic screwdriver acting as a laser with no explanation?
Bullshit
....6_9
they broke the "if it moves the plot" rule?
I really couldn't care less tbh
I have a question for you all.
Yes?
Do you like My Little Pony?
hahaha
do we?
YES YES YES YES YES :D
what a stupid question
My Little Pony? Eugh, gay. :P
You do?
Pfft, your all little girls.
Discord: Eeyup.
you meen fim ?
Now My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic.
THAT'S awesome.
But My Little Pony?
We meant that.
^ you've been trolled
Pffftchchc...
XD
Discord snaps fingers and makes it never existant in 5...4...3...
lol
We meant FIM....
._.
No otherwise I would've said FiM.

Okay then
u are mad
Discord: Did you watch it?
Yes.
Okay then
Was just Troll testing
:3
Congratulations: YoU're not a full troll
It was... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWKuBC3Tb3I
why are trolls called trolls?
because internets?
moop: Becasue they are stupid and presistent and go on for ever talking over things that aren't worth talking about
Internets name them trolls
like in The Hobbit

Also because we're really hoping they will turn to stone one day
but arn't trolls just little creepy dolls?
Maybe... :D
wrong trolls there dear
moop: I think you mean Goblins
or even hobgoblins
perhaps Gremlins
like in troll2?
God save you if you see a gremlin

moop: Know what?
Thanks for this DCD :O
I know a great many things
Ah two reasons:
1) You are one of the Incarnations of Doctor Who, so anything being crazy is a given
2) I know how Beer saved the World

I tried to make up a quarter report of my life like Moop
that sounds... japanese ^-^''
pizza is a king
apperently I spen 1/4 of my life sleeping, 1/2 on the computer, 1/4 writing, 1/4 watching sereis, and 1/4 on this Chat while also spending a nice 4/4 being completely insane
that adds up to 10quarters
hmm it fits
Well, of course, you could be doing those things at the same time
^
Naturally I'm doing Insane all day long so okay, 6/4
then, I'm doing writing, watching sereis and being on chat in 1/2
while beign on computer
Interestingly, I actually do all that three at the same time so technically it is 1/4
What am I doing in 1/2 of my life?
I have no idea!

ok
Hey everypony, what's on?
umm....wtf is this crap
I have been voteing for Monty Python and the holy grail for months.
ohai Fazana
09,01it's GaoGaiGar. It's made of COURAGE and GUTS.

oh my god its voltron
make that really really really really really really really really really [5 years later] really really really really patient
Srs bns bro
PartyCannon! I have been looking for you! did you upload the speed racer poop!?
what would holy grail count as, coz i might change that to my B movie choice
this is actually sad
RainbowcrashNBurn I think the last time it was chosen it was an A movie
voltron!
would life of brian be the same?
>voltron
fuck you :V
so would foreign films count as b movies
probably
alexxm yesh
ok
the robot looks like voltron
Life of brian isn't as funny in my opinion.
no it doesn't
09,01well in all seriousness Brave, Gai and Golion Team were BROES in SRW

Yellowquiet: your math question from earlier... AB = 130 and AC = 122.4
09,01SUDDENLy.

And then they died, the end
Secret butt fun...

Oh shaddap
09,01Mamoru is related to Rarity?
WAHA
Is he a marshmellow too?
is it over, i'm bored
why are they telling this to a bunch of kids
Yellowquiet: The difference between AB and AC is 7.6, and since AC is smaller, 2(AB) must equal 260, therefore AB = 130. 252.4-130 = AC = 122.4
no problem ^_^

Shed.mov is horrible and we shall not speakest of that monstrosity here.
Most of the .mov ones are Jim.
what about apples.mov?
Queen_Rarity, get your sanity out of here
Queen_Rarity: rascist
Shed.mov is like...up...baked bads
uh*
Queen_Rarity - most people enjoy this. So do I, for that matter.
KernelCobb: we aren't allowed to mention that here
05,15Nothing wrong with watching anime
I enjoy it, but others...
I made chili
There're also things streamed that I don't enjoy. And that's no problem. If they'd only stream things I enjoyed, it'd be boring pretty goddamn soon.
You can't watch ponies then say anime is bad fo ryou
as long as no cupcakes... that made my soul sick
and i'm back
Normal people don't go to Bronystate Queen_Rarity
it's what's for Dinner!
Queen_Rarity - it's not a matter of enjoyment or not, it's a matter of this chat being PG-13
Isn't MLP FIM anime
had to go pray at the shrine to talos
?
in other words, no Gore
phai Phase4
Well Queen_Rarity, you appear to be the only one speaking out against this anime.
eww you could see the babies thing!!
So... what's the point?
no*
I think FiM is classified as a cartoon..
LOL
so is this the same show? looks different
Jim - it is...
what?

09,01not so cryptic once you consider they called the Zonder Metal a "pathogen"

A vaccine for space? Well, I don't know. Ask John Madden.
@pokemon
0 Queen_Rarity is a/an 9 Azelf
MahBoi777: no, its a vaccine, its to PREVENT space from becoming sick
but it isn't the same
08,01i'm not sure
09,01anime = short for "animation", in a Japanese context, so in that sense, no
Phase4: ooohhhhh, so space is alright?
08,01i've been getting panic attacks waves of "bleh" feeling
It's not really working with my mIRC client. :p
Hello everyone

Just out of random curiosity, how long has this site been around?
Mmm~ Loving this music I found~
i get a me gusta face when ever i hear the house theme :)\
The who is good
hm...
I don't listen to classic rock that much
I do have one album by The Who, I haven't opened up to it very well though.
Hmm...
Hella crazy
<3
My dad has all of their albums
The Who are one of my favourite bands of all time
I think since last may or something
spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
I heard a cover of The Zombies' "She's Not There" And that got me interested in them.
they're probably the best live band ever
Queen is a great band
a long time
Touche
QUEEN IS
As for The yardbirds, I think Andy Partridge liked them so I'll check them out.
well i got to go do some mah chem work back in a bit guys
*pokes back anyway
Freddy Mercury... you will be missed
The Who's live performances were legendary for breaking world records in loudness
Freddie Mercury was best tenor
09,01dat tear teeming with G-ENERGY

Booo!
/me hgs ScootaChicken
Hey emangamer!
hello!!
09,01: / can you point me in the right direction?
Internet is dead, using irc
How you doin'?
wat?
if your internet is dead then how are you on this site
but the topic was 'what would election posters look like if the voters were all 10 year olds' or something along the lines of that
DCD isn't 10 silly
ScootaChicken: I saw those
they're amazing
candy will be everywhere
eman, you show us
Pinkie Pie approves of candy
Moonlight: no idea, dad does something to the router that means I can't access the internet after 9:30 but for some reason IRC still works
ScootaChicken: cracked right?
yes emangamer
:D
o ok
/me hugs emangamer
Wub wub
/me hugs emangamer back
Oh no, He was swallowed up by the bottom of the screen!

/me hugs LunaTheBeloved and ScootaChicken
I'm confused by this anime
For some reason
I don't know either
epic music is epic
ScootaChicken:
Scoota: Figure out the router's password, then send an http request to it using FF and look through the filters and such. :p
ScootaChicken: here it is : http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_33_what-campaign-ads-would-look-like-if-voting-age-was-6_p23/
Yes? I keep hearing pings.
ScootaChicken Time for bed bro :3
for all of you who care
CK|CatnapIsBestNap: figuring out the routers password is a bit like accomplishing the 12 tasks of Hercules in one day
it won't work.

Pegasister16: ping! :P

09,01because that contest was in 2008
/me hugs Pegasister16
GabeMoist: who?
huh.
09,01and Kamen Rider DCD aired in Mid-2009
Don't worry! I'll be back around 8 or so! hugs LunaTheBeloved
the plot thickens.
