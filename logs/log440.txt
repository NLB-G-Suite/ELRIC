Seriously, people drink just to get drunk

11,01Dammit, he had his period in the pool.
Back
Wb~
XD
hey guys
ewwwwww
:D
that wasnt a period, that was an exclamation point
Acleps, it's an artistic movie, they make sense any way you want
at the moment he's little, his father died in ww2.
Acleps: He is suffering PTSD that is pretty much it -lol-
14also wut
11,01In this movie.
think of it as a compilation of music videos.
11,01Sick, isn't it?
Religious nutjobs is why.
hey guys
lol
Dis Brick in the Wall Part 1
11,01Also, epic song.
brick in the wall
:) this song!
It's too anti-Christian
this movie is a sorta biography for one of the oringinal band members that went crazy
It's not anti-Christian. It's anti-dogma.
11,01Kandarihu: I know.
Evening everypony
whee
I'm %100 antireligion
Souds like the first notes for Proper Education
PONY: I really don't like artistic movies... They make alot of them at my school, and I always suffer while watching them
on logmein
HEY! TEACHER, LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE.
This movie is like a music stream :3
hey guys
its a album that tells a story
11,01I'm pretty tolerant of most things.
^
Check
Kid_Cobaly (\
Another Brick in this movie;)
and now you can do colors with 
lol iPhone
heh
Hehehe
lol
any pastafarians in here?
Not with Slurry here you can't
It's a very positive anti-religious movie. A RARITY among this sort of thing.
xD
11,01It's a personal thing.
I loved those spinny-things when I was young :D
This movie needs moar desktop ponies.
mfw dari is still SP.
11,01There are things I don't like.
how is this movie anti religious?
It jumps between his childhood and adulthood
this movie isn't anti-religious at all
11,01Well, most things then PONY.
03because they're complete idiots?
:D
oh
14lol
actually, anti-dogma is the best work for it.
Hi everypony
Even my chemistry teacher did
and she's like
08,01i believe in Turing Machines
it does anoy me however that people pretend that religion is above criticism and being made fun of
In a teasing way, we're kinda like that
There are things I want to believe more than anything, but are starting to look more and more absurd.
Why admire something someone did deary? Really
08,01i believe that thye exist, and i believe that they model any algorithmic computation
y
bronyism is best religon
so....what's this film about?
14my geography teacher is one of the best people I've ever met
11,01PONY: Well, I don't endorse the website.
14but he's a very religious Apple fanboy
03http://soundcloud.com/drfsupercenter/burning-up
14:(
08,01in other words, the only church i'm a member of *sunglasses* is the Church-Turing Thesis
dat Religion argument
when the tigers broke free
And then he looked at his moms knickers
08,01YEEEEAAAAAAH
why are we talking about religion while watching 'the wall'?
Saturn...... no.
I has soundcloud too
Woah
lol.
fits*
But only one remix i did was uploaded
03yeah
11,01Fun fact: This movie was created years after the album.
03stupid copyrights
03I just tried to upload two of my edits, immediately blocked
11,01Album of the same name.
where can i buy them?
the wall is mostly anti-war anti-government and pro-not isolating yourself. very little religion talk
Apple didn't invent, but they definitely had a large influence on the sales
BANG!
Yeah...
shells here
dem magnum rounds
I have absolutely no clue what's going on... :D
interesting discussion
11,01Son, get dressed. We've got a war to go to.
Even though the one i uploaded wasnt vgm
Since people assume all MP3s are called iPods
14I still can't understand though
03because >RDF
this is gonna be an ant-war movie isnt it?
the main characters father dies at anzio. He feels awful about it.
anti*
based*
because*
11,01Nah. I did trivia once way back.
cat!
kitty
03RDF, that's why.
11,01For Twister.
03:P
dove!
I'm just waiting for a gunshot
OH NO
no pigeon fly away!
03look it up
I hope not
11,01Yay, cartoon.

14but yeah, I tend to not fall into such silly discussions IRL :P
3all of you maybe even
11,01I'm getting up.
Um, you were saying this isn't anti-Christian?
Yeah...

14especially with idiots like the people I have around IRL xD
The power...... OF RELIGION!
3I can't be caught taking favorites >>
3<<
Heheh
lol

dat symbolism
Goodbye, blue skies.
seems legit

It's anti War
its coming up in a second
:'(
PONY: Just to make sure I survive through this movie
religonkills people
lol brits
its more anti-war than anti-religion
yea here we go
Acleps, easily
But this is ridiculoius!
ohhh
that accent could be more forced if they tried
lol
08,01PONY: why do you always talk about religion? aren't there more interesting things to talk about?
poor kid
I once applied for a mod position, but failed. xD
Atheism killed more people than every organized religion combined, though.
PONY: We'll see :)
like ponies!
O hey...theres a train....ITS COMPLETELY SAFE
Uh oh
Interview was scary though
ditto
I see where this is going......
there is a album about anti-war and communication to be discussed
NO!
14lol
DON'T! GO!
I like trains
best part coming up
dat accent
PONY: You? When?
I like trains
I REALLY like trains
lol
SHITE!
That doesn't seem safe :D
DUDE
lol
I'm doing fine :)
IT'S THE HOGWARTS TRAIN

14I liked the old iPods

03scroll wheels are the most retarded thing ever
14the clickwheel system was nice
03no
03it wasn't
WAT
14D:
Wat////
O_o
Placing bullets on the tracks? Yeah that's a brilliant idea.
Haters gonna hate
14I like them :(
PONY: I do, but my memory is shorter than you might think :D
03you'd end up overscrolling
3...
all my wat
Woah....
wut?
Seems legit
here comes one of the most famous parts of this album. the one everyone knows
08,01placing a bullet on the tracks wouldn't do anything
03and you can't seek accurately for s***
11,01BRB.
And here comes the most famous song on the album.
this movie has all of my wut
a larger precentage might have but religions have destroyed civilizations
Acleps, that's a common side effect of being mindfucked
oh volume control
14just calibrate the sensibility? o.o
Epic song.
time to fail
This is oddly accurate.
PONY: Damn... any way of restoring it?
oh...its working...and i think i like it
a secant code???
iPod Nano annoys me
dat Welsh
Sis has one
ALL OF IT
nothing wrong with poems
I had a teacher like this once.
You can't turn it.off completely
03Viri, it still can't seek accurately
03sure you can
Only sleep mode.or whatever
Sigh
03it'll never turn back on
03:P
Wasting battery
I think you can set it to somehow
14LOL

:>
sorry if I misheard that
Nay
03XD
cheap little thing
03Sansas are awesome
Unless you have a replacement
03mine has a large physical BREAK in it
Fun fact: "Spanking" in school was made illegal in Denmark 1969, the same as pornography was made legal to distribute.
kinda...
Cuz then no music at all
03like a CHUNK of plastic missing
03works fine
03:P
Its 4th gen
