08,01so i thought that 6 doubles of absinthe was a perfectly normal thing to drink
PonySwagg: but you're gonna miss THE WALL
Seriously, people drink just to get drunk
03>drinking the whole bottle
They like the feeling
03yeah

08,01Kid_Cobalt: actually, one of my cocktails is called a Tux
Airpuff: These things that I've been enjoying. ;)
Youre abit late
03The song, with Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans helped define the mid-'70s disco trend and hit No. 2 in 1976. <- LOL
/me is suprised....hugs PrincessLuna back
>Nuke world with absorbed love from Trixie

Saw donna and thought Madonna
I was like NOOO
And I'm still tired, need to catch up on the sleep I've been missing.
03XD
hello Dken2021 ^_^
14every time I feel in fault, when a good singer dies and I never listened too much of it
03Madonna is actually legit
So what game is it again?
08,01all that's specified for its ingredients are: black alcohol, white alcohol, contreux
03meh
my keyboard is making fun of me :D
GilDash: ..... =s i dont remember that.. xDDD Alchohol is scary o.o
03most of the time I'm like
PrincessLuna: Saw
08,01*a dash of contreux
PrincessLuna: SAW
Also Sky..someone at my school says Knife Party music is rubbish
Don't fall...
03so another person died. Whoop de doo
O GOD
PonySwagg: If you go to sleep I'll be disappointed. ;)
Don't you dare...
And they like dubstep
dont look down, naow :)
There we go.
08,01also, there's a bomb shot i made called a Kernel Panic
hi Rain
03when Michael Jackson died, I was like "Finally kids can sleep soundly"
I want to drink with you guys, seriously, people around here cant hold their liquor.
GilDash, I think I broke BronyState... Again
Hipster
hello MahBoi777 ^_^
14lol
hai Rain
08,01you need a pint of Duvel, or some other trippel
Airpuff: That's okay, I've got a good memory. ;)
kernel Panic? xD
GilDash: For you? I'd stay up for a week. XD
I think I had at least 5 steins of coke + whiskey with 3 shots each
hello Jim
He says Skrillex is 'real' dubstep
People say Skrillex isn't dubstep eithef
r
Idc
/me hugs Airpuff
so... how are ya PrincessLuna ?
PonySwagg: You might have to. :D
then again, I have a higher body mass, I imagine that contributes.
TV needs more ponies
Pony: What have you done now? -_-
im like theres songs far better than what skrillex can do
GilDash: ...Challenge Accepted. -_-
/me hugs PrincessLuna in return
08,01and the shot glass is a mix of jagermeister, vodka, and contraux
Magical_pablez94: I'm alright, just got home from work :D
03as far as I'm concerned
I'm back.
GilDash, I dunno, I probably was a bad Pony again..
03there IS no such thing as dubstep
all this talk of shots..
Because it's music
who is playing and what is it
Electro dance, dubstep, whateved
Big deal
03it's just nerfy techno
GilDash: so.. yeah not sure what to say... sorry? xDD
my god that looks sexy
Pony: A very naughty pony?
This is Saw, think it's Nittany
Inb4 hyper goes ew dubstep
nice
Is he searching for Pony tapes?
GilDash :'(
He will
to quote myself
Airpuff: Oh no, please, I'd like to go again sometime. :)
I know Sky
Light~
So, PrincessLuna! What do you think of the role you played during the wedding?
oh it is nitt
lol
Pony: Do you need to be punished?
03I'm not a fan of "dubstep", but I still don't see how it's different than regular techno o.o
GilDash: O.o
14hi LL .3
Kid_Cobalt: even liquor sounds like CPU shenanigans.
14*:3
08,01WallDives: it's called a kernel panic because it's smooth until you get to the bomb, and the combination of a trippel and those shots will make you core dump
PonySwagg: Uh....magical? :D
14on a different topic
what game is this?
/me brb
Cypresswolf: Saw
If you say so GilDash ;)
Dubstep is just techno made by austistic kids with down syndrome and aspergers with a keyuboard made of butter and a broken gba
Nice!
14why I love how death metal sounds, but I hate the voice that singers have?
PrincessLuna: jappy to hear this...i had an accident yesterdayso i'm not that nice... lost a tooth while was in da school gym..

GilDash: Especially if they constantly make suggestive comments that I am tempted to play along with.
Airpuff: You're not being literal, are you?
GilDash: ;)
GilDash: You don't confuse Airpuff!
PonySwagg: Oh, you're going to enjoy me sooo much then. ;)
PrincessLuna: He's a big boy, he knows what I mean. :D

I don't think I've seen this movie before

Why do I hear static?
Nittany_Discord, the main stream is too mainstream for me
the order was changed I suppose, Pi is last?
OK BYE GURLS
Bai then PonySwagg =P
GilDash: But that isn't your style? You might end up finding me vapid.
Or do you mean mindfucks? In which case I want to relax today and dont' really want any of that.
there, might get better response time, then again, idk
Bye RDashie
Nittany_Discord: is the static apart of the movie?
More like a shower
Or vacuum?
i've seen the wall a few times. i've listened to the album atleast 800 times
Bizarrely, despite this being one of my favourite albums, I've never seen the movie.

Aspect ratio is screwed up
MaidSurge: You're up!
3ooo
Maids!? These are my peeeeoooplleeee!
I'm a filly and what is this?
3this looks cool
Acleps: i cant see it ;)
Midnight_Fyre: no, it's SUPPOSED to be like that
A movie should grab the audience the moment it starts, Otakon
It's Maid Hour already? O.o
seems legit
Om: I that's what you want, Ommy...
3this is The Wall, yeah?
14never been into Madonna
Airpuff: Damn...

Okay..I'm starting to like using this
Is that artillery?
Yeah
its also a war movie
Alrighty
11,01If the static doesn't go away, I'll turn the volume down.
Ooh, what we watching?
Vordox: It's not even the right time for Europe... :S

BronyJenkins: The Wall
SILLY*
HALT! Hammerzeit
14music was boring for me, until a few years ago
I like those old style lanterns
11,01Because I do hear a background hiss.
14don't ask me why o.o
/me hugs MaidSurge
Awesome.
WW2?
Whee listening to a 18 minute song
GilDash: Whats not the right time? o.o
14now it's like I can't live without it
GilDash: Got a bit of an error in that last sentence.
PrincessLuna: <3 the sound of a lit match
Anzio 43
WW1 probably
SCS13123 *Purr*
ww2
TYou get used to the hiss
this is ww2 at anzio
Ohh
I love the sound of bombs in the morning...it sounds like....victory..
I'm going to bet that this movie will have music from Ponk Floyd.
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka good morning.
Those are soviat rockets.
Not bombs
ive got a 35 minute song
<--- now fight like a man
Om: Sorry, I meant, "If that's what you want, Ommy..."

German Arty
This is The Wall? IO thought it was a Pink Floyd Documentary or something XD
14Iron Maiden :D
/me hugs Shizuka "sleep well?"
Airpuff: Maid hour. Too early...
no, its a movie/album
Nope, it's WW2
14and some Classical
My longest song ive got is 52 minutes
Hey Shizuka!
13not really .-.
dat Webley
yep - planes flying overhead dropping bombs around me would get me to start smoking
afternoon Shizuka!
GilDash: True. The mai wasnt ... yeah enough either.. xD
maid*
Now, go to the ponychat.net drop down menu on the left of the Preferences screen and go to lists
Roger Water's father was killed in Anzio
Yeah, I like this
see ya all later
Silly soundtrack
But those didn't sound like bombs. They sounded like soviet rockets.
Airpuff: That's because it wasn't me. ;)
Magnum >=3
Someone made a 25 minute metroid guitar mix
11,01Maid Hour is starting to get out of hand TBH.
this is sort of like a biography of roger waters...with acid
aww, Im sorry to hear that, Shizu
GilDash: See what you did there...
Nittany_Discord: why do you say that?
Yea but it wasn't a Katyusha rocket launcher...
/me wishes you had waited until Friday or Saturday to play this movie.
After you've done that, go to 'Auto Perform' and add join #bronystate
Called Grant Henry's Flesh Crystal i think
/me kisses GilDash
Nittany_Discord: Aww, I like. :(
and join #bronystateregulasr
Its by PoD
11,01People are pushing the RP too far.
*regulars
blegh
Shizuka: no good sleep last night?
/me smooches Acleps.
And any other channels you use here
Monfang: Just standard artillery, no katyusha :)
Nittany_Discord: ah
Maybe we should just have two Maid Hours. A European Maid Hour and a NA Maid Hour
you've been using the lightirc on the site LTB?
GilDash: I never know what I want.
13nope, stressful dreams
:<
It might have been what it was, but it didn't sound like it, Princess Luna.
/me looks at GilDash with a surprised gaze
/me hugs Shizuka
11,01Kandarihu: That's currently set up.
Nittany_Discord, I expected you to be more familiar with that, L&M
Yeah
its pink
14probably my >10mins favourite song is Ghost Love Score :D
Okay
Nittany_Discord: that's why I'm always a maid lately, too muc RP
03that song's like 9 minutes
Artilery and bombs make a whistling, only the Katyusha made those firework like sounds.
Shizuka: I'm sorry to hear that dear, maybe you should try and catch a nap then?
03LOL
My ears don't like this soind
11,01Well, RP is actually discouraged.
Acleps: it's the movie
Oh
What is he suffering PDS?
Om: Does that mean you're undecided?
yea, kinda a bit limited on it's own
Monfang: I <3 the sound of them
/me winks at Airpuff.
Kid_Cobalt: no idea
14not the concert version :P
Hey Pink
what is this movie about?
14from End of an Era
ortakon: My ears still dissaprove the sounds
Litwick: also, no idea
She needs to say "Housekeeping".
you'll see what this movie is about in a second
Trooper. I couldn't stand the lightirc as soon as they introduced it on the site
Kid_Cobalt: I think you're thinking PTSD
And don't put the forward slash in front of the command like you would normally
As do I, very strong pycological effect.
Seems legit
Nittany_Discord, yeah, and I supposed "Keeping it sane" is also one of the BS mottos
/me starts drooling
brace for it
BRACE
So I'm starting to loose interest again.
BRACE FOR SHOCK!
GilDash: Netrality tends to be purity, in what my limited understanding has concluded.
guys dinner is ready over here. so i gotta go! cul8r!
11,01I don't mind maid RP. I like it.
Don't use the /?

Is this movie supposed to be 4:3?
I'm not sure I really understand what's going on here
dat guitar
PONY: Are you the "Pony" from yesterday?
14xDD
WW2 is going on
otakon: Lots of dying -lol-
Is the world blowing up all over?
?
I mean, when you're putting it on the Auto Perform commands list
brb have to check on my muskrat
That must be it.
Om: Then you obviously need a walk on the wild side to balance your normal day/ :)
03I hate that girl's voice though
03she totally ruins the song
GilDash, L&M Nittany doesn't have anything on me (I hope, otherwise I have lost all the mods)
The main character is a rock star
11,01I turned the sound down to get rid of the background static.
otakon Dken2021 ACS13123 PONY PrincessLuna bye all!
he's 'pink floyd'
14D:
Acleps, yes
Airpuff: I try to hard. Dont laud me.
Cya Magical_pablez94
justin bieber's voice is worse
14but Tarja is <3
Om: Dw ;P
Byye Magical_pablez94
14Viri's voice is worse too
Bye mr Magical_pablez94
/me runs
would you rather JB sing it?
03yeah but maybe for classical music?
PONY: Confusing nick changes are confusing :S
03not ROCK
OH YES
alternately, you can just rightclick the channel and select "join on startup"
ACS13123: mr?
IT'S STARTED
I'm going to go do something else. Maybe I'll finish the Pinkie Pie chapter of my story. I don't know.
So in the box type Join #Bronystate
IN THE FLESH
GET IN
Don't taze me bro
SO YA
PONY: Just make sure it stays that way. I don't think I could lose you too. :'(
The music.. in this movie.. is just... .. yes.
THOUGH YA
MIGHT LIKE TO GO TO THE SHOW?
Yeah.
sorry
Acleps, changed it an hour ago to avoid pings that are not meant for me
magical_pablez94: Yes, cause then its for official ;)
http://dwellingofduels.net/dodarchive/11-08-Recover_Month/01-PrinceOfDarkness-SM-Crystal-DoD.mp3 <-- that 25 minute song
GilDash: Unfrotunetly, that makes sense. Dosen't mean I want to mind you!
Or do what RX-78-SweetieBot just said
Theres no yt vid of it
lolsz???
/me talking to PrincessLuna "good evening, my princess!"
Om: ... But I want to, Ommy... :(
the myoosiiic x.x
So are they supposed to be in a police state now or something?
I didn't know you could do that O_o
XD
I are a silly filly...
Let's do the time wrap- wait wrong movie.
no, this is the main character. he's a rock star
/me 11,01rocks.
GilDash: Why >.>
Heheh
Oh brb
Alright, this being the second song into this, I'm going to say what I think. The video has absolutely nothing to do with anything, its just some kind of a setting for the music. That's it.
Stuka
Nittany_Discord, you don't dislike me, do you? :(
his father fought and died at anzio.
Om: I like the wild side. :)
Stuka dive bombers! <3
PONY: Try changing your nick to "the", you'll get pings only meant for you! </sarcasm>
Mozdoc: And that's a bad thing?
Its a cover of a cover xD
Acleps, well I was "a" for a while :P
'Pink Floyd' is the main character. his father dies at anzio. He grows up to be a rock star. that is the premise of the movie
GilDash: Wild side is good.
11,01PONY: I don't like you worshiping me.
Airpuff: Wild side is best side. :)
AAAAHHH
PONY: It's possible :O? I thought you have to have a longer nick than that :D
the wall has already started. goddammit
GilDash: Indeed :P
It seems as if this movie is going to be awesome! :D
Acleps: Don't go getting any ideas. :D
see?
a: Stop that. :D
the song now should be' The Thin Ice
:3
GilDash: Then there is no reason to try and enrapture me with all that saccharine despotry.
b: Oi... :|
GilDash: What?
11,01Please no one-letter nicks.
Honestly, i'm here mostly for the music
11,01Everyone sploded.
Nittany_Discord, who said Jesus liked being called a son of God either?
http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/47786/10-ways-make-android-better-the-iphone-193447?source=rss_
what the crap is the wall even about?
a and b...
Om: You'd prefer me to just straight up... ask?
xD
Nittany_Discord: Can I worship you? I have a golden idol of you in my living room all set up for it
Yes. Sorry about doing that yesterday
Too bad it's not just a war movie....bitches love war movies
11,01No.
11,01I'm not a god.
:'(
Om: Dat english. Is epic om... sounds smart.. and i dont understand it.. but still awesome *-*
shut up and enjoy the music. I think that...
Nittany_Discord, I didn't say that (today)
Shortest distance between two points is a treight line, thats why wall work so well.
Nittany_Discord: What about Messiah? Would that be okay? :D
the hell did I miss here?
PrincessLuna: it's much better than a simple war movie.
I probably will be surfing around other sites while this playing in the bg;)
otakon: PINK FLOYD.
11,01No.
WATCH THE STREAM.
hiya ScootaBlues aka Neil
Hello everyone. This movie is amazing thx for picking it nittany
OR I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU.
otakon: everyone e-sploded.
MaidSurge: But...but...
Airpuff: I look up words I don't know when I come accrost them.
11,01No problem madnsdestiny
this is an amazing movie and album
And hello everypony, BTW:)
ScootaBlues: dude, relax I'm cooking atm and I have to get up from time to time to check on it
Om Oooo neat
Nittany_Discord, I'm just comparing you to the "Life of Brian"
hiya SirGanjalf
Om: ... But what if you'd say no? :(
/me hugs otakon
I wish I could have the chat's background as the stream, it would make my life A LOT more easier
/me hugs PrincessLuna back
11,01PONY: You should pick that.
^
This movie is weird
RX-78-SweetieBot: A boy called Pinkerton 'Pink' Floyd's father dies in WW2 and grows up to be a Rock Star and then things get really weird.
GilDash: I dunno, what if I do?
Not bad, but weird
its meant to be weird. just wait till the animated parts
PONY: You should pick that. :)
ninja'd you MiadSurge <3
Midnight_Fyre: that is putting it mildly
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGroDrQxTyo <- so apparently Pokémon BW anime is now DDR?
oh

Also, music
Nittany_Discord, my lottery votes go for Ironsky, the Unknown Soldier and Dead snow :P
14meh
I've been voting for this film as B for god knows how long, you have no idea how much I appreciate Nittany_Discord streaming this.
Om: It's easy to take when I'm teasing... It's harder if I ask. :(
Lolwat
Is this movie supposed to make sense yet?
Now I can start voting for Life of Brian
03it sounds like a song from DDR
SumerPan
14I hate the whole "hey look my phone is quad-core, so I'm better than you" trend
you need to be high
I feel like I'm supposed to be high right now
What the fuck sudden blood? Flames?
11,01Dammit, he had his period in the pool.
Back
Wb~
14it's getting worse than the actual "hey I own an iPhone so I'm better than you" one
XD
its a very artistic movie. The main character slowly builds a wall inside of himself because his life sucks.
hey guys
ewwwwww
:D
Acleps: It's making sense for me so far... :S
that wasnt a period, that was an exclamation point
GilDash: I know ;) you arent the only one who can tese you know.
Acleps, it's an artistic movie, they make sense any way you want
at the moment he's little, his father died in ww2.
and he goes insane
I really wish Life of Brian wouldn't be shown on this stream.
Acleps: He is suffering PTSD that is pretty much it -lol-
Nittany_Discord: Apparently men have periods now :D
Midnight_Fyre: That might be helpful:D
14also wut
Kandarihu: Why?
11,01In this movie.
Rain: I see what you did there
think of it as a compilation of music videos.
Om: ... I... Don't know what to say...
11,01Sick, isn't it?
Religious nutjobs is why.
hey guys
lol
Dis Brick in the Wall Part 1
11,01Also, epic song.
brick in the wall
/me now pick Life of Brian for A movie.
:) this song!
TheMaster: He needs to discover ponies
GilDash: Damn, I feel left out
this movie is a sorta biography for one of the oringinal band members that went crazy
This is who pinkie pie would be if she were a guy...british and also a rock star
GilDash: I may not be good at argueing, but I can plan ahead.
11,01Kandarihu: I know.
Evening everypony
whee
I'm %100 antireligion
Oh godesses, this is the only song I know by them (SORRY!) but I love it soo much...
Souds like the first notes for Proper Education
GilDash: There's no telling wether or not Om is teasing you on your teases.. xD
PONY: I really don't like artistic movies... They make alot of them at my school, and I always suffer while watching them
on logmein
HEY! TEACHER, LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE.
Kandarihu:.... Are you fucking kidding me :| It's talking about people who MISUNDERSTAND the bible.
hey Yokupony hows your day been
This movie is like a music stream :3
hey guys
Om: ... I-I need...
Yeah, I really like Chatzilla
RedDawn you mean Syd Barrett
Hey alexxm!
For fuck's sake, I'm an atheist and even I KNOW what the movie's trying to say.
Amen, Nittany_Discord.
Hey Bronystate it's been a while hey alexxm
its a album that tells a story
/me trots away from Om.
alexxm: /)
11,01I'm pretty tolerant of most things.
^
not that bad alexxm, but could have been better
N4X: /)
Nittany_Discord, jsut for the record, I'm not trying to turn you away from your faith, you shouldn't try to convert me either.
Check
Kid_Cobaly (\
Another Brick in this movie;)
and now you can do colors with 
lol iPhone
alexxm :hows your day been?
Kid_Cobalt (\
08,01the combination of rock, and what look slike 40s England is kinda disconcerting
11,01PONY: Believe what you want.
Nittany_Discord: I try to embrace out brony spirit as much as possible. :)
heh
Hehehe
lol
Kid_Cobalt :(\
So many students at school have been getting one lately
any pastafarians in here?
Om: I heard that! :)
failed my provisional test N4X
poor pink.
Not with Slurry here you can't
It's a very positive anti-religious movie. A RARITY among this sort of thing.
David Gilmour is such a good guitarist
xD
11,01I was into tolerance before being a brony.
madnsdestiny: No, but I appreciate your religion. :)
11,01It's a personal thing.
I also hate the atheist stereotype of how we always have a "vendetta against God".
GilDash: Could that be because I typed it?
I loved those spinny-things when I was young :D
This movie needs moar desktop ponies.
mfw dari is still SP.
Nittany_Discord earlier you said wanted me to stop worshipping you :P
11,01There are things I don't like.
well, its the percent sign followed by C then it shows you the numbers for colors
how is this movie anti religious?
It jumps between his childhood and adulthood
14I wonder why
this movie isn't anti-religious at all
ohh sorry to hear that alexxm
11,01Well, most things then PONY.
reddawn: We're talking about Life of brian
Om: ... You are playing me like a violin right now... I'm not sure whether I like it...
03because they're complete idiots?
14I mean, it might be ok if you are some businessman or stuff like that
:D
i was just 3 off passing N4X
oh
14lol
actually, anti-dogma is the best work for it.
GilDash: Puppet masters don't like to be put on strings.
GilDash He most likely is xD
11,01Worshipping internet people and cartoon horses is absurd.
madnsdestiny: Hello fellow FSM believer /)
Hi everypony
well then alexxm : can you redo it?
hiya Evo_Kaer
Hey Evo_Kaer
Believing what one wants to believe, doesn't exactly lend itself to being prepared for the truth.
Even my chemistry teacher did
Hey Evo_Kaer
/me also picks picks Dogma and Red State.
and she's like
yeah N4X
08,01i believe in Turing Machines
Nittany_Discord, nittanydiscord.com is still going to be turned into a cult website.
Om: I'm no puppet master. I haven't got the smarts for that. :D
it does anoy me however that people pretend that religion is above criticism and being made fun of
Now I have a better phone than you
hey Evo_Kaer hows your day been
I don't admire anything online, Or in real life.
wait. I can't pick 3 movies, nevermind.
Om: they don't like people pointing out the strings eiter :D
Midnight_Fyre: Pi?
In a teasing way, we're kinda like that
There are things I want to believe more than anything, but are starting to look more and more absurd.
Why admire something someone did deary? Really
08,01i believe that thye exist, and i believe that they model any algorithmic computation
otakon: Pick of Destiny
MaidSurge: But I like to~
otakon: The pick of destiny :D
alexxm : Then you'll make it next time for sure ^^
So she wasn't purposelt trying to make fun of me
y
bronyism is best religon
Midnight_Fyre: the hell are you on about? It's not anti religous
so....what's this film about?
14my geography teacher is one of the best people I've ever met
Om: it's fun :D
I believe on to my Lords and Science.
11,01PONY: Well, I don't endorse the website.
14but he's a very religious Apple fanboy
alexxm, pretty boring so far, couldn't find any motivation to do something productive
14:(
thanks N4X
08,01in other words, the only church i'm a member of *sunglasses* is the Church-Turing Thesis
dat Religion argument
when the tigers broke free
Nittany_Discord, I know, nobody does.
And then he looked at his moms knickers
08,01YEEEEAAAAAAH
why are we talking about religion while watching 'the wall'?
14and by that I mean that he tells us stuff like Apple invented the tablet, Apple invented the mp3 player etc
That and the new moon is comeing closer, and I always get a bit more hyper around a new moon. Don't know why...
I has soundcloud too
Woah
lol.
TheMaster, it firs
fits*
But only one remix i did was uploaded
03yeah
11,01Fun fact: This movie was created years after the album.
ask TheDoctor
03stupid copyrights
But then, as for believing what I want to believe. If I completely lose the ability to do that, then I have no place here at all.
i want a razor like that
03I just tried to upload two of my edits, immediately blocked
11,01Album of the same name.
where can i buy them?
Midnight_Fyre: exactly
the wall is mostly anti-war anti-government and pro-not isolating yourself. very little religion talk
Apple didn't invent, but they definitely had a large influence on the sales
BANG!
Yeah...
shells here
dem magnum rounds
Eh i only upload vg stuff
Nittany_Discord seems to be taking Silverscreen's role of random fact announcer.
Om: What am I going to do with you now?
I have absolutely no clue what's going on... :D
Life of Brian on the other hand is really just a parody of religion
14I agree, Skydroid
interesting discussion
ScootaBlues: someone needs to!
im back everypony
11,01Son, get dressed. We've got a war to go to.
Even though the one i uploaded wasnt vgm
Since people assume all MP3s are called iPods
14I still can't understand though
I'm guessong this movie is base on the Pink Floyd album of the same name?
03because >RDF
this is gonna be an ant-war movie isnt it?
the main characters father dies at anzio. He feels awful about it.
should have come earlier ^^
becuase religion is funny
anti*
based*
Welcome back brony_swan
ScootaBlues, there will always be fun facts from the streamer
because*
11,01Nah. I did trivia once way back.
14why the iPad succeeded and the 2001 windows tablet didn't
hell yeah i love swans :D
cat!
kitty
It was an original song remix as part of a open remix group
who knows? :3
03RDF, that's why.
11,01For Twister.
03:P
dove!
I'm just waiting for a gunshot
OH NO
03reality distortion field
no pigeon fly away!
03look it up
GilDash: Get thinking.
hey brony_swan what have you been up to
I hope not
11,01Yay, cartoon.
THIS SCENE :'(
mother before the education part. I always approved of the movie part
Possibly
WOAH
lol blood
you know this is based on a true story .... well kinda
HOLY!
the buck........
anti-war stuff annoys me
WOAH
wat
Wait... is this movie going in the wrong direction??
suddenly, animated
grusome
D-d-d-did you see the frightened ones?
WTH
So since it's an anti-war film, I suppose there will be no context for the war. It's just war for the sake of backwards humanity?
also. the animator for hercules did all this animation
/me kisses Om tentatively.
Some girl had a Zune, someone else was like, "Cool iPod!"
What the hay
ive been playin some bf3
so trippy
Nazi's
Woah
03LOL
03Zunes are awesome
oh god
14xD
the horor
Fun Fact: The animation in this is done by the same man who did Disney's Hercules.
3LunaTheBeloved, test out your colors :P
I think.
Same.class too LOL
Um
;__;
Viewers high as shit seeing bursting pidgeons and shit
14well
LTB mod
lol gore
the bloody hell?
Also topical would be the Who's Tommy, which is also a commentary on religion
Dat blood
woahhhhhhhh dudeeeeeeeeee
Well, Gerald Scarfe did the character designs for Hercules.
Transformers moar than meets the eye =3
08,01oh god, an art film by Pink Floyd
03but yeah I've had people ask me what kind of iPod I have
4 Like this?
/me hides
14some people told me "omfg y ur ipod is so big"
03I refuse to answer them :P
3yep :3
08,01i should be revising anyway
Ahahaha
14I was like "D:"
ScootaBlues: That's interesting...
Did he pick up a church?
3xD
Hey I see tower bridge :3
THE FUCK IS THAT!?
wat.....
What?
/me 08,01is not really a pink floyd fan
Dude
wierdest boner.
if you type a comma after the first number you can choose a background color
All dis Freudian imagery up in dis place
Where's the acid?
3:3
GilDash: This animation is distracting.
weirdest
Blitz
Story of my life? anyone?
Dang...
so trippy mannnnnnnnn
<--- Acleps, where is your defination of sense now?
That was fun
Twice now I've been a mod in here
Om: Would you like some other distraction?
Okay, did I take a hit of acid when I wasn't looking?
hey brony_swan what have you been up to
08,01madnsdestiny: when you have a weird boner, i'm it.
The riif sounds like a Metallica song :\
3maybe one day ;3
RELIGION ON SCREEN!
riff*
some bf3
14but yeah, I tend to not fall into such silly discussions IRL :P
otakon: No, you're experiencing Pink Floyd.
3all of you maybe even
Well, silly stuff happens in here
11,01I'm getting up.
GilDash: Sounding more liker yourself already.
ScootaBlues: the bloody hell
Yeah...
like?
14especially with idiots like the people I have around IRL xD
The power...... OF RELIGION!
3I can't be caught taking favorites >>
3<<
This is what happens when you let Roger Waters have full reign.
PONY: I keep it in a secret compartment in my brain, locked by a 7-digit password.
/me waves at SlurryMoon
Heheh
lol
hai :3
11,01Can't even stay asleep dead.
Shit gets trippy.
dat symbolism
Goodbye, blue skies.
The hell? Who even buried all these people?!
I really want to say something about what I'm seeing, but this is just a total mindfuck. I'm rather glad I never listened to anything but the one popular song that I'm guessing is coming soon..
seems legit
am i high
Om: ... I think I need to process all of this...
It's anti War
who said there was nothing to do with religions here?
its coming up in a second
:'(
PONY: Just to make sure I survive through this movie
religonkills people
lol brits
GilDash: keep it down eh?
its more anti-war than anti-religion
so have all you guys been watchin is this
yea here we go
They told me when I had a broken arm to go to the Red Cross.....
Acleps, easily
Gotta love that british accent
But this is ridiculoius!
ohhh
that accent could be more forced if they tried
lol
PONY: Oi! :|
08,01PONY: why do you always talk about religion? aren't there more interesting things to talk about?
poor kid
Oh, and another thing: I have second gen iPod and all these people who have the latest are all like, "WTF IS THAT AN.IPHONE?" since old iPhone was thicker, I think
I once applied for a mod position, but failed. xD
brony_swan: a bit, and so far I am freaking confuzzled
GilDash: Shirking back again? Take all the time you need. No rush for time.
Atheism killed more people than every organized religion combined, though.
oh god
PONY: We'll see :)
like ponies!
O hey...theres a train....ITS COMPLETELY SAFE
micromushroomman: no people kill people, BECAUSE of religion
Uh oh
Interview was scary though
ditto
Oh Cello otakon
I see where this is going......
there is a album about anti-war and communication to be discussed
Acleps, I have mindfucked you so many times, you are surely prepared
Om: What do you want from me?
NO!
14lol
hiya LunaTheBeloved!
DON'T! GO!
I like trains
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU NOT HEAR IT
best part coming up
kandahrihu where the hell did you get that info?
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved "How are you dear?
New Touches are thin, have camera on front, etc.
dat accent
PONY: You? When?
I like trains
I REALLY like trains
lol
hey LunaTheBeloved hows your day been
SHITE!
SUS
That doesn't seem safe :D
Kandarihu: ATHEISTS have killed more people than religious people, but not in the name of atheism
DUDE
lol
I'm doing fine :)
That train is dead
IT'S THE HOGWARTS TRAIN
and thats how equestria was made
DED
Mozdoc: Why are you glad you only listened to Another Brick in The Wall Part 2/Comfortably Numb (it's probably one of those two...) I can understand why you dislike the imagery, but what's the matter with the music?
and he's lucky he wasn't shot
Acleps, you dont really have any idea who I am, do you?
nearly...
11,01Have a train run over a bullet. Smart.
14I liked the old iPods
GilDash: I don't want anything really. And what of you?
3oh gog...
wat
Oh dear
So why did you fail? Oo
08,01Kid_Cobalt: it was funny the first million times, but it's kinda losing it now, dude
How scary?
03I hate all iPods.
3what is this...
THE FUCK!?
Woah
wat
STAND STILL LADDY
The hell?!
here we go
WAT
03scroll wheels are the most retarded thing ever
14the clickwheel system was nice
GilDash, Acleps doesn't know
03no
03it wasn't
WAT
14D:
Wat////
O_o
Placing bullets on the tracks? Yeah that's a brilliant idea.
Haters gonna hate
14I like them :(
PONY: I do, but my memory is shorter than you might think :D
03you'd end up overscrolling
3...
love this song
Om: ... I'd like you...
all my wat
Woah....
the hell was wrong with their facees?
The hell is this....
wut?
Seems legit
here comes one of the most famous parts of this album. the one everyone knows
I doubt that atheists have killed more people considering the small amount of them throughout history
what just happened
08,01placing a bullet on the tracks wouldn't do anything
it only gets more trippy from here
03and you can't seek accurately for s***
PONY: Doesn't know what?
Dunno, I just didn't get the position. Ah well, good thing since soon after that I started coming here less and less
11,01BRB.
Jew trains ;__;
And here comes the most famous song on the album.
LunaTheBeloved: The Wall
so does this movie have a point
Om, GilDash try to keep it down eh?
this movie has all of my wut
GilDash: I don't see why, you have so many. Willy counterparts.
a larger precentage might have but religions have destroyed civilizations
Acleps, that's a common side effect of being mindfucked
oh volume control

It's not literally in the name of atheism. But one man who was bound only by his only sense of reason tried to modernize his country, and in the process 70 million people died pointlessly. His name was Chairman Mao.

Sketch_Toku_Brony: What now?
but I never much care for anything about a band besides the music
nooo PONY you said your lips were mine alone
03I mean, the iPod version
Acleps: I don't know. How do you feel?
03the HD one is fine
PONY: I had to.... I'm sorry :(
drf, was that "you want them" at me?
I have no Idea what's going on....Is that a good thing?

GilDash: I......I don't know

GilDash: But......ok....
alexxm: yesterday i was sitting in a corner of da school gym talking with some friends while my best one was playing basketball. then he was about to fall onto me so i raised my leg to protect my self but he pushed my leg and my own knee ended into my mouth making me lost an incisive....

sorry to hear about that Magical_pablez94
Ok
Okay, I give up now after seeing that.
wow stream is hawt
flower intercourse
11,01So much suggestion.
SirGanjalf : I thought it was pretty easy to interpret them : The monkeys in the begining got the ability to think by it. and it always jumps: The monlyths are a symbol for progress
Ded
Man, half of the reason I got into anime was to avoid stuff like this.
xmasskills, ah, so you do belong, for a second there, I was afraid you had mistaken me for somepony else. Also stop kicking, that's He-Who-Shall-not-be-NAMED's job
anyone see the movie teeth?
lolwut
/me switches off, I know what this is, I still have nightmares about this, and not in a good way
00,03No offense, but I'm not into this kind of things, I mean it's coool if you guys do....
03I make random emails to abuse iTunes store purchases
Mane chat going crazy
Wait until I get home etc.
Dayum Nature! YOU SCARY
I don't know, but I sure do like the artstyle of the animated scenes.
HOLY "buy some apples"
especially in the ending
Can't ahndle the movie, get out <.<
handle*
I'm refering to the mane chat btw
I am here though :)
GilDash: Did...did it work?
Random emails?
I don't even understand it
YEAH MERCEDES!
That sort of dark stuff makes me laugh
Acleps: Do you remember anything?
Insert_cupcake lol pretty much :D
back from shower, this still the wall?
14oh
14drf
/me kisses Acleps
yep
ah
/me kicks PONY for having a kissing booth open
GilDash: I remeber.... something....
Kandarihu: You've must never have heard of Heavy Metal
03it's part of the joy of having my own domain
Apokalipse: What are ponies complaining about?
03and yes?
its da walll
the problem I have is... the one time I seen this... I was drunk... VERY VERY drunk
14which format do you think it's better for videos?
and here comes the mindfuckery
O_O
14what's the .wav format of videos? xD
have stream open, tab out and do other things while listening to the good music
avi
03um
I have heard of it. AFAIK, that's western animation, though.
11,01Damn wall broke the church.
this is interesting#
I didn't even---
/me looks at PONY with a puzzled stare
0_0
that's the more general
03there are very few lossless video codecs
but
.ts
suddenly tron
._.
welll... that just happened
It's gone all Tron
03and they're usually huge
possibly?
xmasskills, really, the kicking belongs to the one who hasn't spoken tonight
03HuffYUV and uh
03Lagarith
i like this version of empty spaces way more than the other one in the album
rain, the problem is... I cant really listen to it either ;)
03you can store it in AVI, mp4 etc
Acleps, do you remember anything?
03thing with videos
Not complaining. Just comments like these: OMFGIAHFIAWEHFUHWUIFASDFAHUIAWRG FLOWER INTERCOURSE being repeated 5 billion times
That it did.
N4X: Oh i know that - monolyth we're always there when humanity had to take the next step in progress and evolution, but i heard the sequel speaks more about the origin of it
PONY: Do go on if you wish...
03avi, mp4, mkv, ogm, all of those are just containers
Aha.
03what matters are the CODECS
I.....I don't even
the images were burned into my brain ;)
DRUGS!
....0__0
Ryunosuke: my mind
14I see
WITH OUR BACKS TO THE WALL!
03XVID was a common one a few years ago and I still use it for quick stuff (not the best quality though)
00,03Is this what eating 'Shrooms does to you?
GilDash, just don't tell him to undress and do that
Most of this film's imagery is just pretentious yet obvious metaphorical allegories about sex and self destruction.
this is amazing
11,01'Dose hammers.
PONY: Yes.... something....But... I'm not sure
RIOTS
03H264 is the newer accepted "good" format, and is what most BLu-Rays use
Brb
no more skooma for me
PONY you deserve to be kicked for all your crimes
03whereas mpeg-2 is what DVDs and HDTV uses
Scoot: yes
14I would like to use one to make a 1:1 dvdrip
PONY: What'd be wrong with that? ;)
It's cool I like it
Scoot-Scootaloo: no, this is what LIVING in one does to you
03yeah, videos are compliated
03um
Lol h264
14I don't care about the space
HAMMERTIME!
03just rip it as ISO...
xvid plz?
alexxm: no need to sorry... it's all okay now... my dentist saved the tooth and now i have to eat mixed stuff for 1-2 weeks but nothing to worring about...
HALT! HAMMERZEIT!
lets put it this way, this doesnt make sense when sane, imagine something NOT making sense, while everything ELSE is not making sense :)
I'll just call it art, don't understand any of it
08,01http://www.theatheistpig.com/comics/2012-05-16.jpg
03ISO is a 1:1 copy of the *entire disc*
08,01<3
Acleps: kick PONY for me my leg is getting tired
03with special features, menus etc
03that's all I rip stuff as anymore xD
SirGanjalf : That would be cool... And I always asked myslef : Who burried the fucking monolyth on the moon? Aliens or a super natural force? Or himself?!
ScootaBlues: That's more or less what the thing's about. I prefer the album over the film, though.
14mh
GilDash: Wha....what's going on.....?
PONY :LOL You german?
Kammerjunk: I prefer the album because I can put it on my iPod ._.
pink is a rock star. his wife cheated on him and now a bunch of groupies are going to a back stage thing
That too.
And then everyone got WATSED
this is called 'young lust'
I can put the movie on my iPod...
14that's not a bad idea, actually
N4X, well I live in Germany.
14I could use a virtual drive to watch them
:p
So can I, but I don't like watching films on a 2" display.
03that's exactly what I do.
0///0
Acleps: I don't know. What do you want to go on? ;)
O________________________O
PONY : Schön zu hören :D
dat explicit content
Black guy's face wen
N4X: I think Monolyths were self-conscious in some way, so the last version might be possible
2'' would be luxury. I have an iPod classic
03though you can technically strip the languages you don't want, etc using DVD Shrink
03just turn compression off
03XD
Ah.
xmasskills... So after all, you are new here.
Litwick: hahahahahahahaha
08,01xmasskills: i'm not; i'm merely sharing a comic i found funny
GilDash: I'm.....not sure..... everything seems.....strange...
08,01xmasskills: it's up to you whether you agree with it or not; i'm not saying you should
But small screen doesn't bother me. I like having a lot of space on it
Good this RAWRity isn't here. He'd go crazy over all the metaphors and allegories.
I'll be back later - got to pick something up
N4X, bitte sprechen English im chat:)
/me nuzzels Acleps.
Plus, you can't split the movie into individual songs and shuffle them along with the rest of your library :P
inb4 boobs
11,01Why are we arguing politics and religion during a stream?
boobs
14nah, I'll take everything x3
PONY : Yes of course, excuse me
Acleps: It's okay, I'll take care of you.
boobs!
Nittany_Discord: Because BronyState.
You could have both the movie and album :o
03yeah, DVD Decrypter
03store it as ISO
Kammerjunk: I'm debating whether I should or not, but to be honest it would probably just be typing effort wasted given no one in mane would read it.
Sooo, when do the funky drawing start up again?
14recently I'm watching my DVD movies in their original languages
PONY : Why are you in Germany right now? Are you studying here or...=
Nittany_Discord: because the movie seems to drive us too
Bronystate: where we discuss politics and ponies
So #bronystate went oatmeal over a pair of flowers doing it, but not boobs.
shame, I was just getting into this
/me rests head on GilDash "Thanks...."
11,01Pony 2012.
I can't imagine why.
That's because #bronystate is fucking stupid these days.
14Scrubs is not fun in English though
/me runs
/me kisses Acleps on the forhead.
i miss much Kandarihu
Yup
N4X, (also to hide the fact that my german is bad), I'm in Berlin, I work here
Acleps: No worries. :)
Hm...but Ponies never kidnapped children
That's the price of manestream.
i'm gonna visit Germany in September
WHY
maybe the flowers meant something to them
03wtf
says who N4X
00,03Can't we argue about Santana and why it never got its own movie?
Remember when THAT was a thing Nittany? And everyone was a sheep and believed it?
WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE THE OLD DAYS
Back in a bit. :)
08,01xmasskills: i personally find there to be truth in this one, though; it's fair enough if you don't like it
03you know
GilDash x Acleps has been confirmed as cannon
WHEN 12 YEAR OLDS DIDN'T FILL UP THE CHAT
alexxm : O_O
hooviet_Pony, wait a month, Octoberfest :)
Scoot-Scootaloo, No
03I heard in the Spanish dub of Scrubs... those scenes where Carla is speaking Spanish, they dubbed it to another language
this song is called. 'one of my turns'
03Italian I think
00,03:(
no fanfics alexxm :D
/me hugs GilDash tightly
because summer vacation
says the jailbait
03which is silly as Italian is like mostly the same as Spanish?
I much prefer the album version over the film version.
AND WE COULD HAVE DEEP INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE INNER MACHINATIONS OF Rarity and Twilight Sparkle.
11,01Litwick: I sure did. Dunno if it was for nothing.
whay N4X
alexxm, has secrets... horrible, horrible secrets

Nope.

Scoot-Scootaloo lol dont ya SA NA TA ANA *waves hand* HOW lol Jeff Dunham

Hey pyrocatboy

Shit was crazy, yo.

11,01Litwick: The Kony 2012 campaign?
I think he's depressed
I think I'm part Welsh.
PONY: the secrets that will get alexxm sent to jail or the ones that will get him lynched
11,01I didn't do that.
14in middle school, I could hardly understand my spanish teacher xD
08,01xmasskills: if you want funny satire, you should see some of the Punch comics from the 80s about Margaret Thatcher
alexxm: Meh
yay Japanese
11,01Just did a reblog on Tumblr.
I am Welsh :)
well there was the scottish cow incident of 99 PONY
11,01I think there was a petition.
Yokupony: Cool!
00,03Not now, I'm watching politics >: (
never thought about going to the pony rooms on weekdays
Apokalipse: I know, its just fun to torture scootachicken
PONY : I'm living the land of the thousands hills in the south east of NRW
alexxm, we agreed to never speak about that again.
14I'm learning many things
Pfffffft, supporting TheInvisibleChildrin
hey pyrocatboy how are ya?
well pretty much south east
00,03Mind crush!
meh
I remember one particular discussion during a live-stream about whether or not a dimension where Equestria exists would be possible.
08,01xmasskills: because she was the cancer that was killing /b/
brace for it, you must brace
08,01apparently
inb4 sex
Magical_pablez94 meh
You're doing it wrong. YOu need to mention jailbait and he'll go crazy

The irony is that that Kony video is about a dictator who hasn't been seen since 2006.

RX-78-SweetieBot: Not as much fun as it is to torture otakon
/me hugs pyrocatboy "what's up?"
08,01but seriously, she was kind of like our version of Dubya
His rage is so amazing
08,01alexxm: margaret thatcher
Magical_pablez94 meh
ScootaBlues: well of course, noone rages like Frenchakon
Nobody rages like Gaston.
3.ts isn't lossless :s it's just something else(mpeg-2/h.264) with a wrapper around it. which means usually there's no point in ever converting to .ts
/b/ception
GabeMaid64 eeyup
actually /b/ is the cancer that is killing the web :)
someponies forgot rule 1&2 again
03right, but if you record the stuff in TS, it's best to keep it as that
08,01xmasskills: http://punch.photoshelter.com/index
I love how just otakon saying something can create a whole new meme
err net :p
11,01War rage.
WHAT?? when did we get on the topic of 4chan :O
pyrocatboy: is meh da only thing u can say me?
RAEG!!

Magical_pablez94 meh
Rage quit,
smashing shit is fun
pyrocatboy: i guess it is :D
Frenchakon is best otakon
Oh I always wanted to know : Why does Dashie look so bored on the top?

otakon's a portable meme generator
lol he missed the Seson 2 finale :D
RX-78-SweetieBot: no dammit no
N4X: bc she's asleep
Resaluta, LunaTheBeloved.
otakon x Pink Floyd
He Discovered Pony R34

Thanks
PONY: :O
http://tinyurl.com/bttbftf
otakon x Roger Waters?
Can someone fill me in on the whole frenchakon thing?
those are some dusty blinds
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I think someone spoiled it for him:D
Kammerjunk: Indeed
Come to think of it, A Life Aquatic turned out to be a pretty good movie.
There went the TV.
lol
but otakon : Her eyes are open...I didn't knew ponies could to that...
This movie is just....just...so...just...
Hey, ScootaBlues, is there anyway to make a pinging sound when someone says your name?
It's like the ending to The Room
the actor actually cut his hand doing that
00,03Dat Forrest gump
He's a Hero
Vordox, we have seen stranger
00,03JENNAY!
LunaTheBeloved: What d'you mean? Like a custom ping sound?
TheMaster: ouch
OK, I'm back. What did I miss in the last 10-15 minutes?
LunaTheBeloved: What client are you using?
PrincessLuna: how are u my princess?
oh gawd my nose has been bleeding for 20 min is my life in danger
http://tinyurl.com/thffth
Well that's what I call acting with passion
All I understand is: Saying Frenchakon= Otakon rage
Chatzilla, and just any kind of sound
xmasskills, stop doing coke
hey Midnight_Fyre hows your day been
11,01Midnight_Fyre: More random stuff.
xmasskills: stick some toilett paper in your nose
xmasskills, I've gone for an hour, you're fine
alexxm: pretty average
Oh. Then frankly, I haven't a goddamn clue.
Magical_pablez94: I'm alright, you?
xmasskills: yes, I'm sorry boi, ur gonna die
00,03Because symbolism
welcome back Midnight_Fyre
xmasskills: No, not really.
This movie is WAY too dark for my tastes.
LunaTheBeloved: I'm fairly sure there's normally a ding when someone says your name
Midnight_Fyre: Pink's wife cheated on him, he had a groupie backstage but a war movie on TV made him lose his mind and have a massive rage fit.
Pool period
What would Otakon be in french anyways?
08,01xmasskills: aye, that's certainly true
:D
PONY: i wasnt i was in a pervy situation but seriously my nose wont stop bleeding

LordDerpington: Thanks
PrincessLuna: me too. full belly makes me always feel good:)
autaconne?
Say my name then
Well, "Otakon" is a fan convention.
Hm...spare rips
SYMBOLISIM!!OMGBBQ!!
dat sexy time
LunaTheBeloved
Otakon said something in a skype call yesterday and I somehow mutated it into otakon being French
I can't even call this movie art anymore. It's just pure weapons-grade angst.
xmasskills: As I said, take some toilett paper and stick it up, make sure no air gets in to stop the blood plasma
Nope
xmasskills, stick your face in ice
No sound
00,03Hurray for symbolism!
xmasskills, stop bleeding on the movie
i'm confused
Huzzah !
Gotta love slo-mo
Once the Blood Plasma stops moving, it'll ...what's the word..
LunaTheBeloved: That's weird, it does highlight the message though, right?
coagulate
Convulant..
Yeah
Yeah Coagulate
dudes you dont understand the gravity of the situation my nose is practicly running with blood and Vordox the toilet paper gets soaked in like 3 min
How long is the movie?
Well, the persons name anyway

Woo!
xmasskills: Oh....erm...
Changeling!
LunaTheBeloved: try under global settings and the global tab, turn on agressive notification
lift your head up it should help stop the bleeding
Vagineer ?
00,03OMG a suggestice monster!
Once the bleeding stops, how about some healing?
00,03suggestive*
this film
i'm confused
xmasskills, lay down or something.
Alan Parker confirmed for pervert.
Kandarihu: sexual healing ^^
me too alexxm, me too
Hey I want a room as big as that
WHOA
xmasskills: Put some toilet paper in your nose, and use the pinch at the bone structure of your nose. that WILL stop the bleeding but...
he has a lot of televisions
moar RAGE!!!

I'm no doctor. :P Not from text alone

I love politics
Try now
damn internet.
well what Vordox
xmasskills: Use the pinch at the tip of your bone structure of your nose.
LunaTheBeloved
Vordox can't you mess upi your nose that way?
I'm getting tempted to stop watching. This is too much angst, and it seems to be getting WORSE since I complained about it a few minutes ago
xmasskills: Take a tissue of paper towl or toilet paper, and wad it up to plug your nose. Lay back or tilt you head back and pinck the bridge of your nose.
Once more
LunaTheBeloved
So...is it over or is this just a...intermezzo/revision part ?
pyrocatboy: hey but... do u do, sometimes , something different than posting images?:)
That's the main circuit of blood causing the rush
this music is actually the news + music
Yeah nothing
Ping her. Ping her ha- no
/me 11,01bricks
bleed the the blood on a cup, drink the blood, problem solved
and now the wall is complete
wow
Kandarihu: Moosic
dat smoke
TEAR THE WALL DOWN
you can't mess up your blood circuit of your nose UNLESS it's already messed up.
Magical_pablez94 : I'm sometimes a maid.
Luna, try clicking on another window for a bit
Om: been doing that for a while all that happens is the toilet paper gets soaked and the blood goes to the back of my throat
Erectin' a Goodbye Cruel World!
and then someone ping her
this is the end of part 1
Besides, it sounds more like a blood Rush, usually caused by High Blood Pressure.
inb4 suicide
you'd have to switch cd's, albums at this point
high res
xmasskills, pinch harder
LunaTheBeloved
i'm sorry but does this film have a plot or is it just random events with random music in the background
LunaTheBeloved: Go back to Global settings and put the word 'beep' in the box next to the phrase 'Channel: Stalk Match'
Good hello!
OO! xmasskillss, collect the blood! you have a serious change to make some 1m dollar modern art!
pyrocatboy: ok....O.O (watches carefully the BOY of da nickname)
Well, I'm now das
it does have a plot. you have to pay attention
sad*
Done try it now
xmasskills: Try bigger wads? and if you are really that concerned you can seek medical attention.
Wait a minute. Was this movie made before the Berlin Wall fell?
hey Litwick hows your day been
LunaTheBeloved
hm...did you ever imagined what would happen if you were able to open portals of some kind the other universes/dimensions?
the plot is. Pink Floyd, the main character, grew up without a father because he died in ww2.
Fine.
yeah, this movie is freaking me out
Yeah...nothing
Magical_pablez94 : Maid Hour
Kandarihu: good question
ok i think the bleeding stopped
Pinging is serious business, apparently.
his mother basically smothered him and he began building a wall to isolate himself from the world. he became a rock star and then his wife cheats on him
what a waste
but im feeling kinda light headed
LunaTheBeloved: Have you tried going to another window?
Kandarihu: It was
well 142 people here :3
at this point pink has totally isolated himself from everything and everyone.
count to three then try
Minimize Chatzilla and then I'll ping you again
and this has nothing to do with the berlin wall
xmasskills, it's lupus

Okay. That makes things a bit better.
Pinching hard, xmasskills ?
hai Wrek

lali-ho Wrek
Yep nothing
O.O pyrocatboy are u ok?
GabeMaid64: whats lupus
Sup Wrek
its bascily about a guy that hated is life so much that he shut himself off from the world
Hey Wrek !
I don't even get pings. I get yays.
Alright, time for one last thing.
Oh wait, he can't type unless he's pinching.
Vordox: the bleeding stopped but im light headed now
Magical_pablez94 : yep

xmasskills: That happens with blood loss, it's not a bad sign unless you lose more blood.
Its at 25
Wow, it's hard to follow up with everything at the same time :S

pyrocatboy hehe
awesomeness
taking apart ALL THE THINGS
Neurosen pretty much...
pyrocatboy: oh well! at least u'r no more answering me with meh and nothing else...:)
<3 Surprise
Go to the mixer and check Chatzilla
i'm sorry but does this film have a plot or is it just random events with random music in the background
This movie is in horrible taste nowadays, but more understandable when one ponders the disparity between West Germany and East Germany.
Just make sure the blood doesn't move, and make sure the toilet papper stop the air to get to your blood area.
Gypsy magic?
Magical_pablez94 meh
ok sweet i have to go guys school calls see everyone in like 3 hours
bye
That'll cause a coagulation, and that should be good

Wikipedia explains this movie at least a little bit.
PONY save those candah kisses
alexxm, it's about a retired soldier going through HORRIBLE PTSD
this guitar work makes me want to listen to The House of the Rising Sun

pyrocatboy: obvious and foreseeable
<3
INB4 he goes insane.
05so i just founded a colony and began erecting mining facilities. but didnt give much thought on any defence. so a dude sent a large cago vessel to my colony, basically getting free loot. when i noticed i sent my fleet of 20 cruisers, 1 battleship and 50 fighters to his homeworld. accompanied by 7 cargo vessels. now i have a shitload of loot on the way back.
PTSD?
<--- wot?
Yep its good
Not sure if that's the entirety of the movie.
TL;DR
He's missing a pick of destiny, I deem this shrine a poor excuse
00,03Ouch...
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

blood for the blood god

14thanks
pyrocatboy, every night darling
Evo_Kaer : /) ?
the whole point of these videos is to make you feel bad for the main character
14it's probably because of all the cottonwood outside
the kid is him when he was young
he's pretty sympathetic actually
14I'm not alergic

Should kicking someone for a crime which isn't actually against the rules be something we can object to?
GilDash: Hmm?
Wrek is BAN shippers

GilDash: I've been trying to learn, but It's really hard... How do you manage it? :)
I dunno..
The kicking is Wrecking business, that's why.

That depends on how yo look at the rules.
But don't expect much

Well Acleps, it's just they only check you under certain conditions. My temp was normal, my oxygen levels were 100%, and my lungs were clear so they didn't test me for infection at all. But I'm going to insist that they check me because I have something bad.
CCCP: how are ya?
Bah, I prefer the album version of Stop.

soooo.. all of this is his life
So from what I've been able to gather, the Wall as a whole is about the metaphorical wall you build around your mind to prevent other people from seeing how vulnerable you are.
?
You really can draw anything cant you.
The poor guy
Magical_pablez94: oh well thats a good things :$!
Yokupony: So get the album.
BOOM
Then get the album
I don't know. Now for me, the songs are just not going to be the same after seeing this to go with them now.

why ishsexest
LunaTheBeloved
08,01i'm thinking either a jet engine, another tesla coil, or a metal cello
LTB
This film gets a Roger Waters/10
Dafuq?/10
So what is the moral of the story?
why IshSexestPony
08,01out of those, the metal cello would be the hardest, i think
The best musical trip ever/10 :$
And all these names now also completely went batshit after this was finished I think.
guess I missed the best film of the week here
alexxm IshBestPony is not an ass
Um, last night I was allowed to put YT links. What's wrong with them?
Evangelion-makes-nice-brainbleach/10
00,03Salvador/Dali
Still no ping but alrgiht
Intriguing/10
On a scale of 1 to pretty cool this movie was pretty cool
the moral of the story is to communicate with people
that was werid
Midnight_Fyre: :D
Cout to 5 and say LTB
05needs more roger waters
o u
TheGir979: not during streams
Are these films being showed again later? Because I kind of wanted to see this one but I couldn't catch it.
Young Pink
11,01Hard to tell what's going on / 10
08,01twilight_sprinkler: already doing that, hun; i built a convention
you shouldn't build a wall around yourself or a giant ass will yell at you and tear it down
Music & Animations/10
I need some time to let it sink in, but my overall impression is that it was excellent.
Uhh... What comes after 3?
LTB
The film is a whole bunch of pretentious yet surprisingly obvious metaphorical allegories for sex and self destruction, but the music is incredible, and the animation is fantastic.
I understood absolutely none of that. :D
But there's always a stream.... -_-
00,03Not during an official stream, TheGir979
Awesome
relative of pinkie pie?
0,5Coming up next on BronyState: Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny!
I like that description Nittany_Discord :D
im prety sure the wall is like society or sompeing i dontknow symbolism is great and all but you dont have to be rediculos
10/10 for the music.

I don't quite understand how so many people don't know Pink Floyd when they're supposed to be one of the most famous bands of all time
(is petted on, softly)
Fine...
Acleps: I wish :(
Yet another movie I was curious about going in, and come out never wanting to see again.

o.o
Kandarihu: They are an immensely talented band. Honestly, I can't get into them much myself though. I always found Pink Floyd to be a bit too slow and plodding for my taste
for some reason that vid was just annoying to me

CCCP: The pick of the destiny
00,03Wait that was for Saxy?
PrincessLuna: by calling otakon French
obvi
Acleps: thanks
otakon x France
00,03why don't I get a pony to like me....
/me nuzzles MaidSurge
INB4 ban.
MaidSurge: I don't think genres is the word you're looking for here...
Well, from what I understand, Tenacious D tends to focus on awesomeness in their tone. I've heard a few of their songs, and they are pretty funny.
00,03Wow that sounded wrong....
pink floyd influenced everyone...no matter if wanted or not
otakon: Are you French, fair otakon ?
/me nuzzles CCCP
I'm digging this spanish guitar interlude

11,01Tenacious D is next.
05was it that one?
Bronysith|Diablo3: Considering the fact taht I just took two finals today, not fucking good.:|
ScootaChicken: I mean "people that come from different music backgrounds"
don't ban the ish guy :(
ScootaChicken: I told her that fun comes from calling otakon French
Acleps thanks
hey Lil_B hows your day been
lol
so how long do you have to wait to find out how you did on the finals TheRainbowDash
05old sketch is old Shizuka. need to make a new one

Bronysith|Diablo3: One final was pretty easy. One was insanely difficult.
Nice CCCP :$
yay
05for 30 minutes
hope you did well TheRainbowDash
Sorry. I didn't notice.
00,03And yeah, where's my sketch >: (
MaidSurge: Ah, fair enough. Yeah, I guess it's because of how varied Pink Floyd's music tends to be, I mean Wish You Were Here is a fairly standard acoustic ballad, whilst Shine on You Crazy Diamond is a weird proggy bluesy kind of thing and ABITW Part 2 and Money are borderline Funk.
Scoot-Scootaloo: i am need of a band
00,03Y U NO LOVE ME?
05Kandarihu: http://i.imgur.com/jvsVH.jpg
otakon shipping?
alexxm: I can tell that I did ok on both.
Scoot-Scootaloo: I play guitar, you play piano, we both sing, lez do this.
alessm great, but i don't know if i really will be here during the movie, I'm watchin VGAs playthrough of the 5th case in pheonix writght ace atturney ~3hours

Sexy jappleack
Ah well
I just call people "they".
otakon: Ah, alrighty then, I dont ship people anyway O.o
Might have been someone else
PrincessLuna: was banned?
It's nice and neutral.
I have got to force myself to go get things done. Maybe I should ship otakon
OMG TheRainbowDash *gives TheRainbowDash a loving Hug*
Ooh ok, sorry for the 1000 questions :$
ahaha we're harrassing Ota xD

hai MysteryPony
How many of you guys have wasted the whole week in here btw?
I thought otakon was in #bronystateregulars, actually.
What up CCCP!
/me hugs Midnight_Fyre
The thing is though, Wrek, banning people for that might not be the best idea, given that this isn't stated in the rules and someone could just come into the chat, make an otashipping joke and get banned without knowing it's a ban offense.
:$ brb\
anyone up for G4-ponies the live-action?
he sometimes is
I was tired of everyone picking on him. Thanks for standing up for him.
yay, I'm not too late for Pi :3
Ah.
usually we have to drag him in here
MrSnugglewoods: what?
!pokemon
PONY: Yep. :D
u know. the live-action?

ScootaChicken: well 30 mins isnt a big deal either
PONY: I don't consider it wasted as such though. ;)
MrSnugglewoods: you should see my Fluttershy cosplay!
So what movie is this?~
MrSnugglewoods: no I dont :P
/me pokes GilDash
twilight_sprinkler: It's not, but it does seem a bit unfair.
ScootaChicken, if Wrek wouldn't warn everypony he wants to ban, there would be nopony left here on the chat.
/me hugs PrincessLuna.
05ScootaChicken: give it time. sicne kicks and tellign people doesnt work. my hand is forced. besides if people actualyl read their kick messages for once alot of shitstrom could have been avoided.
u know, that live ation, when the G4 ponies are one a scen and does things
05which is also im not extreme as in appeal-bans or 1 hour plus. but 30 minutes.
MrSnugglewoods: You mean all of S1+S2?
Scoot-Scootaloo: hes been saying it for a while tho, but in a way it can be unfair, but at the same time 30 mins isnt a big deal
MrSnugglewoods: should I really go to youtube and search for it...
Wrek: why do you need to ban people in the first place?
woooops wrong ping
I remember MY first kick from Wrek.... it said "You have been kicked....for having low DPS" :D
00,03I know ;_;
nah, you know. the infamous live action of G4 ponies?
Kammerjunk: Oh, right they swapped them... well I wouldn't want to miss the D too :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: sorry wrong ping, no sleep this week > : (
CCCP: It is neccassary, to you know, regulate the chat.:P
08,01WHICH WAY IS NORWEGIAN?
Well, if this whole ota shipping stops altogether, nobody new will come in and think to start it up again.
MUFFINS!!!
TheRainbowDash: but i like trolls
hai regulars
there were a live action of G3 ponies on this stream for not so llong ago
RaveBrony, my 7th latest kick said simply "BOOM! HEADSHOT"
Wrek: Fair enough.
Hai
00,03Don't worry about it! i'm sure ScootaChicken is okay with it :D
PONY: Lol!! :D
really wanna se the G4 pony version
Ive had alot of silly kicks
RaveBrony: Aye, I was kicked for mentioning Deus Ex: Invisible War when nopony asked what game Wrek was playing. I deserved it wholely.
MrSnugglewoods: I remember the G3 one
05CCCP: because they keep herassing otakon with it. sure it may be a joke. and be precieved as fun. but when he asks you to stop adn you dont it per automatics becomes an offence.
Scoot-Scootaloo: as i accidently told the other scoot, hes been saying it for a while tho, but in a way it can be unfair, but at the same time 30 mins isnt a big deal
Kammerjunk: Oh, haha :D
GAHG
WHAT THE HELL
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm not.
AGAIN
when somepony*
i foudn it odd that the G3 live performance was better than the G4 one XD
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME
Evo_Kaer: i just wanna se if the G4 is as hilarious as the G3 version
MrSnugglewoods: I turned of the audio and played good pony music in the background: AWESOME
Wrek: oh okay :)

Oh hi, Dashie.
In all fairness, he is a moderator and ultimately his decision stands. If it was an unfair judgement let the mods deal with it

04I don't care, JB can go suck Satan's cock
08,01wagner. that's where it's at.
/me is Totally lost when it comes to rock music stuffs

Irish_Pony|Blind: Pssh, she is nothing, try to chase me with my airplanes and my Dashie powers.
Ghosties Y'know she'll enjoy that right?

The lack of color in this film reminds me of Pokemon Black/White 2.

Airpuff: The icarus referance and how it applies to Max.
bananashark: no offense, just sayin

By the way, curse my battery shortage! It makes me want to go all AVGN and curse randomly
How TheRainbowDash ? How was it referring to you? xD
Oh look it's singing old man

OBEY THE AVGN

Dark92Enigma: oh yeah i love that TMNT line xD
Dark92Enigma time to throw some f-bombs!
Princess_Celestia: good evening my princess how has your day been?
bananashark: well objective as in logical, when you can honestly tell yourself youre objective, then youre maximally objective :P
lets play toss the h-bomb!!
Dken2021: Ah, the f-bombs are not fully functional today.
/me is supprised by TheRainbowDash 's reply.... "Aha" ;P

GilDash my mind is too full of universe
Princess_Celestia how is Twilight doing, by the way?
twilight_sprinkler: Thank the stars. Russia needs a leader who sees people as human beings, not just something to be manipulated.
Why is it that just because I don't smile often I'm automatically grumpy.
I suck at go, as much as i suck at chess
TheFluttershy: lol

Running without any footstep sounds, Ninja Pro.
twilight_sprinkler: Unfortunately so. One politician can't make a difference if the rest are corrupt, even if that man is in charge.
