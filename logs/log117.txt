BWAAAAAAAAAWWWWMMMM! (Inception)
MFW watching this saps the living shit out of my download speed
Ohhhhhh, I see

13But I figured I'd give him the address to ask for one anyway cause I'm super-nice like that. :P
wait why does he have a graynbow dash mane?
i think ill just set up my cam to record all day XD
I read claro de luna

Wait I must know if I'm distracted or not.
/me spins the top thingy.

13Now... whats this about the promotional banners? I don't have Wrek's uber leet computer drawing skills. :P
13Indeed Val.

Ok.
:O they said hey hey hey in English.

07Well Wrek's his hands are pretty much tight with the banners...
Oh dear. It seems I still am.

07^
looks more like a fish with wings now
He... broke through the sky?
woz 'ere apparently
XD
make him stop bugging me >_<
I've heard that saying phrases/words in English is somewhat popular in Japan
Right now in my browser, I have 8 pony-related tabs open
move those hips
does everyone but me and OC writers hate OCs
I have one tab open. It's Equestria Daily.
learning it is mandatory in school in Japan
It is? Didn't know that
I think it's because it's to avoid Mary Sues/Gary Stus
It's mandatory but they do a poor job at it haha
I'm pretty sure, could be wrong I guess
!link http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/55080
SEE? his hair is blond now! hes supersaian!
It's mandatory to get into university too
You can tell by the horrible English accent. :p
...
oh, ok
/me is sad pony

ITZAH PINCHE

Other way
Ither way around
other way around, I think
Does yourself as a pony count as an OC?
sky breaker is good
Red/blonde is good
the one that LOOKS evil usualy is XD
Is this 30 minutes?
Because he has a PEENCH
How long has it been going
Okay.

onNeutral's In Action!
ponyponypony.swf
damn chavs, always vandalizin' the place.
i liked the episode before last
05skethcing it up etc
my parentss too away my comp
which are pretty much OCs because they have no characterization otherwise
05all of that
05would we of awesoem
but i stole it bac
I'm doing Advanced Geometry
:o
13Hmm.. a pony poster for the marathon..
Ok
I have my laptop that I smuggled in last night
wut
BOOBS
Some OCs are popular
basically all the mane cast + popular background characters in a movie theater
I have to ask, was there some fanfic incident where an OC was without a doubt a self-insert?
...s03e21
cone....
background characters are OCs with predefined color schemes and hair
:O
as far as using them as characters
I mean if a child freels powerless at home, it's more likely they'll bully at school to regain that power.
HI CONE!
07It needs to relate to the pony marathon ;)
Woot
oooh full metal panic....whats this about?
:(
this anime...
Or are they just strict to AVOID self-insert fictions getting submitted all over the place?
Possibly
adult bank= sperm bank...
lol
halp
anime ftw
07and yes he is..
whaarghbll

yeah that wouldn't work then >.<
pleease
OH SHIT

Hilarity ensues when he has to go to high school
13I like Val's idea, its decent. Have the view from the theater screen. Y'know, the camera pointing to them sitting in the audiance.
I could nver get into it because of the drawing style of this one =/
NUDE PERSON
:(
13It kinda relates I think.

ALSO
TESSA

05like the thign i sketched for sathi while i was on vacation? :o

Tessa could be Fluttersh... >w>;
07my kitty?
07:D
Fluttershy*
xp
OMG i need advide!!

All of you were close.

I got half of it right!
Can u look at In Action?
I thought one of Chrome's advertising/selling/marketing/whatever points was that it doesn't go boom
9In other news

pre 1.0
RainbowDashCancel, I think most browsers try to have that as their selling point
/me :(
huh
MetalRainbowDash pleas give it a rest, I said i would look at it.
07I was just brain-storming :)
They're up to 6 now.
umm...firefox has been on 6 for a while now
Oh ok
yeah
9hopefully during my birthday

For some bizarre reason they suddenly got the idea that using Chrome's version numbering standard was a great idea.
HEEEEYYYY... Check This OUUUT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEYR5O0PNpM

13I saw it MRD, you can stop posting it. lol
BUST- WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLF
How is it?
oh
/me hugs Fluttershy, then curls up on the ground

6Random disconnect on me?

13oh noes!
Looks nice, though.
sooooo long ago
11Oh MrPeddington. You're as... Charming as ever.
reset by peer
scootaloointeresting.jpg
I prefer to play Chaca, 'cause its actually hard
6Hallo~
6Hmmm. . . Odd.
but it's not really using much footage from the show
oh dear
ive got it
or umm
/me 10flails wildly
11:\
cool
10GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOW!
I'm attempting to animate as much of it originally as possible
Ummm
/me charges MrPeddington to the ground
/me rolls over, looking away
oh man
heh
this takes me back to the old country
...Now I wanna play fighting games.
GRRM, I felt the same way
/me groans slightly
And suddenly I am Viola. . .
(yfw yes, I AM that dedicated to established background and not retconning material...usually)
You want to hear cute overload?
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLQW_DKQQ8g
13lol I noticed that. :P
And story mode isn't much fun.
hey Balloons
^
Gamerdude260, school is a very weird environment
Hello
There should be quotes in there some where.
6Natleyn~ ;3
Flutterstare = Fluttershy's Za Warudo
School is werid.
college*
6How are you doing?
11(What's that part where the pendulum is held called?)
Luckkky.
cause back in the old country we would kill them
She was actually a girl
oh whoa
lol
I know one of you guys
and i doubt you would want that to happen
4Sath, did you upload MetalRainbowDash's app on the forum?
We are naturally social people
hey Westy543
SixSpeed, I believe much the same...however far too few people share our enlightened views
I want
Streaming
To
Come
back!
PONIES!
10GRAOW!!!! graow.....gr...oaw?
6Yes dear child?
Silvermane doesn't need consent
/me ears perk up
...? ...*
Can you helps me on my logo
okay, I think my favorite pony is Pinkie Pie
Alright
13...he has no stomach Decap
rofl...he's asking for help on his logo now?
Pinkie Pie is awesome
:'(
11Good idea.
13Yeah, he was.
also
which one, 1, 2 or 3?
but you can't doubt the cute overload that is Fluttershy
Fluttershy*
11Can I Mirth? Just once?
it's probably just a server issue
/me groans and rolls over on the ground
Fluttershy
You cannot fight the D'awwwww
Fluttershy is okay
but I like Pinkie Pie
10 seconds flat
Fluttershy is like every cute nerd girl I ever had a crush on in high school
Luna is best pony
13Even faster. :P
That wouldn't worry me if it was anyone else
Twilight is best mane 6
!link Fluttershy
We need to ponyify this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bkY9ZS-9BA&feature=related
(Also free!) http://westy.cncfps.com/Pics/APB/rockets.jpg
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/32784
6What kind of help on the logo do you need?
the streamers are off line
but all ponies have a place in my heart
Like effects
is she a character that's introduced later?
I always liked the cute ones, Fluttershy and Luna have been tied for first for a while now
4Where is MRD's app?????
Twilight lifts up Rarity to try and find Philomena.. wat
yeah? why's that
oh
6KILL IT
that must be an earlier episode
13he's 7 feet tall, and equipped with scythe-like claws and rotating lazer array in his mouth
lol
2,14 please be patient MetalRainbowDash, we respond to every application
4-_-
;~;
I'm watching Dragonshie
GRRM, yes, it's from the pilot
"Put me down!"
6DDDD<
lol, he hasn't sent in an app
I should hope not seeing as we had 200 for the hub ep
give it time..
just the request for oen
13with parts of his body exposed to show clockwork and armor
one*
Hat it is one for umm
possibly becoming mod
It's only around 10pm here
I just dont like leaving problems un fixed =p
oh
Pinkie Pie reminds me entirely of my girlfriend
yeah I looked her up
6Synros! O: You have been here too?!?!?
she's just as random
Silly, none of you spelled Rainbow Dash right.
Maybe I'll apply someday when I've been here longer.
his gut*
yah
People like stories of rendemption
if you think that scary, you wouldnt want to see me and my old comrades with vodka and some guns
/me giggles at Natleyn~
pleh
I feel I do not yet deserve Mod powers.
really, he's doing a GREAT job of impressing us :P
...............................
If u do
Leika, yeah...I always loved the X-Men stories when Magneto joined the X-Men
UUUgh,
No reason...
heh, there's a pony wiki
MetalRainbowDash: ok well i won't discuss it for risk of jynxing it
GRRM, yup
there's pony communities all over
uh huh. *groan*
Yurp
Gamerdude260, just wait for 1.8
I've sseen some fanart too
GRRM there are fanfic wikis
also i dont think he is 7 feet tall
I think he's going to be BMN's equivalent to George Bush
Meh
pony fanfic wikis?
4I do remember him spamming
http://apps.facebook.com/neatchat/chatroom?pid=125354227555734
George Bush the regular from ponychan that is
or just fanfic wikis?
Go there if you have FB
4But otherwise...?
Fanfics terrify me.
But for now. Mods are a pain to install.
mlp.wikia.com
but be careful
official?
spoilers warning
I'm too lazy to read fanfics
13he's made like a clockwork soldier underneath, with a bit of magic-infused gem circuits for behavior and energy
tbh
or talk to you*
spamming, color avoidance, linking during streams
Well. When you're instaling a ton
annoying me
yeah,
HAh
Hmm..
the one with most of the info about the show
constantly resending a poorly photoshopped image
annoying me
openly complaining about mods
uh, where is his power supply?
annoying me
neither
annoying me
no
and did I mention annoying me?
4Okay, okay
I do :/
Hatpages are all the rage now
4Can one of you please direct me to his app
that's shocking. I had assumed you were always aroused.
no. i just make fillies around me aroused.
13I dont think he even sent in an app just yet.
4It's not on the forum and I don't see it in the email
well
Yes.
Go here
http://apps.facebook.com/neatchat/chatroom?pid=125354227555734
then they spend the effort to try and do the same for me
lol, if it's not in the email then he lied about submitting a request
If u have FB
because he's been bitching that we never got back to him
/me rolls over again
uh... what's shipping?
you know, I never found out myself
...Totally.
Putting two characters together in a relationship
but i've learned to correlate it with ^
Yeah.
4Oh
13How hes acted.
6;A;
4So he wants to become a mod...
never mind
13It was pretty bad.
That's it. :/
I cant find a place that has that
6eeyup~
Or pictures.
13Yeah...
Yes.
oh
GRRM, my advice...stay away from the fanfics for now
10............
6Both probably
10...graow
eeyuyp
they're weird
like I said I'm too lazy to read fanfics
6Would not be surprised if he starts claiming he IS one. @.@
Good.
lol
Keep it that way.
k
13I gave him the address unfortunately. Because I'm nice... sorry about that. That was before the lies some more and such though. lol
Well, why not fanfic?
11It's too bad there isn't a cavity of some sort. I would have /loved/ to see a Boombox+MrPeddington combo... Mech... Thingy.
*coughCUPCAKEScough*
there's nothing wrong with giving the email address
NO!
especially considering everyone could see it
4You gave him the email address?
!moon Gamerdude260
Grab my tail, TuxOtaku!
11You know.
for applications, yes
4Well, yeah, nothing wrong with that
13oh, that's in his belly silly
13Yeah, to request an app.
11!!!
13To him though, ugh. lol
derp
lol
*coughSWEETAPPLEMASSACREcough*
Lol
oh welp
as mods, we must act impartially :P
Gamerdude260, stop that now.
Oh now you're just being silly.
Don't read those fanfics.
MOOOOOONNAAAAAA
5am
13I think hes just really young or such. Preteen drama and the like.
as good a time as any to watch ponies
as such, we treat every application fairly :P
I see why you guys wanted me to stay away from fanfics
heh
There are terrible.
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
13Unless they act how he has acted. lol
13wat?
/me lolls his tongue as his head bounces off the dirt
Fanfics like anything run a strict Sturgeon's law. 90+% of it is crap.
well don't worry
!moon
*about
Grab my tail, Orangestar!
No Ponies here right now Bash
/me grabs

<MetalRainbowDash> I cant find a place that has that"

But.
They appear randomly and kill you when you turn around.
11Prepare yourself, Peddington!

Atleast

Uh
Well sorta.
/me 10rolls on his stomach

Might just be me but he comes off as wayyyyy to overbearing.

13I honestly think hes 12-14. He acts typical of a kid of that age range.
well
2,14 no more links please
this pony is in extreme gastrointestinal discomfort
*marevel
9also
4That's my name for him now

Not long at all xD
Clop clop clop
Just past 5 minutes.

uh, i probably should just stay quiet too
and they'd beg him for forgiveness
15so i see. isn't RPing usually involve, i dunno, RP? Not just random events?
And didn't want to further distract myself
/me directs mysteriousanimatorx to #EquestriaDailyAfterDark
Erm. Ask someone else Fluttershy.
-tears up, biting her lip-
never again
/me absconds to Nat's corner
Oop.
Buffering
Isnt it Equestria
Oh, I don't want to go to a dirty shippy smeary clop room.
I found even more Fluttershy-inspired music
Don't cry Fluttershy. I've just starred in a few ship-fics is all
:3
I could just
I'm being generous
It stopped at 5:43.
AfterDark? no Daily?
/me runs to VioletVanlla and other ponies.

I need to ask Twilight about that one.

15Rainbow Dash always dresses in style

Really, just don't. :0
Cool cool.

4i didnt name drop it
15where did you play Fluttershy?
4Herospirit did

15not you Decapking, herospirit
3What? did you say Silvershipper?
hah
I like the sun too, but it's night now.

07soo
He used to pay me to work at one of his buildings.
4but i did not say Silvershipper at all
15k
already?
Skipsy: That's awesome
Hey, she deserves to have the choice. Of whether or not to go to Silvershipper.
/me 3is bi-winning.
wow, she is a hard worker :P
At least, his name was on the checks.
#silvershipper even.
4except that one time that i said Silvershipper
6It was an accident. She closed her eyes and the next thing she knew, there it was.
/me wears his FLCL shirt
3...
Nah.
/me is rockin' NASA shirt.
right after BMN
streaming until the S2 premiere, yes?
07and when would that be?
Skipsy
6Do not overextend yourself. . .
You're really good!
Jack Roush is kinda short-tempered and a jerk to his employees.
SILVERMANE YOU BEEN TROLLED.
Danke, hehe
THAT IS ALL.
13Do we need an exact time?
6Next Thursday night I believe was the thought.
*Day time*
-shakes her head- Not like that anyway
11(Out of fucking nowhere :0)
15thanks Tink
still
happened
I could right now maybe
11What?

:P
15hmm, where you located?
11Why?
I have a ductape/PVCpipe/Foam broadsword in my closet :0
07if possible
He liked to buzz the Roush complex with his P51.
6It is getting kind of cold. . .
/me 15has a 32 inch latex scimitar with matchin 10" dagger
Oh yeah. It is.
/me sneezes lightly~ >~<
I think it's Winter here.
13*or
15nope, didn't remember you saying the where
Skipsy. Livestream! :D
11Ah.
15great.
6Or we could just not specify on the actual drawing and add the text later perhaps?
I think you should get home.
15don't paint it
07I'll link the draft
07hang on
http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
I'll be fine, but I'll make sure to get home soon.
13Oh wait, we dont have next weeks movies yet. Derp. lol
Ok
15never bother painting weapons like that. it chips, hardens the weapon, etc etc etc
13I know, I'm also doing many things at once.
that way we can time it out perfectly
: o )
13So I'm a little slow.
07http://i.imgur.com/J2xwE.jpg
I know that seems random, but I have been watching a show about exorcisms.
I'm setting up my alter as we speak.
15meh
lol
*altar
15idc all that much.
Getting home?
I already have my altar
15colored duct tape
My laptop
15electrical tape
13Dash looks a little odd. lol
You must appease me betterer.
Mmmm. I believe I know where I can acquire such assets.
07she needs imput now
/me smiles back :)
6I bet you get a lot of it. . . Being a flier and all.
well, it's a little clumped at the bottom
hi everypony
6Dari would be disappoint.
15hmm, LARPing is a very surreal experience.
4so is bow hunting
helloooooo
Then I guess there's no arguing that
/me speaks like Dr. Nick from the Simpsons.
Well, in a sense it did
HI EVERYBODY!
hi roushguy
I can see from here that you have too much blood.
comcast is terrible
that should be where our eyes go to
we need some leeches
Let's get you covered in LEECHEEEES!
That is something I cannot argue with.
right now the focal point is on Pinkie Pie
lol
But on the contrary,
Fluttershy is awesome
Get a lot of cold? o.o
are they exhibiting the emotion you call... pity?
13I like it overall. I dont want to ask her to have to redrawn it all over again.
/me is trying to be as creatively constructive as possible :-/
3Although II truthfully enjoy 2peakiing a2 20llux the most.
eww!
Man
LEECHES are the way of the pastfuture.
6Get a lot OF the cold. Being in the clouds and all I mean. . .
Np
Can't listen to ponymusic, for the same reason
07well wait till you see the end result :P
Thought it was just my eyes
welcome to the herd GRRM
GRPM: ONE OF US ONE OF US!!
13We'll see, we'll see. :P
4i'd still rather go bow hunting
How goes it?
welp
!link welcome_to_the_herd
6Hallo Fluttershy~
11Bed. Me. Time. Syntax. Grammar. Important to. Not me.
Just gotta yell and curse a lot.
07this is her DA
well, I dunno if anyone else agrees with me

4cause that deer jerky just tastes soooo good
It's like that whenever you type another user's name, mib_5qbfpx
I should mention that the larping I did with my best friend was special... >>
I can't draw though
Or write

4bow chicka wow wow?
I think I'm going to watch The Best Night Ever sometime tonight.
Or I'd contribute to the fanon

13More clustered on the left side?
I think Pumpkin Show is later this month
I wouldn't
yeah
On movies nights we tend to have the mane 6

/me 15hopes nothing happens whilst he is forced to lay prone
and then some.
6Maybe this. . .
4nevermind i think i got it

Am I going to regret joining?
oh: one more thing
em...
And I'm a girl, dude.
/me 4looks around

6I just think, even distribution. Having maybe thre on top, three on bottom instead o four on bottom, three on top.
07give me a tldr
Blums: Lol Wut?
without any prespective, the ponies are dis-proportionate
/me 3decides that all bets are off.
4damn, you really dont have anything to steal
Attention Everypony!
whoa
Probably Fluttershy.
6OOOONNNNEEEE MOOOOORRREEE THIIIINNNNGGG!
!!!
I.E: Pinkie is larger than all of them
Driving would be awesome if no one else was on the road.
*listening*
man, I need to catchup with this show
"already" he says.
The Pony Singing Contest is coming up.
I know I did!
the 17th
Loffly.
its been three or fourt months since the last one grrm
Maybe I'll go lurk there again.
that's not too bad
I'm a horrible, horrible person, aren't I?
If you want to audition, come to the theater today at 3 PM
Umm.... hmmm.
/me lurks
FANTASTIC!...I can't enter :(
Sorry Skipsy my interweb is not nice to me.
/me cries
13No Val lol
GRRM: Marathon it.
This weekend.
I'm a patient man
3Blame herospirit
herospirit?
13I'm just trying to think in ways that wont make her have to erase half or more of it.
15as the name implies, this is my channel of shipping
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/46594 for future use
lol, it's fine
Heh heh heh...
understandable
Marathon it for real. Run a marathon, one episode per mile.
/me absconds to the corner
15created with the intent of a safe haven for shipping stories that get above bronystate's pg13 limites
3inb4 Silvermane eats herospirit
07I like AJ's position
but at the same time, if the end product isn't agreeable, then we've kinda wasted fluttershy's time
13Hard though.
RainbowDashWins, psh
I'm very sad
Wait
4hey Fluttershy
3......
2:30 PM
13I think it'll look good in any case. Just might not be as great as it could have been.
6I think the main thing is how scrunched the four are on the bottom and how Rarity looks like she. . . . is just cast aside. . .
Try me.
3I would do nothing to you Fluttershy, not unless you wanted me to.

13What I've been saying... lol
That's not very nice to swear Rainbow Dash
6From her DA she does things very well, very quickly.
07We should make more use of DA.. maybe even contest
/me 13facehoofs

-narrows her eyes- I seee

I should've known it was only a matter of time before Alucard of Castlevania: SOTN was ponified.
Wait
*Evil laugh*

free publicity for themselves
6Ooooooooo~~~~

13Hmm...
13If we could make it work.
/me absconds to his safety corner
4we dont need any fighting here
from RE4
/me 15finds this moderately interesting. Then he rolls over for sleep
Somebody named Roberto is last to audition.
and RE2
it'd be easy really
13Silvermane...you...you don't like me anymore?
6Streaming is simple and could be set up
Silvermane, you are the defination of Player.
I was just wondering if it's already been done
Roberto?
Is there a Roberto in the room?
6How about like, a primetime spot during the pre-show?
13Is it because I lost my magic? I CAN CHANGE!
Yeah.
Wait..
Hmm.
Where is he?
15eh. Silvermane is not a player. that implies i cheat
4but none the less
nothing here
/me searches
yeah, like during intermission of BMN or something
!link leon_kennedy
/me 15facehoofs. "For Celestia's sake, I caused that, MirthTinker. And it's temporary anyways"
-narrows her eyes- Silvermane YOU ARE GOING DOWN!
Okay...what does he look like?
!link resident_evil
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/9486
07Nah not intermission
!link kennedy
people say..
13Probably be longer than that I would think.
He has..
13I'd say before or after BMN>
07I say pre-show
I... I'm... you...
Well
/me 4holds Fluttershy back
well we can always extend intermission. but pre-show is fine
He's full blue
For some reason I feel less accomplished today.. though I read 130 pages in my book. Probably didn't get enough ponies.
the only problem:
-screeches- I'm going to kill you!
yeah, I want him in his jacket
not nearly as many people attend the pre-show
15okay
13B-But, you sought the comfort of another mare! I'M A HORRIBLE PARTNER!
I have a jacket like his
Oh that pony
Nice.
/me absconds as quickly as possible to his safety corner
more ponies!!
He might be off doing...something...not here

They should've given her his cateyes.

6Ah, okay. . .

Screw this, I'm out.
hmmm
15oh dear
"Oatmeal, are you crazy?"
15this just got worrisome

*After Roberto's performance*
/me is a perfectionist

/me is three
13We just need to work hard!
agreed
Rainbow Dash, I couldn't find Robert--Oh, I guess you found him already...
/me 15shifts, quite nervous now. "Tink, Fluttershy, please relax a moment."
6I can try helping out. . . x.x
Lol, nice, Efreet.

07YES you can!
