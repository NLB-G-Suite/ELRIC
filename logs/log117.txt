I like Trixie
Trixie is okay
FUK YO CAT
Youre fucked
KITCHEN SINK IS THE BEST PONY, EVERYPONY
15well you are a special pony
Kitchen Sink needs more airtime.

Opal can be adorable at times.

that'd be pretty cool to watch on long train journeys or whatever
0DJPON3 must be best. >Be on screen for five seconds. Acquire huge fanbase.

DJ PON-3 HAS RETURNED!
i always said that good FX is half of success
Dress Montage!
and we still dont' have services
o.O what a big link
Trixie's fine, she's a showpony and has to talk up the part. Kitchen sink isn't included in other episodes, wanted it's own trailer.
15no don't do that. it's okay
0Actually i wonder why i didn't think of that. Fluttershy working for Rarity would really help out Rarity whenever she gets into those crazy workload situations.

SPAAAAAAACE....
I bet the first episode of season 2 will be about patience.
Dischord
07That's odd. It's showing up as green on mywot.com. Out of 100, it ranks 91 on trustworthiness, 89 on vendor reliability, 88 on privacy, and 89 on child safety. Overall, mywot.com considers dinkypage.com to be an excellent site in terms of safety.

Hey roushguy
this is why this doctor sucks
why dose he not need oxygen?
FIX IT
he didnt lose all his blood
Yeah, I can't wait for them to "find out" that I am a Brony, and they'll try to prove I am a bunch of thing I am not.
just a lot
FIX IT
having two hearts you'd think the doctor would actually need *more* ocygen
Sketchy_Sounds: what do you mean by that?
thn a human
There needs to be an episode/fanfic about a new craze, this series of books about adorable crows
because she stopped before she sucked him dry
1st ep is a 2 part about Discord is it not
typos everywhere
*lol*
15hmm? who said that
*facepalm*
Spose: you mean episode 3
I'm sorry... ): -hugs DecapKing-
and the "cronies" who like them
Meanwhile, I'm lying hints EVERYWHERE I am a Brony.
Thunder, when chat is less populated some time, we will share the glory of Best Blue Guy
Spin: yes.
:0
/me is nomming cheese doodles and is loving it!
YES!
technically it's 9am on saturday
*explotions*
HE DID IT
Indeed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dq_tbapBY Rainbow Dash is awesome.
/me 4gets hugged
But he's dying too.
well that was easy.
15oh hey DecapKing
Hey Plorf
Elky: Yes?
*oxygen*
I want to find out more about that palette swapped Rainbow Dash
Hi there
07it's a copy paste :P
And I mean Discord relating to patience.
07not me :P
roushguy: good luck :)
*He needs oxygen*
Spose: Agreed
yeah I know
/me 15puts on his Pizza Pony uniform
Cause we don't really know whats bad about Discord yet.
Wait wut
sorry, I was talking about the show fluttershy
What are we talking about
/me 15hands DecapKing a pizza-cake
OH
negative oxygen
NASHY
it gets confusing
Red or blue?
OMINOUS OXYGEN METER
why is doctor who playing?
his name
HELL yes
Red.
man, from the side, his hair looks like Dr. Whooves's
In fact, I bet my severe popularity in the 8th grade can encourage them.
why dose he not need it?
Ah, okay. ^^
4thanks Fluttershy and Silvermane
"dischord" = opposite of "harmony"
what's an oxygen metre doing in there
I just realized, a majority of the people that are hating are homophobes. So unjustly homophobic, considering that the majority of bronies are straight.
Massive Hatedome against the Cronies
BITCH YOU OWE US OXYGEN
and then EVERYONE becomes a cronie
pizza-cake? o-o
Yes, some people hate it and get angry
So, I can infer that Discord will be disrupting the elements of harmony in some way.
*oxygen*
ads in the show too lol
4although, i dont remember ordering a pizza-cake......
.... what how.
But that's as far as I'm speculating.
its raining on the moon
LOL WUT?
did I just see luna!?
Oh good
4Did Chaos say that in the chat?
It's raining ON THE MOOOOOOOOON
Pinkamena's gone.
and also there are some cronies who can't accept that others don't want to read the books
MOON RAIN FTW...
/me 15removes Pizza Pony uniform. 'i'm all naked!'
07I'm here
She really creeps me out.
10 Mins left of this
Celestia banished rain
HotCocoa: Anti-elements of harmony?
I guess you guys are tired of hearing me rage.
There's no "h" in "Discord." He gets annoyed when people don't spell it right.
Sorry guys.
07EQD
/me frowns.
I just saw you on the moon :D
ShadTheCrazed: dunno. :P
lawl
so everyone has to learn to tolerate that people like different things
Luna lost all her new friends. Poor Luna.
4Ahhh
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
4uuuuh, as ponies we normally are
the 10th doctor likes black girls
So discord is a troll.
Elements of Discord
/me wraps her front hooves around KShrike in a tight embrace
Isn't Discord just general chaos, not specifically malevolence?
Time to go home.

I was speaking about a specific chord, thank you

I have a hard time believing he'll be a dragon.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO. we lost hat to the nyan side.
07thisguy that is correct
I thought he was at one point
Also having a male alicorn would just seem weird, whereas all dragons we've seen are male
multicolours!

IM RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO TRAVEL IN TIME
we cannot complain
Luna returns in Season 2 Episode 2.

what sort of different anatomy do time lords have?
Is THAT what they're calling it now?
0;(

ohai Denied_Existence
He replied to the one I sent about some comic refs. Posted one of the two.
two hearts
I could be lulled to sleep if FLuttershy sang "In other words".
mostly
The handbrake
Secret 1. Nyan Cat has a fake Pop Tart, the flavor of it is Poop Flavored.
They just gave me comfort a second ago
At any moment.
then Batman TAS
so does this place have a livestream everynight?
herospirit: Nope, I'm the sheriff in a play about a murder
just two hearts?
Secret 2. Nyan cat was originally from Japan
If I wrote "Batman: The Musical" who would act in it with me?
http://press.discovery.com/media/ugc/photos/mlp201_Cast_worried.jpg You have seen this, right?
07interesting
You Could Be Happy sung by Fluttershy would make my heart asplode 3 times.
Secret 3
Umm waht?
AWW YES JEM

I'd be the penguin
why two hearts?

I thought this was supposed to be one of the greatest animated series ever.
Haha
/me feels like someone be mad
early 90s

I think the sound might desync here shortly
Batman wears his seatbelt, though. Teaching the kids that 50s cars had lap/shoulder restraints.
lag
90's
1993 or smth
I know this is supposed to be a stress test but isn't there supposed to be like 5000 people tuning in Sept 17th?

I'm Batman
Nickelodeon? metalrainbow dash: nickelodion sucks donkey ass now.
Who?

I would approve
Nickelodeon has...
Vic Mignogna, mostly known for the voice of Edward Elric
German Nickelodeon starts airing MLP:FiM now
...
Nickolodeon used to be cool with Doug
Ur mawm
:D
Smart brusce
11Nickelodeon doesn't have jack shit anymore.
meh I never really liked doug
Or Kenan And Kel
Nick was good when it had Bill Cosby every night.
13Yayy~ Doug
Nooo
I have no idea what Edward Elric sounds like
angry beavers ftw
Nick used to be good back when it had Avatar
nikolodean was awesome the had iz then it went downhill
he knew that guy was a pussy
The dub sucks so god damn hard
I have a bad feeling about Demented Cupcakes.
Does Nick have any shows?
and hey arnold
damn
....
after batman gonna reset it, it's been up like 4 hours,
dat lie
Or Angry Beavers
Demented Cupcakes?

Or Pete and Pete
all good cartoon show channels have gone downhill
i wish this channel had a hey arnold marathon :)
New song on EQD front page
13Angry Beavers was good too
Oh Angry Beavers and Hey Arnold..
angry beavers not watched that in yeaaaaaars

WHAT NOSTALGIA
The cupcakes are now Demented
Did cars really used to look like that?
We appreciate the streaming Sumica
How is it possible for Cupcakes to become MORE demented?
fantastic
<3
Or Hey Arnold
10mph impact destroys high tension cables.

2^
MUSCULAR BEAVER
dementina

Doug was fucking garbage

Or Rugrats

Elky: I have to make sure NEVER to tune into Nick at that time
07See you thisguy!
:D
SHES CATWOMAN
i dont think angry beavers holds up :( I tried watching old eps and it was hard. Hey Arnold though gets better as it ages.
I didn't like doug either ziltoid
13So many good old shows
Thought honestly I found Rocket To Insanity much more disturbing
The magis will be lost FOREVER
07Rocky horror is gonna be fun!
Or Rockos Modern Life
magic*
13Darn right Luna!
Lol jk nick sux now
i can't wait either luna ^_^
I can't stop staring at that picture of DJ Pon3
Why? I thought it was boring
rocky horror modern life?
Guys stop with the nostalgia!!
07I have the extended version!!!
13So much movie spam I bet though during key parts :P
07Hint hint!
It's.. it- *mind implodes*
too bad they stopped making it
she looks into my very soul!
I don't watch tv, but I'll tune in one time to see how horrible the voices are outside of the theme tune
13Nice <3
and then they had sex
Cartoon Network & Nick sucks
rocko's horror show
Because my dreams are messed up too
Rocko was so crazy it made me sick... NO JOKE...
Luna, are we gonna have props? I heard something about Rocky Horror and props. Sounds interesting.
AHH! Real Monsters kinda sucked.
Or the final one Hey Dude
4it is quiet....
crazy cat lady
Luna: It does look very interesting I'll admit. o-o
I just want to point out to everyone that we now have Transformers: Prime, the ThunderCats reboot, and MLP. I believe that we are returning to great quality programing again.
Damn. This song is weird.
catwoman!
If I started having repeated lucid dreams
Hooray!
I don't wanna think about it
"All you have to do is take a cup of pony, add it to the mix.."
Batman needs to stop refering to batman in the thirdperson.
As Told By Ginger sucked
RC
yeah i didn't like ahh real monsters
Which pony would be catwoman?
...
opal
Catpony
13Yes we do. <3

05makes sense
They have the INternet, but the TVs are black and white
IN DEXTER'S LABRARTORY

That show was the Bomb
twilight is the perfect main character
Yo, MRD...he said 'main character'.
HE'S THE SMARTEST BOY YOU'VE EVER SEEN

Rainbow dash should be the main character
As in only one.

True or False: Luna is responsible for the big blue glowy thing in the Season 2 promo pics.
The game?

Every one love luna but we love you too the one true Octavia
My best guess is that it has something to do with the resolution of the DACs involved, or at least, it did at one point.

Luna/AppleJack shipfic\

SILENT BATPLANE

Why would the army build a bunker for officials and then leave crates of grenades laying around?
They made Twilight look like the size of an actual pony.
well now I'm hungry.

My mom is probably a bit strange sometimes.

Doesn't work with Anope services then.
Cuting and splicing tape
you have to cut out segments of tape

I'm actually trying to find that persons other works
But if a female has interest in things that are "masculine", it's generally acceptable.
Ello?
If I do Co-OP with Decapking, he will get me killed
XD
Keyframe, megasweet
hopefully pony after too
Hey.
Pony is normaly on friday nights
Welcome to hypocrisy, population over a billion

Ah well

ignorance is bliss
And the shirts Xiagu?
At least no pony episodes.
But I'm gonna watch my FOOTBALL, because it's fun.

Party Loud
yeah, i was about to give him the bad news, dari :(
^^^
4brb, im gonig to restart my PC quick
I can watch pony as loud as I want to everyday because I hsa
Yeah.
As for why Hot Topic, a better question would be why We Love Fine.
Because females are seen as less worth than males, so males acting more "female" is seen as a downgrade.
I know, I'm looking. I just like that design
that is AMAZING
Night GGgala, Polarfire.
Sadly.
Of course, I wouldn't be caught dead watching the MLP that was around when I had to listen to them.
buuut it seems he's afk-ish
*have brony pride
PONI
That was.... G3
Nashy yup I was reading something about that, eh somewhere
Yeah
Because at We Love Fine had a Pony contest. Why you judging me?
night dari
and 3.5
also i think i may have a friend who is a brony
>forever a closet brony
Keyframe, http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/custom-merch-mega-mall.html and also the spreadshirt shirts (ShirtBrony, etc)
I'm not I'm judging them.
Anyway, I watched David the Gnome all the freaking time.
I easily could but I prefer to use my headphones when I'm watching alone
Football Season kickoff in 17 minutes
better safe than sorry huh Thunder_Dash

cupcakes i long beyond simply being a gorefic.

cupcakes is definitely gore
07he's using the pony starwars wallpaper

2,14 like the most recent one says 20% cooler
Luna, you are awesome.
Put up for the sole reason of stopping peoples' complaints
Star Driver before any one ask
/me pokes Polarfire
it's a meme, whether you like it or not
why is it there when there's a rule against it
think he's afk.
11Hey Dari, you should put something like RETIRED underneath anyone who's resigned in the About Us page.
when I type "equestria daily" into google, cupcakes is the first suggestion :(
well today he asked if i like bronies and my brother (who is violently antibrony) got into an argument i couldn't really understand what anyone said because everything was so loud
whats next
my opinion of it is 100% irrelevant
I'm trying to ponify my sis
no star driver
nope
it's hard
07You mean Hip Silver?
Luna, inspires to become a great pony converter...
it's wierd
:(
>_> not all of us are mods in this room
violently antibrony?
a site that doesn't follow its own rules has no integrity
<_<
and then Star Driver
yes
CarrotTop: Because as the owner of EqD, Sethisto can make exceptions
I promised...I wouldn't...cry...
4WHOOPS

Did you look at it
ah, well, then maybe if it is web based
05after the banners
Just sayin'.
07how many you have?
Sumica did you look at onNeutral's Videos?
Only dirty-minded ponies would be interested in such a thing anyway.
in action
/me blushes
the blue glow is luna
Wrek remembers! *squee*
/me eyes Luna_In_Socks.
Is this like character pairings?
awww I don't like mechanime
OH GOD NO, NOT THE GALACTIC PRETTY BOY

DCD is this your doing!

Vanilla; I gotta say I agree

I wonder what being an op is like.
I got Berry Punch/Lyra
nice legs
Are we watching that squid anime after this?
No DCD here AllisZero
And wtf is this Sumica
Hey VioletVanilla
I like HoityMadden
ah, I wasn't aware of that Johnsey
/me 13thinks he should make her an epic Octavia pic... because Wrek is so awesome like that lol I'm kidding. You're way too busy with the other pics. :P
ohh, this is a giant robot show? never would've guessed from the opening...
wtf
So many mane 6 joining.
it#s called hentai Ziltoid
lady gaga?
Nashy, your script can't even generate Scootaluna!
dat underboob
05the list builds fast
That's terrible
No, it cannot.
Yeah GGgala, but as far as I'd seen, not a very good one
05but see it as a possibillity Octavia
Hey Sumica what is being an op like in this chat?
05;)
13Part of the job of an artist I suppose. :P
Yea....
I'll pass
13lol Alright Wrek.
Professors at this school seem to have the loosest dress code ever
13X3
Dont know, I am not an OP
/me requests a Luna pic
AllisZero: yeah... same so far.
AppleSnips? O.O
Ghosties
Was restarting the server. ;3
What is it like being an OP?
Do you think it would be weird if I alternated between three main nicknames from the mane 6? o-o
Apple Bloom/Snips
13Its crazy!
hey Octavia
And is there like any requirements to get it?
13Cause all the ponies in this char are CrAzY!
No
Well... I'm going to go, before Octavia come back... I need to go... uh... the moon... something....
GGgala: First half of the show, typical slice of life high school drama, second half, mecha battles
bye....
13We have anyone interested fill out an application.
go change the tides
Went like that till episode 6 and that's when I gave up :(
Decap

Sumica i'm just wondering, is there any like requirements or something to be an admin.
Haha I went AFK
Before you answer her-
Mess with the surfer ponies
Nvm
For the lulz of course.

bow chicka wow wow
Uhh. no.
Ok
=-=; once I remember the command to change it anyway
on the forum? yeah
O.O
So like what do I say Octavia
>Football is mentioned
MLP ships are like R34 and Lets Plays. If it hasn't happened, someone HAS to do it
sounds good to me, I love Samurai Jack
13Ahh... we prefer you still around at least a few movie nights first.
It's like...a must
Filter: people are shipping everything, no exceptions
Do I just ask for an application
do it fool
they're like UPS or something
rape averted!
it starts with a /
ok
toooo slow...
hi
:D
You can type /quit and log in again
...
It was something easy... e-e;
13You just ask for an application, yes.
I know this is completely unrelated to anything but who here misses Bleach from the first season?... You know, back when it was ghostbustin/slice of life...
>nopony john maddens or even aeious
thats what pheal is for
what has happened to this channel
yes

05on cartoon network abck at where i lived as a kid
It was awesomeness
13But we do prefer our applicants to have some familiarity with us.Being here for several BMN's and such of course.
Keyframe, she did the picture in the background
Here comes another Chinese earthquake aahhbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
I don't think I ever saw the ending to it
07Octa I was talking with Ghosties and Wrek... about a poster or banner or something for the special pony marathon.. I was wondering if you would be up for it
lol
herospirit: i got an Abraham and Isaac allusion if you still need it
It was banshed from my drives after it became filler after filler.
Yea...
Question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark exclamation point
hello i have a question!
I kinda like this.
Could have some nicer images, some less bare formatting and perhaps some more options/tweaks to lists.
13How do you mean?
too bad Tite Kubo dose not seem too interested in bringing back that feel fromt the first season...
He's not
Sketchy_Sounds you take some buck and some manure and some buck and some manure and you have a buck manuer stack.
/me found a cute Octluna pic =3
07a poster, a banner.. basically something to promote the marathon on our frontpage
I sent email
ponies are serious bsns
Sketchy_Sounds is that what you where getting at?

wow has it been that long.
Bess image, I remember this one.
Yeah, 10 years
when are they aring season 2 on here? if they are at all....?
13Also, someone from the chat just sent in an email asking for an application. But this is his first time here and he was trolling a bit...
When it's live, sixthgate
13At first at least.
lo
when it's live on Hub sixthgate
next weekend probly
dang, now I forgot what I was gonna search
17th
17th
darnit
which is 9AM EST on Saturdays
so 17th at 6am PST
Ponies distracted you
Sumica
I sent an email to BronyState@Gmail.com
Ponies can even distract you from ponies.
asking for application
oh nice thats perfect
07Yea thats why I asked if he attended any movie nights
is it common for people to be engaged in japan?
sooo on the 17th at 6 in the morning?
I can watch S2 right before swim
Ok MetalRainbowDash but i just run the stream i am not a mod.
No sixth, at 4 PM
05EST yes
err..in high school that is
eeyup
That..
only another 9 days! Weeeeeeeeee! I cant wait for the second season!
Octaluna sounds pretty 8
Is when it said
/me is distracted by ponies
luntavia is best ship, and i cried at the end
Also cant wait for Fighting is Magic..
ooohh ok so its the 17th at 4pm..... *writing it down*
13Yeah, he said no.
thank you so much!
Naw, just got one
its gona Rule!
wait
Claro De Luna.
13He needs more familiarity with us first.
Go read it.
13At least 3 BMN's.
now i remember, dang, ponies DID distract me from ponies.
13Else, its strictly a no from me.
What is this?
/me knows
05with the way he has currently been acting, i agree qith oct
17th at 4? I thought they were being streamed live
Got any to "The Loaves and Fishes"? :p
MECHATIME
i may or may not have class or something to do, so im trying to set up my camstudio to record it
05qith*
It's called Star driver
http://i.imgur.com/th1ac.jpg
05WITH*
13Especially considering he was a little bit of a trouble maker at first I noticed.
hahaha, DJ Pon3 and Octavia turned into hamspters XD
Cool name.
The cycle of pony
07Yes, he was
Oh ok
Ponies can distract you from ponies, which can distract you from ponies, which can distract you from ponies...
/me continues searching for random pictures
13So I'm already saying no.ZS
13*XD
so are they streaming it live or what? @_@ so confused
I belive we are going to have a recorded re run later the same day sixthgate but i dont know the time.
BWAAAAAAAAAWWWWMMMM! (Inception)
MFW watching this saps the living shit out of my download speed
Sumica btw can you at least just stream In Action by onNeutral after this
Ohhhhhh, I see
oooh ok then thank you!
That is, whenever this is over.
13But I figured I'd give him the address to ask for one anyway cause I'm super-nice like that. :P
wait why does he have a graynbow dash mane?
i think ill just set up my cam to record all day XD
I read claro de luna
well and even if we reject him
felt nothing.
Wait I must know if I'm distracted or not.
someone who might have been THINKING about it now has the info
/me spins the top thingy.
is monster =D
13Now... whats this about the promotional banners? I don't have Wrek's uber leet computer drawing skills. :P
I have to check over to see what it is before I run it MetalRainbowDash
13Indeed Val.
it's never a bad idea to remind chat that we're recruiting
pretty...
Ok.
:O they said hey hey hey in English.
hey look. someone coloured that female dragon arty that faust made
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/55448
07Well Wrek's his hands are pretty much tight with the banners...
Oh dear. It seems I still am.
6Well Octavia, you did say that you enjoyed doing that but felt overlooked. Thought maybe you would like to work on it. . .
Dari
I do like the song in the background
lol he broke the 4th wall
07^
looks more like a fish with wings now
He... broke through the sky?
woz 'ere apparently
XD
make him stop bugging me >_<
I've heard that saying phrases/words in English is somewhat popular in Japan
07What Violet said!
Right now in my browser, I have 8 pony-related tabs open
1 facebook tab open
and 1 Final Fantasy tab open
Galactic pretty boy
move those hips
More sparkle than Twilight Sparkle.
does everyone but me and OC writers hate OCs
I have one tab open. It's Equestria Daily.
OMG he went super saian!
learning it is mandatory in school in Japan
the positioning of that dragon makes it look like a sea-dragon
CarrotTop, nearly, apparently
It is? Didn't know that
I think it's because it's to avoid Mary Sues/Gary Stus
Thunder_Dash thats true in most langueges...
It's mandatory but they do a poor job at it haha
Space is invisible mind dust, and stars are but WISHEEEES!
I'm pretty sure, could be wrong I guess
!link http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/55080
Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
SEE? his hair is blond now! hes supersaian!
It's mandatory to get into university too
You can tell by the horrible English accent. :p
...
oh, ok
/me is sad pony
wut
National Anthem
i g2 stand
And sadly people who just make additional original characters for the story get put in the same group.
probably because it's .org
yup
k
I thought that guy on the right was John Oliver a moment.
ITZAH PINCHE
ITSAPEENCH
I made an OC just so I can be myself... =/
lol
lol
I'm guessing sky breaking blonde dude is the bad guy? Or is it the other way around?
You guys rememberd it
lol itsapeench
XD
Other way
Ither way around
other way around, I think
Does yourself as a pony count as an OC?
sky breaker is good
05yeah im pretty much tied up for long enough that when i get my hadns free, its too little time to mix something together
Red/blonde is good
also, at that ponibooru link, giant trollface.
the one that LOOKS evil usualy is XD
Is this 30 minutes?
Because he has a PEENCH
How long has it been going
Okay.
also I said ITSAPEEINCH earlier D:
Red is hero guy in japan
Damn... Im getting so much lag I just cant enjoy this!
sames
daphuk? his arms are galexies?
MIKURU BEAAAAAM
it's not lagging too badly for me
*armpits
It helps if you close your browser and come back, but that takes a bit.
its like every 5 seconds it laggs up!
it homes!
Well good night everypony, I'm well past my bedtime.
meh
Bai
gnight
night Payne!
homework sucks
gnight!
Seeya Payne
is every one geting spikes or just a few?
Bye Payne
goodnight! may luna shine on you! XD
until tomorrow
:(
lol
I FEEL YOUR PAIN
*princess luna XD
I'm getting spikes here and there, Sumica
whoopscaps
07You rang?
Sumica is this almost over?
What kind of homework?
They aren't too bad though
/me is doing a shipload of notes.
specially when ur parents took away ur comuter, but u smuggle it
...Me/notes. Oh dear.
hey Luna
lol i ment prinsess luna XD
13Ahh. I don't really have the proper things on me right now to do anything like what Wrek does. I'm a good designer, but I lack most suitable applications atm for actual drawing. And a tablet.
Redd,
07hello
PRETTY BOY WINS!!!
are you me?
I honestly haven't ever read a fic and said "this character's a mary sue I don't like them"
no why
THA FOX IS ADORIBLE!!
of course, he's a bishonen
WASH THOSE HANDS
a whaaa?
Because you sound like it
Oh there
redd I just want to know what homework your doing, in the extremely unlikely chance I'd be able to help.
Orangestar? whut
well if you'd like I could take a shot at it, what did you have in mind?
The credits told me
2 laggy I missed the cuteness D=
those t3 sttanding there remind me of samurai shamploo
FMP now?
CarrotTop: I'm also considering another fanfic to write that will have an OC or two. But neither of them are in any way based off of me.
okay, im doing sentence notes
Btw if u stream it I bet you'd like it
It's a little thing onNeutral does
I can go for some FMP!
Oh please don't make an advance wars reference
Alright
13Poor Sumica. That MRD guy is pretty annoying. :/
uh so just notes
05even if you cant make a final product oct
simple pred= ?
He does some virus reviews while it's happening in Action
the current fanfiction I'm writing's main characters are Carrot Top and Dewdrop Dazzle
Samurai Champloo was indeed awesome...
That does sound boring
PONY
05coming up with a neat idea
meh
onNeutral's In Action!
ponyponypony.swf
damn chavs, always vandalizin' the place.
i liked the episode before last
05skethcing it up etc
my parentss too away my comp
which are pretty much OCs because they have no characterization otherwise
05all of that
05would we of awesoem
but i stole it bac
13Well, we could talk about what we'd like.
will it be this laggy on Saturday?
WINDOWS XP SOUND
CarrotTop, ponies don't mind those as much for some reason
it's not a matter of liking it MetalRainbowDash it's I have to preview it so I know what i am showing.
I'm doing Advanced Geometry
:o
13Hmm.. a pony poster for the marathon..
Ok
I've had an idea for a bronystate image for a while now, just never started making one
I have my laptop that I smuggled in last night
wut
BOOBS
Oh lol. nope. I had the spy show /Alias/ , s02e21, "Legacy" - what'd you find?
I feel parents who try to punish their kids by taking away their things, just teach their children mistrust and disrepect of others.
Some OCs are popular
I have to ask, was there some fanfic incident where an OC was without a doubt a self-insert?
...s03e21
my parents stole it, so i stole it back
cone....
background characters are OCs with predefined color schemes and hair
Like that one black one on ponibooru
:O
as far as using them as characters
I mean if a child freels powerless at home, it's more likely they'll bully at school to regain that power.
HI CONE!
07It needs to relate to the pony marathon ;)
Woot
like Pinkie having mounds of candy with her, Twilight talking over the movie, etc
oooh full metal panic....whats this about?
:(
>That black one // Nyx?
Why are we looking at Japanese stuff?
Nyx?
giant robots thats what
this anime...
Possibly
adult bank= sperm bank...
lol
halp
What's your prediction in how many people will show up for the starting episode?
anime ftw
!link nyx the_truth
giant robots thats why
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
unless every one is geting lots of lag I am inclined to belive it's not on my end
07and yes he is..
whaarghbll
and guns
i neeeed answers
sixthgate: It's about a guy who's been in combat zones since a kid, and he has no idea how normal society works
yeah that wouldn't work then >.<
pleease
I got "Abraham and Isaac: Sacrifice at Gettysburg" :p
OH SHIT
getting a little bit here
be a nice mufin
Hilarity ensues when he has to go to high school
Imma getting so much lag it hurts...
I could nver get into it because of the drawing style of this one =/
Also kickass giant robots
NUDE PERSON
and give e my answers
giant robots and giant boobs go together so well
/me goes back to tvtropes "Sorry, can't help you"
:(
13It kinda relates I think.
What about looking them up on the web?
i already said robots
ALSO
TESSA
meh
07Sumica?
13Though not specifically.
Oh man, Tessa <3
i uessss
also the robots =)
I had almost forgotten how moe she is
05like the thign i sketched for sathi while i was on vacation? :o
07It's lagging
13Maybe that idea would be best for a main banner for the site. lol
Tessa could be Fluttersh... >w>;
07my kitty?
07:D
Fluttershy*
bullshit, they were dead by then
xp
13Did I miss something? lol
Can't spell my own name.
OMG i need advide!!
dont like this
it's like, in the sentance "Tom went to the store.
maybe...
i mean thats what, 1800 years?
She could totally be Fluttershy
*advice
sixthgate Just look at tengen toppa...
haha!
The sentance is about Tom
my name is tom
so- oh wow
but anyway
13Mustve missed that one.
Should stream Fumoffu
feh i ran this ep already.
Sumica is there any way you can stop the stream and look at onNeutral?
05with the red drapes
05only showed it to sathi
Or.
Everypony loves Fumoffu
..
EVERYPONY
Yeah, what Orange said.
05and thiw was like, early july
wow, just the title makes me lol forever
13Awww. DX
no no so ive been trying to convert my friends to watch MLP with me, but
redd, also, google is awesome
I want to watch fma :1
You can't understand Fumoffu at all though unless you watch regular FMP first. o-o
well I'm gonna finish catching up on Fallout EQ cyas everypony
ive only had one sucessfull convert
that's up there with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
it's starting to lag quite a bit for me now, too...
Fuck my connection
05was about over a month between that i drew it and actually applied for a mod status
FOr me too.

/me is happy with Wrek in the team
New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: The Ballad of Gordon Freemane (Update Complete!) (http://tinyurl.com/3vacje4)
I nkwo
know
Heh...wow, that's actually a better example than I could come up with
Sumica: Everything ok? o-o
"Your missing out on some good stuff. Just give it a try."
I think.
agreed! Hurray for wrek!
IT'S MAGIC WE AINT GOTTA EXPLAIN SHIT
05*blush*
oh, weird but ok...
My school has a copy of "Pinocchio: Vampire Slayer" :0
gordan freemane... lol
Wrek's cutie mark would be a paintbrush
lol
now we must make it so
I came up with
07hah awesome idea
it's not magic, it's japanesse
i think ima go online gamin ppls thanks for all the info!
05inb4 team members custom OC corssovers
07the entire team with cutiemarks
Make an agreement with them where they have to watch the whole first season (not all at once) and you do something they really want you to do...
I told my friend "this sounds ridiculous, but it's actually a good show" and then showed him Derpy's original appearance as well as hers in Ep15 :P
05oshit what have i gotten myself into
13Hehe.
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: The Vagabond (Update Story 2 Complete!) (http://tinyurl.com/425va49)
O_o
07:D
Also, the Abraham and Isaac thing is about Lincoln's fatherly connection with his soldiers, so it's not as hilarious as it sounds :p
LOLL depy.
lol, I have no idea what my cutie mark would be >.<
*derpy
Story Dump?
I'd probably die a blank flank
hmm ill try that
derpy <3
I don't know all too much about nyx
someone explane
05an internet connection of 5 pins with only 1 pin active val
explain*
She's an OC from Past Sins.
07rofl
Oh
ima go now tho see u guys when season 2 airs! i hope. >,>
13I still basically see Octi as my OC, so I guess I already have one. lol
that's why I don't know. Hm.
Surprisingly, the author does a very good job of making it believable in FMP
>.<
alright, seeya
13Lmao
Bye sixthgate
13Haha
13Poor Val XD
Hey. Sumica?
I should know, I goddamn wrote an essay about Full Metal Panic in college
bye byeee
Ello Cynder
AND got a bloody A on it
where is the stream?
i don't have the hub ;A; i can't watch season 2
read Past sins
05ghosties would be transparent
that's where she came from if I recall
yeah, if that were my cutie mark, I would become the first mass murderer in Equestrian history
it's reloading
watch with us
not on tv!
DecapKing he had to reset.
Because it started to lag for people.
13Your cutie mark could actually be a working wifi spotter! :D

Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
O_o
or
1 days is a big difference D:
Srsly though. BRB. >>
fluttershy went all flutterage on us...
13Haha. <3
http://somepony.spreadshirt.com/vinyl-scratch-dj-pon-3-A7816489/customize/color/2
9I'm sorta back
Question time!
07lollolol
GET ONE THAT'S 20 PERCENT COO- er, sorry
9I feel like shit so I was laying down
13All the ponies be starin at Val's plot. :P
07Well Val / Octa.. if you can't maybe we could ask Fluttershy
Which episode was there a sleepover at Twilight's?
ok ok question time! everyone listen
Hope you'll feel better Folka :)(
Episode number
and name
6
ummmmm...
?
13To make the poster?
07yes
In Season 1
the name was look before you sleep...
*everyone opens youtube*
Lol
13Ah, its worth a shot. She might.
And the episode #?
but cant remember the number...
#
11?
9?
8 look before you sleep
05im still sad i never finished the LOTR event one
07But that banner idea Val had, I like it
lol
huh, interesting to note
Chrome, why you go boom?
13I've not seen any of her work. But I bet she'd do fine.
thankyou mlp-fim.com
:D
05i had such a huge concept in mind
xD
05ive seen ehr work
Correct Answer: Episode 8 - Look Before You Sleep
13Me too. As the sites main banner.
05she can do it
in the end, tis your call Master :P
All of you were close.
oki back online.
Nobody ever said you COULDN'T use YouTube.. or Google >.>
I got half of it right!
Sumica
Can u look at In Action?
I thought one of Chrome's advertising/selling/marketing/whatever points was that it doesn't go boom
9In other news
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmFEXNpmCLA&t=01m07s
well at least when it was still in it's beta stage
9you are now seeing this in your mind every time I perform a ban
pre 1.0
/me finishes another Tengen Toppa episode and joins this chat once again
RainbowDashCancel, I think most browsers try to have that as their selling point
Howdy there
/me :(
huh
And firefox 4 fails big time
MetalRainbowDash pleas give it a rest, I said i would look at it.
In other news, I, for one, am glad to welcome our new Pony Overlords.
now there's more lag for me....
2,14 lol DCD, when you gonna stream that smexyness again? :P
/me begs Sumica to take a look at In Action
07I was just brain-storming :)
They're up to 6 now.
umm...firefox has been on 6 for a while now
Oh ok
yeah
9hopefully during my birthday
9even if I have a lot of stuff to study
Tessa doesn't have boobs that big
i disagree
For some bizarre reason they suddenly got the idea that using Chrome's version numbering standard was a great idea.
Trying not to rage, must love and tolorate.
HEEEEYYYY... Check This OUUUT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEYR5O0PNpM
lol THAT anime
I wouldn't know, I use chrome, and when my computer bricked, I just started useing an ubuntu live cd with firefox 3 on it
cause Mozilla was like ``screw normal version numbers! Everyone else is on like 11! We're behind!''
ooo Fighting is magic =D
so they went to 5 and then 6 in like a month
nightly's on 9, I think
13I have the image in my mind and it looks perdy. lol
Yeah basically, Xiagu.
Check this out ppl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUxchZUSaSM
weee I can't wait to that game to come out!
lol
13Lmao. :P
/me agrees with dashie
I just read there have been power outages in California
i find it painfully ironic that i was just drawing some giant pony mecha when i find FMP running on bronystate XD
in Arizona as well
im kinda sucky in fighting games but, I'll get better just for this one
back!
FUMOFFU
Wonder if Nevada and Utah got anything
9wait what, FMP?
yey
9>loads the stream
The link I sent above the YT video is In Action

howdy there Fluttershy
it's some good videos
9sweet
prism*
Yes, DCD
eeyup
I never see any one giving you so much flack for programing Luna >_<
9I really should finish watching this series
I thought this was your doing
It's silly, because with the amount of revising that goes on with Firefox, they'll be on version 1000 or something daft like that in no time.
9oh hey I had watched this episode
9forever ajapn
/me 2,14 cries
9Val
A prisim shirt, sounds like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon
Oh hi Applejack! ^^

No derpy I didn't mean that...
!moon
Grab my tail, JackiePie!
6My cutie mark would be something. . . . not sure what though. . .
05why the cry cal?
It's about some person reviewing computer viruses in action
that is for 2 reasons
9I'm hoping OG2 PS3 comes statesside though
9here
as they're infecting.
:D
05val*
20 PERCENT COOLER?!
YEAAAAAAHHHHHHH
Ugh, now the stream is being worse to me
1) because anime isn't nearly as well received
Damn This lag. Damn This Lag To Hell.

Sorry to hear that, that happened to me recently too.

9that if Caramel ever appeared in them
Making Derpy doubleflip isn't that difficult.
05we all are
maybe now it will lag less...
You know, I never really consider myself a "brony," per se. I like the show, but don't really participate much in fan followings...
must, not, say.....
Then you call Comcast, "Oh yeah, we were working on the internet then, didn't ya know?" -_-'
2,14 no idea what Battle for Equestria is
/me realizes her farm lacks eletricity
6Val would explode? ;D
aw fuck it

:(
The thank you, thank you was not natural :P
bow chicka wow wow

2,14 but if it's a fanfic you KEEP YOUR DIRTY HANDS OFF MAH CARAMEL
i say ponies

9it's a comic

/me flips a muffin
/me catches the muffin with her mouth and eats it before anyone can see which side is up

Huh? Oh, yeah. ^^; Sorry.

You can 1 all you want but pony eps are only ran on Fridays Movie night
there are quite a few commands using times actually
13Octavia needs to be in there too, of course. ;)

Give this lag THE STARE, it might work >=)
13Dont you forget me! >:|

-takes a deep breath, then opens her eyes wide, staring hard at the screen-
what is on right now?
still lagging for me, too
05such a scene
May Luna guide you, johnsey
How about I shoot this lag in the face with my golden magnum?
05I think would be alot more fitting
05for a mian banner
05main*
13A bubble each coming from OCti and Vinyl bantering what the other said, might be funny.
she does the impossible now lol
Tomorrow he'll play some MLP
05or site art
im gonna love and tolerate this lag with my Meltagun
13Thats what I said too Wrek.
She's talented, that gal.
Caramel has to have this dumbfounded look as he searches for his favorite candy, which has just been swiped by his trolling sister: Toffee
darn it, dis lag's sure tough >=C
05it has way too much potential for a single event
Grrr....
Derpy has afterimages
That's why she's the mailmare. ^_^
Dat song
BAD LAG!
Pinkie Pie's been teaching her.

Where's Twahlight when we need her?
pootis
/me prepares a baricade of pillows...
Oh snap, Derpy can control time to increase her speed
Sry Luna, your night was quite a treat so far, but it's 3 am and i need to sleep.
10hey maan
howdy there RBD
13We're suggesting that be our main banner. :P
-gasps, falls over, twitching-
you still all geting it or is it the vocal few?
07You want her to do the main banner?
05as for the season 1 "stream"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4W7Ff7Pf58&feature=related
bye telofy
All we need is space control and she can be an unstoppable deity.
Wouldn't that make her the pony version of The Flash?
/me pokes Fluttershy
/me bucks the lag even harder
/me pokes Fluttershy again
05the concept might not be as fitting
13Oh, I didnt mean for anyone in particular to do it. Just the idea.
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Key Chains and Ponies With Suitcases (http://tinyurl.com/3d9zoqe)

/me explodes
/me is about to rage due to lag.
05im thinking
05hmm
/me pokes Fluttershy again
/me watches as the lag slowly consumes all...
Well that also sorta gives Derpy the ability to teleport
I did my best... but it's so... laggy...
... You know I'm glad I skimmed that
13Its a little broad and big for just the marathon S1 stream honestly. But it would make a great site main banner.
That was just bad...
anything with Caramel and Toffee will instantly make me squee :P
/me pokes Fluttershy again
This is the kid that goes Seed mode for panties
They do LOL
awww...
doesn't work well on others who can control time
Hi.
/me protects Fluttershy from DecapKing's poking

/me uses her lasso to bind DecapKing

/me pokes Applejack again
Is it just me, or does Twi look bald in the pic of her in that post?

One day, The world will understand and stop hating. Untill then i wait
And have some of my less-understanding family members and friends look at me wierd
13Sounds like a good idea.
You realize that, by nature of his role as your mom's "connection", he probably knows of, and is very good at, keeping client secrets
Weird*

11NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Well im not exactly open about it, But if anyone were to ask i would come fourth with it
11They made a Rainbow Dash version..

RainbowJack sounds like a fabulous pirate, imo.
/me regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches mexican, showing her most adorable kissing face
O.o
Muffins!! You have any? :3
^3^
yes
11Herospirit.. Why would you post that D=
11iSad
Well, I don't go around saying, "I'm a brony, join the herd." but I don't bother hiding the few toys I've gotten and the art I've drawn in my room.
!muffins
Muffins!! You have any? :3
/me trots in with a dead bird in his mouth
Yes, I have honey muffins.
Thank you!!
sooooo.... wich is better?
/me glomps HoneyWhistle
So Fluttershy could make it better. D:
no sense in forcing everypony else into hearing you singing mlp songs when they dont want to.
6Dayjob orchestra Wrek? c;
/me he then drops it in front of CogWeaver
13We rock? Woo hoo~
RainbowJack =3

Blums, isn't that how the herd grows, though?
Alrighty then...
07yay?
well, i openly sing to mlp
I'm going to have to go with the pirate :P
I'm going to have a giant pony poster in my room soon \o/
11Maybe I will once I have these files downloaded
as they all have no idea what im singing
11>.<
see? :D
People don't know about my bronyism
i had a feeling that a hug would work
13Do we want to put the logo in a small screen?
well it also lessens your chances of converting them if you do it every. day.
05i think it wont be in a cinema per se, it would jsut feature the text with the mane 6 around it posed differently and popcorn and soda all around
But I don't hide it
-hyperventilates, then... passes out-
Fooby, hell yes giant pony posters
Fooby, what is it going to be a poster of?
Ten Our fusion shall be known as RAINBOWJACK!
I think... she's better now
*then
It was the title-picture of a drawfriend
i think im going to draw RD in my wall
several drawfriends ago
I need some more pony merch
05ill link you VioletVanilla btw
Is passing out normal for her?
The one with the hydra
i got a rarity
I wish the world would stop hating on bronies, It would make my life so much easier
so... my friend's girlfriend bought me the pony bedspread
/me pulls a blanket out of his saddle bags
I'll take a picture once I put it together and hang it up -- I used BlockPosters to make it
Xiagu has bedspread? o:
/me puts the blanket on the passed out fluttershy
xD
Lucky colt, you.
/me is flamboyantly brony at college and NOBODY IS HATING ON HIM
im going to just guess, no
Ponies is now a good 30% of my life now, And it's a shame i have to hide it to avoid mocery and ridicule
07and we are back :)
Fooby, I will have it by the end of the week, most likely

I need to hide some things
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps ColtPhelps
Too long.
You were in the Magnet program, right?
Or i am teased
05you have our general thoughts and ideas, from ehre you do what you think is best
My School is pretty damn tolerant
That's kind of the home school for that
13Could have the whole background be a giant screen with "BronyState" on it and covered up a bit by the ponies in the foreground. *shrugs*
05also, VioletVanilla
05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3aqD5w4qs
Teasing is not too common
But if anyone were to ask i would agree to being a watcher of ponies
this lag better clear up soon... or we might have some trouble with season 2...
Plorf, yep, unlike apparently 90% of the internet, my high school didn't suck ass
Nor do i lower my voice when i talk of ponies
Same here Xiagu
I didn't get here until just as the last show cut out, so I can't really compare lag before/after...
My bro was a magnet, and did a ton of stuff
07it's still laggy....
aah...
13lol
And somehow didn't get into UMD
07We had a perfect streaming tv test
It was Toooataly laggy!
Plorf, that's sort of sad unless he didn't apply
But did get into like, Carnegie Mellon, Drexel, Rensselaer
etc.
07liar!
since like 99% of the magnet gets into umd
I wonder it it's just due to internet crowding or something along those lines... during certain times of day the internet just gets... laggy
He did apply
wait. that story is familiar
/me pokes fluttershy
you know him apparently
I saw you on his Skype contacts xD
I may know him
it was after we watched ... i think it was Jem...
/me agrees with both RainbowDash and Fluttershy
Well I'm gonna go
07Yem slowed us all down!
Burn Notice was working fine though too wasn't it?
Night
What time is it where you life Fluttershy?
I know how to wake up a Pony. Tell me if I should or not.
07yep
night
I left around the beginning of that.
05I blame Jem
bye
live*
straaange... It was!
2,14 I blame Trixie
You guys watched Burn Notice and I wasn't here for it? T_T
no
Oh! Oh!
look! it's Mugen :D
It's 7:30 PM
Silly Trixie. Trix are for kids.
13Oh no, not DJO!
A'ight.
dam lag]
I wont.
Mugen!
2,14 >mfw Fluttershy is in the same timezone as me O_o
nah. its 2:30 am
It started lagging... when we started watching Star whatever...
it's 22:26 here
9:30 PM here
=actually do it
Hi
Ahoy
Hi
its 10:30 here...
Plorf, don't remember who it was, but that story is familiar
ValtheJean: o-o so where do you live?
you certain? It may be... a bit of a startle to her
05yes
05DJO
2,14 Provo Utah *hides*

05the cause of many laughs in ym life
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNLjOuYSFQ&feature=player_embedded
6You two are like. . . . Not very far from each other. o:

11Its safe to say im just gonna download this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6467987/My_Little_Pony__Friendship_is_Magic_-_Season_1_-_1080p_MKV
13These guys are indeed kinda funny.
It must be a work of FATE!
07<Fluttershy> Hmmm I have an idea then... I'll draw a sketch and send it to you via email, if that's alright. Where should I send it to?
07sure
07send it to BronyState@gmail.com
07<Fluttershy> kk. I'll work on that right now actually. o-o I'm currently passed out in the Bunker and they're speculating how to wake me up.
So it's still doing it?
11Because downloading them individually on Megaupload.. Meh
doing what?
2,14 so there ARE bronies out there! M life...it is fulfilled
VioletVanilla: u mean me and RainbowDash?
We sure have a lot connections, don't we Xiagu
05hug her from all of us
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q351Dr011Pc&feature=related

Plorf, yes, it's really weird
Need to do that
05did you read the forum?
07ahahaha
Derpy: NOO! You'll break the muffin maker!
07dat question
ValtheJean: Oh! I live in Springville!
07I was typing it!
6She did, read last night's/this morning's post~
05dat asnwer
I do, but my memory is so god damn awful
(I got 10 bucks that say it is either disterbing pr0nz or viruses)
ValtheJean: Yay! Only 7 miles away from me! ^^
Weren't people getting kicked during Batman for posting links?
blarg, I'll go check it now :P
/me pulls a tray full of muffins out, then starts loading them into a clearly overdesigned cannon shaped vaguely like a muffin.
2,14 no kidding?
6Short answer yes.
2,14 that's pretty awesome, not going to lie
http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png
13Oh yeah havent been on the forums yet today.
Alrighty
2,14 now the world suddenly doesn't feel so lonely and cruel
Click the white boc
box
05octavia, you froze your dick?
ValtheJean: Well currently attending Snow College actually o-o But I go home on the weekends
oooh
05oh DJO how you amuse me
oooooh
what is it what is it what is it what is it?
thats the box thingy!
6Long answer, since she has only been around for about a week and 0 BMN's we thought it would be best if she familiarized herself better with the rules and BronyState as a whole before becoming a mod.
2,14 ah
can I get a sneak peak at some epic season 2 footage?
The black (kinda unreadable)
says
ValtheJean: You know where Snow is right?
Hold on
2,14 BYU myself... *once again, hides*
the black thing that u cant read

says
13lol Wrek
/me begins to fire muffins into the air at random, resulting in a shower of fresh-baked muffins.
Season 2 Episode 1: The return of Harmony
2,14 ee...no...no I don't...I fail >.<

First Production DVD

6Attack of the snow!

I can PM you what some stuff has.
05for some reason when i watch this, i crave for roastbeef perogees
ValtheJean: Haha it's okay. ^^; I'm the only one who's gone to Snow thus far. Both my mom, dad and sister attended BYU tho
13Wait, we're talking about that Fluttershy?
so your friends with Lauren Faust huh?...
/me puts a slightly different metal object into an oven.
Tasty.
ValtheJean: I practically grew up on the BYU campus d;
6Makes sense of senseless sense lol Wrek I laugh at the video. . .
2,14 ah, well either way I should know more about that state I'm living in :P
13I thought we were talking about LoveFluttershy.
Yep
I am
RainbowDash: I call hax
oooooooooooooooh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfJR6sAo0CU&NR=1 <-- probably one of my favourite Rainbow Dash moments ever.
soooo... how did you meet her?
this is the one where like, all the recruitment happened within like 4 hours
07eyup
and I felt betrayed :P (j/k)
07amazing right?
ValtheJean: It would be fun to meet irl ^^ Bronies in Utah! Yay!
6LOL am I seeing what I think I see?
Long story bro.
13So... I'm confused now slightly.
2,14 wewt!
07it was like go GIRL POWER and Ghostie
6Somepony claiming to be friends with Lauren Faust? XDD
Tl:Dr version?
^
4Yes, it was
TL DR
Dude no way? I'll be moving to Salt Lake for college in October!
?
07Suddenly!
/me feels so betrayed
07Ghosties!
Yep
too long didnt read
You'll prob say TL;DR
I mean, I know I was saying we had to speed up the process and all :P
Ik what it stands for
6It was the best night ever!
/me pulls they object out and takes it over to a curtained-off counter.
okz
4Hi
TrollightSparkle: Oh really? I'm going to be going to the Anime con there in October. It's Anime Banzai. ^^
I like it too, it's of the few time she acts like a girl
6 3 girls to 1 Ghost
2,14 way to be trollightsparkle, Utah Bronies unite!
Soo yeah. That's the photo of the S2E1 DVD
6<3
:)
http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png
Que es Anime Banzai, btw?
This was the instant I became a brony
:O
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivDAMr6GfHU
then were you just walkin down the street when suddenly... BOOM! Lauren Faust?
Twilight told me this video is about Rainbow Dash - are you a spy?
4Hehe, it was like I was never there~ /peeping Tom
Yeah.
Are u a mind reader?
6D<
lol
me?
/me facehoofs
nope
Yes.
13Wait... that MetalRainbowDash says hes friends with Lauren?
Cuz u knew what kinda happened.
/me smacks Ghostie, but her hoof goes through him.
073 girls and a ghost sounds funny for a cartoon!
my favorite pinkie pie moment is when she and RD are preping to prank spike
6IT'S LIKE MAGIC!
wow... seriously?
I dunno why, but the animation where she looks between her hooves always looked really good
:O NOBODY CARES THAT I HAVE A DVD OF SEASON 2 EPISODE 1?!?
And yes.
I cares!
/me still feels betrayed. Is now going back to his promise to never hug Luna again :P
anyyywaaay I need to brb ><
Don't believe me of the S2E1 DVD? Look at this photo I took
http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png
its quiet......
07WAAAT :'(
I'll be back asap tho!
/me blackmails MetalRainbowDash for the S2E1 DVD
6That is the DVD cover. . . on the black market maybe <.<
Show some footage and we can know the truth...
/me goes back to her foreveralonecorner
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8JCX9E0bEI&NR=1 datdashface
yep
How can I just put a dvd in and just stream it
if it makes you feel better, I'm adding Octavia and Violet to the list :P
VioletVanilla just what I thought!
I have to rip the whole entire Part 1 and 2 which takes a while
6First off, if ANYPONY had a DVD of it, they would be shot by Lauren herself for spreading it around the internet.
11Is it now?
/me /)^ε^(\
nope
You buy it and next thing you know.. BAM! You're watching G1 Ponies.
11Then make some noise.
13Yeah...
lol
It's a real DVD.
oh god that one loops lol
soooo... we shall never know the truth?
13As a friend of someone who actually works on the show, I'm more than skeptical honestly.
Not JUST G1 Ponies, but G1 Ponies in Swedish :o
you've watched it?
And you ppl just don't care that I have it
Yes I have
4AHAHAH! It's like I'm not even there *rubs transparent hands together*
I know what happens in the end.
13Yeah...
lol
But I can't tell you because it would count as a spoiler.
there's no real good clip of mine lol
/me 13isnt even going to say anything
And you probably wouldn't watch it when it comes on Sep. 17
yeah I cant think of a better way of putting this: who do I follow for episode torrents for season two?
6Secondly, to come bragging around a random Brony site would be less than smart for someone with that.
but I dont care about spoiler
I CARE
/me glomps Octavia for no real reason
*ahem* I care.
/)ಠεಠ(\
13Wow, this kid is full of shit.
Brevity: No idea yet.
wub of disapproval
So u dont care if u get the ending and don't watch it
ah...
13Wait, what list now? lol
http://www.image-upload.net/images/dup6xwjpwj2lhyetvwim_thumb.png
TrollightSparkle, there is such love for you.
Was AFK, read through all the above
lol, I kinda want him to apply for modship so we can shoot him down
nope
/me starts loading what looks suspiciously like cupcakes into the giant, overdesigned cannon.
13lol Decap XD
I got them from a site that specifically uploaded them, I got the link from pony chan
05who?
/me 13is glomped

VioletVanilla, huh?
Wario Land is way too good
metalrainbowdash
I care to hear what you claim to be the ending to the 1 ep of season 2
/me picks a random pony to glomp.

13Metal... honestly, I think you're lying. But thats me.

Hello
13And I actually DO have a friend who works on the show. I highly doubt hes friends with Lauren somehow.
well theres the obsessing over him during The Ticket Master, but he seems to have gotten over that. otherwise he was at the donut shop, so for all Spike knows shes available
6Hallo Moongaze!
Ok so just for lying
/me got to go as well, since her and RainbowDash study in the same school (HAHA!) c yall later (tomorrow...MAYBE) and she still doesn't believe in MetalRainbowDash story

13Thats all.
6Alllright there AppleJack! <3 See you all later!
Brevity, there's a cut at the donut shop, hiding the mane six describing how the night totally sucked for them
My gonna kick you?
13We dont hate you or anything.
i might
Btw I thought from a view it looked KINDA real.
hum... never thought about that Sketchy
Just about 15%
it's pretty possible since Twilight probably was around Celestia alot
oh I see seems I dot have the right name for it any more.
13It was an aweful photoshop image.
/me comes to Luna's corner :3
13I could tell that a mile away.
It wasn't from photoshop.
and spike usually went where Twilight goes
6I am here for you. ^.^
11Also, that MLP season 2 opening: As sung by the US Marine Corps
13It was photoshopped.
Exactly.
It was from Paint.NET
2,14 MS paint is just as bad :P
07rtmp://live.veemi.com/live?u=BronyStateWillNEVERSurrender&p=H8T8M0W
07BronyStateWillNEVERSurrender
6but why Val? What did I do? D:
13Same thing.
how does one link to specific moments in youtube video's?
I made a fake DVD cover to trick u ppl (Which failed epicly)
Applejack is in here, we will not tolerate dishonesty
So he probably already knew Blueblood was a colossal arse.
13That term basically means anything altered in such a way.
11!!!
blueblood is not related to celestia
you were part of the betrayal :P
Lol, I love that comment
:p
11When did that Boombox get in here
13Yeah, that trick didnt work out so well. :P

Or right click on the red bar and select "Copy video URL at specific time"
http://miburl.com/CMViNE
Lol but some people actually make it look real.
^ works too
11Your picture went bye-bye.
6I take art stealing/lies very seriously.
13Especially considering some of us are artists and graphic designers. We can spot that stuff pretty easily. :P
Vanilla does not tolerate dishonesty; mental note.
07have some seaponies
Hmm
05octavai got a point
05Octavia*
Artists and Graphic Designers eh?
13lol Herospirit
unable to plublish error.
Can you make me a logo for my series?
that worked
http://miburl.com/CMViNE
I agree with Octavia, though I'm not too great at art of any kind ^^'
07oh great...
I've spent enough time noticing all my own mistakes in my art. It becomes easier to notice it in others. :p
05My little liars, paint is magic
13Wrek would be the one to talk to about that. Not sure what he charges. :P
6I have had stuff outright stolen from me and then claimed as someone else's before. I will not tolerate that kind of thing.
13lol
2,14 I'd also like to remind everyone that harmful trolling is against the rules :P
07welll
I really need a logo for my series.
07looks like our stream is over
http://miburl.com/CMViNE
I tried making one in Photoshop. But idk if it is good
it was a good run at least :P
I'll let you people see it.
07unable to publish
Violet holds grudges; mental ote
13Yeah.. now MetalRainbowDash is WAYYYYYYYYYY on my NO list for mod. lol
13NO NO NO and a million times NO lol
yeah
he's on my "let's toy around with him as long as possible" list :P
she secretly plots to destroy me
13lol :P
05Ik now the feelign VioletVanilla.
mental note*
/me hugs VioletVanilla
6I do not hold grudges herospirit. :| I have just had it happen before so I am wary of it and do not take it lightly.
lol @ DecapKing
I like the intro announcement on here.
These mental notes may come in handy.
ty
/me hugs Wrek back.
/me sips some tea
11Lol
okay
Violet, you are Serious Business
6Glad you like it Darcemeus! ;3
Dumb backspace.
but she is plotting to destroy me in secret
hai hai
on the other hoof, /I/ hold grudges for a long time *hit*
so I came here because I'm interested in this pony thing that's going on in the internet right now
due to network error at server,steam name in use or not athorised.
11ohai Mirthtinker, RS
07yep getting the same error
6I am serious business when it comes to stuff like lying and stealing.
Dumb rock!
Hooooooh yeah it's awesome.
I demand that dari's topic be taken down >.>
hey Mirth
I see that you still have your wings
Dumb sock!
(as suggested by Silver)
I don't hold grudges. I prefer to release my anger in bursts of fury.
so... why ponies?
Dumb lock!
13People used to steal my art for icons and such CONSTANTLY a while back, but most didnt claim it as their own work, so I shrugged it off.
yeah, something went wrong with that sigil, I can't turn back!
Make a mental note of that.
6Poor Luna, I will sing seapony songs! n.n
Because ponies are freakin' AWESOME!
because ponies
6SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO~
Oh. Speaking of grudges, I need to check up on something... *Fires up WoW*
he said you should turn back in a week
Ugh I cant find it
11I may be able to help with that...
Hold on
Octavia, I wish my shit was good enough that people wanted to steal it.
13Should have said "used" instead of "steal" in that sense.
so in a way, i feel a bit better. But in another way I feel bad.
NO
Link me to your art and ill print it out and hang it on my wall.
XD
I mean, uh, thanks but I'm alright until he gets back
VIOLETVANILLA WHY DO YOU WANT TO DESTROY ME?!?!?!?
also, is he coming on tonight?
Do you want the short answer or the psychological answer/
because ponies
Thats worse than someone using it for an icon, isnt it?
^ short answer
6I apologize if I went against the rules for kicking him, and I do not mean to be a jerk, but that kind of thing gets on my nerves. . . :|
psychological
Hold on
11Oh...kay.
he left a while ago to go eat
I like psychological
I have a facebook page that has the logo
Hold on
or something like that
13lol Rainbow_Dash X3
so he'll be on later maybe? *puppy eyes*
my friend on this LGS forum I post on keeps linking me to pony videos
Rainbow_Dash, you don't want it. I suck.
so I'm curious
:0
>mfw it hasn't shown up on my client you kicked him O_o
i wouldnt know, not in contact with him
GRRM, have you watched any of the show yet?
WATS UP EVERYPONY!
I actually dont want anyones, I was kidding
MLP:FIM, combined with the internet, allows men to let out the sort of feelings generally kept inside and protects them via the anonymity of the internet
6I do not want to destroy you DecapKing. . . .-.
Plus
Ponies are adorably cute
I have to many pictures I want to print out already..
13I bet some people have have printed some of my nicer pieces to hang up or such, I dunno. :P
/me hugs DecapKing~
a little bit
05its ok VioletVanilla
LIES!!!
Pretty much.
11Hey, I just found this... Thing.
We like the show. The show is good
like the first half of the one with the dragon on the mountain
Yes, the show is genuinely awesome
I'm doing this while writing a paper for uni
13Impending Doom 3
13!
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE-fZ5ETCPQ
6He came back, which is fine because he is not causing trouble anymore. . .
is it a bow chicka wow wow thing?
05octavia
HOLY SHIT
05stop ignoring me
11It's... A thing.
05*sadface*
YOU! OBEY THE FIST
11Yeah.
Ohai
seen it
2,14 continue to ignore him Octavia...give into your anger. LET THE POWER OF THE DARK-SIDE CONTROL YOU
I like the songs
Why do I, I straight 19 year old male, find these ponies so cuite!
but like I'm a grown man... I'm afraid to like it
I can activate fury mode.
cute things are cute. you cant deny that
11Well, what was your original reaction?
13Aww, sorry Wrek. <3
4I activate Rainboom Vanguard mode!
there are 20 and 30 year olds watching it... 40s even
True, but normally, cute doesn't attract 19 year old males
But my rage bar has a high maximum.
Ok
4Oh wait out of context?
well.. i cant draw full metal panic: the seccond friendship at 3am. (not well anyway) g'night fillies'ncolts
Here is the logo I made
Indeed.
4Yep
http://www.image-upload.net/viewer.php?file=pg9z2j7wpdzh50nb1zbg.jpg
I know
but it's like
I don't know
IF this show was just cute, it wouldn't be as popular
Ponies are sweaping the world. Just accept it.
that the people who can solve 4x4 rubix cubes will just have more stuff to do...its like an expansion pack :D
GRRM, I'm 30, I'm a systems administrator, I drink scotch, I listen to jazz....and I like ponies.
I'm 21
The link I put above is the logo
sooooo
I'm not afraid to admit I'
well...not JUST jazz
I'm fairly homophobic
/me pokes MirthTinker
/me pokes MirthTinker again
9Val
/me pokes MirthTinker again
9I am proud
truthfully I listen to pretty much everything
GRRM, you are in phase 1 or 2 or around there
well that's not good... being homophobic
9you have learned well.
GRRM, give it a few days
Octavia
And I still walk around whistling or humming the themesong or Winter Wrap Up
11...
2,14 sorry, forgot the R :P
MCafee tells me no. No image upload for me.
Look at the link I sent above
6Natleyn!! ^.^
roushguy, you and I are going to have issues then.
I liked the ARt of The dress thing
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
2,14 lol
Or below
http://www.image-upload.net/viewer.php?file=pg9z2j7wpdzh50nb1zbg.jpg
its intimidating
I don't go gaybashing or things
Violet! :D
9so no harm done
07a moment please
/me hugs VioletVanilla
/me plops on the ground and curls up into a ball
hes angry
hes german
Are we shouting things now?
and hes a kid!
I sing equestria girls along to california girls when it comes on the radio
It just makes me extremely uncomfortable whenever the topic is brought up
13I saw it MRD, you can stop posting it. lol
2,14 I've been browsing Super Robot Taisen vids because of you DCD :P
BUST- WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLF
How is it?
oh
11Oh my sounds serious
/me hugs Fluttershy, then curls up on the ground
hey Silvermane
It's not restricted to male homosexuality either
I don't so much like the music as I do the characters
hey guys
/me pokes Silvermane
Female homosexuality is just as uncomfortable to me
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
/me hugs Natleyn~ :3
13Eh, it needs work still. It just takes a lot of trial and error and practice.
6How are you doing?
05you still havent replied oct
Well at least I tried -_-
I won't go into that topic on a pony board
HUBBY!
13I will Wrek, sorry. XD
Fluttershy is away at the momeny
but
2,14 I just finished watching Dai-Gaurd take on a Heterodyne
*moment
yeah
hi tinkerbelle
please leave a hug at the beep
*beep*
well, I'm from Toronto. I grew up around LGBT communities
I was feeding my dogs
6I like some of the text you used Metal, the effects of the shadow on it are cool~
that's fine. i just wanted to hug something soft and fluffyish
The show just has the perfect mix of everything
hell my gf's sister is lesbian.
that's nice
Thanks
The characters are really likable
11In this chat: poking ponies.
6It is good for a first banner. Do not stop working at it!
I want this freaking Ponyville MC Map
the writing is excellent
hey
I don't know man... I'M A GROWN MAN
indeed.
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
AND I LIKE PONIES
anyone heard of nyan cat?
indeed Razyn
AAAAAAH
GRRM, and there's nothing wrong with that
also, its really hard to do things you're normally used to doing with magic, how do you pegasi and Earth ponies use your mouths for everything?
I don't know who to talk to about this
...
PREACH IT GRRM!
6Of course Hat~ ;D
Didn't I show u that like a few hours ago
GRRM, us.
;)
lol
very carefully
2,14 I have never heard of said poptart cat that expels rainbows while singing a looped song before
we're like you
GRRM, there's only one thing to do...
yes
practice
a brony
i can't stop watching it
6The true questions is
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
/me gasps for air for a moment
Well
:3
ValtheJean yes you do know.
...more pony.
This reminds me of that scene from spongebob
what DecapKing?
throw a party?
alright well
/me 11has quite a bit of respect for woodworking non-unicorns
i've been nyan'd for 70 minutes
I don't know if I like that term
^
:o
bro kind of reminds me of frat boys
"I'M A BRONY AND I'M PROUD!!"
they're adding us on mibbit
I belive Lauren said that the show was made for both genders. Right?
nothing, just waiting for some type of reaction
Nice.
ZA WARUDO!
and i'm loving every moment!
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
and brony just seems like it's a weird word
TOKI WO TOMARE!
13...
1 Hour and 10 mins.
/me hugs herospirit
She intended it to be for family instead of just little girls.
they make hoof caps that hold equipment. Like Octavia has one for her bow
/me shakes off froth on mouth
Epic sax guy for 10 hours..
Lauren said that the show was made for little girls, and their parents
GRRM, it is a weird word.
bro + pony
GRRM, just give it time
Take all the time you need.
nothin weird about it
MUDA DA! MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA!!!
Fuuu- Right.
Hat
Only made it through one hour :P
11 9_9
13SIC EM!
Soshite, toki ga ugoki desu.
Go to 1227.com
/me pokes MrPeddington
But hey. Nothing worng with being a brony.
10GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOW!
George RR Martin is a weird word
awww
/me curls up tighter, now cowering
Just all I'm sayin'
Your browser dances to Epic Sax guy
lol
lol
Hero, that combo is silly
should i take the precaution of turning the volume to maX?
SAXR0LL3D
hehe, I'm working on possibly my most ambitious pony fan-art piece since I started watching the show
It's not even damage efficient
Yes
Do tell!
Iknowright Natleyn
6Random disconnect on me?
its like the bears i used to wrestle when i was about the size of Silvermane
13oh noes!
it's a PMV set to Royksopp's "Happy Up Here"
Looks nice, though.
sooooo long ago
Hey Violet.
11Oh MrPeddington. You're as... Charming as ever.
But the awesome factor makes it better.
reset by peer
im getting saxrolld
scootaloointeresting.jpg
I prefer to play Chaca, 'cause its actually hard
6Hallo~
13I forgot, Peddington takes commands from my magic, without it feeding his senses he's operating on his own!
6Hmmm. . . Odd.
but it's not really using much footage from the show
oh dear
ive got it
VioletVanilla
or umm
/me 10flails wildly
11:\
testing
whatever your name is
cool
10GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOW!
I'm attempting to animate as much of it originally as possible
Ummm
/me charges MrPeddington to the ground
/me rolls over, looking away
I had to work during the load test. How did things go?
oh man
And 'cause if I get timing right on countering, every human player I fight against gets angry when I block everything :3
why do I feel so weird about htis
6How are you doing Sumica? ^^ Good job on your stream!!
heh
which is a bloody feat...because I can't draw and I suck with flash
Soooo. Being the only brony in my school sucks.
this takes me back to the old country
OK when will the streaming come back?
lol this sax guy is epic
...Now I wanna play fighting games.
GRRM, I felt the same way
/me groans slightly
And suddenly I am Viola. . .
(yfw yes, I AM that dedicated to established background and not retconning material...usually)
You want to hear cute overload?
gets better when you tell someone that you know won't judge you
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLQW_DKQQ8g
Twilight told me this video is about Foozogz - This Song Made Man A Fluttershy
13lol I noticed that. :P
I'd play Jojo's, but I've only met one guy who had it and a dreamcast.
And story mode isn't much fun.
hey Balloons
The real question is why care what other people say?
New "Fighting is Magic" theory:
^
Gamerdude260, school is a very weird environment
Hello
Also I love that song
There should be quotes in there some where.
so what do i do with him now?
6Natleyn~ ;3
Flutterstare = Fluttershy's Za Warudo
School is werid.
I met a brony at my colleg
college*
6How are you doing?
11(What's that part where the pendulum is held called?)
Luckkky.
cause back in the old country we would kill them
She was actually a girl
oh whoa
lol
I know one of you guys
Lots of casual bronies at my college.
why care what other people enjoy? It's none of your business now is it? lol
and i doubt you would want that to happen
Moi? o-o;
I haven't even gotten to play Jojo's :[
4Sath, did you upload MetalRainbowDash's app on the forum?
We are naturally social people
hey Westy543
SixSpeed, I believe much the same...however far too few people share our enlightened views
pfft I have little doubt I'm the only brony at my university, but that doesnt affect my enjoyment
People want to spread what they think is awesome
sup GRRM
13well, he's just acting up a bit because he's upset, but he'll calm down. After that he just acts like a normal obedient bear
I want
Streaming
To
Come
back!
6Yes you silly filly! ;D
PONIES!
...so? Don't bring it up.
how's red alert mod coming?
VIoletVanilla
ung...can't even play a youtube vid without buffering...god I hope they fix this problem soon
10GRAOW!!!! graow.....gr...oaw?
6Yes dear child?
Silvermane doesn't need consent
I'm a bit tired, but I'm in a good mood. Thanks :3
/me ears perk up
what happens if i give him vodka?
...? ...*
Can you helps me on my logo
okay, I think my favorite pony is Pinkie Pie
red alert mod? as in C&C Red Alert?
Alright
And how's Violet doing today?
Butttt. I am going to blast Winter Wrap Up at the end of winter at the end of winter this year
13...he has no stomach Decap
rofl...he's asking for help on his logo now?
Pinkie Pie is awesome
:'(
11Good idea.
seemed ok till masive lag lots of complaing about lag then seems cant publish to site any more.
consent is for those who are afraid to apologize and deliver flowers
13Yeah, he was.
As in Red Alert: A Path Beyond
also
which one, 1, 2 or 3?
I love Rarity and Fluttersy myself
but you can't doubt the cute overload that is Fluttershy
13he's a /clockwork/ teddy bear
Fluttershy*
11Can I Mirth? Just once?
It's an indie shooter that seeks to recreate Red Alert 1 as an FPS.
it's probably just a server issue
/me groans and rolls over on the ground
Fluttershy
/me 13is gonna shoot down his app faster than RD can sonic rainboom
13do what?
which means not your fault :P
You cannot fight the D'awwwww
Fluttershy is okay
I've got Derpy on my login screen on my laptop. It shows up all the time at school. Nobody says anything, so I don't bring it up.
Fluttershy is my favorite. Though she's kind of set there in stone. The others fight for second. Right now second is Rainbow Dash.
Ugh and the BronyState ppl haven't responded to my thing asking for the application
6I am achey and tired as well. It is 3:58AM here and I am thinking of going to bed soon. . .
but I like Pinkie Pie
O-o
10 seconds flat
Fluttershy is like every cute nerd girl I ever had a crush on in high school
Luna is best pony
she's funny
wait, this is a teddy bear?
13Even faster. :P
That wouldn't worry me if it was anyone else
Twilight is best mane 6
who is Luna?
!link Fluttershy
We need to ponyify this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bkY9ZS-9BA&feature=related
(Also free!) http://westy.cncfps.com/Pics/APB/rockets.jpg
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/32784
why are you afraid of a simple teddy bear?
6What kind of help on the logo do you need?
the streamers are off line
but all ponies have a place in my heart
Like effects
is she a character that's introduced later?
and stuff
I always liked the cute ones, Fluttershy and Luna have been tied for first for a while now
4Where is MRD's app?????
I kinda switch. First was fluttershy, then rarity. Then pinkie Pie. Now Im iffy between RD and Pinkie
Twilight lifts up Rarity to try and find Philomena.. wat
yeah? why's that
GRRM, Nightmare Moon after she turns back into a normal pony.
oh
6KILL IT
13Hopefully lost in time and space.
that must be an earlier episode
SPOILER OH GOD
MetalRainbowDash: what application do you speak of
13he's 7 feet tall, and equipped with scythe-like claws and rotating lazer array in his mouth
I think I like Fluttershy because she reminds me of a close friend from high school ( well, almost... My friend wasn't really skiddish lol )
lol
2,14 please be patient MetalRainbowDash, we respond to every application
4-_-
;~;
6DEAR SWEET CELESTIA BURN IT WITH THE SUN!
I'm watching Dragonshie
yes but not sure if it was me causeing the lag or not.
GRRM, yes, it's from the pilot
"Put me down!"
6DDDD<
I need to take Bayonetta's theme, and make it more Twilight Sparkle.
er Dragonshy
lol, he hasn't sent in an app
I should hope not seeing as we had 200 for the hub ep
/me is terrified of giant clockwork abominations that come out of his filly friends closet. He'd say this if he wasn't clutching his guy on the ground
give it time..
just the request for oen
13with parts of his body exposed to show clockwork and armor
one*
Hat it is one for umm
GRRM, she gets two lines in the whole season :C but fans have made a bunch of fanon about her
possibly becoming mod
It's only around 10pm here
I just dont like leaving problems un fixed =p
oh
Pinkie Pie reminds me entirely of my girlfriend
13Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll forget. lol
yeah I looked her up
6Synros! O: You have been here too?!?!?
she's just as random
Silly, none of you spelled Rainbow Dash right.
Ok everyone who has fb
New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: Pinkie P.Ie. (http://tinyurl.com/3f9rv7f)
and he's now complaining on chat that we haven't immediately responded to it
Maybe I'll apply someday when I've been here longer.
his gut*
yah
People like stories of rendemption
if you think that scary, you wouldnt want to see me and my old comrades with vodka and some guns
/me giggles at Natleyn~
pleh
Who has FB
I feel I do not yet deserve Mod powers.
Facebook
ah the good times.....
6I am sorry you are tired D;
really, he's doing a GREAT job of impressing us :P
...............................
Who has Facebook
If u do
Leika, yeah...I always loved the X-Men stories when Magneto joined the X-Men
UUUgh,
Go to this chat
No reason...
heh, there's a pony wiki
MetalRainbowDash: ok well i won't discuss it for risk of jynxing it
13Seriously, he was a trouble maker for a while at first. Then he bitched. Then he lied to the chat. Then he bitched more. No no no no.
GRRM, yup
Notch. Y U NO PUT MOD SUPPORT?
/me finishes kicking his computers ass.
The hell. 13 authors for this one.
there's pony communities all over
6and Synros it is good to see you! ^^; Sorry I have not. . .
11He has a body built around a grandfather clock, right? Because my memory is notorious for being... Wrong.
uh huh. *groan*
So what did i miss.
4Is it that MRD has become everyone's troll or something?
Yurp
GRRM, if you're willing to watch the show for 7 episodes, it gets better as the show goes on
Gamerdude260, just wait for 1.8
I've sseen some fanart too
GRRM there are fanfic wikis
much better
also i dont think he is 7 feet tall
I think he's going to be BMN's equivalent to George Bush
13He was a troll for a while when we were initially stress testing, I remember that.
4Can someone tell me what is so wrong with MRD? Like, what exactly did he do
Meh
pony fanfic wikis?
13you're indeed wrong
lol good to see you too VioletVanilla
4I do remember him spamming
http://apps.facebook.com/neatchat/chatroom?pid=125354227555734
George Bush the regular from ponychan that is
or just fanfic wikis?
Alright, getting the question out of the way. Are you dying or aroused?
Go there if you have FB
4But otherwise...?
namely Fallout: Equestria
Fanfics terrify me.
I get up at 6am for school, so it's a bit of a long day for me. :<
But for now. Mods are a pain to install.
there's an official mlp wiki
mlp.wikia.com
but be careful
13Then he lied about being Lauren Fausts friend and was bitching on and on about no one believing him until he finally came clean.
official?
spoilers warning
I'm too lazy to read fanfics
13he's made like a clockwork soldier underneath, with a bit of magic-infused gem circuits for behavior and energy
tbh
or talk to you*
spamming, color avoidance, linking during streams
Well. When you're instaling a ton
annoying me
yeah,
HAh
Hmm..
the one with most of the info about the show
constantly resending a poorly photoshopped image
Anybody have Facebook?
13Yeah, think he was annoying Sumica too or something. Cant remember.
6 1. He spammed. 2. He claimed to know Lauren Faust and proceeded to try to lie to us. 3. Him with mod powers would be giving a five year olf a license to drive in New York City.
you havent finished watching the shows. you will be unlazy re: fanfics (I too was once skeptical)
annoying me
I'll stick to fanart. It's hilarious and easily forgotten if horrifying.
openly complaining about mods
uh, where is his power supply?
annoying me
neither
annoying me
no
don't be so sure about that
and did I mention annoying me?
4Okay, okay
11A good question indeed
13He is a definite no from me already.Bet hes 14 or so.
nobody uses facebook anymore
I've not seen many horrible pony fanarts yet, but by god are there some terrible ones of things I like
I do :/
Hatpages are all the rage now
4Can one of you please direct me to his app
6DID I MENTION NEW YORK CITY?!?!? D8
that's shocking. I had assumed you were always aroused.
13its in a spell matrix of rubies within the core of his abdomen
no. i just make fillies around me aroused.
13I dont think he even sent in an app just yet.
4It's not on the forum and I don't see it in the email
I don't have access to the bronystate email :P
well
Yes.
Go here
http://apps.facebook.com/neatchat/chatroom?pid=125354227555734
/me has only been there once in her life and remembers the cars.
then they spend the effort to try and do the same for me
lets put this little toy to the test then
If u have FB
11A better is who sanctioned this... Creation of yours. He violates quite a few important laws...
4Thennnnnnnn why the hell are you guys talking about his app like it's bad?
because he's been bitching that we never got back to him
/me rolls over again
uh... what's shipping?
13Ghosties. You missed a lot of the shit he pulled in chat.
(this probably sounds stupid)
/me 10is sitting on the ground, inspecting a flower beningly
you know, I never found out myself
...Totally.
13We're talking about the stuff he's already done.
Putting two characters together in a relationship
but i've learned to correlate it with ^
Yeah.
4Oh
Well I want my own chat room
13How hes acted.
6;A;
4So he wants to become a mod...
never mind
in like fiction in general?
with admin controls
13It was pretty bad.
That's it. :/
4Or he just wants to troll by saying he applied
I cant find a place that has that
6eeyup~
I reaaly hate the new enderman mob
Or pictures.
13Yeah...
Yes.
oh
GRRM, my advice...stay away from the fanfics for now
10............
also, we're not talking about his app per se, we're saying that WHEN he applies we will shoot him down so hard
6Both probably
4Sounds like a swell guy
10...graow
eeyuyp
they're weird
like I said I'm too lazy to read fanfics
6Would not be surprised if he starts claiming he IS one. @.@
Good.
and will ruin the spirit of the show for you
lol
Keep it that way.
I will happily proove him wrong :P
k
13I gave him the address unfortunately. Because I'm nice... sorry about that. That was before the lies some more and such though. lol
yes, i know how you feel comrade bear
Well, why not fanfic?
11It's too bad there isn't a cavity of some sort. I would have /loved/ to see a Boombox+MrPeddington combo... Mech... Thingy.
*coughCUPCAKEScough*
there's nothing wrong with giving the email address
NO!
especially considering everyone could see it
4You gave him the email address?
!moon Gamerdude260
Grab my tail, TuxOtaku!
11You know.
I stay away from cupcakes like it's the plauge
for applications, yes
11For science
4Well, yeah, nothing wrong with that
13oh, that's in his belly silly
13Yeah, to request an app.
still havent read that one. apparently it was a big deal
11!!!
13To him though, ugh. lol
derp
lol
*coughSWEETAPPLEMASSACREcough*
Lol
4Damn, you're a big daddy aren't you MRD?
oh welp
as mods, we must act impartially :P
Gamerdude260, stop that now.
Oh now you're just being silly.
Don't read those fanfics.
MOOOOOONNAAAAAA
5am
13I think hes just really young or such. Preteen drama and the like.
as good a time as any to watch ponies
/me 11turns to face the giant machine.
as such, we treat every application fairly :P
I see why you guys wanted me to stay away from fanfics
heh
There are terrible.
well anyways
eeyup *thump*
/me pokes MirthTinker yet again
just because he has no chance in hell of being recruited doesn't mean we have to hide the information from him
13Unless they act how he has acted. lol
13wat?
oh and Gamerdude260 is 1.8 out already??? you mentioned enderman
/me lolls his tongue as his head bounces off the dirt
Fanfics like anything run a strict Sturgeon's law. 90+% of it is crap.
well don't worry
No.. I just found out baout enderman.
!moon
*about
Grab my tail, Orangestar!
im just bored
No Ponies here right now Bash
/me grabs
I've seen worse
>``Here, let me say the names of two horrible fanfics and tell you not to read them, definitely not planting the seed of some burning curiosity within you to find out what they are''
:[
"<MetalRainbowDash> Well I want my own chat room
<MetalRainbowDash> with admin controls
<MetalRainbowDash> I cant find a place that has that"
How do I make my own Mibbit chat room?
and out of vodka
We can talk about ponies if you like. :D
Endermen are going to be fantastic.
/me whimpers
/me lolz at Ghosties comment about him being a "BIG DADDY"
this guy just makes me lol more and more
but I had to lol
But.
So has MRD been going on like this the whole time/
They appear randomly and kill you when you turn around.
11Prepare yourself, Peddington!
?
Atleast
there are plenty of good fics
Uh
eeyup
What is even happening to this Pony.
That;s what I've heard
Well sorta.
/me 10rolls on his stomach
They only attack you if you look directly at them.
speaking of fanfics though....anyone here a fan of Ghost Rider (and not the crappy movie version with Nic Cage)
10garu?
13lol Yeah.
should i be worried about Silvermane at all?
it's okay
not the worst thing I've ever seen
or read
And if you wear a pumpkin on your head, your gaze does not affect them.
Wait
Come to this link
http://cbe002.chat.mibbit.com/
13meh, probably
Ghost Writer was a toy in the early 90's right
Might just be me but he comes off as wayyyyy to overbearing.
13he might be going into shock about now
well i was gonna watch on youtube anyway, just a random thought cause i'm here through regular ol' mirc
This is my own Pony Chat room
no no
should i try to kick him in the ribs?
the marvel comics character
13I honestly think hes 12-14. He acts typical of a kid of that age range.
well
2,14 no more links please
this pony is in extreme gastrointestinal discomfort
So, anypony listen to my music?
*marevel
/me 11grabs Boombox and opens MrPeddington. "Maybe it's the scientist in me..." Razyn jams Boombox into MrPeddington and closes up the bear.
/me is now thinking of the Nic Cage Song.
9also
4That's my name for him now
Is it like the Beatles?
13But I could be wrong. Heaven knows I've met some adults that act like that as well.
4Big Daddy
Lookin for some feedback
yup
13lol Ghosties
9the MCD ones i mean
4Holy shit, Big Daddy
Then nope.
9gonna go pick one up tomorrow
Beatles Covers with pony lyrics
the glow in the dark ones?
4You made your own Mibbit Pony chat room
Nice.
Everyone
/me tries scooting away from DecapKing, using one hoof whist the other clutches his gut
9yeah those
Ladies.
/me 11turned to his friends with a wicked grin. "I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME REAL SHIT."
/me pictures Ghost Rider sitting down on a desk, writing a novel
13we probably shouldn't mention there's no way to stop Peddington now that he's disconnected from me, since before the only way to stop his auto-repair spell was for me to tell him so or be incapacitated
Go to the link above
9is there a link to images on them?
The cbe mibbit chat
Oh hi not-mibbit user. :D
so I just connect with the mibbit client right
I listen to music
4But Big Daddy, I'm a mod here D:
9the ad here said they were 4 toys
oh
I have ears.
4I can't just jump ship like that
9and the ad had RD, AJ and Pinkie
10...*garu*?
u_u
Two of them, in fact.
9and I'm hoping the 4th is Twilight
Erm. Can I help?
oh wait
thats one thing I have held on to thus far, not getting into "pony related" music (remixes of the season one songs are still OK though)
Aye
i know that look
FOREIGN HOST DETECTED
9I'd only get Twilight due to the fact that getting ponies for me is MD
10(FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSION HA!)
A WILD MIBBITUSER APPEARS
Silvermane just ate some bad food

Sup bronies. And pega-sis.

Dont make Val put you up on a pike as a warning to others
/me groans
I appreciate all the work Eurobeat Brony does, but I can't get myself into that style of electronic music.
Pony music is super fab, just realized that today lol
13Yeah, definite no from me. I cant even hold all this no.
13Would it be an ali-bear?
how are you?
2,14 that's not how you spell Trident Sumica :P

I'll hold some for you Octy :P
Those are great.

13For the lawlz of course.

Pike sound more deadly.

the AlexS dubstep remixes are awesome
So much agreement, RainbowDashWins XD
it hit my entire abdomen at points
2,14 but tridents are more my style :P
I'm wondering if anyone will recognize my Rainbow Dash vinylon the back of my car.

NotACleverPony is great too
Any clue what's wrong?
lol, only for you ghosties <3
yes
not a one
we are all me
13lol
4<3
Silva hound is still my favorite though, his track for Vinyl is mindblowing
I guess a trident could be more effecent. 3 to 1
:( i dont like this any more...
you silly plebian
AlexS's CMC remix made me realize that I don't hate all dubstep (dubtrot :3 )
13Razyn, are you sure you should be messing with a semi-autonomous automata capable of rational thought and housing a body of steel, aluminum, and diamond?
11...
not gonna lie, I dream about getting a blue tacoma with rainbowdash stickers behind and above the rear wheels
4should i got my chainsaw that runs on magic?
*thinks of most crass terms he can for medical pains*
*got one*
dont call me a plebian!
Have you got the shits?
Deadchat kinda
The frogs are taking over.
Val, question
Hours ago this chat was blowing up
2,14 yessums?
Oh look worldsdumbist is on. Shame server is derping.
4*get
Is it Val the Jean, or Valthe Jean?
11Mare, I'm having fun! I knew there was a scientist in me, but he's never had a chance to play!
Hah.
/me glares at server.
i used to hate dubstep
now i don't
the CMC remix also shows how awesome that song can be
2,14 I'm not sure what you mean...it's just Valthejean
NOOOOOOO
^
Did you hear that there apparently is a good version of that song
?
/me 13kisses Silvermane on the cheek, rubbing his stomach
Dubstep is crazy overdone and diluted now that the songs all sound the same.
Daniel Ingram still has it
I want a Rainbow Dash mini. There's a picture that surfaced a long time ago, probably on here, someone had skinned one in Forza 3. It was epic.
/me 4pokes MirthTinker yet again
I was wondering if/how you split up the name.
a non-tonedeaf-scootaloo version?
yes!
want
11Now arise! Beast of fortune! The thirteenth Zodiac! The new world order!
says no place named bronychat :/

Obviously it is Va Lthej Ean
With scootaloo actually singing awesome!
6Heheheh~
11HEAVY
11METAL
Though, my RBD sticker is white, not rainbow'd.

2,14 Eh, I like it clumped together
facehoof
It's private I assume.

OH!

I see
SixSpeed: I would say these sound sufficiently different
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC58-DYyKRs
Thanks herospirit :3
I heard that they didn't make one at all, at least that's what I remember Daniel saying earlier
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Ah. it's so boring.
Twilight told me this video is about UKF Bass Culture (Dubstep Megamix)
GRAWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
13the bear wasn't in the zodiac?
Sibsy said that she has the good one
Hey Sumica
Yup! no prob
Lets watch some vidoes

Not sure what to believe

Alllll sorts.
imo Flutterwonder is only second to Trixie's Good Side

/me crawls over to MirthTinker and curls up in front of her
*steals HoneywWhistles nose*
how do i get to channel Awesomeshy?

Ok.
*M*etal*R*ainbow*D*ash
11...Naw
I'm really selective with dubstep and heavy bass kinda stuff. More into melodic stuff, like Mike Shiver.
Feed Me is good
just like RobotPinkie is RP
13oh honey, *hugs him closer and pets his mane* shhhh now, you'll be okay
and Silvermane is king
11But you're thinking, I like that.
RainbowDashWins, then you will like Magnetic Man
acronyms, HOW DO THEY WORK?
>.>
Anyone want to text Roleplay?
Robot Pinkie is a roleplay sever.

bout time
it took a while
Nat works too.
/me 11taps a hoof.
Lets chat roleplay in Ponyville.
Mission accepted.
If we're talking about regular Dubstep, the Cinema remix by Skrillex is pure win

People call me Hero. I should let it get to my head :p
Skrillex does a badass remix of Nero's "Promises"

/me 3takes out his flask
/me releases control of Dermathil
you know it buzzy baby
11I have a seven foot tall killing machine... And I don't want to kill anything
4im doubting that this will turn out as anything more that fucking terrible
13well, that's not as important as my Silvermane right now, it'll have to wait
6v.v I am sorry Luna. . .
11Boombox, shut the bear up
/me has been shipped with everything he wants...
o_o;
Wow. Ponyville looks like a good place to live.

/me 15whimpers, shifting into her contact
I am new here to Ponyville. I moved here.
Skrillex does badass remixes, period XD
From somewhere far away.
/me is nose deep in a book
/me 10shifts slightly and growls, but quickly returns to his standing position
hi
Actually, no.
No I'm not. I'm making a cursor.
/me takes a look around the city.
6What book Natleyn? o:
dear god...he's roleplaying in the channel now :P
/me stares intently at MetalRainbowDash
Uhh.
/me 15rolls around
11No... No. I... I can't think of anything! I have everything I want!
I'm the local starer. My job is to make people feel uncomfortable.
4want to help me kill/destroy this 7 foot killing machine?
Reading through The Wheel of Time. Again. I'm on The Shadow Rising
10...? ...*
4Yes, I saw Rarity Wrek
*As night approaches, something goes wrong in the town*
/me returns to staring at Natleyn
4She looked great :)
...
/me 15tries hugging MirthTinker back. "Tink..."
I like the use of wobbly bass in this: http://soundcloud.com/space-laces/lucky-date-hos-and-discos
And then the goat killed the chat in - oh, nevermind
What? ;~;
4yeah i mean you, fucking boombox-robot bear thing
/me says "What is that out there?"
Sorry I blew up the servers in a fit of rage. my bad
/me 11waves a hoof at Boombox. "I'm not really concerned with romance."
I was looking for that song. :P
4Oh boy! A fanfic show!
/me 13"Mmmmm? What is it honey? Need me to fly you back home? SQUEEE I can fly you places now!"

11A fillyfriend, for you?"
/me 15nods slowly, mind slow from pain. "Bed sounds nice..."
11Maybe later, Boombox...
anypony know the server info for the pony irc project?
2,14 fanfics make me cry at night]
*Everypony wakes up from the explosion sound and see Canterlot was bombed*
3I'd better spot you two..
Well, usually the RP in here has to do with rape, so this is a nice change from that at least.
Nope, but what project?
4MURDER
3Make sure you don't lose those wings then plummet to the earth.
/me 3takes off into the sky.
theres a pony hosted irc server
*Meets herospirit at Pinkie's Cupcake Store*
4you know what
/me 2,14 stabs Ghosties with a trident
By Celestia, it's RP
and i need it's info
4im going along
to get to #brony
4im sick of this fucking bear
so where are we now?
4Gack! My spleen!
What?
/me slaps ValtheJean.
Bad dog
I suck at RP.
@TuxOtaku, I like that track by MM. I'm usually going even more melodic, though. Sorta like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bX7iwygIKQ
2,14 DOG?
4Fanfic, RP, whatever
/me 15shudders. "Don't let them follow us... your wings should last for a few more days unfortunately"
I hope the people in canterlot are okay.
oh haha, they finally moved servers, Icemane ?
/me puts Natletn in his place
DJMidli bro
/me 11falls to the ground. "I'm not cut out for the whole Mad Scientist thing."
13now Silver, I've never actually flown before, but I'm sure it can't be that hard, are you holding on tight?

Ntleyn*
yeah they did
/me takes out a rolled up newspaper.
Natleyn*
Icemane, you could ask klaxa|away
Puts me where?
4are you sure you dont want me to get some type of transport for this?
/me 15wraps his hooves around MirthTinker tightly. "As tight as I can, Tink"
klaxa would know
I'm assuming a small, dark corner
-gasps- b-back... -falls over-
11I thought all you needed was to be smart and have cool stuff.
ninjapony knows
You are now RPing Natleyn.
Out of the way

Armin Van Buuren is pretty good.
Alright

Fluttershy, we're Chat roleplaying in Ponyville.
Nighty night, Alliszero :3
.______.

Help me Silverman. I think that person wants me to roleplay. I... don't roleplay
/me 13nods back. "Okay then, here goes nothing." Mirth flaps her wings somewhat uselessly at first, not quite getting the rythm.
See y'all tomorrow
11...I'm a nice pony.
Night Alliszero

/me declares this land open season for shipping. SO SAYETH THE KING
/me goes to Canterlot.
/me 13"Wait, I think I've got it now," she makes a large push, creating a small gust as she lifts off with your weight on top of her.
15did that help any?
e-e;
*All of you try to stop me from taking the risk*
11It was fun. Boombox, disengage.
4now excuse me i am going to go and get an experimental flying machine and use it to go to Silver's house
/me looks for Vinyl
So~? We're all hooved~ /pun
Val didn't have enough "motherfucker" to be Gamzee
2,14 wut?
11...But map out that bear's insides. We may need to know how to make our own some day.
you have cleft hooves, heathen
/me 15tries pulling Fluttershy into a on-the-ground hug. It's not very effective...
Says the thing with the horizontal pupils.
/me whacks ValtheJean with the newspaper. "You are not gamzee!"

Don't do it Val, think of the children
/me highhooves Denied
/me whacks ValtheJean again with the newspaper.
/me saves the injured ponies in Canterlot.
I think I'm going to be here and watching hub at the same time
/me returns the highhoof.
4no i am off to Silver's house i guess, cause i think he has a stash of booze somewhere in is apartment
2,14 Easy boy, I may have to strike you down
15i don't drink
BAD DOG
15my stash is non-alcoholic
/me 13"Um, I'm not sure I can use my wings with you on top very well, you might want to close your eyes." Mirth seems to dance in the air as she tries to gain her air-legs.
GOOD DOG. BEST FRIEND
/me bops ValtheJean in the nose with the newspaper.
4well there is stuff to steal, that i can then sell, that i can use to buy booze
/me 15sighs, since he hasn't opened his eyes in several minutes anyways

Nah, you know there's no talking to them
*Fire from Canterlot is out*
/me whacks ValtheJean in the back of the neck with the newspaper. Still not impressed.
15it's part of the apartment
6mfw Natleyn makes dat face
/me 11watches MrPeddington fall to the grass. "I think we broke him."
I doubt they even know what MLP FiM is
Oh, don't try and reason with them.
4fine

13Haha, RPing... lawl
4i can try to sell that robot bear though......
Got the owner of the group to bring down the banhammah!

2,14 don't push my patience Denied :P
They are the true heathens....these non-bronies

SixSpeed that would involve work.
/me pokes ValtheJean with the newspaper.

Roll with it Natleyn
*2 Days Later*
13PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT!
/me falls over and curls up Rainbow Dash style, shivering. o^o
/me 13flutters down the street, barely above street level and panting from exertion. "Haaah, this is...HAH...hard work, I've never used muscles like this before."
/me 13sings
11Or we could blame the Russian
Get back in there and roleplay.
Countertrolling often does, but the rewards...

/me hugs Silvermane tightly and suddenly. ><
/me hugs Octavia's foreleg. "Close enough..."
/me 13"Oh, we're almost there, wait...there's no grass!" Mirth careens towards the ground in the direction of Silver's apartment's front door. "AAAAGH, WE'RE MAKING A CRASH LANDING, EVERYPONY RUN!"
Any flyers? Come to the table and sign out the form to apply to be in the airshow.
6>: Silvermaaaane dun be too hurt. . .

Wait, what is herospirit saying...? Is there something you're not telling me...? ;-;
WHAAAAAAT?

Not long at all xD
Clop clop clop

Just past 5 minutes.
I was going to go to bed soon
/me comes over to Natleyn's shady corner c:
I'mm a do the whole thing
he'd just slap those ninjas silly
uh, i probably should just stay quiet too
and they'd beg him for forgiveness
15so i see. isn't RPing usually involve, i dunno, RP? Not just random events?
And didn't want to further distract myself
ShadTheCrazed: Why tomorrow?
/me directs mysteriousanimatorx to #EquestriaDailyAfterDark
Erm. Ask someone else Fluttershy.
I did it for 3 hours of epic sax guy
6Halloooo~ What are you doing all the way over here? o:

/me absconds to Nat's corner
Oop.
Buffering
Isnt it Equestria
Oh, I don't want to go to a dirty shippy smeary clop room.
I found even more Fluttershy-inspired music
Don't cry Fluttershy. I've just starred in a few ship-fics is all

ROBBERY PONIES ARE HERE IN PONYVILLE!
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Foozogz - Fluttershy Likes Being Nice (CUTENESS OVERLOAD MIX)
I think he may be a child, from how he writes. :0
I like shade. :3
15Rainbow Dash always dresses in style

Hm? Where? o-o
My brother's yelling at me for the music

Really, just don't. :0
Yeah.. o-o I used to Larp with my best friend all the time
Cool cool.
Princess Celestia: What is going on here, Violet?
15stop namedropping it
hahah, my friend requested a ponified version of himself, this is the result. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/Drawings/Screenshot_000006.jpg
More accurately, I like darkness. Not complete, just mostly dark, like just after twilight or just before dawn.
4i didnt name drop it
Because I'm attending classes on the weekdays though I haven't had much of a chance recently
13No problem hubby, let me trot you to your bed
15where did you play Fluttershy?
4Herospirit did
I've occasionally considered sending 'Uncle' Jack a letter asking if I can borrow $20
6This is mighty true q.q
15not you Decapking, herospirit
3What? did you say Silvershipper?
hah
I like the sun too, but it's night now.
3xD
/me 15facehoofs
4and so did DE
:P
07soo
He used to pay me to work at one of his buildings.
4but i did not say Silvershipper at all
07Fluttershy made a sketch
Caramel is alpha you know :P
15k

/me 13carries the incapacitated colt upstairs and into his room, laying him on his bed gently.
Skipsy: That's awesome
Hey, she deserves to have the choice. Of whether or not to go to Silvershipper.
/me 3is bi-winning.
wow, she is a hard worker :P
At least, his name was on the checks.
/me 15crawls under a rock now
07she wants to know the details when we plan on the marathon.. what did we decide again?
#silvershipper even.
LUCKY
4except that one time that i said Silvershipper
6It was an accident. She closed her eyes and the next thing she knew, there it was.
/me wears his FLCL shirt
3...
07i'm doing so many things... my head hurts
Nah.
/me is rockin' NASA shirt.
right after BMN
I sometimes wish I could meet him IRL
streaming until the S2 premiere, yes?
/me hugs Luna :c
07and when would that be?
Skipsy
Oh, I would just hang out with my friend and we would larp whenever and wherever we could, though most larping was in either at her or my house. Most larping happened at my house though, specifically in my room d;
6Do not overextend yourself. . .
You're really good!
Jack Roush is kinda short-tempered and a jerk to his employees.
SILVERMANE YOU BEEN TROLLED.
/me is wearing Team Rocket shirt
4but anyways i wouldnt go there, except that time that i went there
Danke, hehe
THAT IS ALL.
13Do we need an exact time?
6Next Thursday night I believe was the thought.
15ohh, so you've never been to an event, Fluttershy?
And by short-tempered and a jerk I mean I never saw him smile or heard him say anything nice.
I've only started at drawing ponies, so it's.... different.
*Day time*
When you doing your next livestream?
-shakes her head- Not like that anyway
/me in the shade
15i hate you guys so much
11(Out of fucking nowhere :0)
/me *yawn* what time is it?
So he's uncool?
15thanks Tink
Ah well
still
Wh.. what hapepned?
happened
I could right now maybe
11What?
man, has it been raining like crazy this week
I'd ask him for twenty bucks if I met him
:P
15hmm, where you located?
11Why?
4you're welcome for that trolling Silvermane
I have a ductape/PVCpipe/Foam broadsword in my closet :0
Did I crash here?
it better not rain next week when I'm on vacation
07if possible
4you didnt do anything Razyn
He liked to buzz the Roush complex with his P51.
13We know we want to do it after BMN, but... why do we need an exact time? If its for marketing, could we simply put "Immediately after Brony Movie Night" os such?
I've never larped in a big group or at a con. I've never been to a con. The con I'll be attending this year will be my first
6It is getting kind of cold. . .
I'm located in Utah, remember? o-o
/me 15has a 32 inch latex scimitar with matchin 10" dagger
Oh yeah. It is.
4we were trolling Silvermane by namedropping this to Fluttershy
/me sneezes lightly~ >~<
I think it's Winter here.
13*or
15nope, didn't remember you saying the where
/me hands Violet some tissues
Skipsy. Livestream! :D
3D-->You appear to be in deep shit. Herospirit, you b100 b100d.
11Ah.
I never got around to painting my broadsword. :[
15great.
4it was funny
Yup, just rearranging some of my windows to better suit streaming. lol
I could watch a livestream .. if my internet will let me
13Since its hard to pin point an exact time. That or perhaps Midnight EST.
Violet
/me 15rolls over onto his stomach in bed.
6Or we could just not specify on the actual drawing and add the text later perhaps?
I think you should get home.
5seriously...we can kick people who do that kind of stuff right?
You must pray to the internet Gods
15don't paint it
13Gotta look at how long our current movies will hold us up for.
You too, Natleyn
07I'll link the draft
07hang on
http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
well also, we don't know what movies will be picked this BMN
I'll be fine, but I'll make sure to get home soon.
13Oh wait, we dont have next weeks movies yet. Derp. lol
I still say we enact super special mod powers and make our own list
D_E: I'm JuSt MoThErFuCkIn GoIn WiTh ThE fLoW, bRo. :o)
Ok
15never bother painting weapons like that. it chips, hardens the weapon, etc etc etc
13I know, I'm also doing many things at once.
that way we can time it out perfectly
: o )
13So I'm a little slow.
07http://i.imgur.com/J2xwE.jpg
6Thank you Natleyn. . . and Metal for the warning.
I know that seems random, but I have been watching a show about exorcisms.
I'm setting up my alter as we speak.
15meh
lol
*altar
I grew up in Cloudsdale, so I'm used to cold
15idc all that much.
For what warning?
what would you suggest Silver?
07dat sketch
Getting home?
I already have my altar
15colored duct tape
My laptop
I do not approve of your altars.
15electrical tape
13Dash looks a little odd. lol
You must appease me betterer.
eh, it's just a sketch
4THROUGH A MOTHERFUCKIN FISH EYE LENS!
/me smiles at Natleyn. (:
Mmmm. I believe I know where I can acquire such assets.
07she needs imput now
dang it... rping and larping are two things I love so much. I've roleplayed so many characters both male and female that I've created from scratch with my best friend e-e;
07so what do we tell her?
/me smiles back :)
6I bet you get a lot of it. . . Being a flier and all.
well, it's a little clumped at the bottom
hi everypony
6Dari would be disappoint.
15hmm, LARPing is a very surreal experience.
So the topic is set in stone that Rainbow Dash is the best pony ever?
6but I like it as a rough sketch. . .
it might be a good idea to go for a more even distribution in the negative space
4so is bow hunting
Well, she is a good pegasus pony.
helloooooo
Then I guess there's no arguing that
Erects internet monument."GODS WILL YOU ANSWER ME NOW!?"
She did some Sonic Rainbooms.
It is! And we'd get so involved in it too it almost became real for us
/me speaks like Dr. Nick from the Simpsons.
Well, in a sense it did
HI EVERYBODY!
hi roushguy
man, I hate my internet
also, I think Bronystate should be a bit bigger
Very true.
I can see from here that you have too much blood.
Got bored, turned on TruTV's shocking videos
comcast is terrible
that should be where our eyes go to
we need some leeches
Let's get you covered in LEECHEEEES!
Hmmm... Nat and Violet are RPing with MRD.
That is something I cannot argue with.
right now the focal point is on Pinkie Pie
lol
But on the contrary,
15at the 4day i went to, my new character was a fox-type beast man. basically i ran around and caused trouble for 2 days, got eaten by a giant plant, and entertained people by not getting massive inuendos and misunderstanding a job offering to a brothel as a request to be put in soup
No Rainbow Dash = no MLP.
Fluttershy is awesome
Get a lot of cold? o.o
are they exhibiting the emotion you call... pity?
13I like it overall. I dont want to ask her to have to redrawn it all over again.
/me is trying to be as creatively constructive as possible :-/
3Although II truthfully enjoy 2peakiing a2 20llux the most.
eww!
Man
So
o-o thanks?
LEECHES are the way of the pastfuture.
What to do
/me 15fans himself, muttering something about MirthTinker and scrolls
6Get a lot OF the cold. Being in the clouds and all I mean. . .
13BronyState is a little slanted, but I'm not expecting Wrek quality work here. :P
wow, sounds fun ^^
Np
3Silvermane That sounds awesome
Can't watch ponies, brother will complain, and I don't want him to wake up my mom and drag her into the argument
well, I just finished Dragonshy and Sonic Rainboom
...I can't believe I'm saying this... I like My Little Pony: Friendship is magic
Was wondering why the text for "Fluttershy" was green >_<
Can't listen to ponymusic, for the same reason
07well wait till you see the end result :P
Thought it was just my eyes
Yeah, but I like the cold, so it's cool.
KARKAT IS THE FUCKING EASIEST TO IMITATE, YOU GRUB FUCK.
07so what should I tell her again?
welcome to the herd GRRM
GRPM: ONE OF US ONE OF US!!
Hey anon.
6What are you doing in Ponyville then?
it's green hehe ^^;
13We'll see, we'll see. :P
4i'd still rather go bow hunting
How goes it?
15then I got tired of all the noobies getting killed, so I swapped out to my human woodsman who is an expert in healing skills
welp
!link welcome_to_the_herd
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
OMG, they had a video of a carnival park swing ride, and the top of the ride fell off.
^^ for shame
13RD and Twi look a bit close together.
GRRM: I fell in love with it after meeting Fluttershy. I literally felt my heart melt. In addition, welcome to the herd!
6Hallo Fluttershy~
11Bed. Me. Time. Syntax. Grammar. Important to. Not me.
Just gotta yell and curse a lot.
07this is her DA
well, I dunno if anyone else agrees with me
4cause that deer jerky just tastes soooo good
15bow hunting humans is more fun. especially in pitch dark woods and full contact allowed
It's like that whenever you type another user's name, mib_5qbfpx
I should mention that the larping I did with my best friend was special... >>
I can't draw though
Or write
13Kinda a big blank spot up in the middle of AJ and Pinkie
welp
where are u from GRRM?
4bow chicka wow wow?
I think I'm going to watch The Best Night Ever sometime tonight.
/me waves her hoof at the lemon coloured filly.
Or I'd contribute to the fanon
where am I from?
/me 15raises his eyebrows. 'What he said...'
::_:: good bye cruel world!
I like the cold, but I like hanging around my friends more :3
as in where do I live?
Yes
Hi ^^
The entire top of the ride just fell down
or where did I hear about this show?

actually, you know what
its a live stream
Circleville Ohio.
o-o; No, that's an accurate description. We were bfwb

I think they should be more clustered on the left side of the page

/me goes to sleep.
13Eh, some of her work is really good and some of it is kinda... meh. To be completely honest. :|
13(let's hope she'll leave me alone tonight >.>)
4get into your bombshelter then
*Night Time*
oh, I live in Utah... (No, I'm not a mormon)
since I know you guys will ask that
What do you expect? It's a MLP chat, after all :P
15huh. that's interesting.
07I know :)
/me 13huddles in the shelter
Pumpkin Show is later this year, it's the world's largest festival of its kind.
You are asleep...yet you still speak?
4what?
Actually
were, though... past tense... =-=
i wouldnt
draw the eyes to the left
then they follow the words naturally'
give the wording section the most negative space so it has the most attention
13More clustered on the left side?
I think Pumpkin Show is later this month
I wouldn't
yeah
On movies nights we tend to have the mane 6
im mexican and i dont wear a sombrero
natural eye progression
we read from left to right
/me 15hopes nothing happens whilst he is forced to lay prone
and then some.
6Maybe this. . .
Because it's been a while since we did any larping, so now the only form of roleplay we do is online
4nevermind i think i got it
You dont?
Pshh, maybe she WOULD fit in with Silvershipper.
im not into stereotypes
4so it was bow chicka wow wow?
*suggestive eyebrows*
no, no sombrero
I'm 21 and I act 12
put the ponies on the left side, then your eyes naturally follow the wording
15... maybe in a few days
-nods- I miss kissing her and do other things ;-;
I'm 13 and I act 31
nor mustache
Wait
oh dear..

Strike that
sumica, we're chat roleplaying.
Reverse it
13I dunno, I tend to like even distribution for things like this.
15let's see how she handles...
im 21 so i act 12?
now theres an Ask Stoned Trixie tumblr
4Silvershipper, the channel of insanity!
I'm I'm 20 and I act 200
6Pinkie in the middle top middle hanging down in between Brony State, the rest more gathered in a circular pattern around it? o:
I'm 16 and I act umm.. 61?
15okay, she can probably handle it
4and i get to supply it!
I dunno if anyone agrees with me >.<
4HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
I'm a cranky geezer
I'm 23.
No, we're not "roleplaying", we're just a couple of ponies from Ponyville chatting it up
3*Insert image of tavros twitching his eyebrows*
/me notices Razyn is gone. He scrambles to catch up.
07dear god
AND I ACT AS I DAMN WELL PLEASE
Remember, it's 1864
13Clustering them would have to be done just so.
07dat poor gal is gonna receive a big wall of text
/me 4sneaks into Silvermane's house
Dude.
click it.
I'm 24 and I act 14 or 44, depending on the day and the number of idiot drivers that have nearly killed me.

Ask me what I think about driving.

And I'm a girl, dude.

Probably Fluttershy.

Loffly.

Maybe I'll go lurk there again.
4Hello Fluttershy, please choose insanity level
that's not too bad
I'm a horrible, horrible person, aren't I?
GRRM, you don't have to wait, lucky
Umm.... hmmm.

herospirit?
13I'm just trying to think in ways that wont make her have to erase half or more of it.

!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/46594 for future use
Everyone hit her with your best. :I
lol, it's fine
As it is, either I've got someone going 10 under in front of me, or someone who wants to go 20 over behind me. On two-lane roads with very few passing zones.
Shipping yourself? o-o
Heh heh heh...
understandable
Marathon it for real. Run a marathon, one episode per mile.
/me absconds to the corner
What... what are you going to do to me? >>
15created with the intent of a safe haven for shipping stories that get above bronystate's pg13 limites
3inb4 Silvermane eats herospirit
My internet is probably just as bad, it seems to cut out every little bit, and restart the stream.
07I like AJ's position
but at the same time, if the end product isn't agreeable, then we've kinda wasted fluttershy's time
13Hard though.
Twilight told me this picture is about happy reaction_face let_go_of_your_hate macro reaction_image (and 6 more)
RainbowDashWins, psh
13Yeah, I like AJ sitting on the letters.
I'm very sad
15do? not much. currently i'm prone in bed trying not to cry
4Insanity level set to: o-o
PASS ON DOUBLE YELLOW
Wait
Nobody will follow you.
I must have misplaced my watch, what time is it currently?
4hey Fluttershy
it's much better to be nit-picky now when it's just in sketches
I can always play DF or NWN2
3......
2:30 PM
What? What did I do?
Not sure I wanna play DF though
13I think it'll look good in any case. Just might not be as great as it could have been.
/me 15doesn't eat herospirit. He feeds him to a gru
Insanity level... -smiles evilly-
I knew she was a girl O-O
You want to Minecraft.
6I think the main thing is how scrunched the four are on the bottom and how Rarity looks like she. . . . is just cast aside. . .
Try me.
3I would do nothing to you Fluttershy, not unless you wanted me to.
In preparation.
nah
Oh snap, looks like we'll have to think up songs on the spot!
I'm not a MC nut
3Don't make me call up Emerald...
Is it 3 PM now?
Nah, I'm not in that much of a hurry, especially on the weekends when I'm driving my good car. :P
I do have it
15MirthTinker, meet Fluttershy.
Yes.
But I don't spend hours playing
XD
13I thought RD had an odd face too. lol
13...wat?
Did I miss it now?
which is your favorite song?
"Good car"
07right and now let's make it a small wall of text :)
No.
What is your good car?
Your on time

Winter Wrap Up
First audition!
6DERPY DASH
Woohoo!
3*Facehoof*
15DE, I still need to meet this Emerald. I need to see her skills live, honestly. it was an interesting read, that log of hers
13And Fluttershys nose is so edged and pointy. :P
I'm sitting here fighting off grins as I stare at my new Fluttershy flashdrive :)
6:D!!
First up is..
4(DE, call her and get her here)
It depends on how you want me to act? Is this an RP or what is going to happen?
guess I joined at the right time
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
My "dude" was a reply to Silvermane's "dude.
13wait...is she Emerald?
winter wrap up, winter wrap uuuuup, cause tomorrow spring is here!
XD
I honestly have no idea what's going on so... yeah.
4nope
15no she isn't
/me scratches her head
God help us all.
I want a Rainbow flash drive
3She isn't on, or I would.
4she is Fluttershy
Dudette is me? o-o
lol, but Luna I am an English major! Large walls of text is my forte!
little creatures hybernate under the snow and ice
but they don't have them in 16 GB DX
*After Cutie Mark's performance*
15Fluttershy, this is just random chat that occasionally has RP and shipping and wtf moments
NEXT!
4anyways,
Anyone next?
07smaller, pretty please?
'65 Mustang hardtop with the straight six.
Time sure does fly by
They do. Uh. I'm not sure what they do here
4Note, to reset insanity level, please give me all of your possessions
on DashDrives?
13Since their actual designs are so rounded, curves for those things are your friends. :P
What is your definition of 'shipping'?
Hnnng
6Okay. . . How is this?
/me wanders away, humming the tune to himself
I want a dash drive, but I want a USB 3.0 one
5oh, well allow me to introduce myself, I'm ReticentSmolder, writer, rp'er, and npc voiceover extraordinaire
if you get a RD drive can you get me one?
No pun intended...
^
usb 3.0 is amaaaaaziiiiing
2^ *]
they have em up to 64GB i thought
mib_5qbfpx would like to sing a song.
2^ * *
I want a Rainbow Dash prism tshirt
Ok.
3Also it has Cl-I MEAN GREAT FUN
15Also massive schizophrenic. but more on that later
Spin: not the swivel ones
I do?
Sing.
and that's the only one I like
Yes, you do.
Ugggh...
Alter egos... you know what those are?
I have them.
Old MacDonald had a farm...
Many of them.
5shipping is describing the romantic involvement of two ponies of any gender, ranging from platonic friendships to saucy relationships
I do need a new flash drive or two.
E-I-E-I-O
4so do I
the /other/ one doesn't actually engrave the image on the drive itself
NEXT!
I would say "Consistency in the character dimensions, more emphasis on Bronystate and a bit of tweaking on spacing". How about that?
And on that farm he had a...
3Oh...well then you will fit right in Fluttershy
WAIT
15we run the gambit on shipping here
6Fix Dash's eyes. Fluttershy's nose is a bit pointy, make Pinkie a tad smaller, and make them a little less scrunched together on the bottom.
NOOOOO
NEXT!!!!!
Right now I'm in MP mode. It stands for 'Master Puppeter'.
it puts it on a dog-tag thing
(so do i have to type like this if I am not roleplaying?)
The shirt's only $10.40, but I'm kinda broke right now
RainbowDashWins, that is a good car.
5oh Fluttershy, you've already spoken to two of me tonight
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/257
NO! NOT OLD CLASSICAL SONGS
we need that drive
You can get all kinds of em not just swivvel.
Maybe over the weekend when I get more money
4anyways Fluttershy,
[purpose setDefeated: YES] ;
07that will do
4Note, to reset insanity level, please give me all of your possessions

I am in control of myself and my alter egos. The moment I switch to one you'd better be prepared.

07<Fluttershy> e-e oh my. -salutes- Understood. I'll send in more sketches as well
07poor gal :(
The problem is that the current commercial design is somewhat defected.
15oh BTW, technically Silvermane and MirthTinker are an item. It's canon
Ah crap, I forgot when I got this computer, but it's definitely newer than 2009.
I'm sorry :(
oh shit
6inb4 off-model SonicDash
(Okay, that's better)
forgot to add the ()s
They need to fix it.
13Aww, thats why I didnt want to give her too much. lol
USB 3.0 is higher than USB 2.0
Agreed, RainbowDashWins...my poor car needs new control arm bushings, which means new arms. And it's showing rust.
13lol
fact
6She will be fine.
oh herp
derp
D:
Told you he was a player
(/nick's not working for me)
I got this computer in summer 2010
o-o
I don't mean any negativity towards her, just it's good to point out these things >.<
13What I've been saying... lol
That's not very nice to swear Rainbow Dash
6From her DA she does things very well, very quickly.
07We should make more use of DA.. maybe even contest
@SixSpeed: Time for a new augmentation?
/me 13facehoofs
13hehe yup, YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM HE'S MINE, um I mean, we're deeply passionate about our relationship
errrm
4uh, i would not say that to Fluttershy, dont want her to go flutterrage on your ass
-narrows her eyes- I seee
(Sorry)
There's tiny ponies in the room
Man, it feels like I've had this computer for longer than that
13Hmm...
07They loved AJ's position
07<Fluttershy> Oh? ^^ yay
13Yay contests!
Fillies you mean.
i need a new lap
13Yayy~
15also what happens in silvershipper STAYS in silvershipper
/me absconds to his safety corner
BD
6Contests, contests are GOOD was of getting TONS of fanart~
gah! I forgot one thing
the hat!
it's too small!
15do what you want outside of here
Oh, right. Just being nice.
13As for contests, what would we do for prizes?
is there a RD lap?
I need a job
>.>
6Free kittens
Well, didn't get any good singers.
temporary modship (lol totally kidding)
6Free kittens for everypony!
Thank god Justin Bieber Pony isn't here.
13lol :P
So, the contest is off?
5yes, we'd love for you to contribute, but not everypony in mane chat or other rooms might respect our views or interests
/me 15flops under his covers. "That's better..."
Guess so.
07hmm how about to get to pick the A movie / B movie / pony eps
what kind of job?
RainbowDashWins, come put new control arms on my car.
13sure, we get tons of free awesome art out of it. But we need to give something back too.
:<
eh....regulars will be REALLY upset about that
6A for the first place, B for second, and pony eps for third place?
13I dunno, you think that'll be enough Luna?
oh oh!
I GOT IT
I see... so you really are quite a player Silvermane. Making me feel important and special when all along you were with another pony! But of course!
I should've known it was only a matter of time before Alucard of Castlevania: SOTN was ponified.
Wait
*Evil laugh*
07no no
We have one more person to audition
/me 13"Want me to get you some soup? There's some leftovers downstairs in the commons."
We invite them to do an art demonstration on the stream
free publicity for themselves
anything a Junior in highschool could do to pay for ponies and ponies accesories.
6Ooooooooo~~~~
>:| No good dirty rotten idiotic player!
15Technically we are only an item in there. out here, I'm just random guy that gets shipped a lot
13...wat?
6Get THEM publicity
hey
07that might be a good idea ^
I have a request
6I like.
kick his ass Fluttershy!
Shoot
Roberto.
/me 4steps in between Fluttershy and Silvermane's bed
=_=;
Heh, wish I could, I'm actually not much of a mechanic. I just really love nice cars.
Although, I wasn't expecting it so soon after beginning another playthrough of the game
13oh, THIS is news
Oh well, way to pass time till Season 2
4whoa whoa whoa
13Hmm...
13If we could make it work.
could somebody make a Leon S. Kennedy ponified version?
/me absconds to his safety corner
4we dont need any fighting here
from RE4
/me 15finds this moderately interesting. Then he rolls over for sleep
Somebody named Roberto is last to audition.
and RE2
Can you just come hold my car up so I can put them on then?
it'd be easy really
13Silvermane...you...you don't like me anymore?
im not good at drawing, nor know him
6Streaming is simple and could be set up
Silvermane, you are the defination of Player.
I was just wondering if it's already been done
Roberto?
Is there a Roberto in the room?
6How about like, a primetime spot during the pre-show?
13Is it because I lost my magic? I CAN CHANGE!
they can either join the stream, pre-record a video that we stream, or we just make a video tour of their work
Yeah.
Wait..
Hmm.
Where is he?
15eh. Silvermane is not a player. that implies i cheat
4even though it would be interesting to see Fluttershy kick Silvermane's ass
either way, anyone can get their stuff out there
6Show it when they will get the most views out of it.
He better be wearing his jacket if someone ponifies him
4but none the less
SuperBrony, and GrimGallop, go look for him.
!link leon kennedy
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
nothing here
/me searches
yeah, like during intermission of BMN or something
!link leon_kennedy
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
/me 15facehoofs. "For Celestia's sake, I caused that, MirthTinker. And it's temporary anyways"
-narrows her eyes- Silvermane YOU ARE GOING DOWN!
Okay...what does he look like?
!link resident_evil
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/9486
07Nah not intermission
!link kennedy
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
people say..
She is going to do ALL KINDS OF THINGS to his ass!
13Probably be longer than that I would think.
He has..
07intermission is too short
15I'm already in bed. Just cut off the the legs and i'm down
13I'd say before or after BMN>
07I say pre-show
I... I'm... you...
Well
/me 4holds Fluttershy back
well we can always extend intermission. but pre-show is fine
He's full blue
For some reason I feel less accomplished today.. though I read 130 pages in my book. Probably didn't get enough ponies.
And he has a biohazard.. cutie mark?
the only problem:
-screeches- I'm going to kill you!
yeah, I want him in his jacket
I'm actually learning how to work on nuclear reactors, not cars. Ahaha.
not nearly as many people attend the pre-show
15okay
13B-But, you sought the comfort of another mare! I'M A HORRIBLE PARTNER!
I have a jacket like his
Oh that pony
Nice.
so we'd need to make it VERY clear when we do these artist spotlights
/me absconds as quickly as possible to his safety corner
Double nice.
more ponies!!
4oh god
Nuclear ponies?
He might be off doing...something...not here
13If, *sniff* if you really love her I'll go...
07Our newsletter needs work...
If I could draw at all, I would do it myself. Unfortunately, no dice.
07Ideas?
His form says he's really good at singing.
(Surprised that churro thing isn't coming back up :P)
6POST ON ALLLL OF THE 4CHANS!
sounds like Fallout to me
Green Bay doing that thing they did all last season
07lol
6:DD?
/me 15wonders why this RP gets so much more confusing when we aren't doing the canon event cycle
Just go search for him.
what work does it need?
Dominating.
next ep is party of 1
07It needs love
RainbowDashWins, my friend's uncle is certified to weld on reactors.
/me 4struggles to keep control over the yellow pegasus
6It needs love
07lots of it
Hey Churro thing is back up! Been a while.
5sorry, Tink can get a little...melodramatic sometimes
6inb4 herdmind
(:P)
**** yes, Albert Wesker Pinkie Pie
-kicks DecapKing king in the stomach with her hind leg, flies to the bed and puts her front hooves on Silvermane 's neck-
07^<3
well the biggest problem is we don't have that much to advertise
6I have not seen this newsletter. ..
the more activities we plan, the more we can put in the newsletter
(Clueless as to what that is...)
They should've given her his cateyes.
Search
Fact!
for Roberto!
complete... global... saturation......... of pony
07Well if you see the EQD post..
Okay, I'm looking!
4fucking a.....
13(that's because we haven't even started that date you owe me in canon :P)
party of one starting now:
!link http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
15huh, impressive show of aggression.
Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
07the big line up is pretty much the newsletter
15now if only air flow was still available for me...
- puts her forehead against Silvermane 's and stares him hard in the eyes-
07http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/live-hub-stream-stress-test-from-brony.html?showComment=1315523502327#c8023772851248788118
6Ah, okay. . .
Rainbow dash is best pony?
Perhaps you could just pull someone random out of the crowd to fill his slot in the show
Screw this, I'm out.
hmmm
15oh dear
"Oatmeal, are you crazy?"
15this just got worrisome
what about Garrett from the Thief series?
also, if you want I can start spending more time on the imaged signature
"YOU MEAN NOTHING TO ME!"
07see what I mean?
has he been ponified?
4ah shit, i think that she broke a rib
What if they're not good at singing
*Maximum Pinkie*
07do it Val!
We need
a good singer.
right now it's just been a "whenever I have some free time"
15medkit in the cabinet
I know SHODAN has
alright, I shall increase operations!
-stares even harder- "Grrrr...."
13(just a tip Fluttershy, /me changes your text format, we use it sometimes for actions other than speaking like so:)
/me panics a little
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps mexican
07So much to do so little time
Being utterly dominant on the field.
Oh
Here is Roberto.
/me 13comforts Luna
haha
/me 4gets up
/me 13walks to the corner of the room, sniffling quietly
well, I'm always up for more work
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/art/src/131522301669.png I've been ponified ;D
6It will be okay Luna~
4its going to take more than just that to stop me
i'm looking at all of my favorite flash animators on youtube.... And this whole time I've never been more proud of them.
*After Roberto's performance*
ok back, I think I eat to much delicious bacon
Now all we need is Applejack kicking a giant boulder
/me is a perfectionist
o.o
/me 13is too
/me is three
/me 4picks the yellow pegasus up of of Silvermane
13We just need to work hard!
agreed
Rainbow Dash, I couldn't find Robert--Oh, I guess you found him already...
/me 15shifts, quite nervous now. "Tink, Fluttershy, please relax a moment."
(Synros, we're chat roleplaying in Ponyville)
6I can try helping out. . . x.x
Lol, nice, Efreet.
4please, this is really hard to do
07YES you can!
where?
/me freezes, then kicks DecapKing, escaping back to land on Silvermane and then... kisses him hard.
07Wait where... did that come from...
(In this chat room)
07Obama....
