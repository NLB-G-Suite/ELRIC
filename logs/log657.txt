Mine's got nothing to do with ponies whatsoever. XD

Gah
theres no excuse for non-worldwide release anymore
I never did find Torchlight interesting enough to finish.
nah its not gonna be gearbox
Is it not something to do with the ratings systems, the non-unified release dates?
publisher
:O streeeeaaaaaam
budding friendships for example
a pony version of harvest moon
because american law is stupid they would have to stop it
Heya everypony! :)

There are a shitload of games like it

There's that unmistakeable sound that is Saturn...
finally found a good use for this guitar soundfont XD gonna make an earthbound cover :)
Hi everypony
*i would
Does anyone ever buff their vitality in these things?
Back
And not when you've already maxed out everything else?
Welcome back Monstamuffin
How many people have seen my here before
I think this released today.
Awww bitch, noone told me!
I have no money
I have some money, but I don't really want it.
^ lies
Never really cared for Torchlight 1, never really cared for dungeon crawlers.
By the looks of the gameplay I saw before now, TL2 pissed all over TL1
The music reminds me of LotR.
Needs more Ents.
Pfft, just got an email. "Torchlight 2 available now!"
I've heard *of* it.
Lol
Yeah, that's why the first one was brilliant
I'm inclined to point out most dungeon crawlers look pretty similar.
You could say that about most games of a genre though.
It's the same as MMO's though, each one has their own charm
Tbh I couldn't unfocus my vision look at Guild Wars and see World of Warcraft.
Haha
Yeah :P
My entire family was rather disappointed with it.
Yeah :P but its a matter of money, lol
sadfaec
13awwww i can't go dynamite fishing in this town
Attempted piscine genocide.
is that torchlight 2?!?!?1
I know that song
Yesh

Same
Like, ten minutes.

but no one wants to seem to trade it to me for the quake collection
Empty sockets?
Bought 1,2,3 and 4 for 15 quid
i bought it as a present for someone.
:P

Borderlands 2! First one was meh.

!cd
CD = Countdown
I feel misimformed.
!cd
I don't blame the haters really, still am in a sense.
only reason i asked was because my friend told me it was gonna be the 22nd
I can't really tell, are those zombies?
Oh, there's a skeleton, gonna go with yes.
Skellies and zombies
And Torchlight 2 starts...oh dear.
'dat originality

hi everypony :)
Oke
There we go.
First world problems.
Hello everybody
I want to buy Humble Indie Bundle, but I already gave the money my PayPal account held away.
Anyone got a job for me?
Consarnit, I didn't even consider that I could get the Humble Indie Bundle.
Or something.
Oh my.

plans*
Oh.
Always a pain to clean up the brains and entrails though
Aww.
same here
Get off that exctacy
I might go play some KSP
Petmail is best mail.
Oh.
but its worth it
Inb4 Pistachio is a boss in here somewhere.
Bye guys I'm off to try out KSP
Too colourful.
Bye everypony. i'm gonna go play some Battlefield 3
80% of todays games are all shades of grey and brown and people complain when something is too colourful.
This is not how the world should be.
I have seen arguments about whether the end of a toilet paper roll should face the wall or the toilet.
I think it was decided by popular vote that facing the toilet was the correct manner.
And thats the reason I want to live in Eqestria
And I concur.
Cuz everyone is fucking each other and arguing about nothing
Neither. I prefer the N64.
Only because of Conker's Bad Fur Day, though.
They're both shite.
make an experiment. hang up two rolls of toilet paper. one facing the toilet, one facing the wall. then observe (must use public or workplace toilet for this=
I'd rather not observe people using the toilet, though.
the people havespoken, facing it is
Well everyone choses the right one since most people are right handed
And the left handed people the other
That would work
...
This is a really silly conversation.
I'd probably just turn the one facing the wall around, though.
people don't like to touch a lot of things ioin public toilets, if the roll faces the wall, the chances of touching the wall are bigger, thats a +Point for facing the Toilet
Yes. Yes, it is.
you know the conversation is silly cuz no one likes using public toilets
Amen.
That sounded wrong.
anyone has some good music for me?
Yeah, it did.
Care to clarify?
I blame the melons I'm cutting, though.
That sucks kammer
I should.
well aslong as you still have 10 pointy things its oke right?
Yup.
Hi everyponyy
"Hey".
again latin?
Basically.
oh XD
Zeus's lesser known little brother.
Yeah, it's a bad habbit.

I have to go in about 5 to 10 minutes. I just wanted to see is BronyStates works in college.
And it does
Oh
I'm fond of ancient myth but I'm hardly well versed.
And with steeds, I mean goats. Or ram. Whatever.
or the universe being destroyed then remade by alfadur
And somehow, fertility.
Guess he was just throwing darts at the character sheet.
Got to go everypony. Bye
despite him wrapping around the planet
Never played.
that episode was shit
And I have no idea how faithful that is to the source material.
/me has actualy played D&D
dude, I got the paladin on my team to target me]
You caught nothing!
'dat comment
I always thought fishing was the most roundabout thing added to Torchlight.
I can't imagine why.
um, is it?
And it's actually Torchlight 2, but it might as well be Diablo-light 1 and three quarters.
I have no idea, I havent played with either one
Yeah they're pretty samey.
people play MMOs despite wow being huge
ALL MMO'S ARE THE SAME -Meanwhile
I'll drop out now, bye everyone :)
I need some tea.
got freaking cold freaking fast here.
gas bill is a bitch
right
winters'
But why.
Because groping.
Oh.
lol
:D
Wait a minute, hold on one second.
^
There's nothing more cool than being hugged by someone you like...
I want to take a nap.
Same here, but I hate naps. :D

But if someone tries to touch you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's no good.

Look at the latest post
Why should we?
Pfft, street cred. I live in the countryside, everyone around here is either old or livestock.
That's nice.
Oh hi, convenient daribot.
Seriously, it's like daribot can understand us.
*mix
SEEMS LEGIT
In other words its a one sided conversation.
Unless it's Cleverbot.
Inb4 it premieres in January.
INB4 it premieres the 30th of February.
with only 13 episodes it even might be
That'd suck.
darn she aint on
I wouldn't be surprised if it premiered the 22. December.
Warcraft?

?
NOPE.AVI
Peterson isn't is he?
Not anymore
Chen? Selbi?
Hey, who's playing Audiosurf on the stream?
thats not audiosurf
thats torchlight 2
Sure it is.
I thought it was Bejewelled.
No that is Bit Trip Runner
Yeah, might be Bejewelled.
You sure it's not Borderlands 2?
No.. its Call of Duty: Midevil Warfare Melee Combat
Oh, right.
It shall come.
Suuuuspiiiicioooouuus.
Did Half-Life 2 end at a cliffhanger?
I'm thinking VALVe releases Half-Life 2: Episode 2: Part 1 & 2.
I would not be surprised.
The Hub ?@HubTVNetwork
That anouncement of an anouncement
See? it fits.
Eh. He was planning on quiting shortly after he quickly estimated how much money he had in his room.
How about Gordon goes to vocal lessons

And then I get ignored. That's fine.
Wait...
Yep

Wait, really?
I'm terrible at Counter Strike.
O_e
Oh man, I need to go there.
Take me there, NOW.
I don't care if I must enter "That country"
Oh, we call that IT.
ICT, yeah
Information technology
IT is much broader, though, isn't it?
CS =/= IT
Well I don't know
No idea, but I have yet to see anywhere around here offering to teach CS.
I'm not "One of those"
Yeah, we don't get any programming until college
whos streaming right now?
Shizu's streaming Torchlight 2.

You're welcome/

Good point. XD

That is a rather large cannon you have there.
Yeah I think that's beyond the range of "handcannon"
Why can I not say anything without it sounding dirty.
Stop saying large cannon!
Cannons are now canon
Massive cannon?
While being printed on a canon
Canon cannons are now canon.
Canonically.
Haven't seen a canon printer in years
They musta gone bust
And not like that...
There's one on my desk.
Mine's a lexmark :3
13i caught a fish.... that had a sword inside
they surely went out with a bang
13why couldn't i just use the fish as a sword
hello :)
Because swordfish don't work like that.
Oh you.
it was no stingray
fish is food, and a bad one at that
These puns are killing me.
I see food and I eat it! :D
You see food and eat it?
Oh yeah, asides from Trixie.
lol
actually I think avreage fish consumption per capita is the lowest in my country in europe

brb
seafood is for coast people
I might start keeping score of the guesses.
Also, mabye some Grimsbies

I'm thirsty, but I can't be arsed going downstairs and making some tea.
Not here.
I gotta leave an an hour and ten minutes to do some TF2 stuffs
Hey, what's capslock?
Capslock is cruise control for cool.
like skill trees, classes, dificulty, items etc
I stand corrected.
Yes. It's a mechanic of children, as far as I'm concerned.
I dunno, I've seen enough loot drama on WoW.
boring
well every pony i am going to hit the hay
Things to do things to do, back shortly.
Drama is fun.
haHA! found my old CBS cd with ground control!
Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
I'm using the wrong sayings and you can't stop me.
buy it, download it, doestn matter
or ground control 2, for that matter. that one should still be available
Oh er.
hey
wat
http://dagobah.net/flash/Insane.swf (rip headphone people)
huh
Somewhere.
you remember a time when developers actually made manuals? :)
when you could just browse through and read up on weapons while it was installing
yeah, those were good times
they make tutorials now. with no option to skip them.
and i'm just blown away how every single unit has it's own page in the manual

Is this Torchlight 2?
Are you on Skype by the way, Saturn?
ooooh, that analog brass computer they found somewhere underwater?
Nvm, Torchlight.
08,01it predicts not only elliptical orbits, bu also the axis shift *within* those elliptical orbits
oh hey there Saturn
08,01prince-dari: not at the moment, but i can be in a few mi utes
08,01prince-dari: need something?

Well, just wanted to ask you something

EY everypony
08,01DaringDerpy: waaay beyond

And he manages to JUST BARELY be polite enough to avoid a kick.

00,10how did they even get the trailer to move like that
backwards
00,02i'm really not sure how you'd move something like that without a lot of equipment
ponies moved it
if they had a oxy cutter
"get to know the girl"
cut it up if there is no fuel in it
0,14;__;
That train is going to destory that truck man
soothing guitar. |v
I know I can.
:/
I really like the little music there is here.
Well, it might do a fair bit of damage to the train, even if the truck were NOT made of explodium as they're concerned.
I'm gonna touch it
Some times
00,02some times
I'd say empty the truck of fuel, perhaps drop the truck, then gently grind it aside.

I still say its nice that the rabbids got knocked out of the fucking spotlight
By the way, it's easy to find the ingredients for french toast.
Old, but cute
torchlight 2 > torchlight 1

This is Pinkie's song about how she hates smiles

2,14 Pinkie is just slowly draining the fun out of everyone
YOU'RE ALONE NOW
The grey knights? You mean the wardens? Did the Darkspawn come back! Dangit! :O
Link?
(pm.)
okay.
Oh
:O
Starship Troopers
lol knowyourmeme is down
I remember the bugs in Metal Slug 3 that looked like the "thinking bugs" in Starship Troopers
00,02this is odd
00,02whats this?
2,14 this is Roughnecks, and this was a glorious show
00,02Caramel, it looks a lot like starship troopers
2,14 that's because it IS starship troopers -_-
00,02oh
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ty89h5xb1r8y0avo1_400.gif
00,02that makes sense
2,14 can't remember, it was back in 99
2,14 but it got cancelled before the first season was finished
00,02Caramel, srsly?
00,02why?
2,14 because fuck TV execs
2,14 this was my fucking early school mornings right here
2,14 chapters =/= seasons
00,02why would you put all the money into a show and not complete the first season
00,02Caramel, bwah?
whats guys
whats up guys
2,14 they fucking put the show at awful times, and out of order, and then blame the show for doing poorly
oh
This looks like that one cartoon that shows on tv in GTA IV
00,02Caramel, how old is this show?
2,14 it was released in 99
00,02cg isnt bad for the time
2,14 it was amazing at the time
2,14 and they fucking cancelled it -_-
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/345/564/4d1.gif
I'm reminded of ReBoot
It's pretty good cgi for the time :O
lol nice gif
00,02reboot pre-dated this iirc
2,14 they were close times though
2,14 maybe a year or two off
00,02Caramel, this may simply have been to expencive
00,02looks raytraced
2,14 fuck that shit, it was good and should have stayed
00,02its not cheep NOW to raytrace
00,02woah, thats huge
The .GIF?
Thats sniper
What's raytrace? O_o
00,02Gold_Demona, rendering method
2,14 it's an advanced rendering technique
NOO
00,02JunkerKun, global illumination is different, used in adition to raytracing
00,02JunkerKun, 'default rendering method' :P
2,14 believe me, it wasn't production costs that stopped them
00,02Caramel, you sure?
2,14 and no, scanline wont get you this kind of shit without A LOT of work
00,02these are prety huge bits of rendering
2,14 you'd actually be surprised with the shortcuts they took
00,02scanline COULD but similar problems to raytracing
00,02either way, these scenes are massive
2,14 for example: the particle effects on the bikes
Ooh what's this?
2,14 those aren't actually being rendered, they were drawn in later
>: )
00,02Caramel, was wondering that, some of these scenes look like static backgrounds with the actors blit ontop
But Superfag has Invincibility...I mean SUperman. :)
NYC is for Symbiotes now. >: )
Do you think they used MoCap?
00,02Caramel, this still would have taken a fair wack of compute time to do
:D
2,14 eh, with the right render farm you could get it pretty straight forward
2,14 especially when they recycle animations
00,02sure but render farms aren't exactly cheap
afraid
2,14 wouldn't be practical to have 5-6 animators sitting on their asses because only one machine is rendering
00,02lol dat explosion
2,14 I don't HAVE a desktop pony for my OC...
2,14 how can you not see him?
We don't see it O__o
cry
2,14 dafaq?
00,02Caramel, he's not on stream
I see something in right bottom corner
I mean, SAW
2,14 this is bizzare....
2,14 desktop ponies aren't showing up...
00,02huh

No no you don't understand, it's MEANT to explode...
Damn, those triangle things looks like auto-hack from Deus Ex 3
Implying explosions are desirable.

00,02Meanwhile, we simply dont know enough to really predict that
it makes it easier
00,02Snow, that works
We don't know enough to predict that the universe isn't just the imaginations of a stag beetle somewhere.
dat violin
There's also some minor existentialist questions on how something can expand into nothing.
00,02but you can see how little it does
00,02its like 1.5 M/s/s
00,02Gold_Demona, ikr!

Anyone got a job for me yet D:

I wish I could afford to be that indecisive.
00,02probably
00,02or i'll give up
Switching computers
Hello Everypony :)
00,02either way
or try going the other way
00,02if i dont find an intercept with duna i'm heading back to kerbin
00,02then i'ma lookup the math to figure when i need to launch
Still working out the problem with my net connection at home - stealing a work computer for a moment :)
00,02i'm using way to much fuel

00,02which is incredibly anoying
00,02i passed through where it should have given me one
00,02several times
Manual intercepts are really had I take it.
00,02Nyst, 'intercept' meens when it visualy shows me when i enter its sphere of influence
00,02so

00,02Nyst, bout 2 kerbin years
