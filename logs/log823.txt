or made in the first place...
There was no point in looking back. Buck no, not today, thank you kindly. My heart was filled with joy. I felt like a monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger.
A man on the move. And just sick enough to be totally confident.

WINTER WRAP UP
wuts the ep
wow my dad is pc clueless
After That movie: Winter Wrap Up!
HELP ME!!
PONY SWAG
Pi is an infinitely long number
if ya know what I mean
Glad my first win was a movie everyone enjoys
SPAAAAAACE
maybe
he's giving me grief for running disk defrag
No, it is
well, I watched Wall-E too many times anyway
cause tomorrow spring is here
his computer is 5 years old
NEEDED MOAR GAK
Fun fact: Within the first 5 minutes, you heard a monologue through the billboards. 22 minutes into the film, the first dialogue was heard. The first human dialogue in this film began 39 minutes in.
Thanks, J_E_Smith71
J_E_Smith71: great choice if I say so myself
J_E_Smith71: You can never go bad with a PIXAR film.
what will be happening next friday since there is no new episode?
There are infinite number of ways to prove it as well
and as things fell apart
THE Enigma's review of WALL-E: This movie is just brilliant. There are many little things in the film that have so much meaning to them. There are things that will be nostalgic to older viewers, and things that younger viewers will love to look at. However, it does steer for the cheesy, cliché aspects of a child's film, yet still remaining a completely G-rated film. The Characters, especcially WALL-E and EVE are charming and lovabl
he got the twinkie!
and he REFUSES to let me run maintenance on it
HAS EVA AND WALL-E BEEN PONIFIED YET?
Everyone loves wall-e
nopony paid much attention
J_E_Smith71: It's hard to hate Wall-E
shizuka is there a reason that you dont stream movies that are less than 1 year old?
Still a better love dotry than Twilight. By leaps and/or bounds
*story
otakon: Just tell him you're removing viruses.
see Bjornfot otakon just said something
Other than that, restores faith in the animation films. It captures the magic and wonder as past Disney films, which is something I have not seen in most modern animation films. 10/10
Shizuka, really? My perpetual pick for B movie is less than a year old.
his drive is 35% framented
Color_Cloud: Possibly.
Laymen hate viruses.
Some like 2 post members would PM me asking me for "admin"
CrystalPhoenix: That was a good movie that gets too much shit.
wuts next
J.E.Smith71: I love you.
4 days left till 2013
yeah I'm running Norton too
YUS
like, demanding it like it was their birthright.
Live Actio!
none of his auto run services are working
YESH
This movie can PROVE you almost don't need dialog to make an fantastic film like this.
On spyroforum? XD
Oh. Hah.
Woah
i always had a good chuckle.
legal implecations
Color_Cloud: Yes there was a link earlier in the chat

VenHur: totally

And Thank you J_E_Smith71 for this fantastic movie!
eva
ovar

VenHur: You don't ned dialogue to make a movie
he has windows disk defrag on auto run
who saw burn-e
We gonna watch the Burn-E short Sumica?
somebody do eva as a pony
THis and Bambi are the best examples of limited dialogue beautiful movies I know.
it hasn't ran for over a year
but i was barely eating..
That, and one scene in Tangled.
Doctor: TDKR isn't even a year old
Color_Cloud: http://ponybot.net/?i=4448
why hello wipergone2
The Artist?
"Wall-E" and "Eva" are dialogue
10/10 credits
bambi kinda sucks
he's got Norton 360 as his anti virus
SouthernSweet: What about Belle d'rendevous?
oni_link: hi

Happy End!
DAWWW

This movie is also brilliant in how they don't use dialogue, only they call their own names to say something
was about to correct you
And I'm glad my family accepts me as somehow knowledgeable of PCs.

Hopefully, after the events of the movie, the humans will learn that capitalism only works when there's COMPETITION.

Nice saddle.
Spike needs a gasmask "Are you my mommy?"

Saddles are for Spike
Spike is a reptile. They are abandoned at birth. He doesnt have a mommy
Doctor: Pixar films got me in the habit of doing that. Every film I see these days I stay the whole credits for the music, even if there's nothing after the credits

When my mom and I were staying at the hotel, I set my cell phone's alarm to wake us up for breakfast. I HAD to change the ringer to one of the gentler melodies in order to not tick mom off.
Hat: That's the usual cure if you get sprayed by a skunk

Tradition is something someone uses when they don't want to make things better
conami: To-ma-toe Juice
tfw twilight takes a gak bath to relieve the bee stings
Contron: Dash's period
Founded by earth ponies, sure, but plenty of unicorns live there now. Magic is more efficient, anyway, so fuck tradition.

Angry doctor

that explains why trixie doesn't like wheels :|
doctor?
:(
there is only one farm in ponyville. Applejacks
Well to Twilight Sparkle's credit, she really doesn't have the physical strength of an Earth Pony to push that plow. But she should've learned to limit her output.

All I have is a few poniy toys and the tallent of drawing ponies (im not allowed to buy anymore ponies). But for two and a half years, weve done so many things to get us so popular! Good work everypony!
Chillax
Maybe Ponyville being late is how so many other towns like Canterlot look down at them
chillax?
13yes but how much memory, and which os

00,10So yeah yata yata lotto time
Eeyup
I'd stick in some more RAM, but I don't want the "IT guy" yelling at me again for making it better.
13XP would do better on that little ram
Why does it say the lotto is on Friday, Dec 29?
Friday is the 28th.
ie, today
13and then everyone runs away
13as though they don't know how this works
XP tends to do better than Vista in alot of things
all the quits
EspyLacopa: its called a typo
00,10first up number 102 SpeccyRush with Topgun
Heh, Top Gun
13Vista lives comfortably in 4GB, 2GB is pushing it

Kammerjunk: Don't do that, he'll slug ya
Shizuka: can I post a FurAffinity link in here about Top Gun?
:D
I convert to the Religion of BronyState.
0,14Particularly the Patron Saint of Punching
alexxm|colt I love and tolerate you
I actually can't tell if that's the younger group behind the black choir
I checked the survey's page, nothing was there. > I am disapoint
Provided it's suitable, OperatorPony
Not the Patron Saint of Bustah Wolfing?
or if it's the choir I was in that year
Hey this is my first time ever using this site, I just marathon watched mlp seasons 1&2 and I just wanted to say this site is really cool
ekips 2 episodes one a movie
but I remember being there
Thanks for existing!
what is suitable?
This reminds me, i gotta sing Dangerzone in spanish
No
CrystalPhoenix, then it would've happened earlier.
otakon17: Completely worth it.
Polydunami Also you need a account for adult material which most here doubtfully have so it's not a worry tbh.
can we vote for movies with rift tracks or was that special for the titanic?
...wait, this was 2010
Yeah maybe
XD
never mind
Well yeah
pony27245: Welcome to the Herd!

Who played that game?
But some of us aren't that lucky, killerpony7733 :S
SpeccyRush, any reason you picked Topgun?
alexxm|colt: Sonic Rainboom, Kung-fu-hustle, and Stare Master

Programs... Programs never change.
Tried comparing computers to vehicles? They both change
yep Dark92Enigma
CrystalPhoenix: To get on Saxy's good side?:p
Muffin needs to be an instrument
Polydunami I'm a somewhat still furry and all with connections to the fandom. So i have a account.

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Because why not!
CrystalPhoenix: Top Gun picked inspired by MLP? AHAHAHA
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, why not?
It is a sign
ohh

Trixie server?

pony27245 type there name. You can type the first letter and tab until the name you want is populated.

What Server?

A bacon flavored Muffin
For those of you who only come for movie nights, this is what it looks like when the stream is down.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT so you have somewhere to touch yourself at night?
That's a paddlin'
Luna911: No
13hikari
Shizuka there is any way to drain all the water or i must do it all manually?
what is the b movie
oh I noticed it was a Anti Guy chasing SB64, those guys are deadly
CrystalPhoenix, I'm not that one dimensional :P
G&P Server
/me starts a muffin rain in chat
dont they normally have a intermission video?
Luna911: We just had a crash and he's resetting it to fix it
Where da b movie?
otakon17: It's not that bad according to IMDb
Waiting for Sumi to reset before we get trolled by a bad /b/ movie
13worldedit has //drain but i don't think you can get worldedit with forge server
Okay, nickname contest time, today we have a newbie named pony27245, So I asked the modderators and everpony else a favor, give him the best name you can think of, it doesn't had to be THE best, just any.
:D
SuperBrony64: hi
Whos goi
fun fact
I think that no guy hacked the stream
Sinestro: Yes it just crashed they're getting it fixed
who goin to watch Spike at your Service?
oh well
13i have a limited version on now but it doesn't have 90% of worldedit's abilities
Fix it fix it fix it fix it ... fix it fix it fix it
welp
Wait, you can't?
Aplecrisp62: Everyone here
I can Fix It!
Huh.
I'm going to go get some lasagna
I'M GONNA WRECK IT
AJ: he'll get it fix soon
(not really D:)
brb
Do you mean the tekkit server?
CrystalPhoenix: And I picked 21 as an A movie because i thought it would be a nice pick.
Can we fix it?
http://s647.beta.photobucket.com/user/lovekakumei/media/futurama-fixit.gif.html
Kandarihu: I think its based off an already existing story
fun fact
I CAN FIX IT
DerpyMuffins: YES WE CAN
no we cant
13there was once a compatibility plugin between bukkit and forge, but bukkit sent a huge FU to the forge devs that were maintaining it
Can we fix it!?
So whats this next movie about? 6_9
NO we cant
You Can Do it Derpy!!!!
no
13so it's a scrambled effort to get forge some useful server plugins
He would have loved you, Meth
VenHur: Hey, so can you make accounts here?
/me sends Bjornfot to otakon17
is there suppose to be no sound right now?
Might as well play the Pony Ap game while I wait
13the only worldedit ability i have atm is being able to select a region and either set it to a block or replace a block with another
Fairly certain my Tekkit server is running WorldEdit. Might be an old version, I guess.
i missed the A-movie damn it, got sucked into Sins of a Solar Empire
13tekkit is bukkit
13FTB is forge
Shizuka: I tried with full worldedit on a tekkit server, it works ;)
OperatorPony: Yeah no sound cause we crashed, we're working on getting it back up
Ah, FTB. Never really got into that.
D'AAAW!
/me holds otakon17
D:
pony27245: if you want to change names, use /nick <putnamehere>
select water region change it to air or blocks easy i guess
Mostly because I couldn't figure out what the hell 'it' is.
pony27245 you change your name with /nick
13actually that would work
who wants to add me on MLP Android or iphone!!!! My name is: Ninjahunterz961 I GIFT EVERYDAY!!;):D<3:|
All I see is baby AJ with spaghetti

I find it instructive to learn the origin of things
Ads, apparentely I'm a drink driver

Seriously, though, what is FTB all about?
I tried visiting the FTB site, but I couldn't find it.

pony27245: Now change you nickname with "/nick (nickname goes here)".
*your
00,10inb4 old joke
Railing death
I was on r/minecraft reading about FTB and someone asked about what it was and one person described it as "Tekkit on steroids"

Well, that's good. I stopped using Tekkit for a myriad of reasons, but I might start on FTB if I ever get into MC again.
Dinky!

Groundhog Day is a great movie, this movie is uncreative crap that just rips it off!
time to be crazy
/me sends army after army of tonberries after otakon17

God these people are dicks!
I like talking about stuffs :P
"and Nyx and Yiazmat
Stuffs are the best

Todds a douchebag, douchebag, douce, douche, douche, douchebag!!!

he died and has to change fate like that one girl in that one anime I cant remember
Sumica: spoilers....is he the bad guy?
KILL the dad
i know
This is how they save money on this film I assume
Contron: This is actually based off a story written in the 1890s
Oh and the Blueblood fanfic I mentioned was more inspired by Groundhog Day, yes.
Just bone the grandma!
So what'd I miss?
PLOT GRAB OF----denied
Yup

0,14I hope none of ;em popped
Troll saw horse!!!
I wouldn't want that.

And wouldn't he wake up in his BED not in front of his mum in law's house
I figured it out!

J_E_Smith71: WE NEED FILLER.

well, this is frustrating
K.O.

Objection!!!!
/me slams the table
FLAWLESS VICTORY

J_E_Smith71: that's a point in favor
Character from an anime I like. XD
XD
stay awake
Todd is such a D....
I would stay awake

So do we know why he's living in a perpetual nightmare.
Sumica: kinda...a little

Not surprising.
otakon17: here we go, my phoenix wright cosplay minus the wig http://imgur.com/EmTV1

Took him 5 days
Reminds me of that Stargate episode.
how does he only notice that part before?
?
J_E_Smith71: take your time!
<.<
00,10well that was fast
Jerks in a timeloop can have the most fun imaginable.
took him a while to figure it out :)
damn he hates the family
Nyst I love that episode!
he wish
00,10so he thinks
caroling, screw this
I sense some desks about to be slammed.
:D
xD
Nyst: Stargate episode was better
lololololololol

Ohhh no it won't
Hahaha, glad I stayed to watch.
time to be crazy
It's good
AlienWarhead: me too. The golf bit was great.

ok, i am laughing for how much of an A**HOLE THIS GUY IS
Yay for me
Caroling needs some more wub wubs!
Okay, I'll admit, I laughed at that singing.
Good job with it Sith
its going to repeat until he gets the girl isnt it?
so, when does he kill the kid to end the loop? :O
I said so
say no!
How did Jill remember some things of previous times and not this
I can think of a thousand B movies that are better than this!
...
told ya bitch!
TROLOLOLOLOL
:O
no?
;-;
I know the point of these movies is that the jerk learns a lesson, but just once I'd like to see the sarcastic cynic get his way.
*sad noise*
thank you
Conyst: you never told me why you said objection
how did you get your name?
....
Contron: Well it's a made for TV movie of course there's plenty more B films better than this
I agree with Nyst
Nyst: totally!
now if only that whore of a wig T~T
yay the 4th happy ending
Man, that reminds me.
nevermind
Seeing your ex marry someone else would break ANYONES heart:'(
And he never feels better
I need a wider tie.
so did i miss wall-e or...
Its a pokemon name

Dark92Enigma: You said Hold It
J_E_Smith71: ESPECCIALLY when this comes from ABC
Wide ties
That fake snow is made of 100% pure asbestos.
I kinda like the jerks.
wall-e was earlier
that's....a really crappy effect for snow
Raritydiamond: imagine having to see it over and over
he could put a gun to his head
hmm...that snow looks shopped
Hat: you just spoiled my movie
pony_9830: Yep
pony_9830: there'll be a rerun tomorrow.
Conyst: I was looking for info about this flick
The only unbroken tie I have is a) black and b) thin as a fucking needle.
J_E_Smith71: all of that is true
dang. i actually wanted to watch that
OohShiny: sorry :(
It's ABC CrystalPhoenix
Oh
Lol

Never make wishes son. NEVER.

Contron: we only need Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire and the ripoff-cycle would be complete
/me grins stupidly
Honesty is best policy
00,10lawl
that awkward moment when you're from philly
Just when you thought he couldn't become more of a jerk than he already was
otakon17: yea, and so is the protagonist of persona 3 =_=
ok I hate all of you im not being an asshole im being honest
Never
words to live by
It's kinda like the movie Groundhog Day doesn't exist in this universe, otherwise he would have mentioned it to help explain his situation
I think you're giving the film too much credit, MadScientIsht.
