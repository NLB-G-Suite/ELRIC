11,01Well, Valve has more to lose pissing customers off since they don't trade.
ALL THESE EXTRAS HAVE NAMES
I blame the economy.
clones! clones everywhere
That's right. They can make clones in only HALF a lifetime now!
11,01They don't have investors to hold them when their PR goes south
11,01.
xd
Which is more iPoddy, This or Star Trek 2009?
13someone went around spamming the NPC tool!
THIS.
The down side to these clones is that they have energy weapon skills of 0

Mission Acomplished.

On the plus side it worked out, but damn I wish I could've gotten it done earlier.

Inb4 corn on the cob

I think they quickly mentioned about wiping the droids memories in episode 3.
....so...much ...bucks not given
His parents are deeeeeeaaaaaad.

At least LOTR had like 8 characters I actually cared about during their battle scenes.
:D
Jango kkilled a Jedi :O
That's gotta hurt.
Jango got trampled
Jango Fett.
I think the Jedi fail to see the advantages of a ranged weapon
That Easy

Well it looks like they're losing.
Why did you stop!
man the jedis suck
Oh no
11,01Lol.
05and I mean it
NO! WE'RE FINE HERE!!!!!!!
The jedi should consider getting guns
speaking of bobba fett, the good news is that he lives after that pit in Return of the Jedi :3
MACE WINDUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This battle Foreshadows how terrible Jedi are fighting soldiers
Now only those jedi alive.
That's how many Jedi are left?
Jedi are not soldiers, they are peace keepers
Boba Fett lived HE LIVED!
until they get erased from the Jedi archives
My gosh, the Jedi's are HORRIBLE!!!!
dat voice
If the jedi all threw their sabres outwards from that circle they'd probably get most of them...
They doomed!
HOORAY!
Like a boss.
INBOUND REPUBLIC GUNSHIPS :D
dat calvery
afternoon everyone.
hm jedis suck compared to lazers BULLSHIT
CLONES AAAAAAAAAAAAH SAVIORS OF THE JEDI
man, those are the world's quietest Gunships.
wow that weapon is overpowered
English, I do not need to speak properly. My dialogue, ham-fisted it is
send in the clones
SEND IN THE CLONES!!!!!!!!!!!!
GET TO THE CHOPPER
ohthatsright
annoying, yoda's habit of using anastrophes is.
trilogy week
Get to DA CHOPPA!
11,01Chopper you must get to.

Gunships are best choppas
okay to be honest that shiip does look cool
Good ol' star wars episode 2 >_

Boba :'(
>: (
Alas poor Jango I knew him well.
13or predicate shall i put before subject
poor Boba :(
00,10still say we should have seen his head drop out of the helmet
Jedi are no match for droidekas but clones are?
Beating the bush are we.
05for a split second as it was cut off
00,10no when the kid lifted it
Much like Boba Fett
13annoying it very is, off it pisses me

Illogical Dokus plan is to me.
00,10oh the lack of humanity
jar jar of bitch a son he is
>there are too many
>this war lasts for YEARS
OH

Republic commando was best
HARD
QUICKLY!

Mace Windu, Summon the Avengers!
more implausible war machines! more!
00,10they never had aim
Send in the droids.

Purple Missle! :O
hmm?
Spess.
00,10they were all cloned from jengo and well you saw how well he could hit obiwan
No, we keep fighting.
how are the graphical holo projecting this do they have senors in the ground or something?
That Foreshadowing
The Republic gunship is CLEARLY a superior model to the Empire's shit. AND it can deploy walkers more practical than the AT-AT.
That is no moon
Foreshadow.
WHY DID THEY CHANGE TECH?
The plans for the peace moon
Hey, it's like that thing. This automatically makes it Star Wars
Never enrage the fans.
00,10change it? perhaps they just never deployed it
The cartoon or the tv series?
ep3 is the best of the 3 prequals easy
115?
That was a bit Stupid
bad idead
Okay.
xOVER9000!!!!! Kill
spray and pray
00,10it could have been worse. they could have had 3d tech for movies when this came out.
dang out of ammo
There is no time!
>rockets
>YOU HAVE FUCKING LAZERS
Dont they have lasers????/
why no lasers?
wth
PLEASE
"We're out of rockets. That's kind of inconvenient to us but convenient to the action choreographers."
we can't get him. He's on a scootie puff sr. not jr.
sucks to be her
Lazers could be out of amm
*ammo
actually if he did he would be fine
Could be out of... light?
11,01Use lasers, dumbass.
Sorry, run out of Lazers
Listen to be Obi Wan.
I AM ACTING
Again
SHOUTING MATCH
Lasers are deflected by shields, rockets are not.
she would put the ship down
4d is fine.
Lucas said, be loud and that should be enough.
05haha sumi<32
Follow the plot.
lasers run out in the universe HOW NO SERIOUSLY HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF AMMO IN A LASER GUN TELL ME DAMNIT
Okay.

Time to fight Count Dooku.
Stupid
that was stupid
lol
Stupid asshole
RUN AT IT THAT ALWAYS WORKS
Force Drain
Reikin: >it
He just pulled a Leroy Jenkins
Still not an epic fight like Darth Maul.
CHIDORI
Obi-Wan confirmed for dumbass
Quick_Think It could be that theyre not really lazers, but a type of bullet that doesnt exist in our universe(yet), and we just asume that theyre lazers since we have no other cool alternative
I hate the fight after this...
Well the music was.
the cool Lightsaber
muahaha
Tao...dude stop with the un-needed rp..
We need some epic music.
rape time!
^
no rape jokes
Get used to being crispy Annie...
just chillen in the sand
Clones are nicer than humans...
man you think anakin would have been traineed in handling lighting force attacks
HE WAS THERE, ALWAYS...
Oh hey, look, choreography.
NOW HES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE DX
Come one, some music would be good.
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH
dat dual-wield
you know obi wan you could just help
Yet... Anikan still fails..
LIAF
Suddenly, Anakin can duel wield.
Hes not good at 2 Sabers
00,10odd place for cable that powers lights in the wall
Obi Wan is injured.
how do you know when someone retweet you in twitter?
11,01Twirly flashy.
Or maybe he learned to duel wield.
It could not be training, but just instinct
He can't just get up and help him.
trying to make it looks as good as Empires lightsaber battle they are trying at least
MY ARM

Bring it on!
HADOKEN

This is getting a bit stupid
counter
Shizuuuu. Why does everyone in this film keep gripping the idiot ball? ;-;

Why can't you just light saber fight.

Now we fight!
05or i dunno, combining the two?
AW YEA!
Now this is a good fight
Dam he can move
technically, that is also the force IIRC
THE BUFFER IS WEAK IN THIS ONE

FINALLY WE HAVE AN EPIC BATTLE!
Fun fact: NO ONE took this fight sequence seriously in theaters
Note to self... never duel with midgits...
Oh snap

This is just-The Beginning
I'll take some popcorn. Here's three bits.

Why can't you shoot him?
USE BOTH HANDS YOU DUMB HANDMAIDEN

Voyager is when the series jumped the shark
"A force isn't just about pushing or pulling." Any physics majors here?
00,10Kerbal? perhaps
Voyager was awesome.
oh look, it's the pope
HAI EMPEROR
05i find myself saying the same about the latest star trek redux
No.

Oh no....
Victory?

I'd honestly like to see these SFM videos that are devoid of any of Valve's assets. But I'd probably have to pay for it, since the creators can legally charge for it.
Well.

Meanwhile..indeed...
05depending on if you have a tight knit friend circle
05atleast in america
THis movie seesm good.
05casue that place be dangerous
And in England.
ya blew it
England is hardly dangerous compared to America, doesn't stop you getting beat up in school though.
A Knight's Tale
I don't get beat up. People for some reason or another olike and respect me
Is taht old fellow Ulrics father?
Survival of the fittest=high school
05all in all we are great friends
Wrek|Observiking......sounds EXACTLY like my group of freinds last year....
05Alpha-Omega-Prime: i havent had bullyign problesm sicne i broke ones ribcage
inb4 Creepy dude murders ulric
But they are friends none-the-less
His father died?
the problem is that they say they hate them but they bring them up more then me a school :|:|
As for the last couple years, you don't bully the dealer. We played cards all the time.
I've always held my cool because when I get mad I won't stop untill I hear bones break or lack of breathing.
I'm inclined to ask how you can hear lack of breathing.
05i say soccer not to confuse you
Everyone in my school is aiming for sex, not even sports
xD
16 year old pregnancy get.
Current generations prime objectives. Sex Tobacco Alchohol Drugs sex and most prominent! Sex!
I hate the youth.
the problem is that they say they hate them but they bring them up more then me at school maby they say i must be gay to like the show :|:|
05people rarely get accepting of anythign untill they are around 18+
I want to hit them with kayak paddles.
05and by that time if they still ar ent
05there isnt much they can do about it
/me sighs
05and if they do
Just saying.
05well
05police ftw
05the random youth?

Live to fight another day you loony.

05what?
Oh there are 16 year olds doing that right now
There are 13 year old girls doing that right now!
PotC5?
lol
My school was literaly full of losers. The fail percentage was 80%
Pirates of the Carribian 5
05someone said this movie had a low score on imdb
05cant really get why
05must be the soundtrack
Probably.
The movie itself seems good
05TheRandomkid321: not really. the second pubwerty hits you loose control over such things
lose*
05adn as a parent thinkign you have it under control is foolign yourself
It's a good movie, but for some reason it wasn't well received overall. I think it was the history buffs that hated how inaccurate it was.
That little bugger
Makes sense respect him for being a knight. Then when he is on a display treat him like crap
I like the speaker. He is pretty good.
I have yet to see the fourth Pirates movie.
I admit is wasn't best of the series, but it was still enjoyable.
*likdd
*liked
Heard the last one kinda sucked.
The Mermaids were the best part pf the movie, IMO.
Been avoiding it for the sake of my opinion on the series.
part
i dont like the forth pirates of the caribiean
He is royalty?
oh damnit
^
OFF WITH YA HED!
Nice! I like fair and kind kings!
Or he really was just knighting him...
Cheating bastard.
cheater
Wait he has an illegal weapon!
He hesitates and that makes him look awkward.
He should just kill them
FIGHT!
Find out where they live and kill them
Let the Jousting begin!
Maybe.
Could be he's genuinely unfortunate.
It's just a flesh wound.
or both
05Spriggals: no he has no reason to confront them
Or the choice that works
Ignoring it.
William?
ulric
It's William now.
if he is in fact in highschool then i'm really sorry about him
THE HEART!
hey guys
other than that i don't really care
how are people today?
In the world where you aren't cheating.
The honest world?
I just remembered that last night my dream involved ponies.
Why do we watch movie with low scores from critics? Are ment to laugh or critique them?
critics know nothing
^
Dat kick.
I wish the Olmpics did jousting
those ones specifically are retarded
It's decent but I still don't like it
if critics were actually any good
not 80
