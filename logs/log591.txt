Poor Robocop...

im just a poor buy
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
See, if he ever admits that he's still Alex Murphy, she loses all her widow's benefits and insurance money.
Why is everyone mean to the cyborg
Engage robot tears
I'm a pony princess
is this the real life, or is this just fantasy
Oh god...not the electric chair! Anything but THAT!
Because robots don't have souls!
11,01I'm a maid. Hello.

Without those directives, he'd totally kill everyone.
WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT HER HE TOUCHES HIMSELF
the directives don't say anything about changing the directives.
Yeah she sounds like she's totally aware of how this happened.
lol
He became selfaware
awwww
:(
"I want a divorce."
Ohhh shi-
Nooooooooo
Robocop noooooooooooo
:'(
You could hear him trying not to cry.
Shooeie: he's a CYBORG not a robot
Stephen Hawking in his prime.
Poor robo cop
:(
00,10for god sakes put the helmet back on.
hello every ponyyy
Would you kindly put the mask back on...
:'( Still a better drama than As the World Turns

The fact he's a cyborg seems to be kind of a secret.

CK|Catnap: eeyup

Weird commercial
11,01That's why you don't use dial-up.
uh...
We'll give you a 128 Kbps line! SO FAST!
good idea...

Buy from us or die is what they are saying
IN Robocop-verse. Everything is controlled by stupid.
Commercials OF THE FUTURE!
I wonder if they are illegal here
Best commercial ever, hoofs down
pony_3515: robocop 2
I have a 792 KB/s line

I remember when dial-up was the only thing around.
Cypresswolf: THE HORROR!
arent the police force supposed to be government owned?
Who the hell read that?

My dad has a 6 Mb/sec
Who the fuck has that slow of a download speed

Discord: Um, more like about $15 trillion
Barbetos: the mayor.

Meanwhile why would the mayor not read that!? Who voted that asshole into power? Oh wait...

Black businessman as played by Wayne Brady

Rage=broken
Barbetos: Always read the fine print.
UMadBro?
FINALLY
Yo mad, brotah?
he ruined the city and dares to threaten the man who rescues the city?
shiny walls
The makers of this movie are the usual Hollywood fans of big government, portraying a heavily privatized society as a crime-ridden dystopia.
No, I take that back. He's like a slightly more competent Tracy Morgan.
black man is crazy
Only 19 million?
Shiny floor is shiny
i like that guy

You know, that second Robocop 2 waited until he was ON CAMERA before he pulled his helmet off.
My God, these execs are stupid.
Those robot designs...:O It's Fallout Robot Tech!
>desirable
Yeah, because it's not like a cyborg has a brain. Oh wait . . .
alexxm: ok, just'veseen tkdr
Cypresswolf: it's classic cyberpunk from the 80's
Kandarihu: activated the first time for real
WHAT COULD GO WRONG.
:D
soldiers
I would wanna be a cyborg if I died
Kandarihu: just like robocop 1
how was it SirGanjalf
*put space there
Cypresswolf: except Mr House was a smarter inventor than OCP
I just dont know what went wrong
:D
....
Derpy Cop :D
lol

NO BLOOD FOR OLD BUSH IS A NAZIIIIE xD

mmmmdrugs
About to get owned....
nvm..
Cypresswolf: Mr House was a successful businessman in 2077
Cops take drug test you know
11,01I wonder if OCP created Nuke to destabilize Detroit?
brb
shoot him!
Nittany_Discord: you THINK!?
owloysius: its a drug it does drug things
Cop has his standards
Nittany_Discord: Probably, they managed everything else.
Hey look it's me as a kid in :A
Does Detroit need more destabilizing?
tLA
Fou_Lou: it's apparently a high drug
SHOOT HIM
Hey look it's me as a kid in LA
is anypony up for a game of strip global thermonuclear war?
dem arcades
guys im from EU is detroit really that bad ?
Midnight_Fyre: sure, it hasn't literally toppled yet.
lol
Going to play Space Invaders
nice
Arcades, now a indangered species :(
i like that gamne
Nah, he'll be playing Hyperdyne SideArms
Darf14: an* endangered*
pony_9938: Good God no, this is a movie from the 80's describing future Detroit
Glad to know government money is well spent
DOH!
NUT
and goddammit I MISS ARCADES!
TRAITOR
OH SNAP WHAT A TWEST
i know detroit form somewhere.......i watched a game of something with the detroit...lions i think in it?
Speaking of Detroit, we should watch Gran Torino sometime
from*
That cop is a SPY!
kid is mafia boss
otakoni mean in real ime i cnow is a movie derp
Well, considering that OCP is a stereotypical major corporation, I wouldn't be surprised if they were behind Nuke, except that it's killing their own customers.
The local bar used to have a pinball machine. I miss that damn thing.
cmon huffy
yah dont say
hes taking Buffout :O
lucky i love arcades
LAWl
DATA EAST
:D
<3
lawl
xD
lol
You need it *waves hand*
who knew that'd be dirty cops
xD
haha
School day.
xD
he's a cop
"Isn't this a school day?"
Kandarihu: OCP was just a parody of what corporations were presenting themselves as in the late 80's.
when i die, i wanna get resurected as a cyborg
00,10why not use the same door stupid
hes doomed
There is a 30 year old man in that crowd?
Run, porky.
ROBO-truancy officer
that reminds me, i have school work to do.....shit
Truency is biggest priority for robocop
But OCP would profit from destabilizing Detroit. So they can justify their Delta City plan.
Sumica: cause hes trying to avoid robocop im gussing?
Shoot him
Buck the polic- *gets shot by Robocop*
backshot
Nice move
lol
yay
the poor boy
:D
sly spy
good thing kid didnt decide to shoot her
*kid gets away* Fluttershy: yay
Owned by a kid?
Well, it should be noted that OCP is also a monopoly. At no point do we ever see any company small or big that's in competition with OCP
that could have gone better
dude cmon
THYERE
wow, she is being defeated by a kid
xD
DI YOU GUYS SEE THAT?!
officer huffy
BAD DUDES

Heya Thrackerzod
Darf14: not that Kane. Nod!Kane is cooler.

Distortion: not really
why did they even make a third part?
oops wrong Kane
00,10WHERE.IS.KANE!
I was joking
Lob.
Okay, Data East obviously exists in this universe, and is competing with OCP for entertainment. But that's practically just product placement.
Ghost busters
Thrackerzod: Hey! Also, ou have to get out of Sweetie Belle's body.
Bad cop is best cop
Jaws theme, robocop style
Fuck barries

I AM A NORMAL HUMAN

They should make a lego robocop game :D
00,10oh is Thrackerzod around? how is life as a normal pony?
ShadowQuill Sweetie has her own body, i have copyed this one and now use it for my own, to ahive a goal of being a regualr pony
huh, that place looks familiar
Nice looking place.
a 2015 remake of robocop might work
If I recall correctly, RoboCop takes place in 1996.
yah
Suica good, i am watching robo cop like all the other regular pony
Discord but who else would be playable i mean theres usaully at least 100 playable characters
No. No remakes. Leave Robocop alone.
^
Thrackerzod: Yes. We are normal. We brush our normal teeth. This is a typical game.
Wasn't a fight in Highlander II at the same old building.
Discord, YFW they're making a Lego game about a crooked cop
BOOM
ded
00,10ka-boooooom
he doesnt dance often, but when he does, he does the robot
The most stilted walk ever. Perfect for catching criminals.
Um.
How.
Mines.
Bolo tie = Jackass
derp
damn landmines
00,10landmine
yes mines
Good point Meanwhile , we dont want Robocop to have the same faithe as Terminator
Alexxm you could be a lot of villains, and random cops.
it's EMPTY
....they planted land mines in their base of operations?
no corpse
burned out in less than 30 seconds
i heard robocops design was based on some japanese superhero show
CK|Catnap: They probably don't use that entrance.
I see no robot parts....... We killed him :)
alexxm, I can see that
Robocp is loudest Solid Snake
Meanwhile: I would hope not since that would make them really fucking stupid.
CK|Catnap: Damn funny though.
Sneaky he is not
alexxm, maybe Metal Hero.
Darf14: did they knew it was robocop? and not normal cop?
I declare that im the most normal pony in this chat and for this a demand a exsplantion on how i would talk over this site to create a clan to KILL TWILIGHT SPARKEL
Yeah, that worked so well last time.
:D no
sneak skill +20
Let's try it again.

Kandarihu i think the show was called space sherrif
Fucks given = 0

Oh, the SATIRE!

Thrackerzod: what?? dont you dare hurt her
THEY KILLED ELVIS!
elvis
This Kane has a Messiah Complex. The other Kane IS a Messiah.
We FOUND ELVIS :D
Hello Elvis
holy shit he has Elvis' corpse
elvis*
that's a dot!
Lil_B: They are stupid
Thrackerzod, what?
That's just weird.
you can almost see Elvis's pelvis
the hell was that?
because he must show off his awesome, Lil_B
You would think they woud learn to use a grenade or missle launcher
umm
shoot her?
Yoooooooou!
umm
YOOUUUU
Pelvis Resley?
dead or alive
DOA
either they have really good sculptors and made an exact replica of a dot or spent £500 on a dot
Midnight_Fyre: derpy_pony for the Movie!

Ryunosuke: still a cop, strict programming and moral standards
Distortion: they did use a missle launcher.

DocSane: They didn't mention that bit in the old testament.
DAMNIT KID
Even if the kid is evil, He could have used the 50 cal to finish Robocop off.
ancientblood: it's Summer of Trilogies, this week is Robocop and Star Wars prequels

Jesus killed criminals and walked in a really slow manor
Fucking magnets...
MAGNETS, HOW DO THEY FUCKING WORK
00,10uhhhhhhh not sure but I dont think titanium is ferous
Kandarihu its called a god complec
that would not work I don't think
Looks like Kane is an expert in Crane style.
DAMN YOU MAGNETO

magnets how do they work
its not
They made him out of iron? Morons
Curses, why did they made me to be magnetic!?
Seriously, I want that child to die
CK|Catnap: uhh, and how do they work?
Sumi: the Iron inside of him?
Titanium
Kandarihu: are you sure? God claims to have created every plant, and jesus claims to be god...
ouchie
Its Hammer Time!
Thrackerzod, good point
Hammer to the balls
so jesus made all of the psychogenic plants
this will keep him down

My balls are being sledgehammered!
This kid is a dick\
ancientblood: every day is movie night

Son of a bitch, I want our incredibly inefficent robot fighter.
hahaha

Bonk.

DEMOMAN IS SPY
Kandarihu: It was released in 1990, so it was still made in the 80s.
They cant fix him there trying to pay for a non working healthcare plan, wait did i say that?
DocSane, okay.

CCCP: why?
Labels!

You shut up. :I
Now they ded
Why do you have to label people?

Robocop 2
Half a billion would let OCP make a portal to Equestria

Robocop 2.0
CCCP: no, the single-minded pursuit of money is evil
Optimus Primes.

StinkomanFan: Knowing OCP, they'd stripmine it and enslave all the ponies.

Shit gets real now
/me thinks the kid has a point
Bad CGI
Whatever it is it's pissed.
its yeh terminator
Stop motion not cgi
And it's stop motion, not CGI
Distortion its not CGI
well that was useful
Stop motion :$
bad stop motion
RUN RANDY JACKSON RUN!
The kid has no concept of business ethics. He certainly has no good role models, after all.
Its pretty good stop motion i think
DocSane: honestly as long as it doesn't have long term detriments it wouldn't be that bad. No worse than liquor or cigarettes
CRUSH! KILL! DESTROY! SWAG!
pewpew
for stop motion i find it rather Convincing
CCCP: physical effects from the 80's are almost ALWAYS great
ded
otakon agreed!
he's dead
Anything's better than CGI for realism.
so many holes
Kandarihu: he's acting in the interest of his shareholders, and increasing profits.
RUN FATMAN RUN!
Meanwhile YES!
Except maybe paper maché
ROBOCRIMINAL
I AGREE
otakon, Liquor kills brain cells and tobacco coats the inside of lungs, though.
shoot first, ask questions later
Kandarihu: yeah but if Nuke doesn't do that it's not nearly as bad
I remember the glorious Puppets from Starship Troopers.
Weed > Liquer
RUN FATTY RUN!

CCCP: I'm sure that means so much to you.
11,01Uhh....
Because its a legalised killer
11,01Can't follow it up.
FIRST RULE OF TPS'S! TAKE COVER
I never cared for stop motion, really. The only times I've seen it pulled off well is King Kong and some Harryhausen films (but only some of them)
11,01Trying to make a Hammer Time joke.

Meanwhile yes it does :3

if this was Homefront, he wouldn't have gotten hit
We need a Robocop fighting game

Reboot was a brilliant show

Cypresswolf: Now I am become Gigabyte, destroyer of systems.
Kandarihu: from what we see, it's a mental stimulant. And the doctors said Kane's brain was clean. Apparently it has withdrawal symptoms and is highly addictive but besides that doesn't seem to do damage.
I loved how much 4th wall fucking there was
awwww yeah
/me is looking away.
RustyMeat, are you saying Reboot had bad CGI?
And then she was a robosexual
This is why we relied on stop motion and other real effects back then since the CG sucked

Well, let's just say the commentary on here made it clear that people were soaking the stereotypes up like a sponge.
/me huuggies Meanwhile
Rushed ending.....the humans were DUMBER than Robocop.........
:P
Lol
:P
Kandarihu: S'called enjoying the movie.
Humans.....they don't think/10
lol
:D
MaxTheBrony: with what? it looks like a slightly peeved Dash
Besides, did you see that robot punch?
Kandarihu: as long as you know that are stereotypes.
AND NOW FOR ATTACK OF THE CLONES
/me sighs
Meanwhile: no huggies? ;_;
I like to give this movie a rating one step beyond/11
@MAx I can see no ears, Also the eyes are too small for the classical MLP Fim style
CCCP: No.
/me huggies otakon
CCCP: Meanwhile does not hug, you should know this
Robo Cooooooop
Meanwhile pwease! :(
i've still never seen star wars :)
Epicmetalbrony: Its the one hanging down
like sad ears
suddenly chanting Robocop
otakon: i know :3
If I do hug, it's like Spyke from the X-men movie.
Fou_Lou, in the '60s and '70s, asians were consistantly treated as villains. If we were to watch a movie like that, and start talking about how all asians are evil schemers, it would be no less of a disgusting experience.
I missed a Kandarihu hissy fit. Oh well.
What? I thought he took me off ignore.
Kandarihu is basically chat's /that guy/
I love you!
Good night everypony, gotta draw some ponies before its getting too early in the morning
otakon: Idunno. I really think I might skip Clones. The last movie was bad in a fun way. Attack of the clones is just . . . bad. 2.5 hours of boring annoyances, by far the worst thing to come out of the Star Wars franchise. I don't know if I can take it
I love you yes its true!

Fluttershy!
i don't really like the german voices
But on at least two occasions, I changed my nick while he's around. As far as I'm concerned, that's a ban evasion.
oh look, THE SPEECH OF LUNA'S PEOPLE!
I hope he plays the worst voice overs
Again no Latin?
Shooeie: we JUST heard Latin

Shooeie: there were several latin songs

i would normally go to sleep now, because it's dumb not to but Sumica's streaming so i stay up until my eyes bleed. literally that happened once, it was 4AM
Lunar_Brony: Hai!

There should be Derpy, there should be
BronyInstrumental: did it hurt?
CCCP: i've been here the whole time
11,01Valve is adding forced arbitration?!
Attack of the Clones is by far the worst Star Wars film ever. I've tried to erase it from my mind and watching it again would be counterproductive to that end
Dark92Enigma: sip en la bronymexicon
cachi01 exactly.
11,01Oh fuck.
twilight_sprinkle: no more than staying up till 4AM would
Nittany_Discord nope as far as i could read

THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Since we're on intermission - Has anyone heard of The Holder Series?
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Meanwhile many people file the same claim under the same case
NOT THE BEES!
And here's Nittany to complain about the state of the...the...um...what's the word for like, group of things that are all similar and function the same kind of way in primal state?
THEY ARE IN MY EYEEEEEES
CCCP: no of course you can! Hi! :)
instead of everyone doing separedtly
OW THE STINGSSSS
:D
11,01Meanwhile: When a company adds a No Class Action rule, it means that you can't bring them to court under a Class Action Lawsuit unless they break a law.

11,01My mind is blown.
Reading that sentence makes my brain hurt.
cachi01 Y U RAGE?
outlined a new required process whereby we agree to use arbitration or small claims court to resolve the dispute. In the arbitration process, Valve will reimburse your costs of the arbitration for claims under a certain amount.
In not-english?
I'll ask my sister, she knows law.
Lunar_Brony: LATIN DISCOVERY KIDS
hey at least even if you sue them they will pay you back the cost
11,01But they can choose the court, and pay that court to give whatever verdict they want.
cachi01 oh\
ok so Ima tryin to buy minecraft (again) but the damn thing wont talk a credit card and why I try to use paypal its in friggen euros (im in us) can someone solve my delema?
whatev
i loved discovery kids

cachi01 empezando por: el especial de los sabados por la mañana (esos en que tu eliges el programa y ellos transmiten por dos horas) Sacaron a MLP FIM de la lista, mas no del canal (MAS LES VALE) yo tambien espero para el proximo mes
Reimbursement by Valve is provided regardless of the arbitrator’s decision <<
ok :(
Seriously, that guy should of been Doug Walker.
KEEP IT ENGLISH PLEASE!
or take it to PM
NO NOSTALGIA CRITIC?
otakon what about Engrish?
11,01And statistics have shown that arbitration decisions go in favor of the company.
Cypresswolf, sounds like some sort of grimoire.
11,01I think by 90%.
Lunar_Brony: no engrish
:O
shoo be doo
/me contemplates not eating pizza anymore forever.
uh oh
Shoo be doo
lolwut?
:D
Shizuka: so do I "link new debit or credit card" or "add money from your bank account"?
Tovler how could you even think that?
Dark92Enigma: lo cambiaron de hora. envez the transmitirlo a las 10:00 como todos los dias lo transmiten a las 2:30
not many people sue valve anyway ._.
Shardz0fH3ll4386, wait till the end of Sumica's streams :)
what are we waiting for?
owloysius stuff
13Dovah: back when i bought i just entered the card directly
owloysius, sea ponies :)
00,10but Shizuka is streaming now Ryunosuke
owloysius: Attack of the Clones
Kandarihu: yep, interestingly, I found a youtube channel with several creepy pasta stories :) listened to them for hours last night
13it adds something like 1% for a conversion fee
13but it's all automatic
:(
otakon Ok, bro relax........is it wrong that everypony from EVERYWHERE come here?
Cypresswolf: mrcreepypasta?
You know what? My privilege to be here is now in serious jeopardy. Until I can get this straightened out, I don't think I should be chatting here normally. I'm in a LOT of hot water here.
well
Shizuka: whenever i enter the card the damn thing doesnt work
Dark92Enigma: no but dammit textwalls in spanish are kind of aggravating
Kandarihu what did you do?
I meant the frown in the fact that there probbably wont be sea ponies, not the fact that Shizuka is streaming :)
/me 11,01sighs
sorry, I'm curious
Dovah: did you work the shaft?
Kandarihu: CreepyMcPasta
Harassing someone who has me on ignore.
Kandarihu: How so?
Kandarihu :O
otakon: ..................................................
Kandarihu: well just apologize and stop harassing
Dovah: this is what i did. i bought a gift code from mercado libre (mexican ebay) you should buy a gift code from ebay
where was Luna when we found Gondor? :p
I changed my nick after I THOUGHT he took me off ignore.
Dovah: FUS RO DAH
otakon, this is WAY beyond apology.
:'(
no Derpy muffin is not a instrument...... Cupcakes is not a instrument either
Kandarihu: Mr. Widemouth is a good one
poor dery
Los rabanos no son un instrumento tampoco
derpy*
Yes Derpy, muffin IS an instrument! STFU Squidward!
Okay. I am ready for Star Wars Episode 2.
Kandarihu: Tbh, all I've ever heard you say is that you'll be in trouble. As opposed to actually saying anything...well, troubling.
LETS DO THIS http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww303/DementedDSL/2012-07-31_20-22-41_884.jpg
Kandarihu: dude how so? what did you do?
Apologizing for this simply means I want to get away with it.

DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN
i thought this was english only, idc if they speak spanish i understand but yah know....

Shardz0fH3ll4386: hai
Thanks
Smooze spelled backwards is ezooms
When you people learned how to SPELL YOUR NAME
pass* dammit!
Chat needs moar trolls
Sure I would like to be able to convince him to take me off ignore. But changing my nick to something random that I know he doesn't have ignored and just chatting is way WAY out of line.
Np.
of course, Gondor was on the mood
*moon*
mood?
!!!ezooms eht pots eht uoy
chat needs more luna :)
lol
CCCP you might want to have an item that attracts them here

Midnight_Fyre i love that one! <3
bad nightmare moon
stole moffins
otakon I tab-failed

Kandarihu: Did you do it specifically to target him? If not I wouldn't worry about changing your nick.
i see a bad moon rising..
Indeed.
Lol
ALL THE BUFFERS
It's going to get even more complicated once Nittany_Discord gets his computer put together and starts streaming Steam games again.
i hear troubles on the way...
Midnight_Fyre, no excuse. No excuse at all.
Genuine shoutout or not though?
Lunar_Brony CCCP: Thanks
i should prebbly sleep now, 'for my eyes bleed again
probbly*
I have to be held to the same standard as these giant corporations.
6_9
Lol
BronyInstrumental will you?
maybe
Kandarihu: Again, did you do it specifically to target him?
What if bronystate becomes canon?
MUFFINS!!!:P
MUFFINS!!
MUFFINSSSSS!!!!!!!!
:P :P :P
CCCP we need more cannonballs of course
CCCP: if we do it.....they will come
SSSSSSSNIFFUM

Midnight_Fyre, can I prove that I didn't target him?

Objection, its 4:40 seconds until ponie
CCCP: ..... THEY will
wait I mean...oh too late -_-
BronyInstrumental umm like trolls?
Woah, intermission still?
ehh as far as i know it could be since riot have many bronies but thinking that everything is a shoutout is just wrong
Kandarihu it sounds like you're making a mountain that can reach into space out of a molehill.
SirGanjalf eeyup
im not a troll
SirGanjalf, its 20 mintues?
im not trollestia
Tovler and yet it way more off topic than it originally was
4 left
Exactly, still cool though.
CCCP: idk it's a referrance to something :D!
We must construct additional pylons
BronyInstrumental oh lol
If it's more fun to refute my claims of innocence, or it makes people feel more free to find whatever excuse they can to hate on me, it would be "oppresive" for me to plead my innocence.
lol
CriticKitten: if anything, they might need other jedis more, so might as well send a padawan to protect her and hes a friend of hers
PWNED
uh oh
13downshifted a bit fast there obi wan
Excuuuuuuse me, m'lady

dis planet is cool
do NOT, I repeat do NOT argue with a woman, you will NOT win :)
RosePetal: Holy hay, you're right!
wow, great minds think alike :)
amazing Kamino theme iniciate
midalcorin count over 20000 my ass
twilight_sprinkle: You're missing a simple fact. They have *thousands* of Jedi.
Poof!
Nittany_Discord: you would love this planet :P
Fou_Lou: they were sabers made of light...goddammit I hate these movies now. 1, 2, 3 shit on the lore of the original trilogy
R4
And Anakin is like Excuuuuuuuse me, princess!
11,01twilight_sprinkle: Why?
CriticKitten: more like hundreds actually
This is my favorite star wars planet!
11,01Constant storms?
Ryunosuke: Not with that attitude.
Kamino, the planet that always rains.
CriticKitten: and they have *thousands* of planets
I've got a LEGO minimodel of that ship
water! water everywhere!
Its a storm planet, I need to make some Coolant!
i thought the lightsabers light came from a weird stone or mineral
13oh look, the planet where god had fun with the stretch tool in spore creature creator
In the Lego Star Wars game we just skipped all that boring plot and moved onto this
11,01Shizuka: would love it.
Nittany_Discord: eeyup, lots to keep track of
it's pretty cool
crystal*
from a crystal
twilight_sprinkle: And they all need a pair of Jedi at the same time?
And now for our forecast- Rain and tons more of rain.
hm my favorie planet in hte universe is the one with the zombies
Jedi, welcome to Water World
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
13rain rain?
The Prime Minister of Kamino.
otakon: actually its some kind of hot plasma if im right. and you can cotrol their output.
twilight_sprinkle: Also it's only a few hundred.
HAS ANYONE EVER PLAYED STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO? THE BEST STAR WARS GAME EVER?!?!!?
yep
welcome to Zora planet
We could be watching Water World instead of this.
Shizuka oh, now i get it
Why the long neck?
Rain is best weather
i like these aliens
Oh, i forgot to mention that in the last movie (the I) They re-named the lightsabers as ''light swords''...............................HELLO??????????????????????????????
CriticKitten: well seeing how theyre entire planets, yeah, at least a pair would be nice. and iirc,theyre thousands
They is aliens.
twilight_sprinkle: Significantly less in the time period this exists in.
repbulic commando is not better then KOTOR thoough
otakon: and whats so wrong of having some training sabers for the younglings at the academy
Tovler we should. You know why? . . . STUFF!!
13see... now we're getting something resembling a plot.... 40 minutes into the movie..
It's a hotel.
brb
twilight_sprinkle: No, it's only a few hundred.
CriticKitten: how can there be significantly less planets
too... much... cgi
thats good news
8,6I have yet to see any appreciable plot, and I am disappoint
Shizuka I'm trying to think of a plot joke, but this is Star Wars . . .
So much WHITE!
Cliche #234: Relying too much on CGI
needs more bloom
has anyone played Jedi Outcast where you go to Yavin and get training on sabers and watch as teens use actual sabers to fight
Apple aliens
twilight_sprinkle: Because it's one galaxy, and the canon of Star Wars has only established a few hundred planets as canonical members of the Republic. :p
kirzstryfe you beat me to a plot joke
I gotta say, I'll be annoyed if the Oceans Trilogy doesn't get played before this summer event ends.
iPlanet
8,6I'm always on the lookout for a good plot :3
what happened in the last 10 minutes?
these are the cleanest aliens in the galaxy
SirGanjalf: xD
"And they will totally not betray you"
kirzstryfe then why are you watching Star Wars?
THE PLOT! IT DID NOTHING!
CriticKitten: there can be a lot more they havent shown
cachi01: credit to twilight_sprinkle
space Italy
/me 11,01dusts kirzstryfe's plot.
THis is so painful
LOVE MADE ANAKIN GO EVIL
Love story again.
god even the men alien has boobs
Did these clone army payments just fall off the budget? clones aint cheap to feed!
SirGanjalf: haw?
oh shut up handmaiden
No one cares
HOW ROMANTIC TELL US MORE
TELL A STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!
8,6just because you can't see the plot doesn't mean I cannot :P
SirGanjalf: oh nvm
kirz: This one's flat and bony.
Probably the most painful thing about Tovler having me on ignore is when he says something that I want to respond to.
:c
COOL STORY SIS
Discord: nope hate and fear made him
LIK MAI CUM
ugh love story, at least its a better love story than Twilight
Pokemon R/B had better dialog.
I love da water. I love the flowers. Did I mention I love the water.
CREEPER
13now.. i dunno if you guys remember casino royale well, but isn't this the exact same balcony where that one guy is shot at the end?
AND SO ARE YOU.
ugh
Sup cachi01 :p
Fou_Lou If he hadn't met Padme he would not be evil.
I like shorts. They're comfy and easy to wear.
Fucking E.T for Atari had better dialogue!
Really?
OHH GOD NO!
DONT!
creeper
and i mean EVERYWHERE *wink wink*
OHH GOD DX
Cavalluccio_: hi!
NO!
dont do eeeet
Shizuka it is?
You're soft. And smooth. And I want to rub you.
WHYYYY D:?!
lol
oh god
PEDOPHILE
Love make you EVILLLLL!
13missed opportunity for a record scratch there
PEDO
YESH!
Be creepier Annie.
my god at least Han was good looking and quite bad ass (in the books his ship blew up and he fixed it twice)
PEDOOOOOO
:D
So. The leaders of the Jedi sense that there is something wrong with fate, that it is uncertain, after years and years of not being this way. Suddenly war happens, and they get a clone army dumped on them. At the very least they could sense the evilness in that somewhere? No? Okay.
rape face activated
How you doin today ?
dat face:D
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL
Let us KISS!
Shizuka: no, not really. Did that end with someone drinking motor oil, or was that you only die once?
CriticKitten: my opinions are idiotic then? bye, im done wasting your time with my idiocy
I missed the record scratch?
CLONE BABIES
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL PEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOO
xD
The translation of Zero Wing was written better than this movie
lol
OH COME ON
Nope.
no
Too late.
YA THINK
YODO!
denied motherfucker!
twilight_sprinkle: Which makes no sense.
by "I'm sorry" he means "I regret nothing"
13star wars, continuing the tradition of letting powerpoint do your scene transitions
Discord: thats a point. but its hard to tell what happend if they never met. he wouldnt probably a jedi and still a slave on tatooine
Test tube babies.
HOW DID NATALIE PORTMAN ACCEPTED HIS SHITTY SCRIPT?
ALL THESE EXTRAS HAVE NAMES
THX 1138
Clones: superior to droids, except when they're not
She needed money man.
Shizuka..and its the SAME ONE over and over again..
I like how you can press refresh a skip several seconds of this movie.
11,01Well, Valve has more to lose pissing customers off since they don't trade.
ALL THESE EXTRAS HAVE NAMES
13StinkomanFan: amazingly, they're all named Gary
I blame the economy.
I love this soup.
CriticKitten: they mentioned many times throughout this film they dont have enough jedi.
Shizuka: Gary's Mod
clones! clones everywhere
That's right. They can make clones in only HALF a lifetime now!
11,01They don't have investors to hold them when their PR goes south
so they all based off of jango so in a way he never dies
13oh my god cachi01
twilight_sprinkle: When?
11,01.
xd
13you discovered the secret!
Which is more iPoddy, This or Star Trek 2009?
13someone went around spamming the NPC tool!
THIS.
"I think I'm a clone now, there's always two of me just hanging around"
Republic Clone Trooper was a great game
The down side to these clones is that they have energy weapon skills of 0
THAT EXPLAINS IT!
I love star wars republic commando. They should have made a second one.
CriticKitten: well i remember several times in the end, it was the reason they accepted the army.
I want to make a joke about housewives, but I'm not a stupid bastard
that's it!
Discord its being kicked arround
CriticKitten: so you can raise a whole army in 10 years. why not
8,6what's the change?
NO TAKE THE ORIGNAL MUSIC OUT NOW FUCK YOU MOVIE
Too late.
OH GOD NOT MORE GODDAMN ROMANCE!
NOOOO!
twilight_sprinkle: They state that the Jedi cannot fight the entire clone army, yes. But that's because there are millions of droids. >_>
jesus
brb again
Fou_Lou: hitler ould y not them?
Jar Jar, save us from this monotone.
FUCK YOU TO THE CAVES UNDER CANTERLOT CASTLE
Even Twilight's love story is better than this
OOOOOOOH I wonder WHO of all of them will turn EVIL, except for ALL OF THEM?
8,6./run adv dup
Twilight is a better love story
looks like a Final Fantasy Background
Ryunosuke: NO
11,01Funny how the guy proving the "good guys" army is the same guy trying to kill him.
cachi01: WHAT?
twilight_sprinkle: Thousands of Jedi still can't kill millions of droids in a pitched battle, as this movie (tries to) show.
At least these people have emotion unlike Bella.
JUST GET BACK TO THE FUCKING ACTIOAN
RosePetal say what you want about the prequal. Their Soundtracks are Awesome
Im in love... oh no.... Im going to the Dark Side~ :O
13she's wearing miniature beehives on her ears
CriticKitten: hundred
11,01They're putting a "No class action lawsuit" clause in their ToS.
13she heard it's all the buzz
Where's the action!
for the love of god stop preaching
CriticKitten: hundreds*
I don't think your acting lessons worked...
who's steaming
otakon: I'm fairly certain it's thousands.
Fasicism

Weird animal cow things
13LOOK AT ALL THE FUCKS WE GIVE ABOUT THIS ROMANCE
otakon: Got a source handy?
Silly Padme, it's not winter yet. You can't wear earmuffs in the spring.
11,01That's true sadly.
someone wise hmmmmmmm WHY NOT PICK hhmmmmmm Princess Leia Organa
Shizuka also by fox
Get on with it.
GIANT FLEAS
oh look, surprise giant space fleas
WTF IS THAT THING!?!
cachi01: lol, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY PENIS

Let's frolic in the field.

Push over the Cows
Cgi.

11,01In part, our sue-happy culture brought it on themselves.

OH NO, IS HE DEAD?????? I WONDER OF HE WILL SURVIVE LIKE ------------SON OF A BITCH

He's not dead

He's not dead... yet :|

I can just imagine...Vader, 20 years later, after the Empire is destroyed..."I should have worn a condom, then my kids wouldn't have defeated me."
Wookiepedia? What are those space fleas called?
NOT QUITE DEAD
Rolling in the grass is FUN!
anakin skywalker trampled, end of series
i feel smexy today
Quick, flea thing, kill them both before they can keep taking up screentime.
11,01Costing consumers and companies money over trivial matters.
hi thing from jurrasic park

OH MY GOD
Dinosaurs in Kamino.
I like how they just hold the frame during the screenwhipe
booba
Sure ^^ -looks at obi oddly-
Quick_Thinker: pterodyctyl lol
11,01But without fair trail, companies can abuse the law to get their way.
Boba Fett.
cratorkid I can't believe I'm saying this, but yeah, you're right
dat Eeyup
Eeyup.
BOBA !!!!
11,01Except criminal law.
8,6actually, they provide a reasonable arguement for the change
shu
11,01I know.
Hello Boba and Jango Fett.
Boba, the greates badass in the galaxy
BOBBA FETT
boba fett jango fett
11,01And I appreciate that.
I like the weather.
lol boba
So was his father.
ib4 young Han Solo shows up for no reason.
1...2...JANGO!
13obi wan fails a detect bluff check... and another.... and another...
CriticKitten: I was wrong, according to the books it was about 9000 before the Battle of Genosis and Order 66.
Jenga Fett
13you know obi wan... just get a new d20... you suck at this
Shizuka: mandalorian
that mandalorian
Django Unleashed
man obi wan sucks at the D20 system
The Fetts are badass.
8,6and most issues that would result in a class action would more liklely originate in a product, not in Valve's services itself
BOBBA FETT............is this KID????????
my name is wat
WHAT THE FUCK?
YES
8,6at least what I can think of
Shizuka: they're immune to force mind skills
my name is who
YOU IDIOT
Boba Fett IS the kid.
11,01I just feel betrayed.
otakon: Yeah I had thought it was a lot. According to this source I'm reading, there are 200 Jedi alone in the pitched battle later in this movie.
AND IT'S BOBA
my name is boba
yep Dark thats BOBA FETT YOU MAD?
xD
where is Bronysith?
He's okay.
CUASE IM PISSED
oh there he is
11,01Because jumping on the 'take power away from the consumer" bandwagon is more of an EA/Activision thing.
otakon beats me
PFFFFFFFFT
otakon: ping?
:D
buffer
that kids glare
I didn't really care.
13boba fett.. less on screen importance than derpy.... ten times the popularity

LOL
05the jedi order is like the SS but religious
11,01Lol Shizuka.
otakon: im finishing up dead money
RosePetal: i KNOW......but i still feel angry.........as well as Quick_Thinker
Shizuka: Derpy is the Boba of our fandom
Ah Jango Fett. His entire existence is hollow fan service.
a pleasure to meet a jedi hmm that means hes killed a few ( he did in the bount hunterr games)
time to GTFO
FOCUS MOVIE, FOCUS
Dat dialogue
nope, my food!
Laser Diplomacy
Yoink.
Dat showing off
Dats my food.
yeah bitch ITS MINE
was that scene even needed?
if Derpy is Boba, does that mean she'll die in season 3?
Atton Rand could show Jango a few tricks
Grumpy! :[
Ryunosuke ADHD IN SPACE: The Movie

Thank you.
Shizuka: it does

Dken2021: nope

SCREENCAP!
But it's definitely atrophied.
Ever authorize the creation of buffering? I hope not.
SCREENCAP IT!
welp
I'm gonna use this :3
And that one time with RAWRity and otakon
but i have to say. robocop 2 was better than this
the buffer-o-meter is OFF THE CHARTS
OH COME ONE

Mace Windu is not amused.

Epic screencap
13major derp...
Meanwhile: lol yes

/me glomps Shizuka
I think I got up to the point where Shizuka restarted the stream, but we seem to all be having the buffer
Obi-Wan's message to the council is buffering
13and lost connection on that one
Just hangin' out here while trying to write something and monitoring my Minecraft server =.=

/me leaves to catch a flight to hawaii for 5 months until it stops buffering
Thrackerzod read Garretbrony 's message
I lost the movie picture.

DBZ: what Bleach tried to be, right down to the lack of planning on the author's side.
oh thank goodness, though it was just on my end
Derpy must be in charge of Mips again
Shizuka we may have something great here
Lunar_Brony: it's out of Shizuka's hands atm
darf, no.. Derpy's in charge of Comcast
What ever shall we do?!
Mace Windu is Like I am Tired of these MotherFucking BUffers on my MutherFucken Stream Thrackerzod

Herp ALL the derp.
Blind, we are

Bleached: Sounds like a romantic comedy revolving around a dry cleaner's.
That face of malice
Yoda: Stream, disappoint I am
how do you screencap?
It looks like he's constipated.
Steams still broken.
Yoda: Why Buffer?
11,01Lol.
Yoda is using Force Buffering
RosePetal Steam or Stream?
I think She's fixing it.

Darf14 somepony did already
I think someone already it.

-____________-
Shizuka I thought you lived in Japan
http://i.imgur.com/3ydTy.jpg
ohhh they changed champions already ... i was having fun with skarner
Dovah better to be pissed off than pissed on
So Star Wars is canceled?
13if i did... i would have much better internet..
Shizuka: is it nice there?
I'm always having fun with Nocturne.
Lunar_Brony Clicked the wrong link in the newsletter and removed myself from doing any more surveys for movie night.
And I...kind of have fun with Morgana?
13in minnesota... no
/me hugs Shizuka "It's okay dear, shit happens"
Meanwhile I love you
Barbetos *cringes*
Shizuka: well that sucks
How is everyone able to catch these awesome buffer shots but I can't?
http://i.imgur.com/8sm8P.jpg
Shizuka Probably
I dunno, getting three Deathcaps gets old after the third or fourth time you do it :3
Meanwhile: XD
Meanwhile: lol man
Why is that link even there? D=
I mean honestly? what the buck is so hard to undersand about useing a credit card to buy things online?????

lol mines still buffering with a black screen :[
welp, I'm off to try out Fall of Cybertron
05http://i.imgur.com/ywWxx.png
For stupid blondes like me I guess.
mine is yoda staring at the buffer
ping me when it comes back
Also which font is that you're using?
11,01If there was a competing broadband ISP, Shizuka's family's internet bill would be lower.
I've set up a buffer folder just for this
Two buffer images for the price of one. T'is an interesting one.
's got a nice pop to it.
MEME incoming
Wrek: You got the untexted image?
Wrek: lol
Who's free right now? I'm too lazy to wait an hour for my client to patch.
I'm runing low on pony fuel, I need to do something related to refill it D:
13indeed... $75 for 12/4 as is...
11,01I bet it's why I paid less for faster internet in PA than Shizuka.
I use Shaw
05Meanwhile: dont think so
Any stream going?
i'm using gragas
Wrek: Bugger. Alas.
Shizuka, if you're not bound to where you live, you should move to Chattanooga. Best ISP in the country is here, besides the lack of IPv6.
11,01Because Verizon was also in the area offering DSL and FiOS.
Shizuka lemme Guess Eden Praire Internet?
05what!?
We need an album of all the Buffering images
/me has a buffer joke folder on Chrome just for this
13north metro
hi SayWhat. Not AtM
0575 bucks could give you more or less 1gbit here >.>
I had a guy playing Gragas earlier, walked into turrets twice within the space of five minutes.
13further into the cities we could at least have DSL as a fallback
Here's some words of the wise: Don't do Century Link
/me facepalms
05outrageous
Century Link lol
umm
It's really fun when you get someone with stun like Morgana
Ironically not a bad player, just horrible timing.
The only company possibly worse than Comcast
11,01Comcast was actually good to me at least in PA.
Gotta go again D: Be back later
lol yah
00,10Shizuka, how far in?
Unfortunate
11,01I guess that branch operates differently than the MN branch.
ok bye SayWhat
13a bit under an hour
13like
nvm
Don't do Telus either. Customer Service gets you connected to Mongolia probably
56 minute mark according to this buffer, Sumi
1355:00 or so
13or that
Sumica, 56:08
11,0156:08 in Sumica.
8,6issue I had with LoL when I tried it was how you could chain stun for far too long
11,01That's where the stream froze at.
/me nods
my goddamn 360 decided to dc itself for SOME reason at 97% dl
indeed
Hey Guys, I'm in Vancouver.

Only if your opponent is retarded, and only on some matchups
Rainbow Dash always buffers in style.
I've been waiting 3 hours for a 2 gb download
thank goodness for that timestamp
Stunlocking is a totally valid strat.
What should I do? ._.
hiya FlareChaser how are you?
FlareChaser /)
I pay like $25 for like 8mb dsl
hai FlareChaser , how is it?
hi
11,01Verizon actually offers a no-cap internet.
FlareChaser hey thats where MLP FiM is Made
hi FlareChaser!
You have to either get a really good team or a really stupid opponent
FlareChaser: eat some Canadian Bacon and wrestle a moose
11,01I just hated their customer service.
Garretbrony, I know ._.
OK.....i'll be waiting for the movie to start again
FlareChaser: bring me some bacon

05stop pinging him then
Okay no really
yay
8,6stop pinging him or I'll start kicking people
YAY
My problem that I always have with LoL is that as the game progresses I have a tendency to walk into roaming packs of three to five opponents.
yay
I know
omg
yay
I wanted to hear whoah
stop pinging him
What kind of team goes roaming.
*instant gangbeat*
yay, Mica
Ladies. Please. Tell me you wouldn't wear a slave-collar dress.

YES YOU CAN BUT YOU MUST'NT
ERMAHGERD WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK SMITE AND GO JUNGLE
twilight_sprinkle: what was that for?
Because I prefer laning.
otakon I know the Twilight x BigMac Fanfics are a staple of Romance Fiction
twilight_sprinkle: But collar dresses aren't. They look dumb, and can't possibly be easy to put on or remove.
REPORTEEEEEEED
*Senators not allowed to fuck people*
I play bots when I feel like having fun.
otakon youve gone too far :I
Aww boo hoo.........let me play a sad song for you in the world's smallest violin!"
WE WERE FARTHUR IN SUMICA

twilight_sprinkle: Remove the collar bit and it's a very pretty dress. With it on, I'm forced to ask how the fuck she puts it on.
05try now otakon
Our troops aren't born, Neo. They're grown
inb4 more buffering
could they have cloned a Je3di to make a Jedi Army?
Huehue.
11,01That black dress? Not really that great.
Meanwhile I don't get it . . .
i love clones my fav is one of the ones that didnt follow order 66
AttacktheAndalite why did Obiwan take laughing gas and LaxativeS?
CriticKitten it is however dangerous adding that thing that connects the collar to the dress
08,01Garretbrony?
twilight_sprinkle: "Oh Anakin, I love you but we can't be together, so I'm going to tease you with my S&M slave collar dress instead."
you would think Discor XD
Wrek|Observiking: not gonna fall for it.
AttacktheAndalite: for shits and Giggles
Garretbrony: I don't know....
05you sure?
05cause i know how much you loooove it
CriticKitten its funny because his mom dies a slave!
Lil_B: interesting thought. But i doubt that wont work make much difference
05ye sadist >:3
Meanwhile, I don't get
all dem pings
...?
AttacktheAndalite: for shits and Giggles
dari, you alive?
Garretbrony: Ohhhhhh
Wrek|Observiking, I think you have that mixed up?
Also, when teammates ask for leash when I'm already set up on mid.
twilight_sprinkle: Well he has a lot of mommy issues....I mean wut. :DS
Yep
BAD ACTING
Ohai
dari: ota hasn't been spamkicked all night.

AND THEY HAD SEX!

Dark92Enigma dont' hurt yourself
The screen keeps freezing on my end
THE ACTING! IT DID NOTHING!
you know they had sex, her hair is down.
otakon, congratulations on not getting spamkicked.
but the audio keeps going
Creeper
Hello everypony
I'm only level like...13.
watching movie not on friday?
hai Spriggals
jedi dont have nightmares?
hi Spriggals
discord refresh?
so boreing
Heh, you're actually above me I think
I just put in my lottery choice
Maybe
Discord: mines fine, must be your computer glitching
I mean, I can jungle, but I don't like to.
05SeaponiesofLiverpool; yeah where have oyu been?
I WANNA BE A JEDI SO I CAN DREAM WITH ´PONYVILLE =D
Jedi don't have nightmares. Nightmares are forbidden.
SO BOOORING
05its trilogy night
Kandarihu: thanks but I'm sure Wrek|Observiking has it set to some ridiculous count, like 2 in 10 or some such.
AGGHH :(
ddddddd
I'm only like level 15
It's bloody boring.
:p
SeaponiesofLiverpool trilogies have bee nplaying this summer
/me i knew i shouldn't left her in the first movie
Sumica can you skip these parts?
I tried jungling with Lee Sin when he was free.
Very specific dream.
I've been making a half dozen pony songs
otakon: lets count to find it out ^-^
yay
I don't have nightmares just very vivid dreams
It works, only I can't gank for crap because I don't have the runes to do it.
Do Jedi dream of electric Gungans?
05^_^
"I saw my mother, she's in pain."
Fou_Lou: have fun
also, hai SeaponiesofLiverpool
The only badass part in this episode is when the clones come in
YES YOU DO
Hope my A movie gets picked
electric gungans? :D
YOU HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE.
SirGanjalf only if they are replicant Jedis
>_>
Nocturne is great for jungling, which is what makes it doable, but goddamn it's just dull.
finally a fight scene
Jango!
Dune (2000)
i dont have nightmares just dreams that are not nice and scary
SirGanjalf, Star Wars fans dream of electrified Gungans
Discord never complian about the stream. You know the consequences
otakon: no you must count. youre the one wrek has a special rules for
you can inform the counsel like you were told to you fool
pew pew pew
Badass mode activated
Fou_Lou: not a chance inn hell
05oh look i didnt knwo were were watching SWTOR gameplay
Oh hey I almost forgot this was Star Wars and there are lightsabers and fights in it
Nocturne's better going around messing shit up in lane.
otakon: awww
FINALLY THE MISSILE IS USED!
would that be considered 1 movie or a trilogy?
otakon is so loved he gets his own special rule.
nice, back aimin skills
He, got a problem with that, Wrek?! :p
KICK
Wrek|Observiking: thats some cool gameplay
otakon what about in Heavan?
I mean, he is literally one of the scariest champs to come up against alone.
I was just SO entranced by the political discussions and shitty love story
and not a scratch on the Jedi
THE RAILINGS! THEY DO NOTHING!
Howdy.
Exacta
Wrek|Observiking: now changet it back, I don't want to get spam kicked.
SeaponiesofLiverpool well the trilogies haven't been user picked
hi RainRunner
NEEDS MORE RAILINGS
This platform lacks railings
The only one worse is Shaco. *looks behind* AH SHIT RUN FLASHFLASHFLASH
05otakon
CriticKitten do you like Battlefront 2
My favorite fight scene. so much tumbling
xD
howdy RainRunner
05i never changed it
would Dune (2000) be a trilogy or one movie?
He's a monster when you're by yourself.
CriticKitten: its to get the girls in. You know twilight and stuff
OH COME ON
lol :D s true Dark92Enigma
all the railings jokes!
Wrek|Observiking: you LIE! I do not believe you
Stupid Jedi
bountry hunter needs to learn to shoot straight
Stupid Jedi, Mind Tricks are for kids
This is why you should install adequate railings
CUT THE ROPE
They just grouped the seeing of the clones and the fight with Jango into one scene in the Lego game
THANK YOU
05try me
BULLSHIT
how did that happen?
I played TF2 for about 5 hours agian. DIDN'T I? -_-
guys does anypony know?
and he just jumped the shark
/me tries Wrek
Obi-Wan is being pwned by a single bounty hunter. Do note these bounty hunters form the basis of the clone army. Yet we're expected to believe that the clones are roughly equal to the shitty droids Obi-Wan mows through,]
twilight_sprinkle where did you think all the stromtroppers got their aim from?
The force
fine going back to normal
*.
Dark92Enigma: he had a magnetic rope thing
would Dune (2000) be a trilogy or one movie?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 it didn't
and HEY EVERYPONY! :p
Very little is quite as distressing as the ability to mark you with a trail that makes him faster and allows him to clip through units. Besides his fear and the ability to absorb your initial spell and gain more attack speed anyway.
the force keeps his joints from dislocating
Garretbrony: lol :D
SeaponiesofLiverpool is it a trilogy?
Why can't Boba's armor be that useful?
hi Ponies47
00,10wrek we have kick bot now you know?
ok, I finished my Surve for the lottery :)
So you can move objects at will withthe force but you cannot make yourself levitate?
its a SciFi miniseries
So judging from these things, I conclude that power levels in Bleach make more sense than this film.
Really, he's better laning for a bit and then skulking off to assassinate people.
deja Vu
CriticKitten: for each clone comes about 100 droids
dat useless light saber
full movie 6 hrs. long
twilight_sprinkle: You were talking to Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2
who, fyi, doesn't reply to PMs :p
worst ship ever
Lane bot a bit, sneak off to blitz the mid, repeat.
I chose it as A movie
8D
05ssssh
SeaponiesofLiverpool oh, I don't know then
His ultimate is very mentally unfair.
Either that or Jedi observe the law of ninjitsu.
Dark92Enigma: orite, sorry
What does it do again?
SeaponiesofLiverpool this movie is 6 hours long?!?!?!
CriticKitten: the cost is probably the same.
otakon: thank you sweet merciful sexy molestia. i finished dead money on very hard. hardcore
the LIGHTSABER! IT DID NOTHING
00,10Kickbot: make me a sandwich
Bronysith: yay
Autotuned robot
very inconspicous there annikin
well Lawrence of Arabia wasn't disqualified
Did I really just clsoe the bucking chat by mistake? -_-
this movie has cool sounds at least
00,10oh guess it's off
Sumica: what is Wrek|Observiking's kick setting?
no response?
Autotuned robot
otakon: i never want to see that place again
and its about as long
Shortens all enemy vision and removes their ability to see allied vision for the duration.
*close
nice meticulous landing sequence.
Bronysith: told you
twilight_sprinkle: Nah, don't worry, it happens :)
kickbot: say something
um
Mos Eisley! You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
uhh waht?
DOWN IN FRON
down in front!
DOWN IN FRONT!
...Oh shit.
CrimsonPhoenix: the unual droid seen in ep1 is probably cheap as hell
Phew
Kickbot is off? Aww . . .
there we go
That's hell in a big teamfight.
no, it's on, you have to preceed with the :
is that so Fou_Lou?
otakon: but i made 50k caps
That Mega Man pony version
11,01Down in front, ponies! :p
Back.
He looks like a deadbeat
Watto should have been voiced by Mel Brooks
CrimsonPhoenix: damn. wron ping
brb
Twilight used an invisiblility spell <----------
That's right Watto he is now a Cheddar Monk
he has a beard?
00,10oh right
Bronysith: pfffft, I make 50K caps easy
I demand a Luna!
That would have been funny.
no problem
CrimsonPhoenix: ping -.- soryy
he's grown a beard
00,10:kickbot make me a sandwich
Sumica: Not a valid command, silly
Looks nothing like the kid. Just sayin.
otakon: i know. but omg that explosions
Nittany_Discord umm, okay. *lies down*
Oh, yeah.
If you try to flee by yourself, you run the risk of getting picked off hard.
YER MOM
I love it when I get wrongping
yay! Kickbot!
Wow, he hasnt aged since 10 years.
05my name a borat
5 am my writing is getting bad -.-
don't worry
well, that's nedw
05i sold her
MY MAMA
He should have equipped a fly swatter
SOLD HER?
Wrek: It was VERY NICE
lars?
kickbot: say something
Save mama Luigi!
Owen Lars?
Married her.
I've been busy making pony music sorry uysg
During the time it's active Nocturne can hurl toward an enemy champion for a bit of damage.
MY CHILDHOOD....
Don't play with kickbot, his masters get angry
05mos isley
Except, you know, not there.
TELL ME!
The time skip gave Watto a doughboy helmet.
it's cool SeaponiesofLiverpool , nice to have you back
kickbot: do nothing
:kickbot kick yourself
suddenly geonosis
But it's unobstructed and maxed out the range is lunatic.
Hai Guys :D
:D
mostly oldies like Beach Boys, Ricky Nelson, etc.
hahahahah
hi PinkiePieYoshi64
lol
hai PinkiePieYoshi64
Notice - that entire species is extinct by the time Episode 4 rolls around.
so owen wasnthis uncle but his step grandad?
Too bad I missed the Obi Wan and Jango fight.
00,10that is not a parking orbit
Vader holds a grudge.
hoi PinkiePieYoshi64
Just came in from running errands, how much did I miss?
he is not being very stealthy
Ahoy! Twilight Sprinkle! :D
What kind of surprise?
11,01Those are rings.
BOMBS!
05love the bass bombs
Ooh I like suprises :)
I like surprises
Depth charges in space.
hang on, son. We're going down unda
cool sounds
O guess what episode I chose
Makes sense.
It's best off used as a killshot tbh.
for lottery
BASS BOMBS!
suprise*
BOMBS!
05Vinyl Scratch would be proud
ehh... missed half of the movie, but the secold half is better :D
Twang!
00,10so um......shockwaves in space. how do.
BASS CANNON!
Space explosions are two dimensional.
Wrek|Observiking you beat me to it
This charge has 1,000,000 Wubs
in space, no once can hear you shred guitar
Use the boost to get through!
looks like Vinly is drop the bass again XD
plama load?
its sound awesome though
11,01All of the noises in space.
Those do sound nice.
plasma**
11,01Noises in space.
The Wub heard around the universe
Sumica Star Wars physics
IT'S OVER 9000 WUBS!
dubstep is so shitty it destroys asteroids due to his lousy and nonsense sounds
hey guys, I bet you'll never guess what episode I picked.
:D
Sumica I don't get it either
In space no one can hear explosions.
Sumica: No, seismic charges that create sound shockwaves.
Sumica: its prolly not a shockwave of space itself, maybe of some material in the bomb
Spaaaccceee
BROHOOF IF YOU HAD FUN WITH THIS SEISMIC CHARGES ON STAR DESTROYERS ON STAR WARS: REBEL STRIKE :P
08,01woah, it's 4am

you europeans and your late timezone
pm.
MORE BASS CANNONS
But still, when it goes dark it's pretty much a guarantee that Nocturne is coming. And you have no idea who for until the lights come back on or "An ally has been slain"
Well he's flying what amounts to a pre-Rebellion A-Wing so yeah he's kinda fucked
334:99 pm here
It starts with an elderly Pinkie dying, so that's not helping...
I picked Cherry bomb for pony episode

ahh theres the musi
any comment?
music*
Suddenly music.
Fear
FINISH HIM
Bass missile
/me hugs Dken2021 Lunar_Brony and Fou_Lou
Nocturne's the fear champ, so it's appropriate.
Smart missile.
dats one smart rocket
Dat smart missile :O
Indeed.
Discord :D rofl
/me hugs Lil_B back
....I'm gonna get Megapony
/me was hugged
Now this should be epic.

08,01i'm not drunk
Fou_Lou me too, but I want to stand up earlier >.<
Alpha-Omega-Prime: me too but have to watch the lets ply first
08,01i don't drink
08,01well
You write too much.
Boom!
The only champ I truly fear more is Shaco.
00,10you would think he would have flares to do that
this is a clustered ring
08,01i do, but not much, and not often
Nice escape plan :D
funny, in SW3 rockets couldnt do that. althto maybe droids had cheaper ones
USE THE BRAKES!
I don't write too much.
Lol.
guys?
SCREEEEEEEEE
SeaponiesofLiverpool: ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb!
Flares are op
Wtf?
Sumica: That would make sense though.
Dat landing :O
I write not often enough, and I come up with too many ideas.
non-alcoholic?
cherry bomb?
Sumica: how did jango hit ever single molecule BUT obi wan?
Lil_B: cant stantup much earlier anyway even i i go at like 4am or 3 am
Death stars!
And then they all stall.
08,01Lunar_Brony: no, i absorb moisture from the air
05also
yes... is that okay to pick?
TF Core ships are best ships...
Ikr.
oh that cherry bomb
Rocket easily outmanouvers asteroids , but not luggage
05anyone going to buck that owns a zippo lighter that they can spare? >.>
Ugh, even one-shots.
Sumica: he was firing like 3000 million rounds a second and blasted everything except him
Now go!
SeaponiesofLiverpool aure why not?
GUYS.
GUYSSSSSSSSS
come on man not all sterio types are true
hey RAWRity
It's a trap!
RAWRity: wut
:S
It took me three months to finally finish editing my fanfic entry for Bronystate.
Wrek|Observiking: i have a zippo...but cant go to buck :'(
00,10well he is the template for storm troopers
Wrek? zippo that someone can spare??
ohai RAWRity
Mission Acomplished.
TrixieMuffins: heaseeker. Luggage is hotter than asterois. MUCH hotter
Hi RAWRity
hew RAwRity
....as opposed to a usual amount of Federation ships?
did you want a zippo?
Space balls
lali-ho RAWRity
I could have gotten it done in a week. Nope, have to delay for three months because I don't even feel like it.
hello RAWRity
lol
Friendship is Witchcraft episodes for BMN pony episodes... yay!
hi RAWRity!!
Hey RAWRity.
hope to hear some gypsy bard
On the plus side it worked out, but damn I wish I could've gotten it done earlier.
well, space is infinite, matter is finite, so a usual amount of anything in the universe is zero per unit of volume.
05yeah thinking of getting one with a custom engraving
I'm watching the olympics atm. The Women's Gymnastic team is doing their Floor exercises. One of them just did her routine to Catgroove.
Man, I just realized that the Jedi Star Fighter you find buried in the sand on Star Wars: Rebel Strike is actually Obi Wans :O
Uncle Owen
Tiny house.
RAWRity: Like a bossette.
C3po
Hello C3PO!
hen3ry: imo space isnt infinite tho
hen3ry: oooooooh............ wut?
RAWRity lol
The US Woman's Gymanstics Team wins GOLD!!!!!!
00,10bet they have pony ones wrek
I'm pretty much the only pony that doesn't like friendship is witchcraft
Master ANi.
MAKAh
Your plating looks like shit, 3PO
OHAI C3PO!!!!!!!!
Alpha-Omega-Prime: You aren't.
Not even kidding, it's seriously Catgroove.
His voice sounds.... familiar...
if u can get the engraving donw there, i'll buy you a zippo and send it.. or you can let me know what you want engraved
He reconized Padme.
This is the droid that were looking for
Sumica I've seen one around the internet
RAWRity, I hope I can find it somewhere on the internet.
lolympics
....wait.
C3PO Bender edition
Kandarihu: I'm sure you can.
WAIT
Thank goodness someone else who doesn't
oh boy, it's uncle owen
I actually saw the guy who voiced C3PO at the stars wars orchestra.
CriticKitten: what?
cachi01: Hitchhiker's Guide reference.
uncle owen FTW
Much to Talk about.
oh i see.
3PO showed no indication of knowing who the fuck Owen and Beru were in Episode 4.
08,01i have a massive craving for pizza right now
has a newsletter been sent out?
Rawrity, US team wins gold... twitchy twitchy
But he lived on their farm for YEARS?
hen3ry: oh its been a long time since i saw that movie in netflix lol
make one
They wiped his memory out, remember?
CriticKitten: his mind was wiped
CriticKitten eeeeyup
CriticKitten continuity error?
Dammit, now i want a pizza too
CriticKitten: In ep 3 at the end, they make a quick line of saying they're gonna wipe his memory
CriticKitten: his hard drive was reformatted. He had Windows Vista installed at one point
Dken2021: his mind was wiped
Fact: Tusken Raiders is the name of the sandpeople after they raided Fort Tusken
still hard to believe that Vader made him
cachi01: dunno if it's in the movie, it's from the book tho.
SirGanjalf our minds think alike
CriticKitten: funfact though: No mention of wiping R2's memory!
hen3ry: oh i havent read the book lol
Inb4 corn on the cob
they didmt wipe it.
R2 kept his memories.
No....
b/c R2D2 is not a loudmouthed idiot
your mother is dead
hello plot hole
I feel it....
/me My son.....remember when i told you i would be a little dead the next time you would see me? THIS IS HAPPENING NOW........:'(
your father is dead
I think they quickly mentioned about wiping the droids memories in episode 3.
your family is dead
....so...much ...bucks not given
your dog is dead
His parents are deeeeeeaaaaaad.
you are dead
RAWRity: they didnt. apparently astrodroids memory about such things is negligible
GAME OVER
Your goldfish is dead.
your cat is dead
00,10how is it in this dan and age a pizza guy cant find a place
Wombo combo
more angst is a-coming
OHH GOD!!
NOOO FISHY
Anakin is a little to wussy for me personally to relate to. Anyone else?
"I watched as your mother died" ~R2 in Episode 4.
Anakin i love you...
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
RAWRity: But that doesn't explain it away because he clearly has memories of events that happened pre-wipe. ._.
Darf14 *insert plot-joke-associated wisecrack*
oh gosh...
Sumica, I dunno.
WHY THE KISSING!?
CriticKitten: such as?
CriticKitten: like what?
neighsayers Rina-Chan
On the other hand I'm investing too much thought into this movie.
Because we needed more love scenes.

Seems legit.
Sumica what is playing next?
Man, Geonosis always gaves me the creeps...
....
yay
yay xD
cool architecture
00,10not a clue

Suddenly aliens showup.
RAWRity: I seem to recall him mentioning memories of individuals as far back as the Clone Wars in Ep 4, though perhaps I'm mixing him and R2.
Damn Scientologists building their temples everywhere...

Uh.
Sumica, oh ok
Obi-Wan?
It's the man with the golden gun.
Dooku was a Jedi remember?
Dooko confirmed for worst villian
He knows you're there.
Meanwhile Wicker man
I saw that amazing green guy
god i hate that Viceroy guy
dooku coonfirmed for stupid douche
CriticKitten: force masking

I thought the villain from Pound Puppies was worst villian.
Count Dooku? Count D. Count Dracula.
useless army, if the leader is any indication
Dang these ads
Meanwhile at the legion of doom
Jinzo #7 to be exact
What is the green guys name?
Count Doouchie.
Dken2021: I hate being here. :I
twilight_sprinkle: Only works if the individual in question is more powerful, remember? Dooku is significantly stronger than Obi-Wan.

Alpha-Omega-Prime: just because its all snowy doesnt mean its lost planet

Nobody hears it.
Aw.

Sumica: Cool, I'll check it out- "Ad Block+" right?
Lunar_Brony what is his name?
11,01ponibas: You should try it!
They Crucified her! :O
"I can fly, I just don't feel like doing it" R2D2 in Episode 6.
Eeyup anakin thats your mom
ded
RustyMeat. Indeed.
She's not gonna make it.
twilight_sprinkle: Er no? Being stronger means you'd find it much easier to detect someone trying to hide themselves from you.

Discord I dunno
Darf14: They tied her to some sticks. Not quite the same.
is any movie after this Nittany_Discord oh Maid of Knoledge
annie?
alright, thanks guys
you're not safe yet...
YES ITS FUCKING ANNIE
I couldnt reconize you with that ponytail.
I was an EMT for 4 years.. done that and a whole lot more
meh oh well
11,01Garretbrony: No.
RUN
Yes!!
RUN FOR IT!
GET OUT BEFORE IT'S TO LATE!
RUN FOR YOUR FUCKING LIFES
/me My son, remember when i said i would be a little dead the next time you would see me?????? IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW..........:'(
CriticKitten: not if your own strength is interfering, plus its harder notice weak(small) enemies
I missed you.
GET OUT OIF THERE
STOP FUCKING TALKING
RUUUUUUUUUUUN
IDIOTS
RUUUUUUUUN YOU FOOLS
DAMMIT, ANAKIN. RUN!
RUN!
Run! Fucking Run!
Fou_Lou: I know, I'm pointing out that there's no way Dooku can't know he's there when he's way stronger than Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan couldn't hide his presence from someone at that level.
quick, give her some food
That has nothing to do with it. They are on a Planet were the Necromorphs originated and you fight in a 3rd person way as well as Giant Necromorphs nearly lost planet size
FUN, FUCKING RUN!
RUN!
RUN
Annie? School years must've been tough for him
Too late she's gonna die.

If only you'd gotten there last week.
HE'S NOT EVEN CRYING
I feel like taking it out on someone.
cachi01 too late
initiate genocide
Or two weeks ago.
One step closer to the dark side
CriticKitten: why should dooku care if hes there?
AttacktheAndalite too much angst
Dun Dun Duh!
uh oh
....
I... MUST... ACT!
twilight_sprinkle: That's not how it's established to work in canon. Stronger individuals can detect weaker ones in Star Wars canon (as well as every other canon where such power level stuff appears).
TIME TO KILL SOME DOUCHES
Or like...idk, yesterday.
RAGE!
Do i should feel an emotion?
11,01Sumi
HUUURRRRRRRR
Inbound Anger + Rage + Cupcakes
Aniken Confirmed for Psycho
and then he's like "Bitches gonna die!!"
Dken2021: One does not simply have enough angst
murder is an emotion.
ood morning everyone.....oO (5 am here)
CriticKitten: i dont remember that being established
DECAPITATION!
Yay, Genocide!
Damn, a bit off, Nitt.
I........MUST EXPRESS RAGE
hi red_ony
11,01I know CriticKitten :<
Buck this I'm going back to watching the Olympics
Yup. Anakin is going darkside.
dAT seat.
Sumica I love you and Your Las Pagasis Ways
evening red_ony
Fou_Lou: why should Dooku care if one of the Jedi Order has infiltrated his secret base and is going to reveal his secret plans?
You don't say
seeya Alpha-Omega-Prime
Bye Alpha-Omega-Prime
inb4 buffer
yay
Bye.
You know. It goes fear, anger, passionfruit, jelly...
buffer
Yoda could totally be tapping into ANY world
come on buffer!
Peace
those jedis are daft
He must sense the election of Bush
beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessss
He's showing emotions. He's EVIL!
Well I am going to the Bed Sleepytime Ponies47
Fou_Lou: Because....yeah, what RAWRity said. He kinda doesn't want the Jedi there yet. >_>
fear... anger... buffer...
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE NAME OF THE GREEN GUY WITH COUNT DUKU WHO HAD THE RADIO VOICE THING?
Anakin was all like: ''MY MOM........ded...........my mom........ded.........now i get it, THIS REALLY SUCKS! I'M GONNA KILL SOMEPONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!''
No.
RAWRity: revealing the plans would probably end in a war. their goal.
Lunar_Brony,
Discord no idea
Kandarihu what?
Discord: google is an amazing thing
Freakin' heck. I meant to clear that, not send it.
I feel like this is a trap.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Why didnt it ever occur to Obi wan or Anakin to ever call upon the Sea Ponies Kandarihu
Kandarihu oh
IT'S A TRAP
It's a trap!
plb plb plb plb plb pbl
Fou_Lou: There's a difference between starting a war with your enemy unaware of your army and power, and starting it with them forewarned and with time to prepare.
A TRAP IT IS
He has been emotionally comprimised.
Garretbrony, wrong series. Sea Ponies are not canon in Star Wars
Ani is mad.
hey guys, i brought us a corpse!
Anakin was busy murdering masses of Tuskan.
Kandarihu: So far as we know. D:
Well I am going now by Kandarihu
"I brought you a package!"
twilight_sprinkle: goodie! i got a fire started
11,01Your wife's back!
seeya Garretbrony
twilight_sprinkle: lol YOU BEAT me to it
Is anakin crying? I mean his mother died, at least show some emotion.
Kandarihu: Sea ponies might have made this story better.
I just killed hundreds of sand people. Padme, I am so hot for you right nao... oh wait, they cut that from the script
CriticKitten: I dunno, they might show up in that Animated Series for all we know.
bye Garretbrony
Super Bad Acting coming
RAWRity: but the war is only a tool to get the senator to its power. Dooku and the senator are on the same side.
Bye Garretbrony
twilight_sprinkle: corpses taste good
NO
yo i brought your wife she just have a problem SHE IS DED
seeya Garretbrony
ANGRY
Never mentions his mother again.
Im good at fixing things
Seya Garret
SAD
SirGanjalf: i wouldnt say bad acting. he did fine with the shit lines given to him
Drink your blue milk Annie.
Glowing Hexagons... what do they mean? o_0
SAD
You couldn't what? Act?
Bronysith: how do you know that Oo
Because you never visited.
Gungans kinda look like horses, so I disagree with the seapony hypothesis.
cachi01 :D
good at fixing things. Never COULD get that respirator to work right.
Because life is a bitch
twilight_sprinkle: cannibalism perk in fallout
Because you were too late.
You were too late, Anikan...
"Why can't I violate the laws of nature?"
Bronysith: lol k
BECAUSE YOU WERE A TERRIBLE SON
11,01Why did I have to kill an entire race?!
uh oh
Nope.
I find this is a very chewed scene.
BELEAVE IT
Also because you cannot violate laws of life.
well, i should be
arrogance setting in
Nope. :D
YOU NEVER CAME FOR HER!!!! You should have came a MONTH Sooner!
ANAKIN WILL BE HOKAGE BELEAVE IT
idd he say that sand line at one point?
BELIEVE IT!!!-----Naruto
HOW IS IT OBI-WAN'S FAULT?
ohhh, character development!
omg i hate this actor
"Ugh... I'm SO angry right now i could scream"
*did
Stop blaming Obi Wan for this.
such shit acting should be punished by incenaration
weak throw
You are made of stupid.
Pain... anger... aggression...
so much angst!
GENOCIDE!
actually you missed a few, Annie.
if i were pedeme i would run
Whats that sandvich?
OH!, NOW IT'S HIS FAULT????? BLOW ME!
bad acting
How did Obi Wan be jealous of Anakins wife? They never even ment.
he's walken-ing
AND THE CHILDREN?
It's Obi-Wan's fault I murdered an entire group of intelligent creatures!
CriticKitten: And of course, this is the point where he started becoming Vader. That's right. One of fiction's most awesome villains turns evil because he can't do something that is physically impossible.
IM ACTING!
Even the younglings.
Wait he killed the women?!
someone needs to smack that kid upside his vanilla ice's haircut
My Sand People are DEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
AND THE ACTING
best script ever
:((((((
noooooooooooooo
those are some really nice teeth
hate... leads to the dark side
Everyone DEAAAADDDDDDD!
AND THE SAND PEOPLE
Careful Anakin your emotions are showing. For once.
ALL the acting!
:'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :D I mean... :O
Padme is so turned on by genocide.
Lunar_Brony: ALL the acting?
Meanwhile: "emotions"
RAWRity: That's not as big of a betrayal as the one coming up.
I'm AcTINg!
"to be angry is to be human"...
padme should run
Meanwhile: But emotion is forbidden.
Padme you should run away.
RAWRity: Plank from Ed Edd and Eddy had more character.
^
So be bland as possible.
^^
Gosh pame, ever think of telling anyone about this massacre?
Plank was a great character.
these are some nice stones
Hm
CriticKitten: oh I know, but still.
This Plank is best character.
PLANK IS BEST PONY
plank FTW
RAWRity: still anni could have decided to spare the innocent sandraider thingys
dat hoverwheelchair.
Goodbye to you too, random husband we'll never see again.
Meanwhile: one does not simply show emotion
plank is best plank
Stump from Angry Beavers > Plank
:O I wanr a hover chair!! :O
Meanwhile: unlike aniken Plank had actual character development
We never see this Gravestone ever again.
Anger is a natural part of the human condition. But it's important to cope with anger responsibly.
AttacktheAndalite: I can act better than he can.
Are we still making fun of the second prequel movie?
00,10you suck manikin skywalker
ded
red_ony but then you'll end up like the people in Wall-E
I mean it does not show up in the old movies.
I wasn't strong enough to violate the laws of nature.
That was bad sumi
hello everyone :3
DAFUQ ANAKIN YOU JUST STAYED THERE TO TALK TO HER
Meanwhile, I didn't know you were an actor :3
You will fail again. Because you are made of fail.
how should i save your mom?
Reikim we will never stop
Lunar_Brony: Fine by me :P
AttacktheAndalite: I'm not, that's my point. :P
wa?s that bender in the background
I wasn't strong enough ..............to ACT
^
hai Thrackerzod
Oh hey, Swimming's up now. Let's see if Phelps and Lochte can stop fucking it up long enough to get a damn medal.
He's trying SO hard to act.
00,10if only his mom had the highground
I miss you mother. Well off to be Darth Vader.

r2 heard there was a party
XylemTube, you don't notice character development here? If Anakin doesn't have character development, then this movie doesn't have action either.
wait
I wasn't strong enough to move my face in a way that looks like I care about what I'm doing.
wait
Meanwhile: :P It'd still be awesome to hear you act :3
call-forward.
Annie!!! :D :D :D :D
ANNIE ANNIE!

Darth Vader is more honorable than fucking anakin
MESA ALL SPARKLY GLOWY

Where was Gondor when Anakin didn't show any emotions
SirGanjalf: xD
Daat plank.

DROIDEKAS!
Doridekas
Well it looks like he's fine
Overpowered Shield Droids
IT'S A TRAP
Droidekas@ He's doomed.
I can't wait for tomorrow: "From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!"
They also have the peace moon plans.
wow, adblock actually works xD
You now what sucks?
....YA THINK?

Geonosis. Obiwan is fighting Magneto?
What did you guys see before this?
The "Close" button popped up randomly even though there was no ad xDD Thanks Sumica
Follow your orders.
lol
It's only one parsec away!
Getting popcorn kernals stuck in your teeth.
No, Listen to Mace Windu.
Let's keep ignoring what a parsec is!
00,10less then a parcet away? we can make that in 12 miles
Stupid Padme.
So if Anikin hadn't decided to go hunting Sand people, Obi-wan would have died! :D
Only take about 3 years
Oh hoooo pretty sneaky sis
It's just like the Kessel Run.
So SHE WAS INVOLVED IN ANIKANS DECEIT!!!
dont worry c3po... you'll hate it
Shizuka can you show this movie again but without the filler, IE the credits
RosePetal smart, yet stupid
U mad Mace Windu?
so far hes the cartoon Link and shes the cartoon Zelda
Who is that...
Screw Mace Windu, i have politics!!!!
Jar Jar.
Oh! It's that guy from that one series of Dexter!

Foreshadowing.
00,10if only we had some one dumb to sugest this moronic plan to the councle
man, jarjar's been silet throughout this movie
You know, I generally don't mind most of the CGI in this movie. But that ship is so constantly out of sync with Tatooine, it's outright garish.
How can they NOT sense the Dark Side within Palpatine? :O
PALPATINE'S BEHIND IT ALL
Who's the biggest idiot in the Senate? Oh, hai Jarjar
It's coming up....*twitch*
Count Dookus here.
WHO HAS NOT WATCHED EPISOODES 1-3 BEFORE?
PinkiePieYoshi64: He's a master. The yoda of the sith.
itsamistakeaterriblemistaketheyvegonetoofarthisismadness
I had to. My brother made me.
Discord: i think everyone >_>
13Thrackerzod: wish i could, comcast is derping hard though :<
Oh hey look, the only guy trying in this film!
Meanwhile: Seems Legit :O
*cough*bullshit*cough
rotisserie Jedi. Yummy
*
Discord, this is my first time watching the prequels.
PinkiePieYoshi64: hes hiding his dark side. and since hes pretty strong he can do it good
Why don't you just kill him?
Shizuka couldnt be worse than verizon
twilight_sprinkle: no... THID IS SPARTA
You cannot hope to contend with the will of Saruman, Obi-Wan.
05dooku is the good guy here
cratorkid: dont kick me D:
Wrek|Observiking he is?
COUNCELER PALPITINE IS THE EMPOROR
Thrackerzod, Comcast has a monopoly where Shizuka lives.
05yes
We know.
CriticKitten: x3
Some people don't.
05see?
:3
Wait
THE TRUTH..........SHALL SET YOU FREE
Shizuka: I think at this point we need to just assume "Derped" is Comcast's natural state.
SPOILER ALERT
Wow... DOOKU IS INNOCENT!?!?
Too late?
00,10shame shame, no spoilers
The peace moon is really a weapon.
Wrek|Observiking: he was probably lying to use Obiwan to either get power for himself or turn him to the dark side
no spoil please
DOOKU............INNOCENT?
dat government corruption
Good Sith Dooku
DARTH CITIOUS
WOW DOOKU WATCH THE SPOILERS
05but what dooku doesnt know
JOIN HIM
05is that [SPOILER]
Dookoo
at least hes telling the truth
/me "ok" pushes twilight_sprinkle
/me Pokes Biglaw
im back
So he's a bad guy who's not bad but is still bad but may be a little bad in between?
Is it dookoo or dooku?
IF YOU JOIN HIM THEN ANAKIN WON'T BECOME EEEEEEEVIL
dooku
DO YOU NEED A TERMINOUS-BOT?
im sorry but i love dookus actor in this movie
Technically he does know, Wrek
Oh god
00,10it's a clear
/me twitches
Jar Jar NOOO!\
Oh no...
cratorkid: curse youuuuuuuuuu.....
RosePetal: He's complicated
and jar jar's debating....
he did it, he destoryed the republic
11,01Go Jar Jar!
My brain is melting!
uh oh
Dam it Jar Jar, dont make the situation worse for them >_<
....
he's less annoying when debating
jar jar just fucked up the galaxy
YAY JAR-JAR SHUT UP
You idiot! YOU DOOMED US ALLL!
Ass faces
Oh, democracy... What hat thou become
BOOO
squid face
Jar Jar started this war I swear.
B....b.....BEEEEEEETRAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL.
Yes, Of course. I trust him
SORRY, I JUST CAME FROM #CAPSLOCK
Ryunosuke, agreed.
JAR JAR YOU FUCKING DUMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They all agreed to Jar Jar.... DA BUCK?
Because of Jar Jar!
lol
00,10and jar jar began a war that lasted 20 years
What Dooku doesn't know is that eventually there will be a 3D animated series that will make him look like the shittiest Sith since Asaji Vedris
Dam you Jar Jar! You Caused the Deathstar! :O
^
THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS FUCKED OVER BECAUSE OF FUCKING JAR JAR?!?
Jar Jar is like a Selarian
Dammit Jar Jar!
isnt dooku sidious apprentice in the clonewars?
Yes!
Jar-Jar you idiot
the republic is sexy
eeeeyup
OHHHAHAHAAH
no need for a vote.
BE-TRYAL.
DO YOU NEED A FUcKING TERMINOUS-BOT OR NOT?!
Jar-Jar started the war? I don't remember this?
Now we are DOOMED!
BETRAYED ME. :|
And that's why Jar Jar is the worst SW character
RainBowJack: absolutely worthless
JAR JAR YOU DOUCHE
05Fou_Lou: but dooku doesnt know that they are [spoiler]
11,01And Jar Jar single-handedly began the downfall of the republic.
That's why nobody likes Jar Jar.
well..... better start joining the rebel force
lololol:D
Nittany_Discord: who saw that coming?
Hey, it's the yellow floating robot from Flubber.
cratorkid : you agree with me?
jar jar sucks
God dammit, Jar-Jar. Even when the writers make you competent, you fuck up.
wow
STUPID JAR JAR
Say hi to Lama Su
Wrek|Observiking: what?
"The ability to speak does not make you intelligent"
00,10why the rant Tao?
RainBowJack: absolutly
Dat cruiser...
Jar Jar Binks destroyed the Republic. My loathing cannot seethe out fast enough.
Sumica: Not sure if Ran Tao...
Jar Jar is new face of the Selarians
Do you all know that in the lastest star war books that Darth Vader KILLS Jar Jar XD
JAR JAR IS FUCKING GEORGE BUSH
That makes me so mad.
I think that was written in to satisfy the Jar Jar haters, ironically...
From all of the toy ads and what little I saw of the animated series, I thought the Seperatists were villains in some way.
And he killed the Jedis.
:O
C3PO and R2D2 are the new GETH
Well not really but kinda is responsible for order 66.
Kandarihu: They are, kind of. They're mostly being manipulated by [spoiler], though.
There, caps lock off
I guess
StormFox: And that's another reason why Vader >>> Anakin
Kandarihu: Everyone's a villain in this movie.
Sumica you should stream more, your streams are teh best :D
Vader kills Jar Jar? THHHHHAANKKKK YOOUUUUUUUUU ANIIIIEEEE!!
C3po is the best actor in the movie
Kandarihu: Which is part of the reason it's somewhat stupid.
from what i heard yeah
Ah, okay.
I'm Anakin Skywalker, and this is my favorite base on Geonosis.
C3PO. Programmed to understand humans.
R2 does not care.
CriticKitten: Jar-Jar isn't a villain! I'm using the insanity plea here.
EEDIOT
Jar jar was leading a revolt just before the New Hope movie. Darth comes in to deal with it :3
R2 doesnt give a buck
Jar Jar was a patshy
patsy.. grr.
Commander Shepard would've fixed this by now. But we would've hated the ending.
wall people
DARTH VADER..........KILLS JAR JAR? THANK YOU, VADER, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't sense moving walls
I got a bad feeling about this.
Reikim: Jar Jar destroyed the Republic. HE'S A BAD GUY AND HE SHOULD FEEL BAD.
the lego parody with han solo as a kid is better than the actual movie
00,10hen3ry, programed by a 12yr old
he cudnt here them bfor
Hey
programmed to understand humans, but don't understand droid behavior
They sound like pigs.

bon-apetir: http://buffetoblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/costume-chef-vader-serving-jar-jar-binks.jpg
CriticKitten: But he's too stupid to know what he's doing, so he's basically just a well-meaning idiot.
Kero Kero Kero
Time for some Shennagians.
*apetit
Best part in lego star wars.
get off the belt you dumb broad
i love there gun
Chef Darth Vader.
Booger blaster
HEY!
Fun fact: There's a Robot Chicken sketch in which Darth Vader kills Jar Jar Binks. It's probably my favorite sketch of theirs.
I alway die at this part
CriticKitten: So, instead of being a bad guy, HE'S A STUPID IDIOT AND HE SHOULD BE STUPID.
Jump off the convey line.
Do you?
I just had a sudden memory when I used to play Lego Star Wars... Geonosis was a BIIIT---.... Why did my most trusted friend scratch my game? :|
Now comes a huge skill challenge
Oh i remember that skecth.
*FEEL
It was funny.
CriticKitten: Mesa all sparkly glowy

IMO 1 is shit. 2 is stinkier shit, and 3 is still shit, but because it's not as smelly the last 2, it doesn't look as diseased and awful.

CriticKitten: that's like finding a sinkhole inside the grand canyon
Quick_Thinker: Watching Hulk Hogan, Mr T and Bruce Campbell filling their taxes is more entertaining than this
Spider Crab.
Welp
Needs more CGI
Okay random question, why exactly are they executing their enemies like this?
and also a jabba the hut toy :D

CriticKitten that wouldn't be interesting
And yet, no one is noticing Padme...
Literally.

Anakin got... feelings?
i see watchu did there obione
Thrackerzod, lets work together to rule the entire universe
The fun begins!

80% of their budget must have went to designing all these creatures
YEEE HAWWWWW xD
RAWRity: I figured Man with the Golden Gun, myself. Same villain.
And ANAKIN quoted Obi-Wan-...................HARDYHARHAR
CriticKitten: because that separatist guy hates them and wants them to die violently
yeah those are really good chains
Anakin: master i have this feeling of .......
Quick_Thinker 'cause Star Wars

No, because then it would not be exciting.
Meanwhile: Play her off, Keyboard Cat!

Smart
he didnt give a fuck
Go Obi wan!
Why don't you just pick it up and fling it with the force?
Hey imagine that, when you give your captives opportunities to escape, THEY FUCKING ESCAPE. If any of you are aspiring villains, dear bronies, learn the lesson of this film and just SHOOT your enemies.
He's got a bad feeling about this too
And there was much rejoicing..................Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
wha, no kiss for obiwan?

If someone dose me a Trackerzod fanart ill love them forever

Droidekas.

Shoot you stupids.
CriticKitten: dont forget to double tap
hm suddenly a jedi
And then Samuel L Jackson
Funfact: I can recite all the Harry Potter chapter titles, from beginning to end, by memory. That has nothing to do with this, but it's still more entertaining to read this post than to be watching this fight scene.
Why doesn't Viceroy Gunray have a ray gun?
Mace Windu. AH YEAH!
Master Windu is not in the mood for you.
:D
Im tired of these Mother ****** robots in this Mother ****** stadium!

Its so funny watching all the jedi's appear out of nowhere

BRAVE, but foolish
CRUSH! KILL! DESTROY! SWAG!
Tao yes you will be usefull
Who is the Sith Lord
00,10say imposably outnumbered again mother fucker
You know, this invasion of Jedi warriors would have worked....if Mace hadn't selected a bunch of Jedi who were all two days away from retirement
Because he was scripted to die in that one
THE JEDI ARE EQUALISTS! :D
/me I'M TIRED OF THESE MOTHERFUCKING PARTY, IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING COLLISEUM!
StormFox: he was, he defeated the emperor

Can we get more shit on the screen guys?!?!? :O

his lightsaber was purple, then it was bluie
The force is strong with this mothafucka
Bronysith: i think this is the best scene of the movie :(
And suddenly Jedi's came down?
I'm mad this is the only time we see Mace Windu fighting in the movie.

At least LOTR had like 8 characters I actually cared about during their battle scenes.

That's gotta hurt.
Jango got trampled
Jango Fett.
He regret his decision to jump in there
Bronysith, have you seen some plinkett?

You have a jetpack and your opponent has a laser sword. Why not just fly around like a loony?
Looks like Jango found out how to get "a-head"
Poor Boba Fett.
Oh god
I know your jetpack is broken, Jango, but that's no reason to....lose your head.
DIE JEDI DIE

05and I mean it
Wrek|Observiking: can you do taht anyway?
NO! WE'RE FINE HERE!!!!!!!
The jedi should consider getting guns
speaking of bobba fett, the good news is that he lives after that pit in Return of the Jedi :3
MACE WINDUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This battle Foreshadows how terrible Jedi are fighting soldiers
Now only those jedi alive.
That's how many Jedi are left?
Wrek|Observiking: yay the wookie cristmas special thingy
/me pulls Thrackerzod through
Wrek|Observiking: finally, thank you.
you're bluffing, nobody has that footage
Jedi are not soldiers, they are peace keepers
Boba Fett lived HE LIVED!
until they get erased from the Jedi archives
Wrek: Do it.
A stalemate! We'll see who blinks first.
Wrek|Observiking: PLEASE do that. PLEASE.
My gosh, the Jedi's are HORRIBLE!!!!
dat voice
If the jedi all threw their sabres outwards from that circle they'd probably get most of them...
They doomed!
You. Will. DIE.
HOORAY!

Yoda came to save the day
Like a boss.

wow that weapon is overpowered
good evening XAX

Allo XAX
English, I do not need to speak properly. My dialogue, ham-fisted it is
send in the clones
hi XAX
Evening, XAX
Nittany_Discord: Talk properly he cannot.
Quick_Thinker: in pure front strength, yes
SEND IN THE CLONES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nittany_Discord: what to do you shall not tell me!

Get to DA CHOPPA!
Speak like Yoda we will.
11,01Chopper you must get to.
Nittany_Discord: give him credit. he's a green alien from a distant galaxy...and can speak english

Gunships are best choppas
okay to be honest that shiip does look cool
Good ol' star wars episode 2 >_

Boba :'(

Alas poor Jango I knew him well.
Yoda-fy puns we will.
poor Boba :(
00,10still say we should have seen his head drop out of the helmet
sorry boba dont feel bad you can just clone one
13and gibberish will i spout
Jedi are no match for droidekas but clones are?
its too bad is head didnt fall out, that wouldve been funny
Jango Fett: Pointless fan service, he was.
05we did sumica
Beating the bush are we.
05for a split second as it was cut off
Shizuka: do that you shall
00,10no when the kid lifted it
Much like Boba Fett
13annoying it very is, off it pisses me
^
We gotta destroy it.

Suddenly an Invasion
Sumica that would prove slightly humourus
/me 11,01Shizuka hugs
confusing way Shizuka talks in
Shizu: lol
how did these ships make it through without anyone noticing
HOW
Quick_Thinker: Bad Writers
Quick_Thinker 'cause Star Wars
Illogical Dokus plan is to me.
00,10oh the lack of humanity
jar jar of bitch a son he is
Geonosia has a terrible space defense
You know, Yoda's speech made sense in Empire, because it was clear the dude was senile and borderline insane. Here, it's just silly.
the death star in the background
>there are too many
/me Nittany_Discord dusts
Oh the huge manatee.
>this war lasts for YEARS
OH
MY
GOD
why is Windu yelling?
Windu can yell if he wants to.
Because of the wind resistance
Point in a random direction.
RAWRity: He's probably been senile and borderline insane for centuries. Nearly nine hundred, he is.
because hes samuel L
Tovler: cause hes had it with these mother**** driods
he yells
05the clone army and stormtroopers are teh same
Republic commando was best
I WANT TO POST A VIDEO
HARD
has yoda nailed his feet to that transporter?
11,01Tovler: He's Samuel L. Jackson!
Wrek|Observiking: thats when i lost faith in star wars
RAWRity: and it's also excessive. He only used it occasionally in his dialogue in Empire and Return. In every fucking sentence, in here it is
QUICKLY!
dat zoom
these clones have better aim then the stormtroopers man what happened to them
Mace Windu, Summon the Avengers!
Wrek|Observiking: Stormtroopers are supposedly descended (in terms of aesthetics) from clone troopers.
Captain Cody.
Wrek|Observiking: but it seems they lost their aim in the years
Quick_Thinker: clones of clones
more implausible war machines! more!
Quick_Thinker: Budget.
00,10they never had aim
Quick_Thinker training program got dropped
Send in the droids.
CriticKitten: and the only good about said war is that we got Genddy tartakovsky to do show it to us.
fireworks!
Fire all the things!
Okay, honest question
Purple Missle! :O
Mr. Garrison's wheel-thingy of death
hmm?
Spess.
00,10they were all cloned from jengo and well you saw how well he could hit obiwan
11,01ALL things we will fire.
No, we keep fighting.
Arn't there clone ships in space right now?
CriticKitten go on
how are the graphical holo projecting this do they have senors in the ground or something?
That Foreshadowing
dat Death Star
The Republic gunship is CLEARLY a superior model to the Empire's shit. AND it can deploy walkers more practical than the AT-AT.
Death Star
So....
Your doomed anyway.
That is no moon
Foreshadow.
WHY DID THEY CHANGE TECH?
RosePetal: You're*
Quick_Thinker: the droids probably analyze and giv e feedback
Dat Death Star...
The plans for the peace moon
and fans yet again raged in anger
CriticKitten 'cause Star Wars
CriticKitten: They had to cut back the budget post-war. They had a Death Star to build, you see.
CriticKitten Change Tech?
Hey, it's like that thing. This automatically makes it Star Wars
Seriously, in the sea of shit that is the Prequels "Star Wars: Clone Wars" was the only thing of value, because it knew when to shut the fuck up and let the action speak for itself.
Never enrage the fans.
00,10change it? perhaps they just never deployed it
RAWRity somewhat
The cartoon or the tv series?
Sumica
Reikim: They own the galaxy. Literally everything. Can't they just say "build this" and it's built? >_>
RAWRity: And it wasn't afraid to stomp on Ki-adi Mundi's head.
CriticKitten: rebel tech Is empire tech in part, it was said so in one of the games
I have a video I want to share after the movie
ep3 is the best of the 3 prequals easy
oh no you dont flying ball
CriticKitten: they stole empire tech
Which one is Captain Cody?
115?
THATS RIHGT TAKE ONE DOWN BUT LET THE OTHERS FLEE SMART YOU ARE NOT
RosePetal: i think the yellow one..
The orange one RosePetal
Yay, they got a giant ball thingy
That was a bit Stupid
bad idead
Okay.
CriticKitten: It's a mechanized planet. Even a galaxy has trouble dealing with that. Also, transportation and communication issues arising from managing said galaxy.
CriticKitten They dont "own" the galaxy. The Droids are merely a diplomatic solution, like the Jedi are. Then the droid manufactures became diplomats who sided with the federalists
xOVER9000!!!!! Kill
Red and blue bullets.
spray and pray
00,10it could have been worse. they could have had 3d tech for movies when this came out.
dang out of ammo
There is no time!
>rockets
[SWAG]Haku, laser diplomacy
twilight_sprinkle: It shows. The Republic uses fighters similar to X-Wings, the Jedi use starfighters akin to the A-Wing. My question is: Republic Gunships are clearly better than the shit they were using, why bother making TIEs
>YOU HAVE FUCKING LAZERS
Dont they have lasers????/
Sumica, can I request a video after the movie?
why no lasers?
wth
Sumica O_______O
PLEASE
"We're out of rockets. That's kind of inconvenient to us but convenient to the action choreographers."
Y U NO Fire lazers?!
Sumica: Eurgh. 3D. The worst thing the film industry keeps doing.
WHY WOULD YOU SWITCH TO ROCKETS WHEN YOU HAVE GOD DAMN LAZERS
we can't get him. He's on a scootie puff sr. not jr.
Yay
sucks to be her
Lazers could be out of amm
*ammo
They probably are going to make the star wars in 3d because they need money. :|
Padame fell out? Yay.
actually if he did he would be fine
Could be out of... light?
CriticKitten: Quantity vs. Quality. Also see the TIE Fighter games.
11,01Use lasers, dumbass.
XAX LoLz
Sorry, run out of Lazers
Listen to be Obi Wan.
I AM ACTING
Again
SHOUTING MATCH
CriticKitten: idk, ive thought about that before. although im not sure that its the tech, might be the people
Lasers are deflected by shields, rockets are not.
[SWAG]Haku: nobody is using lasers here
RosePetal: here in mexico we had 4D star wars due to its anniversary
RAWR RAWR RAW
she would put the ship down
00,10she said she would blow me when this was done I dont want to miss that goddamit obi
Anakin, don't let your personal feelings get in the way! WE MUST FOLLOW THE PLOT!
4d is fine.
Yoda is not amused
CriticKitten: you rang?
05haha sumi<32
Follow the plot.
RosePetal: IT WAS AWEEEESOME
lasers run out in the universe HOW NO SERIOUSLY HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF AMMO IN A LASER GUN TELL ME DAMNIT
Okay.
bring me your finest ship
why is kermit talking ormally now
Quick_Thinker batteries?
O_O
Quick_Thinker 'cause Star Wars
CriticKitten: In the TIE Fighter games, they establish that TIEs are not supposed to succeed. Also, TIE Interceptors/Defenders are monstrous; they're the real threat hidden among the regulars.
Nope
Time to fight Count Dooku.
that ship was only 2 days from retirement
Stupid
2 vs 1, easy wi...... *facehoof*
that was stupid
lol
Stupid asshole
Fool.
force lightning!
RUN AT IT THAT ALWAYS WORKS
Quick_Thinker: what kind of shitty as battery only last 10 minutes in a fire fight?
Force Drain
Quick_Thinker: no laser guns are used in the fight. with exeption of the ones that cut down the big starting ships
Reikin: >it
He just pulled a Leroy Jenkins
Still not an epic fight like Darth Maul.
CHIDORI
Obi-Wan confirmed for dumbass
Quick_Think It could be that theyre not really lazers, but a type of bullet that doesnt exist in our universe(yet), and we just asume that theyre lazers since we have no other cool alternative
RosePetal: darth maul was not epic fight
and this is again why we hate the boy and love Varder :D
/me drags Thrackerzod in and closes the portal quickly
red lightsaber, that means he's evil right?
I hate the fight after this...
Well the music was.
the cool Lightsaber
He's more burnt than Misty's bike in episode 1 of pokemon
Dken2021 eeyup
muahaha
[SWAG]Haku: No, they're lasers. They're just useless 'cause shield tech.
Tao...dude stop with the un-needed rp..
I miss Misty :(
We need some epic music.
Dooku is a lightsaber duelist, you IDIOT. Why would you try to attack him head on?
drth vader vs luke is da best
[SWAG]Haku: Blasters. Plasma projectiles.
rape time!

ponyfromPR: /)
no rape jokes
Get used to being crispy Annie...
just chillen in the sand
Clones are nicer than humans...
I miss Misty too. Pokemon is not the same anymore.
LUKE VS VADER is best lightsaber duel EVER
I MISS BROCK
Quick_Thinker: He was too busy being ANGSTY
HE WAS THERE, ALWAYS...
Oh hey, look, choreography.
NOW HES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE DX
Come one, some music would be good.
No cast Summon Giant Sand Worm
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH

Double the swords.
Bronysith: /)

Yet... Anikan still fails..
LIAF
Suddenly, Anakin can duel wield.
Hes not good at 2 Sabers
00,10odd place for cable that powers lights in the wall
Obi Wan is injured.
how do you know when someone retweet you in twitter?
Kandarihu apparently he cant, didnt last long
And then Episode 2 became Alone in the Dark
11,01Twirly flashy.
Or maybe he learned to duel wield.
I see anakin leveled up the ninja job class
Reikim: terrible writing my dear brother
Reikim 'cause Star Wars
It could not be training, but just instinct
He can't just get up and help him.
trying to make it looks as good as Empires lightsaber battle they are trying at least
MY ARM

hIS ARM!
TAKE HIS ARM

THIS SCENE IS A TRAITOR TO THE CHARACTER YES?
None of these Jedi ever seem to learn the Conservation of Sensei-fu. You always lose to the person who taught you (or taught your teacher).
"Hey Anikin, I want to show you my new girlfriend here." "But all that's over there with you is my left hand!" ";)" "6_9"
Reikim yodas saber stlye is godlike
lol :D
This is getting a bit stupid
counter
Two oldest characters have the most badass fight scene while the younger ones have nothing.
GO YODA GO :D
dooku u mad bro? :D
Shizuuuu. Why does everyone in this film keep gripping the idiot ball? ;-;
dooku is gonna get is asswhooped by a 600 year old alien
YODA KILL HIM
Why can't you just light saber fight.
00,10and with that power yoda has at least 25 more years of life left in him.
Und dann Yoda could fight.
KILL HIM YODA YOU BADASS GREEN DWARF
don't do it yoda...aaw
Now we fight!
yoda is a god
05or i dunno, combining the two?
It is obvious zis contest will not be decided bah our knowledge of... Force Arm-Wrestling, but bah our skills with ze lasair sword. En garde!
AW YEA!
To be honest the 1st time I saw Yoda fight, I LOL'd
Now this is a good fight
Sumica: Imagine him in his prime. My. God.
Dam he can move
This scene is just so.. so. so much FUCKING FAIL
technically, that is also the force IIRC
THE BUFFER IS WEAK IN THIS ONE
Wrek they do
dat YEAAAAAAAAAAAA
Bronysith How?
Go yoda!
/me walks around the chat "Popcorn, get your popcorn here!"
must. contain. laughter
FINALLY WE HAVE AN EPIC BATTLE!
Note to self... never duel with midgits...
yoda with battlecries lol
Oh snap
*eats popcorn*
In this movie*
He's very spritely for someone who apparently needs a cane.
This is just-The Beginning
AttacktheAndalite I will trade you a bucket for a muffin.
COWARD!
Save us, CGI Yoda!
00,10so much for not leting fealings control you yoda
So everypony's cool with Yoda fighting?
Pickles.... Pickles..... Get your pickles..... Family recipe pickles...
Now fling that at hs ship.
I'll take some popcorn. Here's three bits.
Meanwhile: He uses the cane to throw people off. Yoda is just that badass.
night everyone
Or...drop it.
[SWAG]Haku: yoda is old. the appeal of yoda is that he is powerful even though he is little and old. when you are older, you are not physically powerful
Yoda is badass anyway.
night Derpy_Hooves
Lunar_Brony: Done. *gives a muffin*
Some of us always wanted to see Yoda fight.
g'night Derpy_Hooves
[SWAG]Haku: it wouldve been better if it was a force battle
Meanwhile: Or grab his ship with the Force.
Kandarihu: yes and no
Use the gunship to kill him!
bye Derpy_Hooves
Meanwhile: Which he could totally do.
?
Why can't you shoot him?
USE BOTH HANDS YOU DUMB HANDMAIDEN
CriticKitten: Indeed.
AttacktheAndalite -_(\ I give you a muffin, you give me popcorn
Dat solar surfer
plz
Cool ship design. Too bad it never resurfaces.
05the sail of that ship keeps reminding me of of that star trek TNG movie
CriticKitten: or use the force to throw a bomb onto his ship.
05whats it called
Yoda is sad.
>MFW I cut my thumb and just notices it
trollda
We need the matrix revolutions. Now that is an awesome battle.
CriticKitten they cant grab ships, thats why too hard.
lol:D
Insurrection, Wrek?
05ah yes
05insurrection
lol, now he's old and slow again
RainRunner: Shame about the rest of it.
*way
Wrek|Observiking: Star Trek: Burning Erection?
ooh, have the matrix triligies b\played yet?
Sumica after this can you play that game again?
00,10they had one of those in DS9 as well wrek
Weirdest Ship ever
mind giving me a hand :D
RainRunner: I find it amusing and appropriate that you refer to that movie as one battle singular.
Lunar_Brony: My bad *gives you a giant bucket of popcorn* Butter?
That's no moon.
Bronysith Its called adrenaline, something even old people can use to perform under better curcumstances. Second, Yoda is the best Jedi when it comes to the force, hwe can use it to help him battle like that. The force isnt just about pushing and pulling.
Dat Buffer....
>mfw said cut is starting to get feeling.
twilight_sprinkle: Yoda lifted an entire X-Wing fighter in his old age in Empire. :p
Sumica: implying anypony gave 2 fucks about DS9
Is dis da one with Grievous?
Meanwhile, Reikim: well the movie was just one big climax to the trilogy.
No.
Discord nope
3rd one is.
[SWAG]Haku: But that's the very definition of a force! Unless you get into the four fundamental types.
00,10it was good till the war RAWRity
aww :(
CriticKitten an immobile xwing with no speed, and he barely lifted it up
[SWAG]Haku: but he is 2 feet tall, so to compensate he has to jump everywhere, and it just looks fucking stupid
DS9 wasn't that bad. It paled in comparison to Babylon 5 tho
AttacktheAndalite nah, I'm fine. *sticks face in popcorn*
Lunar_Brony: Don't choke on that
Sumica: at least it was better than Voyager
Voyager is when the series jumped the shark
RAWRity: Leave Voyager alone.
twilight_sprinkle: Barely? He lifted it easily.
So Sumica, you think you can play that space game thing?
"A force isn't just about pushing or pulling." Any physics majors here?
00,10Kerbal? perhaps
You have done well for a coward.
Voyager was awesome.
oh look, it's the pope
HAI EMPEROR
yay
05i find myself saying the same about the latest star trek redux
Sumica: YES I love kerbal :D thank you!
No.
05sure the first 2 seasons were dull and played on sex every episode
The Definition isnt PUSHING and PULLING. Its a natural energy that Jedi and Sith can harness. It just so happens that the two most common ways of doing so is to push and pull
Seriously dude, get another robe, you're wearing THE SAME ROBE
Now to the Cheddar Monks
YOU DONT SAY YODA
CriticKitten he gave a exhausted heavy breath after he lifted it. and it wasnt flying
05but once the xindi wars errupted i enjoyed that show
Sumica: I mean after the movie, of course.
Captain obivious.
Oh no....
"Agree, I" you mean, Yoda
Victory?
/me Victory? Victory this is not. A cloud of darkness and POINTLESS FILLER hovers on the galaxy..............we have just enntered.........in the BATTLE OF THE FILLER CLONES!
Master pokemon?
Whats on everypony?
Victreebel
General Yoda's Great Big Sith Hunt! Begun, it has!
Victini
They may won the battle, but they havent won the war yet
00,10drop the movie title has
dun dun duuuun
The Clone War? He named it before it started?
>Order of jedi skilled at sensing evil and darkness
But luckily we can just skip this, and go to the 3rd movie.
05but ut seems to be only me that thinks so
Oh hey look, Star Destroyers.
dan vs Sumica
/me BEGUN THE FILLER WAR HAS
>Failed at doing just that
>Can't spot Darth Sidius RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR FACES
Guys
11,01Begun, my bowel movement has.
We need more filler.
Dang, the Router died on me...\
*cue varder music*
Nittany_Discord, luls?
Jimmy Smits
:D
=/
hoq is the minseries the clone wars?
Star Destroyers.
Best part of this movie is the John Williams soundtrack. Let's not lie to ourselves.
Greedo.
Suddenly, General Grievous appears.
Darth vader music.
ITS NOT GREEDO
WHAT
UNWANTED SCENE
Yeah, that nick is getting feeling
No, they get married.
WTF
Dken2021: "Star Wars: Clone Wars" is fantastic. Star Wars: The Clone Wars is poop.
ITS A GREEDO RACED PERSON
and then this scene
And he marries her, because she's not like sand
WHY
seriously JanAnimations is WAY better than BronyDanceParty
and then EXPLOSION
Why they have to get married? Live in sin you two!
You should have just ended with the clones.
At least they didn't feel the need to drag out this marriage.
Darf14: I don't recall nor care what model, that's my point. :p
/me Fillies and Gentlecolts we leave you with SIR JOHN WILLIAMS to play us off
MARRIAAAAAAAGE
*padme marries a psycho
ITS A TRAP

Sumica: it vibrates
Sumica: Giggity.
Sumica: Comes built with vibrate.

RAWRity, which is which?
RAWRity the first one was gennedy's right?
LOl .

ENTIRE CHAT SAID VIBRATOR

Sumica: Probably not. I don't think they had augs in the SW universe
GODDAMNIT

Wow
Wrek|Observiking: nice
Dken2021: yes
00,10it's got a pull start like the engi hand.

lol innudendos.
Meanwhile: oh shit you raged
yay its over :)
RAWRity: Do you mean the animated series is crap?
THE
END
The Genndy one vs the CGI one?
The end.
The 3D Clones Wars cartoon is good. But it's impossible to give a shit about what's going on.
11,01Warm vibrator.
yay its over
awwww IT ENDED?!?!!?
And it's over. Thank gawd.
o_0
I only got to say I've got a bad feeling about this. once D:
hm didn't lukes have a a battery in it to charge mechial tools (it was talked about in the books)
08,01vibrator?
I saying this now; I enjoy the prequels much more the original trilogy. Althought the OT is the more loved one, the prequels are able to give us more action and adventure since its what made the OT possible. When I first watch the OT, I always wondered what Darth VAder use to be like, how the clone wars happened, and what other JEdi were like. The prequels answered those for me, why the OT were the ones who me me ask.
XAX: the 3D clone wars is poop
Dat wall of text.
Sorry guys, just threw up in my mouth a little at the idea of Hayden nude and thrusting
TOOK LONG ENOUGH

See you guys
RAWRity: okay

[SWAG]Haku: and just like that you lost someone who doesnt care for you

They were talking about the hand.
some of the worst acting and script ever.

ACROSS THE STARS BY MUTHABUCKING JOH WILLIAMS/10
[SWAG]Haku: These prequels were a mess, crippled by an unlikable Anakin Skywalker than no one ever really likes.
Frank Oz directed that awesomely bad Stepford Wives remake.
Mace Windu/10
Kanarihu; HIya, what's up? :P
Haku: So it boils down to whether you wanted story or a bunch of pewpewpewflashboomzoom crap.
night everypony
CriticKitten: that also manage to completely fuck up the continuity and characters of the originals

Ironic that a man named Best played the worst character in this movie.
056am
Bye Fou.....
05wow
05no rest for the wicked
Star Wars was originally, in a lot of ways, A western movie set in space.
CGI clusterfuck/10
both series didnt catch my attention
Go to bed Wrek.
God these strings. AND THAT BRASS SECTION. If music is sex then John Williams is an orgy.
Yeah, I'm still a bit sickened by the thought of Anakin breeding
00,10at least you got pizza wrek
05true
The prequels were reheated pop.
/me checks to see if The Stepford Wives is A or B.
05and some candy
see ya brohhof
Kandarihu: aww, thanks mate :) /)
Wrek|Observiking you got pizza? Lucky . . .
Wrek: CANDY!
Bronysith Hey, dont get me wrong, I love the OT very much, theyre some of the best films Ive ever seen, but they just made me wonder about how things got the way the were. The prequels showed us how everything happened and why. True, there were some mistakes made with the prequels, some I wish werent in them, but the fact remains that the reason Darth Vader was even Darth Vader was because he was too close to his emotions, all
CriticKitten: with Natalie Portman no less.
Too late to show mom an episode of Macross /10
No. If music is sex, then John Williams is the greatest pimp ever.
Ew, liquorice.
/me agrees with RAWRity
I'M SICK OF THESE MOTHERBUCKING SOAP OPERA IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING MOVIE/10
LOL
Sumica, does it let you skip the credits?
:D
Licorice is tummy
[SWAG]Haku: who are you?
Bronysith And there are many toher things in them that showed how the emperor rose to power, something you have to admit wouldve made you wonder if the prequels were never made
http://i.imgur.com/3ydTy.jpg /10

[SWAG]Haku: but nothing makes sense
/me pokes Ponies47
SIR JOHN WILLIAMS/10
/me pokes oni_link
/me throws a muffin at oni_link
RAWRity: I don't mind Natalie so much, she has demonstrated that she CAN be a good actor with the right script. I honestly feel sorry for her being in the prequels, because her GOOD stuff will never be remembered over Padme.
00,10nope i have no way of skiping the credits at all.
08,01Wrek|Observiking: actually, i can't stand the stuff
/me Pokes oni_link "HI!" :D
Bronysith Tell me one thing that doesnt make sense. One.
The Jedi come off as such easily-duped pricks in these movies.
05salmiak?
This music is just so beautiful.... after Duel of the Fates, I think this one is my second favorite :')
00,10Once i hit play it must go all the way to the end before I can do any thing
CriticKitten: and her rathe forgetable role in Thor as well.
Sumica whatev. Music ain't bad
hmm… Stepford Wives had a high budget, but it have a 5.1 on imdb.
AttacktheAndalite: ...Did they actually do that soundtrack? I'll have to listen to that movie properly now...
/me throws a muffin at Ponies47
08,01Wrek|Observiking: he's my favourite to'kra
what? licorice is tolerable
Reikim: Yep. For the first and second movie as well
[SWAG]Haku: "i dont trust these people. i think something bad could happen any minute" Drinks tea
I honestly hope that Episode III tomorrow night won't be the Rifftrax version.
................................
licorice? Blech
/me Nomes on Lunar_Brony's muffin
hey, mind if I link a vidoe now?
RAWRity: Yeah, she's a good actor who has gotten dealt some good and some bad hands. Hayden though? Can anyone name a film he was great in?
05oh well you can use it as prank candy then (lol SG joke) cause its burning hot
*Noms
/me wants some Twizzlers now
08,01Wrek|Observiking: but no, i don't liek salmiak
[SWAG]Haku: he had a bad feeling about the ship yet he willingly drank tea which couldve been poisoned
/me laughs because of Jmo4267 's poke and catches Lunar_Brony 's muffin
licorice? yummi
as long as it isn't black licorice, that's disgusting
08,01i've had the german version before
;D
Kandarihu: we'll provide out own Rifftrax!
Bronysith well what do you want, attack them for no reason while being on a diplomatic mission?
Unless they run it twice. Both original and Rifftrax
a rifftax version of Episode 3 o_O i SO want to see that :D
Leon The Professional.
so... I finally took a look at Tara Strong's twitter page
05ill see what i can find
AAWW SHIIZ, John Williams at his best right here :P
all that bling
Spent all the budget on CGI, couldn't train half the cast. /10
twilight_sprinkle: the fact that he willingly drank the tea, which couldve been poisoned was retarded
StormFox, have you seen Episode III already?
That's what they did with the other films during the trilogy feature
05worst case i bring plopp
Bronysith as for the tea, jedis havent been known to get poisoned iirc, they might sense it or someth
I'm legit curious, too.
Ponies47: how ya been dude? :)
Bronysith Just because he has a bad feeling doesnt mean he knows exactly what will come. He can not see the future, merely predict that a bad event will 'soon' come to pass
08,01oh oh!
Not even trolling. Can ANYONE name a film Hayden was good in?
08,01can you bring me some mesmor?
I stopped caring about John William's after the Harry Potter theme
08,01i *love* that stuff
OMG
oni_link: I'm good. How's about you? :3
05i should be able to
[SWAG]Haku: and when tehy filled the room with poison. why not just leave the door closed for like 5 hours and then they will be dead
Reikim: JOHN POWELL, DON'T KNO?!?!? That's like the John Williams of animated movies, mate!
look at that <.....
There's that disclaimer again
WHERE?
08,01i've not had it in *years* since my local swede left for greener pastures
Reikim: Ohhh....oh yea that's right. I knew there was a John in there somewhere.
[SWAG]Haku: but noooooo " they are probably dead now, so go in there and ffinsih whats left of them"
What is this vid with such terrible contrast?
PinkiePieYoshi64: Excuse me as I shrug.
Reikim: But John Powell is just as good as them
needs captions.
Bronysith they Did leave it for a while, but the jedi meditated and held out longer than they thought
Reikim: Accepted xD
Sumica: space game later?
/me If you have any problems with this movie..............SING ALONG FLUTTERSHY!
PinkiePieYoshi64: What's John Powell done?
CriticKitten: um...uh...he was in uh........... oh! Takers!
11,01Play the Solrac version.
I can't even read that text
It hurts my face.
LOL YES
Fluttershy is adorable in all languages.

je ne comprendre pas les personnes qui parle en francais... c'est mal.
ow >_<
darn derpy keyboard :P
Bronysith Look, no matter what you think, answer me this; Do or dont the prequels make you apprecitate the OT even more so than possible without them.
so Adorable
Reikim: John Powell is known for "The Incredibles", some of "Toy Story", "Rio" "How to Train Your Dagon" (he was nominated Oscar for this), and a few numberous films that are pixar Classics
Romanian Fluttershy doesn't sound gentle.
Ponies47: Its still not soon enough though!
Could cook a fooden?
oni_link: Awwww. It will come don't worry
[SWAG]Haku: what? i hate the prequels cause it has nothing to do with the OT whatsoever
PinkiePieYoshi64: Okay, for How To Train Your Dragon, he gets my salute.
Bronysith: i dont even know what youre referring to there
Dagger of danak!
to be fair, the last half of the song is not in Fluttershy's normal speaking mode.
Hungary, never waste food. You will eat pig feet and you will like it.
I like the Dutch one
Italian~
Reikim: That's why he got an Oscar :P I loved him after that film :)

twilight_sprinkle: when in the shiton menace, they were boarding the ships filled with droids to naboo and took seperate crafts
cant hold a note too well
PinkiePieYoshi64: The first Dreamworks movie to ever hit the bar at the Pixar level.
i wonder what hebrew and japanese would sound like :3
Reikim: Well... scratch that... he didn't get it, but got close
oni_link: I see.
StormFox: I bet the Japanese would be soo adorable
ugh...that white & yellow text - who thought that was a good idea :|
what asshat thought it would be brillaint to make th text in glowing yellow on a yellow background
Cypresswolf: Someone who hates your eyeballs.
:D
deep voice for a filly
Bronysith Also, Im not saying that the prequels are perfect, nor am I saying that they are better they are better than the OT. All I said was that I enjoy them more because they answered some things I had wondered ofr years. Its my opinion saying that the prequels, though not better in story, make good movies on their own.
Yoru_kun: one is spoken in Portugal, the other in Brazil
TMK, there is no official Japanese dub, only a fandub.
05im happy im not color blind
Bronysith: the ships only have one bay, they cant get ambushed separately
SHTOOOOOOOOOOOOOKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

*goes back to reading creppy pasta*
Ok, IMa have to leave for now people
Cya
Night [SWAG]Haku
From my understanding, the Japanese tend to have a bad reaction to quadropeds. There is only ONE mecha franchise in which the robots aren't humanoid, and the Brony fandom has a limited impact there as well.
bye [SWAG]Haku
Sumica can you play that kerbal game after this video?
oni_link: It SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS! I gotta stop looking at Pony shirts! D:

Kandarihu screwed up? They shoved it in our faces!

Wrek|Observiking: Pinkie made a laughing sound after her mouth had closed.
oni_link: And we all know who that is....not calling any names
hen3ry: Not when it's your native language
Alister, I enjoyed the french dub
Ponies47: Ill gift you something when I get my new laptop :)
What? I don't even
Alister: Yeah, you did. It didn't sound too bad, but definitely inferior to the English job, though it's not their fault; translation to French while maintaining rhythm is not fun to say the least.
:O
RAWRity: Ah mah gad, it's Godzilla!

Reikim: SFM.

I love the way he says suit
Reikim: To be fair, it apparently overs any instance of an animal crawling into your engine and casuing damage.
CrimsonPhoenix: yep
nope... not MLP at all *shifts eyes*
Yeah, looks too smooth for Gmod
"I could care less about my suit."
oh, i can unmute it now?

DocSane, Brony plays TF2
Meanwhile: sfm
Polydunami: its from 64, ds, and a few others

cachi01: Eh?
Brony vs hater
ded
oh f*ck
what is this video callled?

Dammit that's sad

Umm, I KNOW that. Rainbow Road is a staple of Mario Kart games.
I was wondering which version.
oh thanls.

You can actually fall off Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64. You just have to try hard enough :P
cachi01: it was really fun
I'm laughing for real, and that never happens
cachi01: its a great game, but theres a little wall of stars on the paths so you wont fall off
Oh, I saw Ted tonight. That movie is hilarious.
rofl.. this is great

I like this alot
DocSane: agreed!

Giving the fandom SFM was probably one of the best moves Valve ever made.

crap
well shit
damn
/me laughs his ass off
*clap

nuke XD
Aw, fuck
I blame the BLU engi
I'd honestly like to see these SFM videos that are devoid of any of Valve's assets. But I'd probably have to pay for it, since the creators can legally charge for it.
Well.
And that is why TF2 should never have tactical nukes
and not a single was said in the entire video
i wonder how he did the smashed up map
/me claps
Sumica will you be playin kerbal again? I kinda want to know so I can stop annoying the shit out of you >.<
Yeah! Fuck 2fort!!!!!
not bad
Where did that tire even come from?

*coughs and stretches* Thanks
Nittany_Discord: Same they should
I also learn that it's more than useless to request a video.
05Nittany_Discord: they can only "Ponify" the oens that have had their SFM files released
Things got serious
Four turrets? HAAAAX
05which is afaik only meet the engie and heavy so far
lol nice one CrimsonPhoenix
05probably more
eventuallly

11,01Who's heavy in PF2?
CrimsonPhoenix
I
what
whew bot
WTHS?
Pinkie
05said can
What is this, One Piece?
adorable.
Fluttershy is apparently Roronoa Zoro for this vid.
where did all the swords come from?
I can't wait until "Meet the Pyro" gets ponyfied
epic
Well, we know that Meat the Heavy was released. So we should be seeing Fluttershy freaking out over somepony touching her gun.
wait Heavy?
11,01I'd think they'd make Pinkie a Pyro.
Big Mac
00,10Big Mac is the heavy most the time
I mistook
I forget. Watch pony is Pyro?
00,10Some times fluttershy
Nittany_Discord: Pinkie IS the Pyro.
well they're getting better
*Which
:'(
Sumica, oh. I thought it was Fluttershy.
OH SHIT
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
11,01Who's Heavy then?
See, a clever animator would have kept the swords in their mouths and them on four legs.
Nittany_Discord: pinkie for pyro!
Pinkie is the Pyro, Fluttershy is the Medic, Mac is the Hoovy, etc.
ah shit fluttershy got disarmed
BIg Mac
yay
the hell?
O_O
nice Twi
Fluttershy is Medic
nice shot
Nittany_Discord: Big Mac's the heavy.
and CUT!
I think Heavy = Big Macintosh
Twilight with a Machina
good job twi saved everyone
GOOD ENDING!
lol
the machina dosnet use bullets
I did not expect that
dat squee
11,01Never saw Big Mac in PF2 when streamed.

CAVE STORY CANNOT LAG UNLESS YOUR PC IS A DECADE OLD
XylemTube: and there is this button in the middle that gives you turbo
AttacktheAndalite: Huh?
Polydunami: Are you actually serious about that? Because you might need a new computer.
otakon: Like yours?
otakon: lmao
00,10might work better if wrek hosted bot match if I am streaming

cachi01: strem is on no more youtube links
DashWithRainbows: http://www.mlptf2mods.com/

The Original looks like a crotch rocket.
Suddenly, Doom: TF2 version,
cachi01: lolz
I find this really..... (misses mosqueto) DAMN IT
thanks a lot Reikim.
One question about the Pony/Class affinities. If Big Mac is the Heavy, who's the Soldier and Demoman?
Kandarihu: Spike and Zecora.
I would like to see Derpy as the Demo
How did you get your rocket launcher to be held like that?
soldier should be the YEAAAAAAH pony
I was guessing Celestia and Luna, but that works too.
cachi01: u like Manowar
hmm i feel left out =/
Still buffering.
-.-
NVM
Sumica is that how that rocket is held?
Discord that one's called "The Original". Basically the same stats as the Rocket Launcher, except rockets fly straight down the cursor
CANT FINISH QWOP MLP!!!
Oh...
xtremetoxicguy: xD
hm any clue what the IP is?
Discord there's a reson it's called the "Penis Cannon"
CAAAAAAAAAAAAANNOOOOOOOOON PEEEEEEEEENNIIIIIIIIIIS
I FEEL RETARDED
Quick_Thinker wish I could tell you
thanks CrimsonPhoenix so far i like it
Nice spray, there
The Original still looks like a crotch gun.
11,01Is this a Doom TF2 mod?
looks like
Sumica can I play with you?
Nittany_Discord: Nah it's an actual weapon.
I'd like to think of it as a chest-mounted cannon
Nittany_Discord: no its a real weapon
OH HELLYEAH!
Nittany_Discord: its called the Original
OOOHHH! now i know
THE OLD REPUBLIC IS NOW FREE TO PLAY!
and there was Ponies47 cameo
otakon: Welcome to five hours ago.
Wrek what's the server password?
Password ? But I wanna play :(
Meanwhile: why? WHY DO YOU RAIN ON MY PARADE?
old republi BAH im skipping that
otakon: Because I caaaan.
I feel like a winner when I play qwop
Hey, what otakon was saying is news to me.

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/critical-miss/9834-Our-Little-Pony
Okay, back to watching some more Doctor Who.
nooo pinky
Wrek can you tell me the server password?
otakon: That's from seven hours ago.
Meanwhile: damn you
Meanwhile: DAMN YOU AND YOUR MUSTACHE!
otakon: Mind your caps.
11,01And I beat Dead Space 2.
Meanwhile: caps u play fallout dont u
11,01The Original. Is that a new weapon?
scottish-geeky: Actually I dislike Fallout. I meant capslock.
Nittany_Discord it's been around for over a year now
Nittany_Discord: nah its old
AH!
11,01I've never seen it used.
Time to download all the TF2 pony models to compliment my Touhou pony models.
Meanwhile: ohh oki
Bethesda got ahold of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. apparently
hmm not sure if i should join
loldeadspace2
Nittany_Discord: It never gets used cuz it's identical to vanilla launcher.
HELL YEAH!
NEW BETHESDA MADE STALKER!
Nittany_Discord it has the same stats as the Rocket Launcher, so I'm not surprised
dead
Attack of the ten foot axe.
11,01So it's a vanity launcher. OK.
Nittany_Discord: yup
11,01Pony models
My own interpretation of the Pony/TF2 afinitties, I guess would have Applebloom = Demoman, Scootaloo = Soldier, and Sweetie Bell as Heavy, unless Fluttershy is the Heavy, then Sweetie Bell = Medic.
Nittany_Discord if you want to put it that way, then yes
at least this rocket launcher goeas directly ahead
11,01!
PONY
BTW someone cosplayed as rainbow dash scout at bronymexicon
ha Wrek|Observiking sur dos love twilight
Did you enjoy the Dead Space 2 ending Nittany_Discord?
Hi everypony
I like to snipe with a Strange Piss Rifle
hia Pudge
hi Pudge
11,01It was satisfying.
I bring good news
11,01The boss was easy.
I got an interview :)
Pudge: what
Pudge: cook
Wrek rollin' with the Hoovy.
Pudge: cool
11,01Pudge: Awesome.
Yeah it is Nittany_Discord.
BRB IN 10 MINUTES
hi Pudge
11,01The boss was easier than the last few rooms in the game.
Dead Space 2?
It's nice knowing that I'm not the only one who uses the "ding" on hits.
Yeah, they could of done abit more effort into the last boss, but meh whatever. Hoping they don't let down on Dead Space 3.
11,01I use the ding.
I never finished dead space 1
Pudge, sweet. I wish I culd get an interview.
i also use the ding
Finish it nao.
11,01I think DS3 will be a letdown.
Meanwhile hell, my friend has a Burning Snaggletooth.
Jmo4267: Someone on here rants about Dead Space 3 a lot. Apparently they're dropping most of the horror element in favour of multiplayer?
i got stuck on the monster that follows you around the ship and you cant kill it
It probably will since they're practically getting rid of the horror aspect.
11,01It's an EA game. Expect it.
Dead Space was 2spooky, so they're making it an action game
2spooky?
AttacktheAndalite: Definitely not easy in this day and age
Nittany_Discord: It's going to be like a shadow-world version of Valve. All the threequels will be a letdown!
Pudge: I know. And I've never had an actual job a day in my life so fun times
Dead Space 3 is practically Lost Planet.
Dat Sumica spray.
11,01EA put so much money into DS3 that they need to sell 5 million copies to break even. Morons.
ikr
AttacktheAndalite: It's so liberating when you get one because you have a steady cash flow
11,01Sumica: I think you're worse than me at this right now.
Who or what is doing that adorable giggle?
Pudge: I know, right? My parents send me money every two weeks and it's 100 dollars, not enough to live off of
11,01Ahh. K.
Sumica: so much lag
Wrek|Observiking: May I join to perhaps help Sumi?
AttacktheAndalite: definitely not, you should look around
btw Nittany_Discord i know you won the motherboard, but have you fixed your pc yet?
Pudge: With gas and Internet and necessities and there's a convention this weekend that I plan on attending
luna is cute pink
yay, stream works now
hehe
11,01I wish I could get a job. I need to straighten some health issues out first.
AttacktheAndalite: oh what convention?
Pudge: RoundCon, a local one.
Sumi, is that you doing that adorable giggle? Or is it Wrek?
Sumica: Because spy?
Night everypony
Night, Dovah
Ah a SC convention
nithgy Dovah
Pudge: Yep.
night Dovah
once I get the cash I'm definitely flying to bronycon
I am one of them
Cream GRAVY!
Pudge: all my envy
there is no "Bad weapon"
11,01Yay Sumica!
8,6GLOMP PILE ON Nittany_Discord!

Meanwhile I've lost all care for this conversation. There is no hope in changing your mind.
/me was glomped
Lunar_Brony: No, there isn't. You're a tad slow aren't you.
Meanwhile I had high hopes.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
/me ties up Meanwhile and Lunar_Brony and drops them in the middle of the glomp pile
I didn't ask for this.
8,6too bad :P
this is your fault Meanwhile
I blame you.

8,6someone should hug those two until they settle down
8,6or suffocate, whichever comes first
Nevermind. Who's going to glomp us first?
ohai kirzstryfe
kirzstryfe, I would but I like living and I can't run fast enough to defend myself
hial kirzstryfe
AttacktheAndalite we aren't going anywhere
11,01I hear Shamroc.
Lunar_Brony: It's not you I'm worried about. I'm worried about the next time I'll be able to remember anything from having something chucked at my head.
Nittany_Discord: yeah you do
AttacktheAndalite oh, you're worrying about the other guy. He's tied up too.
Pfft. "The other guy" I have a name you know.
I know

Lunar_Brony: what, is he He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now?

Hello everypony

Lunar_Brony: Shhhhh, don't say his name, the Trackers will--! *is taken by one of Voldy's henchmenses*
Seeya!

/me Apparates to avoid the cinderblock
You're tied up. How did you throw it?
With my teeth.
Yes, my reflexes finally work!

/me wills the cinderblock into AttacktheAndalite's head.
/me slumps to the ground, dead and bleeding'
I would facehoof, but I can't move my hooves up to my face
I require an assisted facehoof!
(assits Lunar_Brony )
/me casts revive on AttacktheAndalite.
-_(\
Anyhoo, enough of that.
he could have just respawned
/me is dizzy "Huh? What happened?"
AttacktheAndalite Meanwhile killed you and revived you
/me negates all of Meanwhile's cinder-block throwing because he never got himself untied
=/

/me negates kirzstryfe's negation because deal with it.

Chocolate? Did you say...chocolate?
I was able to make it down the stairs. Took me about five minutes, but I did.
Chocolate?
CHOCOLATE
/me punches |Discord| "Don't diss the chocolate"
Suddenly it's 7:30AM. I need a cup of tea.
CHOCOLATE!!!!!
Memo from god to Canada: "I froze half your country, so I gave you extra."
CHOCOLATE!!!!!!
CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE!
AttacktheAndalite: I am Discord. I can do whatever - oh muffins
Just watched the animated film version of Animal Farm

So I tried Twilight Vs. Walking, which is the MLP version of QWOP.

Well Im off, Night all.

Noooo. Money!
Me? I, um, am 20.
Great with horseshoes, shite with armour.

Specifically, no non image links while a stream is on.
Unless you ask the streamer for permission.

Mind you, it's probably hard not to be a sore loser when losing means taking a giant bit of wood to the chest.
89 ponys...about 86 are lurking
Never.
T: Chat is heavily dead.
Sabershy u remind me of someone
Oh my, really? Whom, my I ask?
Just ur same
Alright then. :)

You have been measured. And found wanting.

Meanwhile...sound like he said you have been found wanted
Shamroc: But that'd make no sense.
Meanwhile...well i mean wanted like...as in the LAW wants you..
Shamroc: Why would the law want him?
for IDK fakeing to be a bloody noble?
he did say wanting
Grean
Yeah but they don't know he's faking.
i know but still its all illegal.....soo yeah i win in a sense

Why yes, yes it is.

and... can't sleep
Alchemist: Oh wow, that looks like him.
I this that jousting movie or am I way off?
that music change
Spriggals: That's what it is.
whats the title of this movie?
A Knights Tale I think.
A Knight's Tale
if it's the one I thinkit is..
What would have made this worse if jackblack was there
it is
justing + Heath Ledger
bleh
Von Douchebag is in a bad mood.

lets see how good it actually is
who cares for imdb i like this movie :p

Wrek|Observiking same /)

Wrek: You got good tastes then. :)
hello
That so? I will break his face.
hello everypony
Hahahaaaa
Whiterun guard armour?
Trolled.
looked like one from the back
therainbowvortex: Hello...!
hey so has any pony seen xxmoopy
xxmoopyxx i mean
If we had it'd be obvious because he'd be making a nuisance of himself.
morning everypony
i never see him on any more ah well
Allo HatchetRyda.
what we watchin?
05he got ihmself banned after several infractions
HatchetRyda: A movie
05and if i recall correctly ban evaded
Of course he did, he was a muppet.
HatchetRyda: A Knight's Tale, I think.
AttacktheAndalite: ^_^
dose any pony here like truesoul116
thanks Sabershy
somone is a fan of Twilight...
he dose fanfic readings
:3
HatchetRyda: No problem. :)
05Spriggals: mhmmmm
He is /not/ smooth at all.
I don't recall most guys being... "smooth".
I'm not either
dose any pony know of truesoul116 :) ps whats the movie
It's all in the words.
05i keep accidentally closing it
therainbowvortex: Movie is A Knights Tale. Have no idea who truesoul is.
If only lancers were that good in battle
Um, Wrek: Are you downloading Minecraft?
Spriggals: you mean an actual battle? I thought they didnt deploy those kind of units during an actual battle.
Heck they used Lancers in the Napleonic era
:D
So smart.
Spriggals: interesting, they seem pretty useless. give them a sword or a bow with the horse and they are much more effective
I hope I don't work tomorrow. :\
Battle lancers could pierce through armour. If you think that the tournament ones could still crack the stuff, pointed fighting lances would impale something fierce.
Night Shizuschlafen ~ Sleep well
I'm naturally biased for lances though, given one half of my family history.
Meanwhile: yes, pierce anything...once. Then you have to discard the lance.
I would think lances would be a one hit kill but you can only(god this love letter :L) use the lance once before pulling out your sword and wingin it
Alchemist: Unless its Gae-bolg.
I dunno what that is
My family motto is "Spears amongst our enemies" We were royal lancers. I have to hold face for the chargers.
is it weird that i had a dreem where pinkie was real and i shot haters and antibronys with her party cannon
No that's the best kind of dream
haha
No homo
HAHA.
he happy
therainbowvortex: chances are you watched too many pony before going to bed :D
YESSSS
bromance!
therainbowvortex: Yes it is weird , attacking someone because of their opinion is weird and wrong
We need to go deeper.
French flags are white on French soil.
also pinkie ate all my candy :(

Jesus is English?
idiots
French and english are always going at it
Jesus was black

I've yet to have a pony related dream... If I come to that I'll know I have to cut back on the stuff.

Niether do i
It's all in /sounding/ fancy.
Neither*

Im bad with words too. Even if I have time to prepare for it.
Normally, you need to be asleep to dream,
As long as you sound like you know what you're doing, you'll be fine.
I must have inspiration for me to write poetry. That is how I wrote one to my friend and girl I likd

Ulric gets the ladies. Despite talking to one like he's talking to a sack of flour.
JOUSTING!

This movie is not historically accurate....where is all the horse shit?

Why, thank you Flootahshy! :)

Terrible wetha eh?
So yea...I may return to Star Wars: the Old Republic...once they open up the Free-to-play option in November.

tl;dr wall of text.
Then the are oviously not your friends
Are you in Highshool or what?
SUdden lag... WALL OF TEXT! Is this your doing?
Alpha-Omega-Prime speaks the truth.
Meanwhile...meet moopys freind...
why in the hell would you tell others you watch the show?
05highschool is jsut about survival
ANd also that's why I only have one friend and I dont tell him I'm a brony
Yea
05you basically tell nothing to no one
Yea
Wrek true dat
05well
Shamroc: I feel my resovoir of uncaring continuing.
05last 3 years
therainbowvortex: Er, oh wow. I can't help you other than tell you that high school is crap and you'll never see them again when you leave.
that's like painting your ass red in the prison showers saying "oh boy, I hope it isn't sausage saturday"
Well one of my "friends" thinks I'm gay for liking ponies and playing ponymon.
05you "may" be able to
Meanwhile..indeed...
05depending on if you have a tight knit friend circle
Aye, in high school, you keep your mouth shut and try not to tread on anyone's feet.
THis movie seesm good.
05casue that place be dangerous
And in England.
You get friends Freshmeat year and hopefully they will stick with you
they made school so bad i just totaly skiped school today and im gona tomorow and the next day
ya blew it
What movie is this?
theraibowvortex DO a sonic rainboom into their face.
A Knight's Tale
05heck my firends cicrcle consists of 2 bisexuals, one a gamer gal. anotehr one that is an animefreak and into the kinkier stuff. and 3 cosntant magic the gathering players.
I don't get beat up. People for some reason or another olike and respect me
Is taht old fellow Ulrics father?
Survival of the fittest=high school
that an awsome idear
05all in all we are great friends
Wrek|Observiking......sounds EXACTLY like my group of freinds last year....
05Alpha-Omega-Prime: i havent had bullyign problesm sicne i broke ones ribcage
inb4 Creepy dude murders ulric
...quite a strange group of friends, Wrek
Oh that's always lovely.
Wrek where m at everything is 1950's go with us or be shamed
But they are friends none-the-less
My group of friends consists of anime fans and a few bronies. Mmm, the lulz that take place when we hang out.
His father died?
the problem is that they say they hate them but they bring them up more then me a school :|:|
Unfortunately, the latino community aren't as accepting of bronies as english.
As for the last couple years, you don't bully the dealer. We played cards all the time.
I've always held my cool because when I get mad I won't stop untill I hear bones break or lack of breathing.
Sabershy WHAT!? SAY WAHT!?
I'm inclined to ask how you can hear lack of breathing.
05then again the bullies back then were the soccer fanatics who were more or less the biggest pansies you could imagine
Sorry, but the mexs, I hanged with, I was better off with my mouth shut.
05i say soccer not to confuse you
Everyone in my school is aiming for sex, not even sports
05Spriggals: you poor soul.
xD
16 year old pregnancy get.
Spriggals: You could take advantage of that
Alister: Don't encourage those types of ideas.
Meanwhile, I think the new age for that is 14 or 15 now.
Current generations prime objectives. Sex Tobacco Alchohol Drugs sex and most prominent! Sex!
Meanwhile so they aim for MTV ?
I hate the youth.
the problem is that they say they hate them but they bring them up more then me at school maby they say i must be gay to like the show :|:|
I remember Freshman year im 14 tell my friends I haven't had sex and they look at me like im crazy
05people rarely get accepting of anythign untill they are around 18+
Sabershy: Because , of course , I was completly serious
I want to hit them with kayak paddles.
05and by that time if they still ar ent
05there isnt much they can do about it
/me sighs
05and if they do
Just saying.
05well
Meanwhile I technically am a youth. But not the steryotypical youth.
05police ftw
My group of friends....I stopped hanging out with them after I started isolating myself from people
05the random youth?
That need to been on a plaque, Wrek.
can you belive that every pony
Live to fight another day you loony.
or fight for glory today
05what?
Spriggals: More power to you by not giving in to peer pressure. By the time you graduate, there's probably some chick your age getting pregnant right now and possibly dropping out of school because she can't take care of herself and the child and her parents refuse to help her
05then you can find joy in the fact that the same gal was the one making fun out of you
Oh there are 16 year olds doing that right now
Will there ever be a PotC5? I keep hearong rumors it is in production.
Spriggals: I have no doubts about it.
There are 13 year old girls doing that right now!
PotC5?
lol
My school was literaly full of losers. The fail percentage was 80%
Pirates of the Carribian 5
TheRandomkid321: There are 11 year olds doing it right now, I bet
There's supposed to be a whole new trilogy, so there'll also be a 6th
05someone said this movie had a low score on imdb
spriggals that hapaned to a relly close freind of mine now we never talk because she dosent want people judging her
05cant really get why
Attack|Relaxed ANd if it was possible I bet 6 year old girls would be doing it right now... Too far?
05must be the soundtrack
Probably.
Attack|Relaxed: 11, really?!
The movie itself seems good
05TheRandomkid321: not really. the second pubwerty hits you loose control over such things
lose*
TheRandomkid321: Not at all, with the way the media pressures girls to act waay older than their age earlier and earlier, it seems
05adn as a parent thinkign you have it under control is foolign yourself
It's a good movie, but for some reason it wasn't well received overall. I think it was the history buffs that hated how inaccurate it was.
That little bugger
05the best thing you can do is to provide your kid with a proper moral and ethical base. and hope that he or she can think for him/her self
HatchetRyda: Yes. Middle schoolers.
OtakuTom, so there will also be a 6...
Makes sense respect him for being a knight. Then when he is on a display treat him like crap
Attack|Relaxed: thats just sad
MASF123: That's what I heard when the 4th came out.
HatchetRyda: Mhm
Mayby this guy is the reason for the low ratin
Suddenly fresh produce.
05and instead of bashing your 15 year old pregnant daughter support her and make her to think logically
I like the speaker. He is pretty good.
every pony i think im close to convetinf a freind into a brony
Yes throw food despite us being peasents and needing every small bit!
On Stranger Tides was good, however some people didn't like it.
I have yet to see the fourth Pirates movie.
I admit is wasn't best of the series, but it was still enjoyable.
I loked the latest Pirate Of the Carribean movie.
*likdd
*liked
Heard the last one kinda sucked.
Got one through three on DVD, but I need a new copy of each.
The Mermaids were the best part pf the movie, IMO.
Been avoiding it for the sake of my opinion on the series.
part
Attack|Relaxed: why?
MASF123 :|
i dont like the forth pirates of the caribiean
HatchetRyda: Scratched.
suddenly....he is a good guy...and...doing so just so he can kill the dude..
He is royalty?
Shamroc: Eh?
Shamroc is not the same dude
Shamroc Spoilers much?
oh damnit
Attack|Relaxed: well i know what to get some one neeext~ :)
Oh right. Shamroc thought it was the douche guy
^
OFF WITH YA HED!
Nice! I like fair and kind kings!
Or he really was just knighting him...
Wait, has anyone even seen the 4th film to judge it like that?
TheRandomkid321: thought it was the douche...seting him free just so he could kick his ass later
Technically this is a prince.
...and then they were dead
HatchetRyda, I wonder what it is.
05she doesnt look happy
inb4 he dies in thsi joust... It aint a spoiler if I am soeculating
MASF123: I have seen it. It was good. Since the love triangle though was gone, I felt it was lacking a bit in the drama. However the action was amusing. :)
Attack|Relaxed: *giggle* you'll just have to wait and see cutie
Cheating bastard.
HatchetRyda, d'aww
Sabershy the part with Jack being tied to a tree with Captain Barbosa was pretty funny
Wait he has an illegal weapon!
That guy just doesn't have the same kind of energy.
He hesitates and that makes him look awkward.
some guys at school told me to go kill mysely and that i was going to hell and beter then me just because i was a brony :(:'(:'(:[:[
He should just kill them
killing a knight.....how bad is that especially when the prince is watching
therainbowvortex: So shrug.
05therainbowvortex: and exactly why should you care what he syas?
therainbowvortex...few things...that really sucks...but who really givesa buck what they say..
FIGHT!
LAG!
fuck you let that get to ya no wonder they give you shit kid
Find out where they live and kill them
Let the Jousting begin!
Bloody collision detection...
and here is when i start thinking therainbowvortex just want attention but maybe it's just me
05fidn joy that his abusive alcoholic excuse for a mother will die in a week
Maybe.
Could be he's genuinely unfortunate.
Oh god that stick is not where is should be.
MEDIC!
Attack|Relaxed: ;)
:[
It's just a flesh wound.
Well you have 2 choices either Love and Tolerate or Troll them
But in the same vein he shouldn't care about that stuff, I don't care about him.
or both
05Spriggals: no he has no reason to confront them
Or the choice that works
Ignoring it.
Im saying if he had to
GO!... GUY WHO I FORGOT THE NAME OF!
spriggals hmm what would pinkie do
William?
ulric
05william vs ademar
It's William now.
if he is in fact in highschool then i'm really sorry about him
THE HEART!
spriggals i think she cut the basted
hey guys
other than that i don't really care
Ohai Chrysalis.

In the world where you aren't cheating.
Allo Chrysalis.

Pinkie would make a plan and she'd follow through, that's what Pinkie Pie would do.
The honest world?

Spoiler. There's ponies in s3
Why do we watch movie with low scores from critics? Are ment to laugh or critique them?
JRP DAMN YOU!
critics know nothing
^
Dat kick.
critics said mw3 is a good game
I wish the Olmpics did jousting
those ones specifically are retarded
Honestly, I love this movie. I used to watch it with my father often.
Chrysalis Ys
MASF123: some are actually good......but just didnt have the funding to get a better review
Attack|Relaxed: have your last thoughts be of your loving bf and drift off to sleep ^_^
It's decent but I still don't like it
if critics were actually any good
Haha/ :D That's the funniest joke I've ever heard, Chrysalis
the average game would be 50
not 80
