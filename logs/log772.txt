When in doubt, take 'em out.
Wrek: Amen bro

XaviortheSavior: yep
Hate it that LimeV is blocked in your country.
So he was right all along. I was totally expecting Jack to show up and reveal that Brent really was just a civilian.
Kandarihu: Same here.
Misdreavus used Perish Song
if any cartoon apart from mlp deserves a huge fandom, it's Samurai Jack
Women are evil...just a fact.
me to
DoctoDoctorWho: Depends what feel you want it to have, but Luna shipping kinda rubs me the wrong way...
MASF123: Not true, my friend.
00,02Wrek, no offical soundtrack it seems :(
OH GOD.

AW SHEET
jack is back
ded
so amnesia gives you an accent?
Criminy.
Wait, hold on a sec, If EQD didnt say anyting, Would us bronies be misinformed and Spam /v/?
One would think that Jack would gain his memories from touching his sword.
Daaaauuummmm
SafariMonkey: If I decide to I will do it to the best of my ability as a storywriter. o_o7
how did he lost his memory????????????????
poof
cachi01: They wiped it, IIRC.
Nittany_Discord: it's not even that, sometimes it just seems to glitch and declare "nope, you're not getting a stream, just some boguse maintenance"
SARUMANI JACK!!!
now hug.
cue awesome Scotsman music
cachi01 the sirens did it
...HA!
oh you
Deacon: oh
DOOOOOOOHOHOHOO
05spamming /v/ would be the most idiotic thing bronies could do right now
cachi01, the sirens reprogrammed his mind with their song
How does amnesia give you an accent?
Oh you jack
dohohoho
Lol oh u jack
Yeah, That's what i'm afraid of
@Wrek is right
If something says "Hacked by V" it probably was NOT /v.
Wrek: They did right after, but the thread was removed
More like someone trying to start something between /v and bronies.
why spam /v/? it's already ruined
J_E_Smith71 there were more than just one thread.
AHAHHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA
Why give them the satisfaction of butthurt?
wahahha
By spamming /v/, we'd be falling right into GNAA's hands.
There were quite a few.
lol
uh oh... they left them lol
why do people care about /v/ anyway?
^
...
^^?
aja!...@wrek is /v/!
I'm NOT going to be manipulated into retaliating against something that may not have been responsible for what was done in the first place.
eh, /v/ kinda ruined themselves
the way i see it, GNAA pissed on 4chan by shifting the blame of this to them
Lol.
Phase4 Wrek i find a download with 10 tracks only
hello
/v/ vs /mlp/..... wont work almost every brony is a gamer
ENOUGH ABOUT /V/ ITS SAMURA JACK TIME!!
it would be /mlp/ vs /mlp/
Take on paddle each
/me rows
Gah, people being jerks on the internet. Was I ever that young?
in the end ponychan wins
1
00,02i'm drivin'
lol
hello
cachi01 why would anyone ever go on /mlp/?
U guys know the GNAA did all this right?
The ackward moment when you need help then you find exactly what you need and your like Oh wtf?!?! That moment happened
Are we still talking about the stupid failhack?
I bet the people who hijacked the thread have nothing to do with V. They're just trying to conflict brony gamers against other bronies.
CCCP: r34? lols? bronysith? lol
you DONT SAY
Wats the GNAA?
08,01also, good evenin' m'lovelies!
I mean who hijacked the stream.

XaviortheSavior: they are a troll group

Wrek Phase4 it does appear that the OST is 10 tracks only want a link ?
08,01CCCP: i do it all the time to test the site, actually
CCCP: ULTRABAN
He even got a head start.
:o
It doesn't help having a gun for a leg
DoctoDoctorWho: Sure. It may turn out fine. I just feel that shipping Luna can be a risky move if it's not done right... I personally don't like Luna shipping, as I find it usually doesn't fit her character well...
oh...
05TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ill take it in PM :)
CCCP: is dat possible?
wiat, Bronystate was hacked?
remember remember the 24th of november
Metronome im not even sure

THUMB WAR

Hello BronyState. :)
They didn't start correctly!

This is certainly not filler!
1, 2, 3, 4 then -_-
JACK!
Jack is the man. Like I said before.
Jump good. That was one of my favorite episodes.
its 3 counts not 3 secs
Agreed, Kurra.
05hwo would ponies thumb wrestle?
^^
Wrek: ask pinkie
Wrek: pinkie vs lyra
Jack is naked is my favorite
I've heard a couple of other complaints about that message today.
WarpXR: Jack always cheats. but he cheats honorably. so it doesn't count
pinkie clones could
ikr
I would thumb wrestle Lyra
Arm wrestle with hooves.
>tfw you remember watching the Samurai Jack world premiere on cartoon network as a kid.
Man, that was amazingly drawn out, there.
samurai applejack
>tfw your old as hell.
Wrek, it involves the law and a whole lot of paperwork that has to be filed by a week till next Tuesday....
I watched its premire as a kid
At the very end of Cider Squeezy, it looked like ponies have short little thumbs.
Wrek: Spike?
Kurra: :D
I remember first ep of Spongebob
NuclerReaver: She would cheat and steal your fingers with magic, though...:P
:O :O :O :O :O :O :O
Fingers are canon, remember? TO MANY PINKIE PIES
Nittany_Discord: I can get pretty complainy and whiny though, so don't listen to me all the time
Ponies have hoof-thumbs.
night guys
jack just needs to hit aku 1 time right?
Goodnight alexxm
night mang
Night, alexxm. :)
night bro
Wow...I was thinking of Samurai Jack just earlier today...
night Alexxm
Jack JAck Jack
I remember watching this as a 2 year old with my dad. Good times...
My whole family watched the series premier of Samurai Jack at a hotel.
..........good point @ Iwa
cachi01: i think not
Sumurai Gak!
Dashie_Dashie, S03E03 doesn't make fingers any more canon than G3 faces
For Lulu, sweet thang.
did you watch Applejack and Rainbow dash hoof wrestle?
so
I like the episode where he fights his inner hate.
My favorite episode!
twilight_sprinkle: oh because if iirc he just needed the final blow
Hey this is the episode with Princess Celestia's first appearance. :D
Thanks Wrek!
walk in after a fun day to samuri jack
:)
Hi twilight_sprinkle!
Hello~
:'(
jack?
2 year old?
JACK!
hi CCCP :)
Hello mishia
Welcome back, mishia. :)
Pegasi could theoretically thumb wrestle via feathers, but unicorns and earth ponies are SOL there
The episode that Luna kept streaming
640x480 does not do it justice
cachi01: he had to hit him a lot of times before that though
what message Nittany_Discord ?
i am a neenja
Randy Meyers! My name is Randy :D
Dat hair
:3
Cypresswolf..... face wrestling!
twilight_sprinkle: yeah but i mean right now
Jaaaackiieee!
Arabian Jack
no unicorns can horn wrestle
cachi01: LimeV is telling me it's doing maintenance
Kurra: :D That I would LOVE to see
this episode showcases how you can tell a good story and create atmosphere with sound effects and almost no dialogue
cachi01: well he's recovered since then
ONE MORE THING~
oh
00,02looks like steam is going to require steam guard to be enabled
no hackers hacked stream while i left?
MadSurge: what browser r u using?
/me facenuzzle Cypresswolf, sparring
It amazes me at how many outfits can be made from jacks clothing.
00,02this is a problem for me
Tovler: You have my word that I will next time I stream
A Samurai named Jack in the Future?
Which most likely means nothing as I will forget
Unless you remind me
Phase4, linux?
:P
Phase4 why not just stream it on Livestream instead of mips?
cachi01: Chrome
Alchemist: many samurai jack episodes do something like that. that's why he's great
Now I heard everything...
Phase4, for what?
MadSurge: oh...same here.....then idfk whats happening
its funny when you say g a k
Sounds like an SCP moment
Sand ghost
ONE MORE THING
omg lol!
Eli: right, but I think this ep has the least dialoge in it.
00,02AdamTheDuck, not so much linux as it'll break on my setup
For some reason, LimeV is blocked in some countries.
Mishia vanished for quite a bit :)
IT MULTIPLIES!
/me hugs Kandarihu
and becomes together
Nittany_Discord: why is your words not blue
PinkiePie40: you are not allowed to speak about the SCP foundation. your punishment will be [DATA EXPUNGED]
cachi01: probably LimeV is glitchy and hates Europe :D
say g a k
Tovler: Jaaaaaaaackie!!!!!
05ermegerd my beards is on its way again
05:C
maybe lol
Unless you use a proxy to fake your country of origin, you're not going to see a stream.
00,02Kandarihu, trading
aiyaaaaaaaaaaa
So, I watched Wrek it Ralph.....
/me strokes Wrek's beard :3
I want a lookie at it, Wrek.
If ya can't stand the heat, get outta the future.
Phase4, I see
mishia: I was chatting in another channel that doesn't like colors.
Someone get the Dyson! and SCP IS AFTER ME!
/me hugs CCCP
Nittany_Discord: ah
Let me see your viking beard blossom!
Alchemist: while i love to watch stuff like mlp for the story, i watch samurai jack mostl for the animation. this show is just great with styles and kinds of stroy telling
Wrek: I just started shaving today
Tovler: Magic must defeat MAGIC.
05hell naw ima gona shave untill the blind spot gets some colo
JACK!!! IS IT THE END!?!?!
Welcome to Elsewhere, Home of the Khajiit, Skooma and sand ghosts.
bad day bad day bad day!
I've been growing a beard over the last 5 or 6 weeks...the security guard where I work is calling me Grizzly Adams now XD
Tovler: Moo-Moo Gway Gway FI-De-Sow!!!!!
Jack monking it

Gonna say now, the movie is defintly worth a watch.
oh god this makes me sad... that acceptance of death...
Kipkat07_USAF: he didnt accept it, he jsut realized theyre mirages

Mirages sure aren't wet!

Did you like it as well?<3
of course i did!
oh Jackie Chan Adventures, there are still like 5 seasons of you that I haven't seen.
Evil scientist, at work :)

Zacklego: if you're not mad just let it go. forget about it
The precioussssss

His leaf monster will end us all
I just want to know wtf was that dancing thing
Pre zombiefied jockey?
08,01Kipkat07_USAF: it's not the first time people have tried to bring us down and failed
Me too the niggas and chicken bit was a little...... hilarious
Kipkat07_USAF: idk, i dont find the failure funny, i just fund the hack funny
alchemy is magic
08,01we had a botnet attack a while ago, but it wasn't even a blip on our radar; they only had about 500 nodes
what the?
Aw, hes gomma snort it now...
08,01bitch please, we can handle 20,000
Haha 500
CCCP: then we get back up again
This guy is funny.

ScootalooBodyGuard: Why would you pour soup on everypoy?

Hmm, in your veiwing did they show that short called "Paper Man" before the movie?
CCCP: yeah welp. i for my part am not going to stop before the show disapoints me. i'm sure as hell not going to back down because of some trolls
That guy just tainted HIS OWN water supply.

ScootalooBodyGuard: you really like rp dont you :/

It's probably healthier than Coke.
CCCP: what?

I think he heard the sweat drop fall.

Rairity's crystal mine?
It kind of ended poorly it just kind of...died
Eli it totally works though
I just want to see it so I can finally understand who the hell is this Turbo guy that keeps popping out everywhere
And thats how eridium is mined!
CCCP: if you have trolling in mind...
I feel sooo bad for these guys lol.
it totally needs a reboot
The movie, or what it's based on?
Eli and CCCP: Poe's Law :)
I need to counter-troll trolling brony any suggestions?
MASF123: Ignoring them?
How about, ignore them
noooooo!
^^
I figured out the theme for these 4 short graybles!
eyjey thats the boring way
Rarity WHAT DID THEY DO?
Poe's law states: Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of fundamentalism that someone won't mistake for the real thing.
twilight_sprinkle: But efficient. :3
Trolling them is just doing the same thing they did..
epic soundtrack
sending sprunkls to their HQ
Whoa.
That would be the SMART thing to do. I am not known for that. AJIsAwesome
brb dinner
MASF123, love and tolerate is the brony tradition.
I Would Annoy the troll
You would be as bad as them if you stooped to trolling them
Dat Dragon.
Yeah but 3/4 don't follow it.
MSF123: To counter a troll, ignore them. To counter-troll a troll, be oblivious to their trolling no matter what but don't react directly, till the extreme
Don't google Bad Dragon!
but its an awesome store!!!
/me googles it
grond
Who he is, mostly
GAH-BWAH-BWAAAAAGH
Oh... my.
Yeah, the movie
Iwa....Press TAB on MAS to get my name faster.
/me faints
It's not out here yet :|
poe's law also makes it easy, to "pretend to have been kidding the whole time"
Iwa, that sounds like a good policy.
It works for any other member too.
Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw!
Ya bloody ponehs!
I have a question, what can knock out your conenction to the internet?
Bonk.
Today my internet seems to die randomly
Lol. Bink.
COOL
Bonk
dat nick lel
I'm not even winded.
"Turbo" refers to a racing game main charcter in the movie whom always had attention. When a new racing game popped up and gathered all the children who where visting the arcade, Turbo became jelous. He left his game during the night and entered the new game, and tryed to take it over.

SpadeMagnes[School, what lies between your computer and the internet in general?
MASF123: i aint even mad + :) = u mad
Did you try the modum?
im for one furious, watch me break these cuffs!
Daw, look, having failed at stream trolling, they're gonna try chat trolling. So cute! :3
cachi01: ... it's getting late isn't it?
Kandarihu: I'd have to ask my dad... maybe something wrong with it
because the modum is the thing that controls the internet
They've been through such hell for this sword and warrior.
And Jack just...
Denies.
Eli: indeed
Hello everybody.
I so ain't even mad, I don't even want U to get mad, chill in channel, enjoy the show, hava muffin.
cachi01: we've all stopped to make sense
hey Meanwhile
Ooh, Jamurai Sack.
However, his interferance made the new game seem broken, and his absense from his own game deemed that one broken too. Both him and thouse two games where unplugged and removed.
And what do you mean whats between my computer and the internet?
DENIED
wow
thats kinda shitty
That was anti-climatic
Eli: when did we started?

All his life dreams...shattered in one blow :(

Raw deal for them.
wow jack

cmon guys you can do better
She wears no clothes
Syslvester Stallone is jealous of that face cleft.
honor integrity personal courage :D
reese witherspoon chin
jack is going to get some plant god
Mishia: A lotus-eater, basically?
What is the speed of a unladen swallow
oh hai Celestia
To pop caps in Aku
Its not really a spoiler, since its just the orgin of a word that is used quite a bit.
celestia
Pretty lady :3
this is kinda creepy...
Penis grab....
SpadeMagnes[School: 42
Aku be trolling here
Jack used Misdirection
SpadeMagnes[School: African or european swallow?
Siren uses Seduction
Celestia or Molestia guys
Nourishment....
"nourishment"
DoctoDoctorWho: I dont know that!
nourishment = sex
P0N-3: Neither.
You deserve to cheat on your diet for once.
molestia
More like Chrysalis PON-3
aaaand its all made of thorns
is that Celestia VA? 0_o
He is dreaming
Passed out
"Nourishment" Is the same thing Chrysalis wanted
this all sounds too good to be true
Jack's Wet Dreams
/me invisible force chucks SpadeMagnes[School off a cliff
c'mon jack. yolo
Agreed, Eli.
It's so easy to imagine a Samurai Jack / pony crossover now.
And there, her logic went total bull...:P
P0N-3: Done allready
totally bangable
She keeps calling him "young servant"
/me is relaxed
Aw.
Norishment? The gods pleasures and land bring only distraction to the mortals who accept it.....and the food is useless to the mortals whom consume it.
Tovler: Lol.
CELESTIA\
samurai jack as pony XD
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
How many nicks you got Rose`?
way too good. i call fake
Yeah but I mean using canonical material, Spademages[school.
^
fr4nky1: Been done.

This is so Chrysalis
Hi, IshPonyPonyThePony. :)

/me is relaxed
DAH
Eeyup. EVIL.
"How would you like to come to Equestria, Jack?"
EVIL? EVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL!
EEK

pstd brought on by rainbow factory
Welp.

Clingy
EVIL?!
hentai
Poison Ivy?
I have reason to believe the hacker may be from Columbus Ohio
stay, whats the worst that could happen
EEEEEEVIIIILLLL!!!!!
When did you get here?
raep
Poison Ivy much
The creatures that offer mortals' a gods plesure desire only to have compony, and have no ally.
just saying http://derpy.me/cdUMH
seen enought hentai to know where that was going
She just lets him go?
The hell?
See? Chrysalis.
Well then...
Sooo- er Somedaaaaay
Great episode
Maybe lonely Celestia.
SpadeMagnes[School: she's not so bad i guess...
so awesome
She let him rest.
stay she said, itll be relaxing she said
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: lol
>Molestia
SpadeMagnes[School: As a test?
It was!
Was that really Celestia?
Jack was tired, it was the only reason he'd agree to rest.
Nah
Celestia's cameo.
StupidSexyCJ: We'll share a drink, have a few laaughs...
was that nicole?
Doubt it, DerpyMuffins.
HUMANIZED CELESTIA
Goddess of the sun became lonely. The lone samurai spurned her company, and the only other sentient creatures were ponies...
DerpyMuffins, no.
Celestia was the voice of that purple dog?
As soon as he was rested, his destiny yanked him back.
Did this show ever have a conclusive ending? Didnt it just end apprubtly?
no, it wasnt nicole oliver
Kandarihu http://derpy.me/cdUMH
OMG Cant stop laughing
Ahcoo!. god bless you
ohai regulars
seems close to me
DerpyMuffins: nope. wont stop us from seeing the stunning similarity though B)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, lol
Aku is voiced by Mako the guy who voices Iroh in Avatar
Jack vs The Undead?
He ran out of there with renewed energy. I'd say that's what a good rest does.
this intro is just fabulous
Aku is a coward.
This was the Spring fairy's VA http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0217221/
/me blows his mane out of the way, fhoo.
R.I.P Mako
HA TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Who voiced Jack anyway?
They need to get the guy who voices the new Splinter in TNMT
http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTBEcAFVoTyr41U8O8_XOIIHprkm4Vfu1jGNUcpqsbmf24t3YYZThOti1A_
Aku knows Jack can defeat him.
SpadeMagnes[School: Phill LaMarr
I have potentially important information regarding the hacking
ok
Zacklego: dont think that's jack. is insignia is different
OH THIS ONE.
Erm.... The creatures that was based on is a lonley spirit which can only provide god's pleasures, and hopes to keep the compony untill they perish. The food they give provides the nurishment to survive, but is a drug that causes time to become worthless to the one who eats it, and the person will happily engage in pleasure.
Is there a new TMNT?
Da mafia.
The SOurce of Wtaer episode?
P0N-3: hes a pussy. he sends his enemnies away

I remember watching this show with my dad when I was young. I miss the good ol' days
P0N-3: For realz?
Yup.
05but one could argue that many close friends increases the chance for one of them being an idiot
http://www.livescience.com/6769-live-longer-friends.html
I think heavy accidentally granted a murder wish
05and that one idiot may be the one casuing your death in a car crash or otehr stupid shit
However, why don't they show them in animated action shows? that would really be interesting
Kipkat07_USAF: Not sure if you had a better youth, or I did watching Dragonball with my dad...:P

Yet GAK is everywhere.
00,10but they have them all the time dureing other shows
True wonder why
You're right.
That... doesnt make sense....
they had the cadence or was that after the show?
Sumica its because capitalism is bad
or before?
dat hair
Maybe because the show itself may be an advertisement....
00,10they advertised the hell out of the talking princess candace toy
I mean it makes me want to buy them....
Big birdy.
I saw a pony pack in a magasign, but I was embarased to ask my parents for them

They'll be able to find someone who isn't half bad, hopefully.
It's like the Shogun units from RA3
And thus Symbiotic Titan was born
This is why we could never beat future japan........
CHICKS DIG GIANT ROBOTS

It's Gozirra! Run!

Stone sounds
Nyst, DBZ does it better. 10 minutes of guys hovering in midair and screaming at the top of their lungs = epic
sounds like stone
But Lyra, if I lived by your advice, I'd have 80 children by now

Shotgun shells the size of vw beetles
And to think.....this is set 5000 years after Adventure time
and stone shogun gives no fucks
'curses, the controller has run out of power'
the casings are doing more damage then guns
and to think, adventure time is a terrible show
<.<

Hevay_Ballerina, why would I give out something bad?

I have to ask, what do you guys think of some people working on black friday? Because some dumbass woman in the paper I read is trying to get a petition to get retailers to close on Black friday
yes
I am validated by this response! c:
i like it
Spade: The issue is people working on Thanksgiving
otakon: Will do.
i buy shit
SpadeMagnes[School: someone has to
Or rather employers forcing people to work on Thanksgiving.
hee. >_> :> c_c;
I went to some like
Some one has to work, and you arent working the whole day
Let them end the foolish ones.
Black Friday midnight madness things
SpadeMagnes[School, fuck that lady. Last year for black Friday I got an HP printer for 20 bucks an an 8Gb jump drive for like 9 bucks
otakon: how bout Kip x HAL 9000?
The mall was opened at midnight
i buy martinis with apples in them
Buytoast agree
It wasn't some rush of people trying to get stuff
And they can easily be replaced...
it was just like this huge party
SpadeMagnes[School, close retailers on Black Friday? That sounds awful.
well crap, I have to do laundry so Ill be back later :|
Just... a bunch of people hanging around at the mall, at midnight
While I got progrssively less lucid.
ikr
This song is long... Oh my
00,02otakon, so you needed help with something or was it sorted?
This sounds like some of that Japanese cartoon music they play in them girly shows.
This needs some MURIKAN rock and roll.
And trumpets flourishing in the name of Uncle Sam and his glorious beard.
Needs more Swedish death metal.

Fun Fact: Kip likes cats and actually named his profile after a cat that he once had
OTAKON X RAINBOWS

SaxyPretender: and which fighting game was the most dissapointing to you?
otakon: yeppers
hey guys
O_o
longest song EVER
0,14that I've owned or that I've played?
Hey guys. Didn't know we were using Mips again.
hey FlutterMEDIC
THIS SONG MAKES MY EYES HURT
otakon: Nah I bet theres one longer
60% finished
is this Pendulum?
yep
well, was
SaxyPretender: one that you were "OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME" and then after you played it, from either owning or playing, you flipped a table or got real down
welp, still on Sequense 6 of Assassin's Creed 3. SO MUCH SHIT TO DO
IM DONE FINALLY
I DID IT
done what?
yay
Bronysith: friends did that with MVC3
0,14hmm, I guess Blazblue Continuum Shift 2 was the one that didn't quite live up to the hype
FlutterMEDIC: bah don't worry the later chapters are empty and frustrating as hell I hope you didn't buy that game for your own sake
I MADE ALL THE MLP SONG 12 BIT OR WHAT EVER ITS CALLED
SON GS
>:I
lol 12 bit?
that doesn't exist
i think u mean 8 or 16 :P
Shizuka check again
/me is really picky about chiptunes
and it's called chiptunes
Oh, I heard MandoBrony will be in the season finale!
OSOSO\
otakon: i didnt buy for my sake, bought because HOLY HELL IS IT FUN
GSXCC is cancer
SaxyPretender: and which tekken game is your fav?
I could simulate this game. All I need are some shrooms
FlutterMEDIC: well have fun with the lackluster and aggravating as hell optional objectives of the later chapters
lol
If you like tekken >.>
0,14none, I'm not a Tekken guy
bronyhaters are like 6 year olds
So are bronies.
Which is rather ironic.
snap
Smash Brothers is teh best
pinkiebrony: Care to explain?
Haters and bronies are all age
otakon: dont worry, got a guidebook here to help me with them
wish i knew the name of this one too :|
I could simulate this game. All I need is a concrete form and all the Home Depot spraypaint.
i meant 4chan
FlutterMEDIC: seriously you should have rented it, I nearly got 100% in only 30 hours and that's bc I didn't want to replay one mission since I played through it at like 3 am
Oohh...
SaxyPretender: typical grouping in UMvC3? who you use most?
pinkiebrony, you are aware that there's a pony board in 4chan
0,14my team for UMvC3 is Hulk/Task/Skrull
right?
lol oh this
first time i got a stealth on party with pinkie damn hard, had to change my mouse sensitivity
episode 3
otakon: 'course, this is my first AC game too
123 123 123
but its full of CLOPPERS
i hope itll be wirht the weight!
To stop a gaben
pinkiebrony, and?
FlutterMEDIC: you would have been better with AC2, the best game in the series if you ask me
gagagagagagaben
otakon: course, that is your opinion
I sort of want MvC2 for the Dreamcast but it's really expensive
meh i got nothing else
The Xbox version is cheaper (whenever I see that used whcih is like never) but apparently less accurate?
FlutterMEDIC: plus it's cheaper, but goddamn the Naval battles of AC3 are awesome. Seriously if you really like AC3 so much, pick up AC2 when you can
0,14wait, is this toohoo musics?
SaxyPretender: and finally, favorite sandwich?
Mesh, isn't there a re-release of that in 360 PS3?
sounds like is SaxyPretender
Hey guys guess what I saw in a toy magazine?
SaxyPretender, yes
TOOHOO?!
otakon: i know, the naval battles are FUCKING AWESOME
Crystal: Probably, except I have a Dreamcast and an original Xbox.
What, Spade?
A Sega Genesis with 80 games
song so long
and neither a 360 nor a ps3
:O
0,14all sandwiches that don't involve mortadella are good
Mesh, what a predicament
wait, is this still the same song?
yes'
Yup
what does the tn next to the plus mean?
i went and made a sandwich and a cup of tea
damn
long song
Mesh: It was on PS2, so it might be on Xbox, too
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEW
What?
I think I heard the PS2 port was bad? idk
SPAAAAAACE!
otakon: there was this one side quest that fried my mind, not from frustration, but from sheer WAT
so slow
Like 20 minutes
i mean long
Idk, I had the PS2 version and it was okay
And no real desire to own a 360 or PS3 since they sound sort of useless without XBLA or PSN accounts, also I hear you basically need HD TVs for them, and I donm't really want an HD TV
huh
wha?
Yes.
Yes I do.
Hey, I have a theroy for the hacker/s! It might be bronies who wanted revenge for that meme that must not be named!
You ever try playing Skyrim on a small tv? god near impossible
otakon: that side quest involved a certain horseman
FlutterMEDIC: yeah well it gets worse. The penultimate mission suffers from horrible glitches and randomness to get the optional objectives. I had to replay it over 20 times before I got it 100%
Mesh: not really true. they come with composite cables
Yeahyeahyeh!
Whoa
FlutterMEDIC: bah that was easy
Blaze: Your theory is bad. Shush.
you're thoery is wrong Blaze
Okay....
I feel like I would die if I tried playing this game.
Why do PC versions of games always seem better?
otakon: no, i mean the outcome of it was surprising
/me sits in the corner
shot down
thoery is so wrong
Blaze, theyre just tools, best to ignore and move on
SpadeMagnes[School: more buttons
FlutterMEDIC: oh
otakon: i mean, i NEVER expected the Headless Horseman to be there
Bronysith: Mods?
Got it.
:)
FlutterMEDIC: oh yeah me neither actually
shot down like a triplane vs a SAM missile
SpadeMagnes[School: because you spend more on hardware, more buttons, more accuracy if you go with mouse and keyboard
almost doooone
and it looks better
Also Mods add shit
otakon: made me go full WAT
^^
SpadeMagnes[School: and also games are designed on the computer, but doesnt matter how a game looks, it is how it plays
mods too
Dude.
Waiter at the restaurant today called me "young man"
I'm pretty sure I was older than him.
song over YAY ALMOST THERE
FlutterMEDIC: how about the reveal at the end of the prologue?
Mesh: lol
Uhoh did Shazooka hit a gray block?
otakon: that made me go HOLYSHITWTFBBQJOPHFAL:KSJAOPIHGF
FlutterMEDIC: yeah me too basically
Hey cousin lets go bowling!
SpadeMagnes[School: die
FlutterMEDIC: didn't see it coming and they never really explain it either on WHY they were able to do that stuff.

SpadeMagnes[School: sorry Roman, Im too busy getting shot
Pootis
another time, maybe?
I SLAPPED THAT MARTINI OUT OF THIS HAND

otakon: possibly for their own goals? rejection of the old ways?
FlutterMEDIC: also, if you want to make a LOT of money, ship Beaver pelts out on the convoys.
I had a dream last night that the mods took me and made me a mod. Best dream ever.

Now that I have gotten my degree in Marine Biology, I can now start to do some pony projects, perhaps a game. I came here for suggestions. Any game I should ponify?
so the little finger is called a pinky in US but pinkie in UK?
I have no use for my time, so pony is now my priority
here's an idea
Ello
don't ponify anything
If not for that grey
i thought you didn't like ninja mono shizu
and make something original
i wonder if the guy who uploaded swaggity swag was the one of the guys who did the hack
Okay, how about an RPG?
moment
team up with a genetic engineer to create a real-life sea pony.
KrazyNoobs, I'd like to see Grand Theft Auto IV ponified.
KrazyNoobs: dont listen to him,ponify something if you want to, many bronies would probably enjoy it
Okay, I'd rather do an RPG.
WHere you level up and get stronger. Thanks guise!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I am coming for you
Any ideas for a battle system? I want to make it complex.
:p
0,14oh snap
0,14it's on
but also to give chat something new
0,14like Donkey Kong
as i've never played any of these on ninja
KrazyNoobs: well thinking up a rpg system will take some time
Should I do a ponified Pokemon?
make the enemies attack you in sync with the music's beats
if you do that
KrazyNoobs: theres already a ponified pokemon game
i'll forgive you for ponifyin something
Dayum.
Shizupony is best Shizupony
Watching the game in negative like this makes me want to go snowboarding
Ponified legend of zelda?
because nothing is cooler shit than watching enemies dance and boogie to the fight theme
bass
/me 's ears melt from the bass
Link would be a donkey, with the long ears no?
I am coming up with ideas, I'll be back in a moment.
Have any of you played Mario RPG, such as Partners in Time, Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga or Bowser's Inside Story? I ponified verson of that would be epic and amazing! :D
Ow
Kurra: A donkey? really? IDK :I and Epona would remain unchanged XD maybe with a carrot for a cutie mark though lol
You know what would be nice? Lets all play Mario hotel
never been a fan of mario game personally
NO
KrazyNoobs: All three of em
KrazyNoobs: that would be cool
don't you dare defile the handheld mario and luigi RPGS
i swear
haha
Epona would have to be like, a giant Hercules beetle or something really unbelievable
I never really played Mario O.o
Defile? No, it will not BE them, it will be like them, with fun battle systems.
as long as you don't touch the games or anything they contain
To tell you the truth, only Earthbound and Mario RPG have ever sucked in hours and hours of my time with gameplay. If I can ponify them, bronies that have played them will find it exciting.
well if i ever decide to defile i game, i now know what to lel
COOL
Kurra: lol she can be a giant venomous moth
NO
boy, this makes me livid
??
It already has been thought up of. Ponified Earthbound, anyone?
Buytoast: The song or the pic?
/me melts from the bass
that picture
guys, you found Buytoast's ticker
the song aint too bad
Ikr? THe bass is great :D
that... sucked...
D:
but i can do better...
oni_link|laundry: magnificent :>
Shizuka: just remember that no matter what, you cant do worse than me
some of the songs by midnight syndicate are awesome in audiosurf shizu you should try them :p
Yeah, I'll just create something original. Thanks everypony!
there ya go
O__O
An RPG, but the only thing I will copy is the battle system: I will do something sort of like the Mario RPG games.
that's just horrifying
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcWJcbMLSWo

I was wondering why Shizuka would show that O_o
bunch of little 12yo's that weren't hit hard enough as kids
then it hit me
omg.. STOP PUTTING DOWNLOAD LINKS
o3o
kirzstryfe: You gotta pay other people to beat your kids
I like the first vid they hijacked us with better, lol
im getting sick of this crap
That was a HiJack NOW?
eh, theyre only messing around, its not like theyve done anything terribly unforgivale
Dafuq?
RaveBrony: what was the name of that song anyways?
11,02Restream of the early morning show?
*Looks away from the stream* Oh is that another hijack? LimeV again I suppose
Wait wat?
XylemTube: Look up Swiggity Swag on youtube
And thats why I don't watch the live eps :I
Do these people not realize that if stream ever gets interrupted, we just start drawing/making music/remixing stuff/creating FiW stuff? :p
oh lol found the hack in this morning's episode
00,10Nice of them to fall for it
hoodi pls, todays the first time it happened
Mwahahah! youre going to love me!
??
sumica so you tracked them then?
evening everypony
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, but two times in a day?
you cant stop hiJack, hes a samurai
Hello there PrincessLuna
00,10no just wanted to see if they could still do it
But you can backtrace him, right?
Gettin a little worrisome
so wait, that was or wasn't a counter hack?
hiya AdamTheDuck
mica trolol
/me is so glad he can go places where hijacking is impossible
Oi PrincessLuna
HoodyNinja they can only do it with mips though
sumica: Have they been constantly trying to today? O.o
bronystate hacked?
*Hijacked
hello HoodyNinja
Not hacked
Oh boy
refresh
im sorry but i still cant get over how good Cheer On was, ive had more respect for reading
bluestroms1 - nah. the stream was hijacked. the website itself wasn't
JRP2234, did you seriously just wake up at 17:00 in the afternoon?
ahh
mrow
no
I was too busy raging at the lack of Derpy to notice the hacking or the Dr. Who/Hooves reference

i forgot to cahnge me nick

0,14ShiningDawn, settle down.
Dont let it rustle your jimmies
im joking
00,10just relax

oi
I think i'm going biking tomorrow
13settle down
http://lolerstream.com/ hijacked the stream guys
A decent number of people didn't notice since they can't tell Derpy and Cloud Kicker apart.
Kurra: Do you have a route, or just go as you would?
http://derpy.me/mKxWn
Herostar_Returned: what do you mean? did something happen?
lolerstream spam dont seem legit
So they decide to hijack again when its 1 AM when its just the regulars here don't give a dang. Sure during the new ep it was one thing since it was packed and more people would freak out, but we know better
I'd randomly go.
so why are we freaking out about this?
13refresh and hit play
Errizaria, yay immune to internets out there! :D
I did that twice
so i heard they got us again
Oh there it go
ad
There we go
ADBLOCK Y U AD ME
Hmm. something musta been happening. whether it was the lovable mods getting a laugh or an actual breach is my question..
I ain't freaking out I just think its funny that they try it again so late
Kurra: Indeed, hehe
what's wrong?
so anyway back to the music please
J_E_Smith71: Ikr?
hijacking here is like... interrupting a restock to a single Wal*Mart. Once.
13they revealed their attack vector and are now useless
What n00bs
No more Mips?
heheh
hello
but the word vector sounds frightful and threatening
vector polynomials
It's still an issue. and I'm looking up programs to either prevent, or severely counterhack the hacker's system. Even if I'm not the direct streamer, if they can steal a stream, I can steal their IP from it.
It is a word that is evil in both depth and meaning
cosplay or a disturbing image? http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x339/AlexeiStukov/Ponyman.jpg
vector algebra, may it burn
I love vector algebra
you aint batman son
ponyman: Both
Way less disturbing when the colors aren't messed with
vector calc is horrible
"shurg"...
well yeah, i mean vector calc
wait, shizuka plays C&C?
don't go all gung ho vigilante because some chucklefucks are gettin their jollies riling you up
i meant vector math, may it burn
tell her to marry me.

Buytoast! you dont understand! theyve rustled that persons jimmies!
Lol!

Shizuka...wat?
Haha
That's a burn
wait, what?
Rose` - my jimmies remain unrustled
Shizuka: OOOOOOOOH GENTLEMAN BURN

0,14you know, something I'll always like about animu fightan gaems, is that they never have conventional "round 1, fight" type of sayings

13I FOUND IT
/me slaps SaxyPretender around a bit with a large trout
13mips is weak
Hows mips week shizuka?
13but mips is confirmed the weak link in the chain, bronystate is secure as ever
oh
Shizuka - so was this a "hack" or just social engineering?
Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: actually... now that I watch that video, I think every day is a good day when I draw. :o c:

13no, mips exposes the stream key

13one of which is associated with the channel and i'm sure you can easily search for it

What was the appeal for using mips as oppsed to another stream service?
13mips autostarts when someone starts broadcasting
And this is why that the GNAA needs to be booted offline for the whole year and they need to be banned cause i want them to be gone forever so just saying though
13eh tbf this is a pretty glaring hole in mips security
13so we just don't use them anymore, problem solved
Awww. I liked Mips, they had a cool name.
works for me
Did gnaa take responsibility? Why did it say it was from /v
13basic tactics
13aka framing
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me09s0xDeR1r6eu2fo1_250.gif
Easier to blame it on someone else than to take the blame yourself
like when 4chan used to blame ebaums
trying to ignite a war possibly
ponyman: O_O
Shizuka: Wait a sec so that hijack just now wasn't them, it was you guys just running a security check?
Sweetie Belle drinking a milkshake, aaaah I'll never live to see 35
13no it was a hijack, a couple twits stumbled into a kline bragging about it
13mips is hijacked simply by starting a broadcast to it while another is active
13limev is not
Oh shizuka i read some of the stuff on GNAA on google it said GNAA the ipads or something and it said something else to so i read most of the parts of what it said in there
so wait, was shizumobile a legitimate login earlier then?
GNAA released info on people who preordered the iPad I think
i thought i saw SuperBrony64 -b it
I would hesitate even to read google caches of that site
13yes
13shizumobile is my phone
+b*, pardon
13that's why it gets autoopped
ah, just looked back at the chat log
sb64 +b'd someone and your phone /quit'd at the same time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4mEc_6JQ8
And while i was looking at the GNAA stuff on google i was fliping off the website with my middle finger and i said screw you GNAA i hate you so bad now so yeah
the hell is GNAA
its racist.
Moopy you don't have to hate, just vote! *winning smile*
I can't say here
go look it up on google
yeah, google is your friend
Moopy: Best not to let it get to you, then they win.
just dont go to their site thegt90
But...............but
also, don't even go look it up, honestly your mind doesn't need to even see something of so little value
i like mips tv better...........awww sad face:(
0,14so to get people's minds off things, have some music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-_n8jbTDDg
found a link to encyclopedia dramatica clicking it
no reason to hate gnaa, if anything it's pity that I look at them with, because that foul of an attitude will only poison their own life in the end
thegt90 - make sure you at least put on a hard hat before you do
According to wiki, they are an antil blogging trolling orgranization

Kurra - allow me
LOOK! a shiny!
[SWAG]Haku: Yeah but Shizuka discovered it's a problem with Mips that makes it easy to steal the stream, so we're sticking with LimeV from now on
The only whos I know are the ones with a PhD
So did i miss anything when i wasn't on here when i was on my xbox elite with my friends?

13we have now patched that hole on our end by removing mips embeds
We should send them some lover and tollerance lol

or you will anywayas
So who won the lottery?
who the fuck is gnaa?
im sure mips knows.

i work help desk at my job. i would much rather be told multiple times "X is broken," even if we already knew that.

Maybe MIPS will co-credit us and the um, other website!
/me is listening to Pareidolia
I liked how the stream can just come up and even if I'm not watching at first, I know it and am called to attention.
13we're going to give veemi a try
Kandarihu: wut?
13not sure if it autostarts or not
So it was freakin /v/ U MAD guy huh?...............i should've known God dang it /v/ U MAD guy why in the hell did you do that to mips huh? why?
Haha, backfire - we'll be together FOREVER, united in recognition for making MIPS more secure :D
/me is just a lonely zombie in this hallway
/me wishes he could eat some brains
13Moopy: it wasn't /v/, gnaa was framing /v/ hoping to incite cross community attacks
Shizuka: I'm sure you'll check if there's the same security problem with that?
implying that we ever actively go on the attack anymore
13already did
How did gnaa get caught then?
13limev and veemi both do not expose the keys
MirrorImage: We don't?
LimeV requires each person to click the play button manually.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNtxkmFpWWk
13right which is a downside
Kandarihu: Ogod, we just lost half our people

Not real sure what I can say about that
hmm
One Day
one day, Ill end it
has bstate been attacked before by other groups?
13someone tried to organize a DDOS at the season finale
13it fizzled beautifully
One day, one day very soon
13they were all excited OMG WE HAVE THEIR IPS FIRE YOUR LOICS
Punkie_Pue - DDOS, streamjacks, etc. it comes and goes
*SIGH* oh well i guess im going to miss mips tv for the whole year huh?
DDOSes are basically retards with money
rofl
13except they had cloudflare's IP, who waves off DDOS like a flea
woooow...
cloudflare being the hosting company?
someone actually paid 8k for that?
13cloudflare is a free DNS service that puts a CDN cache between the domain and your server
13cloudflare is the reason our saturday bill doesn't run into the hundreds
yep
its extremely rare
J_E_Smith71: What happened?
Is GBP the currency in Canada too?
welp back from BL3
I know about the random trolls but do people really hate us that badly?
bl2*
Punkie_Pue - believe that was another DDOS. the stream that day was just general crap
Punkie_Pue: Site was hacked
basically everyone is bored to the point, they just want to cause some chaos >.>
Hmm, by watching episodes on the Hub, I seem to be missing some interesting attacks by morons
thelonepony: The greatest game evah made
Dat1FuglyMuffin - that's why i tend to keep the stream on my computer as well, but muted
no
i get to watch the chat reactions, but i'm watching it live and uninterrupted on my tv
k, there was a MLP: the franchise reference but there was a furries reference in the newest Rifftrax.
I just record the shows and sleep till noon :3
Can someone tell me which movies won the lottery?

I'll have to buy some Air Force Ones before Friday
Funny thing is, they probably arent!
MirrorImage just bronies trying to love and tolerate the haters
I support it
sumica: not really, they're just people that have nothing to do in their life but waste oxygen and screw around other people's business
I might be the only person I know who's exited for the elder scrolls mmo...
but heres something I dont get
00,10no I was looking at there page and steam group.
00,10it's sad
well, think its time I head to bed

HoodyNinja: When does that come out, anyways?
sumica - NGAA?
night
What steam group? I know of about 12 that don't like bronies
00,10there idea of an even is a few eps of burnnotice
see you laters :)
MPAA?
Dat1FuglyMuffin: 2013 I think
or whatever the abbreviation was
Haters say they hate bronies because A) we're everywhere B) we dont shut up about what we love C)Wereall a bunch of weirdos. Sounds like the typical description of internet trolls and haters, so why is it that they arent being as hated as us?
00,10no the clowns pretending to be NGAA
Im just going to listen some luna republic music on youtube for a little bit to calm down my anger stuff
Ive always windered that
HoodyNinja: i wish i had a good pc to run it ;3;
lame
whereas brony allows for a very direct attack
[SWAG]Haku: B and C are kinda justified to a point
[SWAG]Haku: scratch that B
Not really
Darkts3|Trader|Snipe - ehhh... yeah, can't agree with you on C, and we've gotten much much better about B recently
Some of us worse than others
MirrorImage: ya thats why i took back C
mainly B there son
[SWAG]Haku: A) Wondered and B) No one hates them, we just feel sorry for them
Most bronies, from what Ive seen, arent the ones who spew out "Ponies ROCK" at every youtube video
^
there are some tho
now that's not to say we don't run around with MLP avatars...
You mean ponyfags?
Those bronies are the minority in our community
No one likes them :I
And they annoy even me sometime
and dont care question ponies to that type of brony either
I Say we call these Bronies a new name, since a lot of them, from Ive also seen, are also trolls

Howdy everypony
Night Derpy_Hooves
night Derpy_Hooves
Hey guys i have a question to ask here: on my paint program thing here is it hard to draw a pony with paint stuff?
My area sucks because 1. No bronies around. Period. 2. No toys R Us'es around.
It won't, if you're looking for it in a store for children
Same here Zacklego
Zacklego, ebay
Zacklego: same here
Had to convert some of my friends so Im not alone
11,02Spell-of-Gaming: No :/
Moopy What program?
paint program
Now I feel bad for living 30 mins away from a toys r us
lol
/me hugs HoodyNinja
why's that HoodyNinja?
Also, make your own bronies
I tried to convert friends but they are one or two seasons behind
its okay :I
Superbrony...........sup
and they dont go to mlb
;3;*
and THEY DONT F*CKING DO ANYTHING WITH BRONIES!
bummer
Zacklego: give them time
Don't forcefully convert people.
Jesus.
^ dont force it, thats just annoying
^
All I did was show a few people the show :I
Zacklego - let's be fair here. how many of us are really here "for the ponies" as much as we are "for the community?"
I gave them a year and they asked me a week ago if i saw cupcakes.
Its why people dont like us
13let them come on their own
if they dont like it, just be cool about it
0,14^
^^
0,14's what I do
Everybody here has seen cupcakes..
BAD WORDS
O_o
0,14heck, I don't even force people to watch it
i did
13i'd seen pony references for a few months but never looked into it, figured it was the latest internet fad that would move on
I like cupcakes... delicious
...
Zacklego: I havn't and I won't
Zacklego: everytime you try and force conversion, you let the haters win
Um...
13took bronystate's weekday streams to convince me to stay
0,14dem old days of TNG and SG-1
Then they took you as a mod because you
Glad you stayed Shizuka
you're awesoem*
"Ahhh.... good times, goood times."
Transformers
awesome*
Nobody really gives a buck around me because they dont know about bronies. So atleast I'm safe from haters.
Took the 1st 3 episodes to turn me into a brony. Just got curious about this whole Brony thing, decided to see what it was about, and now I laugh about it
13HoodyNinja: cause i about singlehandedly built the site in a month? a bit
oh, speaking of good times, evidently the Hub is getting Animaniacs!
FUCK YEAH
what
WHAT
CHILDHOOD
My friend from Highschool showed me this show
OH MY FUCKING GOD YES
SERIOUS?
13i should do another this year
OMG ANIMANIACS
I started watching the show ecuz i saw silly vids and the songs from s1. After i feared that I was all alone when it came to watching mlp.
THE HUB JUST 20% COOLER
Spell-of-Gaming - i think i am... i don't recall where i heard that particular rumor
MirrorImage, source, dont joke about this
Ow! My childhood has been incapacitated!
I was wondering why he liked it
MirrorImage: they're having a marathon of animaniacs on december 24 for 4 hours....
/me cringes that he made a 20% cooler joke
DeathStar: :O
Oh boy
Awwww. If they are doing another animaniacs. Remake the countries song because it is so outdated.
ah, i think i StumbledUpon'd the link a few days ago
http://www.nickandmore.com/2012/11/21/animaniacs-joins-the-hub-this-december/
it should be streamed here for those of us who are hubless
I made a vow to try anything once, then I discovered MLP... the rest is history
mornin' everypony
hint hint
13animaniacs is large enough for syndication that i know of
hey SirGanjalf
Hi SirGanjalf :)
13which is what mlp is aiming at with the shorter season
I tried Littlest Pet Shop. Wasn't bad.
Everytime you make a pony joke, someone vanishes from the mortal coil.
My friends dispise animaniacs because it is too mainstreem
Animainiacs = The MLP FiM of the 90's
Eh, LPS is alright, nothing imma follow though
Shizuka - regardless, the Hub is basically becoming a better Boomerang at this point
lolwut
And yet they dont know about bronies.....
Boomerang has Teen Titans and Ben 10
13that's good
No network is better
it's just dropkicking us all right in the nostalgia, and all we can do is "Can i have another? I NEED ANOTHER"
Right now, at least
13boomerang made me horribly depressed putting dexters lab in the lineup
"GIVE ME MORE"
131997 IS NOT OLD CARTOONS
Boomerang makes me feel super old...
in retrospect, Dexter's Lab is rather meh...
Kinda is
Boomerang was a good idea, but Ive out grown alot of the shows from my childhood
i liked dexter
wait, they have Dexter's Lab on there now?
Except some
MirrorImage, lies!
Dexters lab is amazing, but it's mostly the same.
i thought Boomerang was for shit like Yogi bear
and el kabong
13Buytoast: they did some years ago when we still had satellite
Buytoast - i've seen Cow and Chicken on there as well
13quick draw mcgraw!
"Dee dee you are stupid" *dee dee proceeds to fuck shit up*
DRAW BOB ROSS
hang on, let me pull up the channel guide and see what kind of stuff they're showing now
Shizuka, and to all of the bronystate fans, I've been an everyday viewer to this stream since july 2011 and if there's one thing that I keeps me comeback here is that bronystate is vibrant and dynamic always growing. I've seen people come in, get familiar and become admins themselves I remember when you Shizuka were just a normal viewing same with SuperBrony64 you guys and your devotion to this place to keep it alive and en
I used to hate bommerang, becuz it had 'old' shows.... ow i love becuz it has my fav old shows :'(
13yeah dexter, cow and chicken, and johnny bravo all launched at the same time in 97
O_O
oh hey... my tv was on BBC and Dr. Who is on...
I liked Cow and Chicken but it started getting weird
Hey I was born in 1997.
/me huggles bluestroms1
Ahaha just kidding, 1987.
dat loving textwall
Boomerang turned into my childhood this year
... I encounter a lot of people online that would've been born in 1997.
11,02How does this look?
I need to go re-evaluate my life.
Mesh: I was born in that year...
13looks like text
13oh you mean stream
Mesh, 88 /)
is that a pokemon or a goat face ring?
alright, so it's 2am EST right now, and the current Boomerang show lineup is: Dexter's Lab, Secret Saturdays, Samurai Jack, and then it switches back to the old old stuff at 4am
I just searched for mlp wristwatches and found none.
/me was born in '94
oh god what is thaaaaat?!
It's all over.
i think thats suppost to be Haku
SuperBrony64: that dosn't look like me :(
Aw yeah, '94!!
Secret saturdays <3
wow really dude....................really
13MirrorImage: samurai jack? that's even worse... that started in, what, 99?
SuperBrony64: Kirby's origan charecter?
original*
Jonny Quest, Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Flintstones...
SAMURAI JACK IS THE BEST
ooo, Captain Planet at 6am
SuperBrony64: can u give us like a little miiverse tour pls lol
13if anything boomerang is what cartoon network WAS in the late 90s
^
11,02Seems like nopony was here this morning.
13classic warner brothers alongside awesome new animation
Can anybody give me a link to a place that sells mlp wristwatches. I already checked amazon and ebay
SuperBrony64: did you draw that blirby?:D
13sb is drawing again? you must post to dA remember
SuperBrony64: dat drawing :D
Everything about cartoons was great until 2004. Thats when shit started happening on CN, Disney, and Nick.
SuperBrony64: oh you mean that creepy charecter that "troll" showed us? :D
SuperBrony64: if so, thats an awesome drawing :D
[SWAG]Haku - that's about the time they stopped being "Cartoons" and started becoming "Children's Sitcoms"
Eeyup
i
Live action shows about teens and their problems
actually like some of the sitcoms on Disney.
I got enough of that on Nick@Nite
The only good Live action thing disney had was good luck charlie, but even that's gotten old
Just because Waverly Place turned into an exercise of getting things by the censors.
And the censors for that show were basically dead
i mean at least Nickelodeon learned and created the NickToon network, which is much more traditional Nick content
13i'm going to steal cyan's catchphrase and say i'm cautiously optimistic about season five code lyoko adding live action
The only thing I like to watch on CN now is Adventure Time
Anyone remember House of Mouse on disney?
Avatar
i.e., Animated Stuff and Power Rangers
Nickalodeon wins
Shizuka - wait wait wat?
Code Lyoko is still on?
[SWAG]Haku: I DO it was mah fave cartoon
13will be in the next year or so that i know of
Code lyoko is over
That show is still on?
WAHT?
O_o
Code Lyoko is coming out with a ew Season
Holy Globs
That french cg anime is still going?
13they've been building up a season five, replacing the real world segments with live action
I watch Young justice.
with LIVE ACTION
Code Lyoko... Live action... We need to stop this?
NOOOOOOOOO
0,14Hey, Xiaolin Showdown is coming back to
Young Justice is kick ass
13the clips of lyoko look like they're using the same models, added a new sector design
0,14too
by "new season," are we talking a continuation from Season 4, or a whole new story line?
/me drinks some brain bleach
Live action
WUT
all the shows~
I liked Code Lyoko but I wish it had like all be... normal animation.
SaxyPretender: YAY
MirrorImage a few yeasrs after season 4
Because the normal animation parts were rather good looking whereas the CGI stuff did not look at all good.
13MirrorImage: from what i've heard, it's a tacked on new season, so we killed xana at the finale of season 4, but season 5 says SURPRISE NOT REALLY
Mesh - well think about it
Mesh what? The CGI was awesome for a show like that
13Mesh: seasons 2-4 did better with the CG
00,10but but live action shizu
13especially 4
00,10live action
they use CGI for the computer scenes...
13live action aelita might make me look it up once it's out
YE-AH YE-AH YE-AH
I wanted to see a fight this ep...
I would pay so much money
that drawing O_
O_O
MirrorImage: you said hey, whats going on? :)
nyeh
00,10I wonder if they managed to find kids with foreheads like coffee tables
heyn
es bee, there are fillies here :I
I wasn' here yesterday during lottery, what movies were chosen?
Kirby :3
Heheh
dude Code Lyoko was sort of like reboot in retrospect
Hmm?
I did like how dark the series ended up getting !
Coffee Table foreheads
13season 3-4 are the best
...and now i want Hub to get Reboot
I never really followed that show
CG turned me away when I was younger :I
00,10reboot is on netflix
132 was a little pitiful though it crammed through a lot of backstory for aelita
Samurai Jack was never cancelled, its just on hiatus
reboot was ... interesting
reboob
sumica - implying i'm not too cheap to get netflix
moo
Dat moo
131 was all self contained with a couple callbacks and finally an arc on the finale
i wouldnt mind seeing an ... updated reboot, if that makes sense
u liek moo
13reboot is also supposed to be getting something new
(and don't ask - there really is no reason why i haven't gotten netflix yet other than "Youtube")
13feature film in development hell iirc
like more up to date instead of ... 90's-ish
00,10implying I could stream or you know shizu could stream it again
Shizuka - that was called "The Matrix"
still excited over how good cheer on was, somepony calm me down so i can go to bed
Hakus going to bed now
13the teaser didn't look anything like reboot so not sure how connected they'll try to be
Night yall

You only live once?
But either people overuse it, or hipsters trash it too much
You live everyday.

13yolo is the new emo
HoodyNinja: both?

Either way, you can get people to do the dumbest shit in the world
13the fad that all the teens attach to until they graduate high school
13then a new one starts up
Shizu stahp bein a hipster
13seriously notice how fast emo died?
YOLO is too mainstream *sips starbucks*
You Obviously Love Octavia
emo isnt a fad, its a way of life!
Fast?
13it was everywhere but as soon as 2008 hit POOF it disappeared
Who the fuck was ever emo?

/me huggles HoodyNinja ^_^ "yay"
0,14clearly, they're not paying them in enough mountain dew
13AdamTheDuck: chicken
AdamTheDuck: Not as good as pizza
0,14AdamTheDuck, pork
13sumica: oh i know, the universal geek bribe is twinkies, and those just went out of business

I've heard it tastes like spam :$
Spam?
I know that HoodyNinja will betray me :I
0,14except for me, I taste sweet :3
If I were a codemonkey, I would need more cheetos
Yup, good old fashioend Shoulder Prok and "meat".
00,10I thought code monkie like cheatoes and mountain dew
13god no
Shizuka: Just bribe them with Little Debbie's knockoffs then
thelonepony: It's not so much betrayal, more like I just forget to help you

13cheeto dust gets everywhere
Pork*
/me licks SaxyPretender
Ew
13doritos too
You taste like soap
13as good as those are..
Shizuka: it's not universal silly ^_^ we actualy only recently got twinkies in NZ :(
its hot pockets
00,10that's why you dont lick you fingers till it's done shizu
0,14...and now I'm jonesing for doritos
13DeathStar: according to my networking for dummies from 97 it is..
0,14I can feel the flavor on my tongue too >.<
13course i have an A+ cram book from like 96...
00,10hell there is enough dust for like 2 more chetoes on your fingers when you are done
NZ is apparentally late behind the rest of the modern world
Shizuka: well they're wrong :P
Funyons FTW
13yeah but you can't type with cheeto dust, you'll ruin your keyboard
HoodyNinja: :'( meany
^
Shizuka, ^^
DeathStar: Its true, though
Shizuka - that's why you get one of them new-fangled "washable" keyboards
/me remembers when doritos first hit the market
Bugles are clearly best chip
13again doritos too although i'm dainty with those and use like the very tip of the finger to grip
Cheetos have dust?
We dropped my friends laptop the other day, and somehow ended up cleaning it
Still has crumbs in it
13lays stax are good, basically pringles but thicker
00,10I am now picture ing shizu eating doritos with her pinkie up
13when in doubt :3
00,10pinkies out
Classy
0,14Where your curleh mustache at?
13fritos and original bean dip is my munchie of choice :)

StupidSexyCJ: don't say that or they'll make a real mod rainbow and your eyes will never be the same @_@
I love the rainbow text!
13ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE NO MODERATION? *chugs a can of... wait i'm out of drink*

Can we get a restraining order?
replace the alert klaxon you hear when something is getting sapped with a baby's cry

UNDERAGE MICSPAMMERS
The best part of CoD
Wait, this is CoD?
I thought the best part of CoD was the receipt.
hooray for children
HoodyNinja: they are the only part of CoD
RaveBrony: Black Ops 2
"OH MY GOD YOU BITCH"
right, well i'm out for the morning
later folks
Bye MirrorImage.
Meanwhile: No, silly, you don't keep the receipt :3
I always liked the part of CoD where I paid $60 for the same game I bought last year.
latas mirr-fuuuuu
Your fault :I
HoodyNinja: Well it's not like you buy it yourself is it.
inb4 8 year olds yelling NOOOB
Meanwhile: if you keept the receipt then no one would have CoD
Yes, I bought a game I like :I
Hehe, CoD. The ONLY time ive played it, a kid cried on the mic asking me to stop killing him =_=
What about it?
But DeathStar, what about all those 10 year olds?
Then again, ive made kids cry on plenty of other games...
RaveBrony: dayum, das MLG dawg~
RaveBrony: That's not nice.
RaveBrony: You are such a hurtful person. It's fun, isnt it?
RaveBrony: That sounds hilarious without the CoD part.
children are good at crying, help them to reach their full potential
People don't constantly commentate what they're doing on the mic on PC...
Meanwhile: true true.. but they don't buy the game for themselves do they? if there parents cept the recept...
nothin says pro like beatin some kids~
hi
Hayo aniderp
In fact, literally almost no one use the Mic feature on CoD on PC.
twilight_sprinkle: :3
that i've seen
XAX: that sounds lovely
DeathStar: If these parents were attentive enough they wouldn't buy this stuff for their children anyway.
Ohai aniderp
Kids prefer consoles, to be honest.
You dont have time to use the mic on PC, everyone is busy using mods and aimbots, lol
StupidSexyCJ: We yell at eachother with the chat instead lol
Meanwhile: fair point.
Meanwhile, lol ikr
Ive always been a Halo guy, lol
SpeccyRush: its facts
"we got a rambo in here"
rambo
Using a videogame as a babysitter is not a good parenting technique. I see that being used all around me
fact*
I remember playing cod 3 on ps2 and not even knowing about multiplayer
Dettol protects, fact.
Parents don't give a fuck.
I've got CoD1 on my hard drive. somewhere.
Even when bullying.
XAX, /)
Zelda is best babysitter anyway
hoody cod 2 here
AdamTheDuck: eh
HoodyNinja: Them days when CoD was for the campaign.
Dat1FuglyMuffin: :I
Campaign was good in BO1
HoodyNinja: I enjoyed it.
Lol mason has a tulpa.
Skyrim is best babysitter. works for 7 motnhs for jut 60 bucks
I didn't /like/ it but it was better than some I'd seen.
months*
60 bucks for 7 months?
I cant understand a word theyre saying
Lolno
you know that sucks though they freakin took out the raidaition symbole emblem on black ops 2
GG cod player: Protects your care package so you can get it
7 months? Try 7 days.
cachi01: childrens attention spans don't last long enough for Skyrim
radaition symbole
holy shit he let go of his mic button for about 3 seconds there
lel
If you take your time anyway.
MW3 is the greatest example of a bad story.
Never seen anyone else do this
yeah that
Meanwhile: you are talking about main quest? pfft 5 days
7 days if you don't use fast travel.
i mean why did they took it out though?
How about you just actually babysit the kid instead of being a slack arse.
I had way more of an attention span when I was in middle school than I do now.
Jmo: By that logic you call all gamers lonely
lol
How is that even relevant?
My parents played games with me
what kind
My dad would kick my ass in mario party and laugh ;~;
My dad owned me at Unreal Tournament.
oh that kind=(
My father let me play Diablo when i was 4 :3
HoodyNinja: then destroy you in COD and call you a noob?
HoodyNinja: "hey nooooob, dinner's ready"
Me and my mom played through Jak and Daxter together :3
twilight_sprinkle: CoD wasn't big on multiplayer when I was 3
Babysitting the kid does not compute to all gamers being single
me my brother and my sister bonded by killing eachother in spy vs. spy
HoodyNinja: wow 3 huh
twas fun ^_^
Spy vs. Spy PS2 <3
I never had a lonely childhood, and my life revolved around my ps2
Jmo: ikr ^_^

Jaymoo pls, Battlefront 2.
TEAM DEATHMATCH
I had an SNES growing up.
Got a Genesis sometime after I got a PSX.
had Battlefront 2 as well, great game.
SuperBrony64: change match for star and it's the best thing ever
Loved inviting over friends to play it.
I had a PS1... I grew up on Spyro :$
hi :P
HoodyNinja: lawl pls
99% of Nintendo party games break relationships
I didn't actually play a Spyro game till I was 22.
hiiii aniderp :P
RaveBrony: I'm jelly
Had a Nintendo 64 as a kid
DeathStar: Why is that?
as far as console games went I played RPGs pretty exclusively when I was younger.
Sonic and Double Dragon and Kid Chameleon and Boogerman were my childhood
Nintendo 64 is best childhood
RaveBrony: I'v only ever played 5 min on spyro in my live and it was awesome :(
D:
You must play!!
anyway im out bye yall
I know :'(
I wanna!
http://i.imgur.com/cbHxv.jpg
Playin spyro wit mah friend was amazin
I bought something like 40 psx games this year. I was on a business trip and all of our meals were being reimbursed so I basically had 500~ dollars of completely free, disposable income that I wouldn't have otherwise had.
Bye twilight_sprinkle :)
So it was like
Get off work. Go back to the hotel. Walk out to the used game store. Buy whatever. Spend the rest of the night playing Syphon Filter.

Ryunosuke, that's the closest thing we'll get to anything pony-related. http://i.imgur.com/2UN5W.jpg
I saw Club Luna
tbh, ps cant support player icons yet, it will create too much server load and make the servers a bit more unstable as they are now :)
00,10he dose better with the pistol
SB might not win this
I know this cause there was (and still is) the discussion about custom paint jobs, logo's etc for EVE and it's implications :p
oh
actually, sumica, the servers in PS2, how ARE they set up?
00,10how is what set up?
the servers
00,10like 10 servers
00,106000 players per
Just dance 4 has gangnam style...
they seem to be stable most of the time, ie. not crashing every other hour
:)
00,10all the servers are us but some are classed as AU or euro
Not sure if good or not
I know that part
umm
how to put this, each server, is on its own server or group of servers right?
00,10not sure of the setup
so you dont have the US servers on one box, the EU servers on a box, etc
00,10they are for all purpouses seprate servers as your trooper is only on one server
11,02:)
ahh

Foxtrot, I always liked the sound of that
whos streaming
And I saved a whole bunch of money on my car insurance by putting my car in reverse and driving away.
Is there a stream?
I don't think so
00,10set the time then Phase4
Sumica, my time is correct
but the time in the logs isnt
00,10how odd seeing as skype pulls them from the computers time
Sumica, it does, i was having another issue
time was wrong for a bit
brb
cereal....
ok that was random
cereal is good
it is with milk
If you have not already noted. I am saying random stuff (or typing)
No it's good with chocolate milk
no strawberry milk
i tried weetbix with up and go once, it was epic
00,10and this is why thermal is OP in planet side 2 http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/2523/mosquitorocketthermal.jpg
o.o
Sorry
Dat wall
00,10oi
Nah Strawberry milk is too sweet and ruins the flavor
00,10shorten links there Vinylscratch
Sorry :(
Sumica, wow... How many certs does it take for one of those .-.
Link even failed :/
/me throws all the cert points at the monitor
/me climbs mount text
use derpy.me it helps
HavokOC not for me
00,1050 certs
damn
o.o
Yeah sry HavokOC it wrks for me 2
00,10it's for the rocket pods
looks like i cant use twitch
00,10make your own Phase4
00,10take no time
Sumica, but that takes work :(
just describe what you would be streaming with text
Sumica: hai
Sumica: yay
You can use mine phase :3
00,10more examples of thermal on fighters http://i.imgur.com/tkz8H.jpg
haaaaaaaaaaa yay~
damn
i cant use my colour plugin
Sumica, shame on you for fighting on the wrong faction :$
no colours for now
So I recently bought a Derpy Polo
00,10not my pictures
Ahh, alright
Phase4 that sucks, i like your colors
00,10NC is my home
Phase4, show some dignity and put on some clothes
:|
/me throws a bucket of paint at Phase4
Clothes? What's clothes?
00,10so much bitching about inabilty to kill ESF with libs and Gals
00,10they say the walker is underpowered
00,10where as I agree it's weak
00,10but we still kill fighteres just fine in the lib
00,10mind you more often with the cannon then the tail gun
I don't really care about the weapons, I just watched half my platoon leave the battle after we started losing territory.
Traitors
It's the people that let NC down really.
Even if we are losing. I stick with my team until the very end as I feel it is my duty.
4:30 a.m and I'm still not tired....
whos streaming
Is there anyone streaming?
nope no stream i think
I don't think anyone is streaming texasboykc09
someone was streaming
Here we go
k
refresh your streams
Yay!!
everything working?
I'm getting audio
so much lag for me
no screen though
quiet in here
odd
It's laggy for me
wow
lots of delay here
bah, why'd mips have to go and have an exploit
eeyup
AdamTheDuck, try refresh again
Wait what do you mean?
I just pressed ctrl+F5
No change
So how many of the live streaming sites were using mips?
Kandarihu, no idea, don't really care
easy enough to use a different service
There we go
I can see now
Phase4, Guns of Icarus? :3
I mean, all of the streams were attacked at the same time, right?
this is broken
i'll try fix
Kandarihu, no idea
they are trying to attack the site still
not getting far it seems by trying nontheless
00,10and this is why I like ps2 over ps1 in many cases http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6999/ps2sunderer.png
need to adjust stream but i dont want to interupt music D:
hmmm
i may not be able to use limev
Sumica, did the twitch issue with frames get sorted?
00,10you are overflowing the sound buffer btw Phase4
00,10the issues is we are useing esentaly a hack
00,10the way i pluged in the twich embed is not as intended
00,10only crome and safari report this
00,10all otehre borwses it works fine
yeah, i cant stream to limev
something wont let me
00,10use veemi then
probably the same routing issue that causes problems when watching
00,10or try out xsplit
Later guys, good luck with the stream issues.
later d3rb
Bye d3rb
I think the first time I csme here they were streaming Heroes
NUUU
DONT BREAK
HOLD TOGETHER
came
bye d3rb

shit i jinxed it
bail!
Luck doesn't exist
Lel
/me slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
Sumica, link to xsplit?
worth a shot i suppose
not sure why ffsplit is suddenly not working
00,10you are a bit limited on the free bersion
00,10but it gives you a taste
stream is laggy
00,10http://www.xsplit.com/
mmm xsplit, good program.
00,10but here we see why I am bummed about mips
00,10autoplay
00,10.......hmmmmmm
00,10wonder if we can use the autoplay tag like LS embeds have
could be worse i supposed
could be using fmle
how i do not miss that software
Uh oh
urgh
someone decided to stuff their pc
brb, have to fix
ok hb
Please bear with us as we are having technical difficulties
00,10you seeing that some place [Alpha]?
someone let derpy into the server room
we're attempting to coax her out with muffins
huh?
oh god
Sumica, it requires you to log in?
i hate software that does that
00,10it has an auto log on but yeah
can i post a video link
Stream is down so go ahead
00,10it's a far better platform then FMLE+screencap

Swagitty Swag
Oi Meanwhile, don't be dissing dual monitor setup.
I'll beat you with a teapot.
Seriously, I don't know why I did this.
dari suggested that that video be apart of the bronystate playlist
Ha, I remember that thing!
want
Meanwhile: Three monitors, there you go
I wish someone would hurry up and upload a seamless version of the hacks
Serenity: there is
The only guy who had it and showed it was lagging loads
theres one in good quality
i get
broadcast offline
aniderp, press ctrl+F5
it just stopped xD
I don't know if you noticed. But there's no stream.
Psssst
guys
news flash
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds <--- contains #rainbow_dash reactions and everything, second hack is cockblocked sorta though
it wasn't a hack
Yeah
It was a hijack
That's the one, but notice he was lagging through the hijacks
oh thats awkward
because MIPS was a terrible idea from the getgo
i posted on my chrysalis like page since people would rage if it was on my actual fb account cause my mother would get mad :\
long live LimeV in its traditional glory
Well, I can keep stream up to the side now. That's something.
sup
Serenity: sorta, the originals of some of the clips are actually youtube videos, want them?
Yeah, sre
The orange one made me lol
i gave up on recording..
i was recording for possible derpy in the episode ;_;
stop it with the whole derpy
seriously
Want a tissue CrystalPhoenix
just in case.. plus so i could watch episode on bus while waiting to go to work
I wound up waiting until later to watch the episode since the hijacking made us miss so much of the episode. =/
Turned out for the better. Husband was at work when the episode aired anyway
I switched over to another site to watch it....then the mods had capture card problems
Gold_Demona: Yeah, I ended up seeing the rest on the second stream
As we only saw the last 8 minutes of the first one
Ahaha
the 1080p came out like 2 hours after
just wait til then
Yeah, they woulda captcha carded their telly or something for maximum quality
I was really tired when the episode aired anyway, I thought I'd passed out when that walking thing appeared.
Swiggity Swag

lol and I took a nap only to wake up to a strang orange walking
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Get a new client n00b
why?
You don't deserve the trout .-.
Meanwhile: I probably passed out from laughter
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
00,10shame you all jumped ship so fast was fixed realy fast
/me eats the large trout
Oh..uhhh.
say wut?
/me slaps Serenity around a bit with a large trout
I kinda forgot fish makes me..sick
It was like "Why is Babs being a bitch" then it was "Fried chicken watermelon" and I was like "Oh...Ok."
Meanwhile: That must be the new reason for everything now.
Sumica: I stayed for the whole thing
Oh and back to what I asked along time ago, the tetsuo iron man movie..... found the soundtrack.
* A Huge horde of ZAWBIES*
that mouse in the scren is anoying
screen;'
Clearly Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon need some fried chicken and watermelon.
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that I shouldve voted for Ron Paul and what black people enjoy the most in life
lolwait
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
EAT THIS ONE
/me magically replaces the trouts with bananas
*A Fugo fish*
Fried Chicken, watermelon, white women was what it said lol
HI! I'm Gamer Luna
WallFlower: I KNOOOOOW
/me hugs Gold_Demona
tell us more
Hello.
Hi GamerLuna
Where all the white women at.
Hello GamerLuna
So...
Sup Gamerluna
How's you get hacked?
There was a GamerLuna before you
And was it /v/?
no
00,10no
74.91.112.238
Then who?
CaptainAlliance, doesnt look like
and we didnt get hacked
mips did
hijacked
CaptainAlliance: GNAA
No, I think that was just to get us to go over and be like YOU FERGERTS!
00,10was not a hack either Phase4
GNAA?
bad name
ill pm you the initials
It was Hijacked
ok...
GNAA just sounds like an onomatopiea for disgust.
It's so hard to google.
Now the next question is: Why pin it on /v/?
IDK
Just checked /v/
As in, "GNAA Jaymoo what're you doing to that goat?"
All they do is bitch about consoles.
00,10to cause /mlp/ to go to war with/v/
You don't wanna know what I'm doing to that goat.
But why?
You're right, I don't.
For the lulz
Because ponyfags
thats why
Oh, GNAA...
I thought it meant
00,10I am not entirely sure it was Gnaa
no proof right now
Trust me many have commited so many evils for the lulz...
Sumica: I can't say for sure, but I'm lead to beleive they posted something on their site
i meen i've got 1 ip address, could probably match it
Though could be fake, who knows
Gory Narcolepsies Association of Austrailia..
CaptainAlliance, that is not them
nah he knows
But there is one, right?
00,10well seeing as i set a trap later on to test for the hole
CaptainAlliance, given the internet that wouldnt suprise me
CaptainAlliance: possibly
Gory Narcolepsies Association of Austrailia, the hell is that shit?
Gifted Nublet And Associates.
Sumica, if their attempts on the site are anything to go by we're fine
00,10either them or some one that read of it from a fail stream site decided to try their hand at it
silly script kiddies who think they're clever
Gasp! No Apple Acres!
Grannies nosh all apples
plot twist: it was HipsterBrony's evil cousin
lol
GrAnyways
Anyone else here watch, Pleasure island?
Is it true?
Does hipsterbrony still piss around here? Or has he gone for good?
00,10the long and short of it is mips failed not us
Hi everybrony
Ive always hated MIPs
Sumica: So I presume Veemi's the answer for now?
Hello LOL
Lime of the Vs
00,10yeah we always keep backup plans
I liked mips, probably for the same reason that the mods did
Kimis livestream :>
hi AdamTheDuck
lel
Livestream doesn't seem as good as mips
Or does it?
LimeV >> MIPs
LOL why do you persist to have different names GamerLuna?
Mips is VERY stable though usually
00,10LS is more of a hard ass when it comes to what you stream as well as to how you stream
veemi looks good so fare
far'
How to stream?
hmmmmmmm..........
oh awesome, raven is on
MIPs, however, is weaksauce
You're streaming?
Damn.
00,10veemi is fine but it lacks a few things that mips had
Hey look soveit boy is back
Phase4: Yeah, I remember positive feedback a few months ago from some of you lot
lel
I liked it, but sometimes the server really really REALLY does fart.
jaymoo :P
at least LimeV doesnt have ads for Asian women
aniderppp
/me slaps J around a bit with a large trout
lolwut
wat?
Dafuq?
Where all the asian women at.
wanna cookie?
tab fail?
I have adblock, so no ads for me
yes I do aniderp :>
-tosses cookie-
Jmo your fat go home
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Anyone else hear about that Tosh.0 thing on bronies?
laggg
you're*
Your mother is one to talk.
Me
How did tosh show tht on TV?
Katamari couldn't even roll her.
00,10LimeV seems to have regonal issues
WallFlower: its about fucking time
WallFlower, let me ask you something
Yes?
how relevent is tosh.0? seriously?
I mean, we don't watch lesbo ponies... well not all of us.
How popular is he?
veemi works for craop for me keeps crashing the webpage and flash for me
relevant*
lel
CrystalPhoenix: very
I do not know, just saw the vid on youtube
but even so
Daniel Tosh trolled the entire brony community
I found it hilarious
I like Veemi, works pretty well in Britain
yep
CaptainAlliance, like he does in most things
/me huggles aniderp for ze cookie
Brony stereotypes are hilarious
Amirite?
cookayy
he's just some unfunny moron
He makes dick jokes
thats his career
Sounds alot like dabi.
and just lost the stream
and heck we've got plenty of good coverage to counter those kind
O U
Kekeke
he's just extremely late
Let me end this arguement by saying this: The brony community on a whole is full of criminally retarded people
6_9
lol
Stream keeps popping off and on
It's funny how No one talks about derpy anymore
Or even mentions her
Why is it funny?
I never did
You know why?
because she's just a background pony
because the topic is dumb
ITs funny because of the reactions
seriously
It's in the past. Why does it matter?
00,10just lost stream
ermagerd guyz, srsly.
yep
everything about arguing and over analyzing episodes and characters is so dumb beyond belief
Phase4, stream's getting laggy again
Browniestaet, stahp
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
/me turns trouts into bananas
00,10unfortunatly yeah mips was better just because auto play
/me dies on the floor
it's not allowing me to change my nick
Sumica: That's exactly the reason I like it
Sumica, that's my favorite aspect of mips
S'getting a bit weird in here.
And look what we did, we've triggered OPINION TIME ft EVERY OTHER BRONY
That's exactly the reason I like it
lel
/me takes out the defibrillators and attempts to revive aniderp
Sumica i can't change my nick
Hijacked
ah right sorted ot self
Pfft.
Stream keeps stopping. :<
Good start.
and its mr Swiggity Swag
still lagging?
yea stops for me also
so there
thanks
YOLO
oh come on
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
The video names are "IT'S HAPPENING" and "Swiggity Swag"
You're not alone Gold_Demona
Phase4 not even working for me at all
And when I say stopping, I mean turns off completely like nothing's broadcasting.
Jmo get out
How about no?
broadcast offline
yeah
See, had we voted for Ron Paul, the GNAA would be merciful on our souls
I like polos
but then ITS HAPPENING occured
Its a reference to the video
calm your political nipples
lel
I voted for whoever was representing the "I Don't Care" party.
ITS HAPPENING
Meanwhile: You can't vote for yourself!
that video
Serenity: Says you
Oh. That was Ron Paul in the image there?
Yes. Says me. >=D
/me doesn't know about any video call "ITS HAPPENING"
Meanwhile voted for the queen
I voted for Pinkie Pie
I didn't give a shit.
You mean Chancelor Puddinghead?
I voted for no-one because I'm not 18.
Queens aren't elected.
can i vote for derpy?
No, I mean Pinkie Pie
Serenity: heh, underage
I voted for the Ice King
Gold_Demona, the second hack attack had a man's face in strange colors with the words "It's Happening" as an image macro.
its funny because so am i
and it sucks
I'm almost there though, just 2 years away!
no the 2nd one was discord
Jmo
stahp
then 3rd was the face
Kandarihu: Ah, must've missed it. I refreshed a LOT during the second hijack.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
is there a stream?
Under-aged fewl.
Over-aged Chav
Jmo: Oh go awae yew
alexxm, doesn't seem so
Oh you wanna start Yahoez
Jmo: OH IM STARTIn
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
jaymoo be good or no cookie D:
/me turns trouts into bananas
Fine.
So much trout tonight .-.
Sotp startin'! D:
Personally and there is alot of people who will disagree with me.....but I think alot of the things of elections are acting. I think both parties really just work together needing the other to paint as the bad guy.
Don't start with us!
You know what? I think it might be worth sending e-mail to mips about the security issue, and they'll have to deal with it asap
Kandarihu: Knowing them, I'd wager that they already have
Kandarihu, you don't think anyone else already did
I bet my car that its 3 am
AJIsAwesome|Napping, go back to bread
...somewhere
who is streaming
WRONG. It's 1210 hours here
Bye, I'm tired
SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINVBOW
i'm not sure why the stream isnt working this time
AdamTheDuck: But I just woke up. :<
I WILL DESTROY YOUR BLADDER WITH GRAPE JUICE.
/me tucks AJIsAwesome back to bread :|
Go. To. Bread. :|
;~;
Good point. But it's not really a good idea to just make that assumption. What if, in all of this confusion, everypony who DID think about e-mailing them figured they'd already be swamped and sent nothing?
Or you won't get your muffin AJIsAwesome :|
Kandarihu, I think I remember Shizu saying she was going to write to MIPS earilier today
Hi everypony. Back again.
Hello P0N-3
I am wearing the most AWSESOME pair of PANTS, EVER!

Hi
Hi AdamTheDuck.
wipergone2, the identity of who's streaming keeps switching back and forth between Phase4 and noone

Heh! Trixie comes back.
Oops

It's in the title.
Gold_Demona, i think thats what everyone is infering
There be no spoilers here <_<
jokes on you, im deaf
Nope >_>
who else thinks that bads seed is there favourite song in season 3 so far?
I'm drinking lime kool-aid!
but no
... I'
I said nothing. <_<
me turtlegod98
I've noticed kool-aid doesn't seem to attract fruit flies.
If anything, it seems to repel them.
/me shuts up
I'm not sure whether I should be impressed or disturbed.
yeah, veemi has had it
Veemi be ded
You shall know that word shortly Adam .-.
Kool-aid killed Veemi?
that guy with the red eyes in rooger rabbit D:
Eyyy mon it be gone naw ya hurr?

/me licks Jmo
Jamaica
Brick.

....
LimeV will take all of it

P0N-3: You want disturbing facts about drinks? The milk plant my husband works at also processes artificial fruit drinks. The concentrate comes in on a refrigerated truck and stored in the cooler section of the plant.
woah woah!........licking you say?
he kissed the rabbit hehe
hey everypony
P0N-3: After it's processed and bottled, it no longer needs refrigerated.
Hello KinsagaKing
Hi there
Hi, KinsagaKing.
wtf
Lol
That's spooky.
LOL.
AHAHA
Really...
wanna hear something nasty bout soup?

Yes! I do!
YOU FOOLS
hehehe
AJIsAwesome: hi
GPO
when i was at jobsite at panera
k, refresh your streams
:D
Now I get it. :P

Back to LimeV
they froze their soup in plastic bag thigns and thawed them out
LIMEVVVVVVVV
salvation at last
i was like ew
phase4 alot better
right behindyou
aniderp: That's not unheard of to me.
That sounds like an effective way to store soup.
AJIsAwesome: talk of g*k,thats a paddlin'
well they froze it..
Kinsagaing: Oh, shush. :P
say g ak
I like soup.
^
aniderp: I think a drink whose ingredients require refrigeration but the final drink itself doesn't is more disturbing.
what type of soup, Serenity?
Tomato
aniderp: That does not surprise me about soup makers.
it wasnt tomato
aniderp: freezing soup really isn't all that weird.
these wubs
I'm going to take soymilk, and cook it with tapioca flour so it's a thick gel. I'm going to add green colouring and concentrated apple flavour, and then mix in high proof alcohol before it sets. I'm gonna call it Applegak Daniels. :D
XD
That was worth the boot.
It totally was
Yeah, I mostly like tomato soup because it's the colour of the blood of my enemies
Sumica should really keep it on for the episodes
G4k you can eat that gets you drunk.
P0N-3: who's your favorite pony?
And apple flavoured!

Okay then. Applegák Daniels. :D

00,10ah children
Meanwhile: where was Gondor when G4K attacked?
I'm ecstatic.

St0p spamming it Yahoez
Gawd

Jaymo
Did you see what happened during commercial breaks last ep?

Boo..... :3
Anywaaaay, lets move onto something else, other than exploiting the filter
well
this is less than ideally interesting
Nope.avi
Phase4: at least i provided wubs
You didn't provide shit Yahoez .-.
Ordinalthrone, oi
I put the stream on my back
Go back to bread Ordinalthrone
You didn't do anything.

Quit lyin'
jmo pls
AdamTheDuck: you aint my mother

Morning everyone

jaymoo did i sleep enough? D:
Hi, Cypresswolf. :)

i dont sleep long xD
maybe 3 hours about..
Good enough aniderp :P
Go to bread Ordinalthrone :|
hello Cypresswolf
Sleep is sleep.
Really?
nah
other hat was better
No not really Meanwhile.
gak pls
Yes, it's true, I love brains.
Because I was under the impression sleep was raspberry jam.
I'm going to bed
wait, this ain't dubstep
It could be.
BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU SAID SO!!
Or it could be milky.
Shaddup Jaymoo.
goodnight everypony
Ahahaha.
Dante LOVE pizza
Goodnight Ordinalthrone .-.
Night, Ordinalthrone. :)
i think thats enough tf2 actuallyt
What did I miss last night? my screen screen captured an image of another hijack attempt when it shut off shortly after midnight
Cypresswolf, some anoying people being anoying
Cypresswolf, nothing worth mentioning
then we got to watch the episode anyway
annoying*
I loved loved loved the last episode. The music, the plot, it was like something from the late eighties, early nineties.
Phase4: how's HexChat coming along?
same idiots?
gunthler, is working good
Cypresswolf: The stream was Hijacked twice, the first one was 10 seconds after the episode started, and there was a walking orange, the second one was IT'S HAPPENEING
Cypresswolf, gnaa, not sure
well i THINK it was them
hard to tell
I've switched from mIRC to HexChat and back to mIRC
lel
whoever it is they are booring and dull
Do you guys remember how shows in the eighties used to treat kid characters like complete chracters, and not just stereotypes?
Im a Colloquy
is it better than WDK Phase4 ?
Crystal Empire was Cool, Too many Pinkie Pies was FUN and One bad Apple was OH MY GOSH CUTENESS OVERLORD
I saw the ones during the ep airing
I need to set up an external client
P0N-3, those were the days
LightIRC has it strong points, but also it's weak points
except we still have that now in some shows
like mlp
Yeah. Well my point is that MLP FIM brings that back with the CMC.
They're definitely their own characters.
i like the CMC
^
some people dont, not sure why
Haio, everybrony.
ohai CountDoofus
Hi, CountDoofus. :)
Phase4: Because I hate kids
Allo CountDoofus
The CMC act... well, like kids.
It's great.
Serenity, fair enough i suppose
hiyo CountDoofus
Rarity and Sweetie Belle are best pony
P0N-3, ikr!
Who could not love the CMC.....except for people who like scootabuse.
CrystalPhoenix: The two of them are a singular best pony?
Ikr?
the CMC promote some fairly sick brony actvity...
Ohai CountDoofus
Gold_Demona, yes
not gonan lie
Ikr!
Foalcon
:D
>_>
ow my legs..
<_<
Dat Derpy
KSP
Yeah um I'm not going to blame the CMC for being perverted by perverts.
Rarity's EMERGENCY EDIBLE BOOTS
restarting stream so i can remove the boreders
Did you see that flank on the golden Sweetie Belle?
Honeybadger, you mean the shininess?
Boots! Not boobs... ;)
I have met many Pervert's in my time. So much so that I know not a human without at least one.
Honeybadger, very funny... I don't believe you're John De Lancie...
LimeV broke again
due to derps this is the best i can do
gunthler, i stopped stream, press play
it should be back
Phase is removing the borders, stream will be back up soon
^
So, you're not-... you're not John De Lancie, right?
P0N-3: I doubt it, my friend.
Until then let us fill the time with the many things of which we can talk of.
P0N-3: Honeybadger doen't talk much.
Sign my copy of Assassin's Creed III, pl0x!
<3 TheFatRat
i call this craft fusion bomb
:D
watch why
give it a sec to load
You guys are all probably aware that 'Honey Badger' was security's code word for JDL at Bronycon.
phase4 is it big enough
Its loading
Because honeybadgers don't care and do whatever they want.
Yay, time to watch Phase4 bomb Kerbin
AdamTheDuck: Hooray? :D
/me passes out onto floor
o.o
Oh no
wat.
BOOm
Boooooooom
ded
that looks great with lagsbane enabled XD
Ka-booooooooom!
I havent caught a Kerbal stream in at least a month :) Yay
This music is perfect for Kerbals. :D
cant remember what the second one did differetn
Gold_Demona: you're a kerbal! :P
/me flails around
:O
Neeeeergh
gunthler: Don't be silly. There are no female Kerbals. :P
You alright there, Jmo?
ded
That's a question within a question while warping within itself.
Gold_Demona: I'm a silly ^-^
/me doesnt move and is collasped on floor
Is it wrapped in an enigma?
So I'll take as a "no"?
the rockets REALLY want to overheat
It is wrapped in cookie dough .-.
let them overheat
Gold_Demona: The inner machinations of Jmo's mind are an enigma.
/me noms on Jmo's questions wrapped in cookie .-.
texasboykc09, but then we dont go to space
daily reminder that this isn't dubstep
please do enjoy the stream
CrystalPhoenix: did we really need that? XD
It's pretty obvious that it isn't, CrystalPhoenix. :D
^
this isnt remotely electronic house
phase4, oh yea, forgot about that
My husband actually tried to overheat the engines once. He couldn't do it.
why would it be dubstep?
at all?
someone bring me to bread
/me flings aniderp to bread
Huzzah, gentlemently I r
weee
harharhar
/me throws bread at aniderp
Hm. I want a bottle of Crown.
In fact, I bet you cant name the genre of this music
aniderp: no RP o.O
/me watches as aniderp misses the bed and crashes into the wall D:
He kept making the rocket fly waaaaaay into space to intersect the other planets' orbits. :D
'No RP' coming from you that is funny.
^
ooof
You checked into Dashiesauce lately?
Owait.
2oofs :<
soo unstable
inb4 there will be explosion
oww i hit the wall :<
My hubby and I have yet to figure out how to steer the rockets to where we want them to go. And I've yet to make the rockets fly high enough to leave orbit. XP
My husband keeps trying to attempt to make the rocket fly past Jool's orbit.
this is Electronic Dance/ Progressive House
trying to attempt. lol
Your face is progressive.
summed up simply enough
dat redundancy
wub wub weeble whop
Your moms progressive
under control
mostly
Your face is electronic.
Lel
this rocket is not designed to be where it is
I wonder if the career mode will explain the pathing process better.
Cuz I know more or less how to do it, but I suck at it
Practice makes perfect Dema.
Your face needs practice.
I know right?
Where the practice women at?
Guise stahp fiting! D:
Pfft.
fiting
I'm having a fit.
Neeergghhhh
Im so fit >: D
i'd liek to point out that this craft has already exploded
twice
like'
You're fat Yahoez.
I...got nothing.
no u
lol
Katamari gonna roll yo ass.
Anyone willing to loan me 20,000 dong?
dong?
Dafuq currency is that?
/me loans WallFlower 20,000 dong
Vietnamese currency
Jmo, Vietnamese currecnt
currency*
Oh.
hmmm

20000 dongs
Something close to $1-2
snicke
*snicker
iirc
Don't let Nail into that
thanks! now I can buy a 1 dollar coke!
Yay!
Cookies!
Jmo: catastrophe
This calls for a celebration!
2012 right there.
i didnt realise they were the next stage
oops
That Kerbal is freaking the fuck out
Not realising the order your rockets go off is a fairly major oversight.
Imagine fooling someone into coming to Vietnam saying you will give them 100,000 dollars.......and it turns out it is just 5 U.S dollars.
Moar TheFatRat :3
OOOH SNAP SCOOTALOO FLEW AAAAHH!
Less TheFatYahoez
I didn't notice the first time!
I'm rewatching it.
now i actually need to close the game and check something
Hm.
yes, less fat of me
i think thats fair
Scootaloo FLEW!
P0N-3: I thought she hovered down to the ground.
Phase4: fair dos
Well! That's closer than before!
She's getting there.
FAIR DOS GOVNA
She did, hovering and flying are different.......Chickens can hover.
for a split moment
Well it's close!
Flying turkeys.
bye got to get some sleep
Bye, texasboykc09. :)
See ya later neighbor
this is much better
much less lag
Well this was a fairly unfortunate development.
Did you finally describe milk correctly?

dat wtf comment xD
lol
Whats up with the pinkies?
alexxm : Great, just watched the new episode and such! :D A little hangoverish but besides that, fantastic! :D
oh god
I like the idea of multiple streams
watch is this eaxcatly?
That all are the same
i am doing nowhere near enough damage
N4x Did you feel like eating salad afterwards? I ate salad. Veggie Salad
Zompony, vs ponyville
alexxm : And you?
one player becomes a pony, everyone else fights the one pony
usualy the pony wins

HavokOC, they stream ponies at specific times during official events and when they feel like it and ONLY THEN
jmo, shuddup
Bronysith: I dun like that link name
Na.
Bronysith: LOL
dident they take down moestia?

I really don't feel like it.
Kandarihu, It was a joke >.>

Wrek: Your typo: "Sue /nick"
mew, they stream ponies at specific times during official events and when they feel like it and ONLY THEN. Ask for ponies when something else is streaming and you'll get it in the worst imaginable way.
00,10stop saying gak
omg i want that
but its fun to say
wrek, do you get auto kicked for saying it?
How is it fun to say?
Jmo: retards

00,10so wrek, hows that Twi Dressed up as jessica rabbit coming along?
Cuz they came out of the reflection, not the water
The fun has been infinitized
Wow CCCP.

Do you have a brain of a peanut?
That's charitable.
muffin_mix, exponent your fun

CCCP: and you are trying to be dark and edgy by saying how much you like communism, jeez, stalin and lenin would be upset that you get so upset easily

Sumi you do realise he's aiming those at someone else, yes?
00,10No I talk as if you are excersiseing futility and stupidity

Gold_Demona: Agnorant stupidity is more like it
Jmo you know hurting others feeling is naughty
CCCP do shut up.

Also, Pinkie, please stop crying!
Why are they all complaining to Twilight?
there was a derpy in the background!!
how goes?
She wasn't even AWARE
Serenity: Cuz she's the magic nut? :P
Meanwhile do I have to?
05why are they complainign to twilight in the first place?
CCCP: Yes.
fluttershys mad
Ah, so the latest episode IS next. But I have church to go to.
Lil_B, and Dr. Whooves wasn't with derpy in the cinema yetsreday :<
Wrek: shes smartest in ponyville
Meanwhile can you ask nicely?
Shut up please.
doctor whooves was with cloudkicker....
Invi I bet I saw them together! Maybe it was the one that looked just like Derpy
Twilight is smart, thus she has the highest chance of finding out what the hell is going on
A better answer would of been yes or no
Well, Pinkie is a great friend to Twilight, so maybe they thought Twi would know what's going on with her.. Them.. Wat
Lil_B, the coat color the eye color and the hair was close but wrong ^^
Fancy Pants ----> Towered Pile of Pinkie Pies :D

apples instead of fries and milk instead of soda. I'd say that's more healthy than a normal happy meal.
When the boss broke in, and he scared them half to death, with a rifle in his hand, and cheap whiskey on his breath.
