what's wrong?
hijacking here is like... interrupting a restock to a single Wal*Mart. Once.
heheh
hello
vector polynomials
It's still an issue. and I'm looking up programs to either prevent, or severely counterhack the hacker's system. Even if I'm not the direct streamer, if they can steal a stream, I can steal their IP from it.
It is a word that is evil in both depth and meaning
cosplay or a disturbing image? http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x339/AlexeiStukov/Ponyman.jpg
vector algebra, may it burn
Way less disturbing when the colors aren't messed with
vector calc is horrible
"shurg"...
well yeah, i mean vector calc
don't go all gung ho vigilante because some chucklefucks are gettin their jollies riling you up
i meant vector math, may it burn
tell her to marry me.

Hey yall
hello
hi
0,14you know, something I'll always like about animu fightan gaems, is that they never have conventional "round 1, fight" type of sayings
13AHA
13I FOUND IT
13mips is weak
oh
noice
Oh zing.
stream key~
ill get the gun
0,14?

0,14??
¿
Needs less ?
<:
13one of which is associated with the channel and i'm sure you can easily search for it
but i thought you couldnt stream while there was a connection already in place?
13the other is in the open on the iframe itself
Hmm
or bill nye
wut
13mips autostarts when someone starts broadcasting
13so we just don't use them anymore, problem solved
works for me
Did gnaa take responsibility? Why did it say it was from /v
13basic tactics
13aka framing
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me09s0xDeR1r6eu2fo1_250.gif
Easier to blame it on someone else than to take the blame yourself
like when 4chan used to blame ebaums
trying to ignite a war possibly
13no it was a hijack, a couple twits stumbled into a kline bragging about it
13mips is hijacked simply by starting a broadcast to it while another is active
13limev is not
13yes
13shizumobile is my phone
+b*, pardon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4mEc_6JQ8
its racist.
I can't say here
But...............but
0,14so to get people's minds off things, have some music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-_n8jbTDDg
found a link to encyclopedia dramatica clicking it
already got the brain bleach still not enough
the streamjacker came back for a brief moment
really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Kpy0ECkRA
And I missed it again?
Heard it was someone in Germany or something
0,14don't worry about it, it's over with
/me tries to find something novel and unprecedented to distract peoples from hijacking
no whos on second
The only whos I know are the ones with a PhD
hia
~yay~
hi guys
Hmm gmm
:D
I hate gnaa :@ http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x339/AlexeiStukov/Hacked.jpg

i work help desk at my job. i would much rather be told multiple times "X is broken," even if we already knew that.
/me is listening to Pareidolia
I liked how the stream can just come up and even if I'm not watching at first, I know it and am called to attention.
13we're going to give veemi a try
13not sure if it autostarts or not
13Moopy: it wasn't /v/, gnaa was framing /v/ hoping to incite cross community attacks
13already did
How did gnaa get caught then?
13limev and veemi both do not expose the keys
LimeV requires each person to click the play button manually.

Everytime you make a pony joke, someone vanishes from the mortal coil.
My friends dispise animaniacs because it is too mainstreem

Right now, at least
13boomerang made me horribly depressed putting dexters lab in the lineup
"GIVE ME MORE"

in retrospect, Dexter's Lab is rather meh...
Kinda is
Boomerang was a good idea, but Ive out grown alot of the shows from my childhood
wait, they have Dexter's Lab on there now?
Except some
Dexters lab is amazing, but it's mostly the same.

13sb is drawing again? you must post to dA remember
i
Live action shows about teens and their problems
I got enough of that on Nick@Nite
Just because Waverly Place turned into an exercise of getting things by the censors.
i mean at least Nickelodeon learned and created the NickToon network, which is much more traditional Nick content
13i'm going to steal cyan's catchphrase and say i'm cautiously optimistic about season five code lyoko adding live action
The only thing I like to watch on CN now is Adventure Time

Code Lyoko is still on?
Code lyoko is over
That show is still on?
WAHT?

Code Lyoko is coming out with a ew Season

Hmm?
13season 3-4 are the best
...and now i want Hub to get Reboot
I never really followed that show
00,10reboot is on netflix
132 was a little pitiful though it crammed through a lot of backstory for aelita
reboot was ... interesting
reboob
131 was all self contained with a couple callbacks and finally an arc on the finale
i wouldnt mind seeing an ... updated reboot, if that makes sense
(and don't ask - there really is no reason why i haven't gotten netflix yet other than "Youtube")
like more up to date instead of ... 90's-ish
Night yall
they are rebooting reboot?

hi
that i've seen
Kids prefer consoles, to be honest.
Using a videogame as a babysitter is not a good parenting technique. I see that being used all around me
fact*
I remember playing cod 3 on ps2 and not even knowing about multiplayer
Dettol protects, fact.
Parents don't give a fuck.
I've got CoD1 on my hard drive. somewhere.
Even when bullying.
Zelda is best babysitter anyway
Campaign was good in BO1
Lol mason has a tulpa.
Skyrim is best babysitter. works for 7 motnhs for jut 60 bucks
months*
60 bucks for 7 months?
I cant understand a word theyre saying
Lolno
radaition symbole
lel
MW3 is the greatest example of a bad story.
Never seen anyone else do this
yeah that
i mean why did they took it out though?
How about you just actually babysit the kid instead of being a slack arse.
I had way more of an attention span when I was in middle school than I do now.
lol
How is that even relevant?
My parents played games with me
oh that kind=(
Babysitting the kid does not compute to all gamers being single
