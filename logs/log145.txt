Val actually missed a "t"
Weird old once-dead boyfriend
evil kamen-rider

Now, now perfectly symmetrical violence is not the answer
A fair fight.

XD
kamen riders have sex through finger-to-plastic abs-contact
:P
this all probably would make sense, if I had actually paid attention
;)
Status Report: So far, so good.
:| :'(
So is the snow supposed to be symbolic of sexual intercourse?

Japan is always strange
no,not relevant at all so far
You know what I just realized?
who the hell are paying their bills?
less emotion more kiccking shit
Japan is strange? THATS A LIE
Whoa... PONY EMOTICONS!!!
KamenModFaiz: implying there are times it isn't strange
come at me bro!... and gimmie a hugs
so, any important dialogue that i missed?
Yup.
50 dollars more to be exact.
I like the way Ghosties thinks
Japanese NHS?
Also, what did you realise, oh Silverscreen?
Ghosties that would be so awesome /)^3^(\
pony emoticons ftw!
For a grand total of 200
ya know for sick people they look really healthy
(Not kissing up to mods at all)
06,15Sometimes it's just awesome, Zephirdd :P
"unh"
...and now she dies
Cobalt: You think that's bad?
That Kamen Rider dude would make a good Danny Phantom if he spoke English.
pff, i almost expect the doctor to start running around trying to undermine the evil bug squad while spouting off wacky thing to his companion.
She is sick, and she spent her time visitng the scarf guy even though shes sick =(
aww I thought he was gonna say soemthing else
House becomes a Kamen Rider
...and if he was white.
I think they look awfully pale
um... inb4 "it's morphin' time" in japanese. or something
Cobalt: Wait until The Last Airbender
I'm pretty sure we're all a little strange... no, just me, ah well.
Where was Gondor when the medical bills came?
I wish I had Pony Emoticons
she looks 14
...you make a good point
*cough*Pedo*cough*
:|
04Oh, and House speaks fluent Japanese
04suddenly
NO
But I don't use the chat there
and then she died
'I love you scarf man'
I RETURN!
House did live in japan
inb4 tenticles pop out and rape everyone
so he does speak japanese
DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!
Good news guys, The guy that make power rangers, recently trademarked the name Power Rider
don't die
It scrolls up too fast for me
she is going to dead...
Welcome back.
only when the plot calls for it Ghosties
Suddenly
/me is slowly falling asleep because nothing interesting is actually happening.
Looking forward to that.
The age of concent in japan is 13
its house ghosties,
Well Improbable Island if a fun RPin' game... Where madness lies... And I play a pony at the moment... That's also a Vampire and a Time Lord... I do crazy stuff...
Sadness

So is this movie about these two, or what?
he can do anything
I am roses.
/me wants a Danny Phantom Live Action Movie.

Thats the driver and he tells you that your gonna die!
2,14 it's in black and white, that means things are thuper therial
I don't think a Danny Phantom Live Action Movie would work....
its actually int he plot that house wanted to become a doctor from when he lived in japan
What a friendly Taxi driver.
wtf was that?
:$
I've seen enough Japan to know where this is going...
Do you want a Death Rose?
THERES A BEE IN THE FLOWERS
Well that was bizarre and ominous
04"Here, I brought you some red. Hope you enjoy it!"
Oh Man, RED flowers.
EXACTLY
House can even speak fluent Vulcan! NOW THAT I HAVE SAID IT, IT MUST BE CANON!
they tried a ben 10 live action movie
Oh well. A mistake we all make once, I s'ppose.

in japan, one year is nostalgy
BEE
*???
Lol that Ghosties text is red
Were back to mantis man

Technically, so is MLP Arentius.

that guy in the leather was the dopplegang manis man
YOU SHOWED THAT FIVE MINUTES AGO. Good lord, I wonder if the movie keeps showing flashbacks because it forgets itself what happened. D:<
Definatly a good figting place.
So essentially you're wrong. :P

I liked emo guy when he complained about the flowers...
Desertman2, he doesn't get much practice
Why...this barf is *so good*...I think I'd like to try it a *second time*
That's some fast-growing flowers.

To the gay japanese batcave.

Combustiblemons I said dig a tunnel

More symbolic sex!
My hands are sweaty, I would be embarrassed
A wonderful scientific discovery.
I dont understand this movie at all...
lil smily button to left of txt bar, Glamador
:|
WATER IS ALIVE,KILL IT WITH FIR....oh,crap...
Probably because it's in Japanese
ah ok
/me asks that you stop, collaborate and listen.
....totally read that as "this crystal has six ponies"
Normal water does not have points.
The Ambigously Gay Duo
no cells, DNA, homeostasis,
the crystals grow because they are cold and cooling the other water around them... duh...
I thought water is alive
Just wait for the screaming and tentacles like thw rest of us.
Mantis men is my teacher yo!
we made water alive with SCIENCE!
:P I have discovered the smilies
I believe crystalized water is known as S-N-O-W...
water is inorganic
"With snowflakes, we can cure cancer, and solve the worlds energy crisis."
we'll skuttle the storry and run her aground, way hay slow the plot down.
me too, but i will resist spamming them
*wind blows*
DEATH!!!!!
yo she wants some of kamen
So he's a professor?
Sorry, that's not a scientific question
:P
hey rocks have feelings too!
*tumbleweed*
your beautiful honey ;)
Don't argue with the smart guy, it might break the world.
That's a dumb question, moving on.
6_9 a beautiful derp
...woman, wat?
What does that have to do with anything?
she wants to ride the kamen
If he says "you" I will be mad
because that is the sort of thing you ask
how many credits would a class about how pretty crystals are be worth?
this is how science works in Japan
snowflakes
Beat me to it
THATS DEEP BRO
OK...silly time is over, I came here because of a vague news post on EqD
What in the hey is this place?
Oh snap!
...god the dialogue is so brilliant...
I always was fairly quick on my feet.
HERE COMES TOM!
So water that is alive forms into something...that is alive
This is how college works in Japan
+10 pussy-points!
GASP! It's me but not me!
snow flakes, I like snow flakes
...or, well, keyboard.
But professor, what is best in life?
LAG!

13<3 Tom
Snow Flakes mean sex in this movie?
6_9
This is bronystate, the best place in the world!
why do I get an 80s vibe here
so, anyone know how much longer this movie is?
we should watch conan...
And water mirrors.
DAT STUDENT-TEACHER ROMANCE
tom is best in life!
Class dismissed.
some day
I commend your reflexes good sir
/me gets run over by said tumbleweed and carried away!
Shoes!
This needs more fights with tentacle robots.
to crush your enemies
the new one? or old
He comes hard
And Bronystate...is?
nope
We should watch something with better pace.
Well, cause I can chick
I remember when Tom was named Dan
we should watch 96 hours
Conan the barbarian or Conan the talk show host
or serenity
eeeyu...nope
Xel, are you underweight? :P
longer than it should be
this plot has changed like 5 times
:3
both
Bronystate, what else?
we should watch a movie
Bronystate is amazing.
So much water to turn into snow!
Like in Fate/Stay Night the DOLPHIN
I give up on trying to follow the plot, none of this makes sense to me.
anyone reaad the TomXRocky fic?
bronystate is a website where we stream movies and pony episodes on the weekend
Yet fun <3!
So symbolic!
Go back to the fighting bug people
Walks on the beach!
I still don't know what's going on in their lives and i still don't care.
How about conan the barbarian talk show host
first we go from "evil organization with insect themed supervillians"
oh god,the dolphin
ill be playing portal till the intremission
Look at all the water mirrors!
weekdays are just ramndom stuff
so it's over now?
Until Tom was canon, but Tom is hilarious
woops firefox crash
DashWithRainbows what do you think we are doing
Bronystate is a place where we watch movies and obssess over ponies
to "romance between two guys and...like 3 girls"
Ha ha ha
Arigato
Splashing!
This is more confusing than NGE, episode 26.
oh sweet, thanks for the plug!
/me cringes at the music.
sorry lash let me try again
HEHEHE
they just wet their designer clothing
.______. whale does not approve
Dead on, dash. Dead on.

Running!
portal?
Anyone read the TomXRocky fic?
Whew! I thought you were sent to mars
:D
Laughing!

Steppin on the beach
Haha, what a story, Mark
lulz

Discord second
Sitting!

And soon, the water formed into...clones of...them
good*
just refrence the movies instead.
NO!
Sitting under an unbrella with fancy china!
what is the point of this show?
NO
you know, someone should write a pony/eva crossover
anyway how's your sex life?
bad Meanwhile
WHy show this kamen rider movie? I would much rather have watched Paradise lost.
is that the game i played through >100 times?
yes
2,14 Meanwhile: don't make me trident you
/me slaps meanwhile
Fancy Japan
yes she is.
it's not bad...just.....suicide guy should just suicide and leave usefull space to the KR plot...
So close to a Bioshock reference
Minecraft? Portal? My two favorites...
<<<< not caring about the movie no more
pony_4569 is being a bit unrelated…
ALL ALONE AGAIN!
Agreed.
i agree
its fancy Japan
I personally think Luna is best pony, but Fluttershy is up there to
Just needs a monocle and top hat
I AGREE WITH THE FLUTTERSHY LOVE
...since he's basically useless so far
lol
would you kindly send me your adress?
9bannana: cause we already watched Paradise Lost
BAM!
GREEN KAMEN
FIGHT SCENE
Yes yes i know, terrible idea.
Stalker!
mainly due to lag

if i were in the business of writing fanfiction i would
who is this person?
Yes!
Is this Kamen Rider just came in
JOIN KAMEN FORCES
Oh, ok. cools
so... white
Hey, this love triangle reminds me of Twilight. Two monsters, one girl... n-not that I've ever seen it...
Not the NGE-movies, especially not the new ones. There are only so many story-lines i can keep track of.
Fluttershy is the BEST pony, tied with Rarity.
I AM HEER.
my bad then
Business casual to combat gear in 10 seconds flat
still alive
if not we might have to start a code yellow
ALL ponies are pest ponies
All of them have likable characteristics
... i think i'm gonmna be sick
We should watch spiders web a pigs tale instead.
re-PM'd it Scar, and thanks again :)
yeah
06,15Ohay Pegacorn

I wonder if they're going to have a three-some
That is green antis man
THEN I HAVE TO GO!
...Well, yeah
Other Kamen I...
Thank you for indulging me. I needed that
Threesome?
the one is the brown is black mantis man
the rebuild NGE movies are badass
No....nono, Twi and The Pie tie for #2
To be honest, Pinkie is 2nd best pont
BRILLIANT!
PEGACOOORN~~
*pony
Yes.
NGE?
To choose one for me is like asking what you like best about yourself.
/me explodes then reforms...
Okay...I thought we got over this
BJORNFOT!
Sup Pegacorn
fluttershy is the ultamate hooved creature
They love Oscar
i like scratch 2nd best
Now it's getting yaoy
@dashorcrash mine too :)
*starts new argument* so who is 2nd best pony?
Shinji in 2.0 is GODLIKE!
This is my new favorite comedy.
lol
OHHHH>
9stop it DERPDERPDERPDERP. Don't make me draw Sparkles and Pedowolf as THE FIRST versions of the Riders. Don't do it man.
I need popcorn
Huh... that was different Xel

brb
I plan on watching Transformers 86 for the first time on Blu ray tommorow
WHIZZBANG!
Everyone else is second best pony
Fairly usual for him.
who is the least likable pony???
9Shinji in SRW trascends Godhood
Always Rainbow dash
Ah
right, Im out. GG TTYL good night, have fun etc.
I agree with Scorchman
I prefer Emo-Shinji
In fact, the sheer amount of chaos for him is regular, making him very orderly.
those last 10 minutes
Fluttershy>Pinkie Pie>Twilight>Rainbow>everything else.
bai gold
RaInBoW dAsH is second best
I just got here from ED, how is this related to MLP? Just wondering..
It truely be...
later gold
*DEFEATED BY LOGIC!*
lol cya gold
if epic rap battle makes twlight sparkle vs edward cullen theres gonna be a flamewar.
YES
pedowolf?
PARADOX!!
Goof night GoldenArbiter
We're bronies.
shinji in 2.0 manages to be 2000% cooler than in all the rest of nge...and still be owned so bad it hurts
Its not really
That's the connection.
in the end
didnt the main character clop to a chick in a coma TheMaster?
pedobear you mean right?
Ponies are always related
06,15Well I'd rather we watch the entirety of KR Faiz, but I like this too. :P
3.0 needs to come out soon
a remodeled human?
Aside from the audience

13Pedowolf is like pedobear... only a wolf. :D
Ah, ok, I was getting a little confused
eeugh
You Got the Touch,, love that song, will like even more tommow
that can be taken so wrong
Search your feelings, you know its true.
you exploded then exploded again?
the original series was very dark. basically its the anti-ttgl
Barnaby Barnacle would improve this film.
i knew it was possible
:P
That's good though, it means nobody is going to get cut halfway through the season b/c they have no fans
i have to go guys... need finish my pmv... good bye ^^

Ooh, an island fortress! Very sinister!
oh hi island of doom
Fair enough XD
Needs more T-Pain.
Minecarts are superior to boats in every way
They need a bigger boat.
:)
/me jumps into said blasting chamber with a pinkie pie like joy! Then frowns... Seeing as Xel now must wait.
i've seen enough james bond hentais to know where this is going
Exept floating.
If Tom Hanks can make a raft, I think remodeled humans can make a boat
Hey, look! SCIENCE
what's in your hand? I have it.
minecraft FTW
EGAD!! tomorrow I ain't gonna watch the live action airbender movie

I like the music in the credits.
I was completely confused during the whole movies.

I'm just going to ignore scar now..

I liked it, but could have done without the love triangle stuff
[18:27:17] <ValtheJean> I'm going to put it bluntly: I will not, nor will I ever join #bunker. The things that go on there are borderline rulebreaking to begin with. At the moment I have no reason to take any action, because of that I will leave you all to your own agendas.

Hi lash!
Whenever you say pinkie pie like that you sound like a rapist.
er, incomplete to phrase it better.
Heya.
I totally want to make pony art
Mine would be a cupcake.

Welcome back!
I am fashionably late to this party
I still say Quiet Storm is the best OC pony.

I like cupcates
Just no there Pinkamena.

Shutup Eon-Flash

My cutie mark would be teh internets.
Wouldn't it be a whip because you're so whipped by your mother?
Oh shit, my question.
ACLEPSIOS STAFF
A cup of coffee.... with the steam making a heart

Wait...
I regret to inform you that, this is the internet.
Maybe a troll face.
O o/¯¯/_o___o___o___o____o__\__\¯¯o¯¯¯o¯¯¯¯¯¯o¯¯¯¯¯¯o﻿
13I have a little pony thing with a pony with a coffee cup as the cutie mark.
But of course. My mistake

(It was a joke)
No fireing of lazors here
6CHOO CHOO!
DARI WOULD HAVE A SONIC SCREWDRIVER
Blank flank.
Where's y lyric sheet? That did not sound right...
/me is still a blank flank

Sarcasm? What is this?
New DCD is Derek Styles
You can't unsee
:P
Forever a Blank Flank Valthejean
Hmm…Edward_Newgates questions seems…debatable…
ok im done
What is your favourite programming languages?
Wait, where is the url of their broadcast?
k
Did chat die?
Chat never dies
AAAAAAH I NEED TO PLAY MASS EFFECT 2
Calamity IS EPIC DAMMIT.
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Then again, don't remember if it references something.
/me is partially an OC
What are you wearing?
On the ten-point sexiness scale, how many deci-Daris is your voice?
my cutie mark would be...two hands shaking
:(
/me is an OC.
They hate you Octavia.
I was too busy listening to my question being answered
Why?
Do you stream naked?
or something relating to helping
My Flash crashed :(
Also on a side note, nobody can write a mass effect 2 pony crossover properly
Wouldn't it be two hooves shaking?
in b4 raging discussion about nyx
13I know Meanwhile. :(
My dash crashed :(
because its like my fav series ever mag
I know I can't!
Background ponies are not OC ponies, IMHO
We the people still love you though.
Mine crashed.
/me is OC
13lol
...yes it would, Slowter
On a scale of 1-10 how much do you love Nyx?
inb4 chicken reference.
im going to have to do it myself arent i?
were you there for the bronyville livestream?
Someone give me some cutatoe chips plox
/me liked Past Sins and Nyx.
13Well, I came up with Octavia's name. And theres a nother little tidbit about her that makes her me kinda.
I missed it, unfortunatley
Why dont you guys throw everybody a super seceret money money thing?
you know what i'd love to see? a fic with rainbow dash where she doesn't crash and break her wings...she just isn't that clumsy
You play double bass?
Hmmmmm
13No lol
I was there for the second half
I play Double Bass
I was Octavia once... Good times.... Good times.
I have never played it, because apparently, every choice takes you down a different path, and trying to comprehend it all would cause me to explode twice.
You're grey?
Determine the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 20.0 g of NaOH in sufficient water to yield a 482 cm3 solution?
good times
Background ponies are not OC ponies, IMHO
Do you guys feel that Zecora is a cannibal?
but I thought Octavia played cello
the only ones that have that are the shipping ones aren
Was it good/
?
What are your hobbies (besides Ponies :P) ?
What is the smooth jazz song used in the intermission
it was
13Not this again! XD
You're a pony?
this is why it annoys me
PErsonalities created for background ponies makes them OC Ponies.
because thats the easiest way to make rainbow dash seem complex is to break her
I'm not huge on the whole shipping thing
IT'S TOTALLY A CELLO!
Your arguement is flawed, therefore, I win.
it essentially gives her a false sense of depth
everyone was suffuring from sleep deprivation
13Well, people kinda... try to take over me... lol
2,14 inb4 massive answer spam
when her character is actually quite shallow
ohai Octavia
....Would a serial killer pony have to wear pants to cover his or her serial killer cutiemark?
o_o
Octavia.
Lol, there's my question.
I am watching Ponies, your argument is invalid
Um... Can I have both?
Fluttershy!
Some shipping works.
we couldnt stop laughing
I liek Colgate
That is the Correct Answer
Do any of you guys hunt?
That is a double entendre.
Some of it is an atrocity.
You're a rape victim?
HELP!!!! I am unable to view the movie even though it is online, what is wrong
RD
Thats a side effect of ponies, alright
it isn't that shallow...but nobody has tried to explore it properly
Eon-Flash uh, that was my opinion, not argument.
Pepsi or Fluttershy? Neither.
PEPSI
Fluttershy cuz I need to cut back on my soda.
2,14 mib: you're using dinkypage

Sarspirilla is another name for Root Beer, so Root Beer.
07,01mib_jvjdzs there's no movie on atm we're streaming a Q&A session
and then in argument they say that she cant run away from her feelings yadda yadda lame excuse for shipping
Never tries Sarsaparilla.
I'll have to go do that sometime
I would answer, but anyone who's ever read or heard of fanfics already knows my answer.
And que the Jeopardy theme
I've never tried it
Anypony know approx when this segment will be over and UHF will start?
4am is the best time
Which is your favorite testicle?
Approximately Later
@ Tolver: If you've had root beer, you've had sarsparilla.
07,01once we're out of questions..
Cupcakes.
07,01;)
My guess would be at 8
when in actuality if her wings DID break they would probably be ireperable
Is it just incoherant mumbling by then?
so, 11 est?
Would you bang me?
Luna that will never happen
black is a lack of any colour
All you do is take a cup of skittles, and add it to the mix.
13That'll be all night, Luna. :P
really dark grey
Luna: Oh wow, that will take forever :P
07,01indeed!
the livestream?
because normally she breaks them to shit
we'll never run out of questions
07,01FOREVER!
Luna, you gusy will never be out of questions.
white is reallhy light grey
Is Veewave successful troll?
OH. . . dear. . .
Skittles, taste the rainbow.
Yep
Would you bang Bjornfot?
That's a damn long time.
Turtaguin
not too much
ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS!
INappropriate question.
pikorar that's interesting.
Which one of you has the most testicles?
ALL OF THE COLOURS!
My favorite color is Ultraviolet.
Doctor I think I may be a homosexual! How can you tell?
The question is who wouldn
so she would probably always have a sad fanfic about suicide
RAINBOWWWSSSSS
everyone was just acting like they had smoked a joint
2,14 no more testicle questions
Quiet
Same for Furples.
All across the sky!
theres a rather peculiar question i have
but thats just my take on it
2,14 and sklar: last warning about comments
do you have a question for me to ask you?
Sounds funny
ty for that test
its nice to see colour spelled correctly
06Eat all the dashite!
eating like a pony is hard
especially in the chatroom
Rainbow Dash is made of skittles.
My favorite color is Rainbows too! They taste so delicious and moist! =D
How hard would you bang me?
I cmake them Moist
*perks up* but... i did write a song!
can you guys impersonate dari's accent??
Are we allowed to ask questions relating to genitalia?
Same goes for Bjornfot
VioletVanilla... why u eat me?
...
Pinkamena...
No sense crying over every mistake
come on.
XD
The chat is at least half the fun
Moist and delicious sandvich.
Do you read fanfic and if so, what is your favorite?
InsertCupcakes mfw Coulour is the British spelling.
/me 's head explodes at the science.
Just keep on trying till you run out of cake
if rainbow lost the ability to fly she probably would go suicidal..its her life. BUT it wouldnt be hard to write a fic where...i dont know shes a normal happy pony?
it totally is
I never thought they were spicy... Kinda tasted like blood.
Moist is such a unsettling word.
i would but i have fail writing skills
Moist
06Because you are my nom, and will be my delicious meal <3
some of us call it a sonic screwdriver
thats why I always watch new episodes on the chat
Moist
Xd
What is your favorite Metal?
blood just tastes like iron
Valthejean i didnt mean to do that last one i just hit the enter button by accident
Well, I wouldn't have given Furples voice :P
Sandvich is delicious AND moist.
2,14 fair enough
That's IMO
let me alone, i have to write at least 3000 words for chapter one of Infamare
*slumps down again* but i have no instumental talent...
eh, my mouse misclicked
23?
Yep, I was here for the airing of the discord episodes
Sanvich is made of "Rainbows"
instrumental*
this will take me long time
I'm delicious?
Ms. Dash.
So was that still my last warning or what
Lol.
me too
I can't wait to befriend Animal Crossing Bronies when AC:3DS comes out.
why not 20% cooler?
@ Slowter: Know what's funnier than 23? 24!
/me licks Dashite
2,14 yes...it was...
insertcupcakes Nevermind, you spelled it the British way, i spelled it wrong.
only time Ive woken up at 9 on a saturday
Okay
wonderfully creepy
My apologies for interrupting your flow of creativeness
of course im essentially following the plot of the game so it wont be tooo hard
i was a bit confused for a sec Crickettwb
Dari has favorite Doctor
oh i cant start yet
@ pikorar HAHAHAHHAAaa
mfw when I thought Tovlarw as talking about Ace Combat
I got up at 6
"I like... things... just things...."
im going to replay the game first
I think anything by Stephen King is great!
memorize the story
make it ponies
...
Also Poe is nice!
I had actually planned to get up at 9 but somehow got up 3 hours earlier
Edgar Allen Poe? @ PinkamenaDianePie
I kept waking up every hour after falling asleep to check the time
Do you enjoy tasting moist cupcakes, pinka?
Which type of pony would you prefer: Pegasus, Earth, or Unicorn? (Alicorn is cheating :P)
I keep forgetting about Silverscreen
Of course, silly philly!

That is, what pony would you be?
I enjoy tasting moist pinka.
Hello everypony.

Hello Jon

Since I have a lack of question s do you like the band XTC? I'm probably the only one here who knows who they are...
What is the smooth jazz song used in the intermission?
Yep, I hadn't been so excited in a long time
(Cartman's voice) Hooray you guys!

Why are we watching a skype call?
My hands smell like... Coconut.

plot holes? ... EWW!
WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THIS PLOT DEVELOPMENT!?
Did you atleast use the good boots?

Rainbow plot?
I can always folow a good plot.
SuperBrony64: Why thank you sir.
Although, I like what they did with her in the second episode
Lovely South Carolina. A state seriously lacking in bronies.
Yeah I've never heard of it but someone said Weird Als in it
How could she be your LEAST favorite pony?
maaag
Octavia has too many pictures of plot.

How many plots must a man walk, before you can call him a Brony?
You know that thing that you just can't stand no matter what
