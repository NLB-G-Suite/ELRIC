Probably because it's in Japanese
/me asks that you stop, collaborate and listen.
The Ambigously Gay Duo
no cells, DNA, homeostasis,
Just wait for the screaming and tentacles like thw rest of us.
Mantis men is my teacher yo!
:P I have discovered the smilies
"With snowflakes, we can cure cancer, and solve the worlds energy crisis."

This needs more fights with tentacle robots.
He comes hard
And Bronystate...is?
Well, cause I can chick
we should watch 96 hours
Conan the barbarian or Conan the talk show host
eeeyu...nope
Xel, are you underweight? :P
longer than it should be
this plot has changed like 5 times
:3

I give up on trying to follow the plot, none of this makes sense to me.
anyone reaad the TomXRocky fic?
Yet fun <3!
Walks on the beach!
I still don't know what's going on in their lives and i still don't care.
How about conan the barbarian talk show host
first we go from "evil organization with insect themed supervillians"
to "romance between two guys and...like 3 girls"
Ha ha ha
Arigato
Splashing!
This is more confusing than NGE, episode 26.
/me cringes at the music.

<<<< not caring about the movie no more
pony_4569 is being a bit unrelated…

I personally think Luna is best pony, but Fluttershy is up there to
Just needs a monocle and top hat
lol
9bannana: cause we already watched Paradise Lost
BAM!
FIGHT SCENE
Yes yes i know, terrible idea.

Yes!
Oh, ok. cools
Fluttershy is the BEST pony, tied with Rarity.
I AM HEER.
my bad then
still alive
if not we might have to start a code yellow
ALL ponies are pest ponies
All of them have likable characteristics
... i think i'm gonmna be sick
We should watch spiders web a pigs tale instead.
yeah
...
THEN I HAVE TO GO!
...Well, yeah
Thank you for indulging me. I needed that
Threesome?
To be honest, Pinkie is 2nd best pont
BRILLIANT!

9Shinji in SRW trascends Godhood
Always Rainbow dash
I agree with Scorchman
I prefer Emo-Shinji
those last 10 minutes
Fluttershy>Pinkie Pie>Twilight>Rainbow>everything else.
RaInBoW dAsH is second best
It truely be...
*DEFEATED BY LOGIC!*
YES
pedowolf?

That's the connection.
in the end
Ponies are always related

the only ones that have that are the shipping ones aren
Was it good/

it was
13Not this again! XD
You're a pony?
this is why it annoys me
PErsonalities created for background ponies makes them OC Ponies.
because thats the easiest way to make rainbow dash seem complex is to break her
I'm not huge on the whole shipping thing
IT'S TOTALLY A CELLO!
it essentially gives her a false sense of depth
