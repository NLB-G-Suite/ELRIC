theres a pony for that

RAWRity: Nah man, you're using the wrong magic. You need technomancy. It's difficult, but putting your tower in a closed fast-time dimension greatly increases speed. Great for gaming.
oh im back
Alister: Actually, I prefer flipflops
Put flame decals on your computer. It makes it faster.

well, everything needs more glitter
Did i miss the lottery

No putting hooves on the computer makes it faste. just get some from pikies basement

Iron_Edge: welcome back
Shimmer: howdy and good evening!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i wasnt a brony at the time
Hwy Shimmer :)
*hey
:|
Sylandest: -lol im just playing monster hunter. im still watching the stream and chat.
BowDownToTheSocks not really. I can't play hockey, but (almost) every Canadian LIKES hockey
Bronysith just checking is you
We don't like boyfriends round these parts. Unless we are boyfriends.
Well , I think I'll be going to sleep. Mares and Genltecolts. Good night to you !
Iron_Edge: ahh, i see. good choice!
first person to say "lyra needs hands" gets told he is is cool!
But you can post your very special somepony if you must
Alister: night! Take care! :)
Night night Alister :)
Lyra needs hands
Bee3ry: My boyfriend comes here sometimes :3
Lyra needs hams
mmm ham
Canadian_brony: point recieved. You could still play street hockey though.

North is Kim Jong Un
so yeah.
South is professional starcraft
0,14there's actually an explanation for why Korea enjoys Starcraft
North Korea is Best Korea
Shimmer: but-but why :'(
Shimmer. You. ARE. EPICLY EPIC AWESOME SAUSE but not as cool as bronysith
North doesn't have internet, so they can't play
BowDownToTheSocks I've tried, and I suck at that too. It doesn't help that my PE class either sucks more than me or plays hockey. Either your good at hockey or you suck at hockey
North Korea is full of nothing
Hugs DeathStar
/me hugs Ponies47
what about Rainbow Dash?
SaxyPretender: what is the explanation?
ooh starcraft
*gives bronysith a hug
So is that DeathStar or DanceStar? :S
Kim Jong Un has increased the chocolate ration from 2 squares a month to 1 square a year.
0,14well, there's a Go-like Korean game, that's very focused around strategy
just kidding, they don't have chocolate
Lyra: He belongs to the Solar Empire. I'm a Lunar Republican, which is infinitely more cooler
Canadian_brony: I suppose, i for one, suck at hockey. Good thing my dad isnt a fan ^^
Polydunami: what do you mean?
owlicious: Dat "increase" :D
im digging a hole
SaxyPretender: ahhh, so since they're familiar with the concept and idea already, they immediately cling to it?
0,14and Koreans value games like that, and Starcraft is kinda reminiscent of that, iirc
BowDownToTheSocks point taken
just kidding, i don't know. We don'
that sounds like when Boris Yeltsin doubled the legal drinking age in Russia. From 2 to 4.
0,14something like that, Sylandest
You know, Death and Dance sound kind of similar, kind of... right?
Shimmer lunar=luna=stupid
You did not just say that!
Well, they do where I live :S
Lyra did you just insult Princess Luna?
SaxyPretender: It makes sense to me. One could prolly draw a lot of comparisons between traditional games of a society and compare them to the popular video games of the same theme or concept
0,14eeyup
maybe
Polydunami: i guess.... if you scwint your ears
BowDownToTheSocks: Are you kidding? We're expected to be rude and obnoxious EVERYWHERE! It's way too much pressure
and someone left
Lyra: No awesome cloaks made of bats for enemies of the great Lunar Republic
hen3ry especially to Canadians
bye whoever!
I WUB U
0,14it's kinda why games with sexual content have a bigger risk of getting in trouble over things of a more violent nature
I suppose
BAI
0,14here in the US
not sure who taht was...
who's leaving?
bronysith is best human
Canadian_brony: Well, let's face it, we're just getting revenge for 1812.
The US is ridiculous when it comes to stuff that shows skin
SaxyPretender: eeyup. violence is in our nature easily and is easily accepted. Sexual content? oh lordy no, what have you done? :D
hen3ry: Yeah. we have to be especially mean to Canadians too. They're apperently way to nice for their own good.
0,14indeed
/me hums the war of 1812
BowDownToTheSocks actually, we have 12 ways to say sorry, but rarely apologize
is bronysith still here?
/me dances to hen3ry s humming
Shit, I missed the friday movie night...
hen3ry point taken. We even have a song about it!
Lyra: I believe bronysith is likely playing LoL at the moment
Lyra: No, he left you, you're all alone against the Lunar Republic now
Canadian_brony: I'm familiar with it
Oh well, at least I finally saw Sucker Punch during then
the white house burned, burned, burned, etc.
Good movie BTW. I suggest seeing it.
Shimmer i hate you
hen3ry that's the one!
I love and tolerate you Lyra
So, which Starcraft is this?
Eddmario: saw it when it first came out, hehe. It was indeed good
ok then prove it
/me glomps Shimmer
/me noms Lyra
Canadian_brony: I thought all Canadians were nice. It goes with all those other well known canadian stereotypes, like all Canadians love hockey, and Canada has really good Coffee
/me loves and tolerates Lyra with Shimmer
Canadian_brony: I've had a few Canadian friends online over the years. Met a few of em at ComiCon couple years back.
blech, the coffee is terrible, and makes me sick
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 10Azumarill.
/me dances some more
or maybe it's the cream
ah see SC2
Alas, the cute girl was a bit too young for me. But, such is life. Or liff.
sure
BowDownToTheSocks firstly, we are actually nice. Secondly, where did you get the coffee one? I only know of our diets consisting of snow and donuts
hen3ry nice
Who is streaming?

Polydunami is Canadian and has been known to get agitated from time to time :$
seeya Lyra
night, Lyra
I MUST STAY UP FOR 48 HOURS OR MORE I MUST! *Jumps around chat laughing like Daffy Duck*
owlicious also tends to refer to himself in the third person like trixie
/me lurks for Pegasisters again.

Bye Lyra :)
08,01suddenly, i feel hella tired
Ponies47: you can do it!
Ponies47 are you doing the Ultimate Brony Challenge?
Canadian_brony: Nope.avi. But I should sometime :P
I'm down with pegasisters as much as the next guy, but let's face it, there's a shortage.
DeathStar: *Squees* :)
I'm not angry at the moment, Sylandest. I do have my Berserk Buttons, though, and you'd regret pushing them.
08,01Canadian_brony: http://imgur.com/53hxW
Hey who agrees Fluttershy is BEST pony
I won't go so far as to invoke the "no girls on the internet" rule - at least not while Shizuka-san is there - but...
Canadian_brony: I honestly have no idea, i just heard that become a stereotype overtime. Though, i have one question. How can Canadians be so nice, yet play the most vicious, un-nice sport in the world(Hockey)?
Polydunami: I pray I never push them :$ warn me if I ever tread near them
08,01i felt that was necessary
Deadmau5: Hate to break it to you but RD is best pony
Sure, don't worry about it
Thats cool Shimmer
Oh for (squee) sake. (Inhales)
hah
BowDownToTheSocks because we're awesome like that
08,01Canadian_brony: don't worry about it, i don't mind
EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY! THERE IS NO 1 BETTER THAN THE REST! THERE ALL AWESOME! :[
Hmm... for me, it's a tossup between Rarity and Twilight Sparkle :3
08,01owlicious: the sun has been up for over an hour
I like Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy
RD is worst pony though.
*toss up
some ponies are more equal than others
Ponies47: RD is best pony. No discussion.
Rainbow Dash is pretty cool, actually
nopony will sleep on a bed with sheets
Canadian_brony: I wish i lived in Canada. Oh Canada, Oh Canada! Where the health care is so free!Eh.
Flarechaser WAT U SAY
Agian. EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY! :[

BowDownToTheSocks all you have to do is pretend you know the lyrics to Oh Canada, learn how to say Sorry, know when to use "eh?", and love donuts
My desk only has 12 square meters of surface space, there's no room for a mousepad

BowDownToTheSocks great! Now what's the capital of Nova Scotia?
08,01my mum is from India, but I don't speak Hindi or Telugu

Canadian_brony, I'm Canadian, it's HALIFAX
Slyandest: Thar be a Docto Who fan if i ever saw one
BowDownToTheSocks: correct-a-mundo! ...a word I hope to never use again XD
08,01Sylandest: who is best Doctor?
BowDownToTheSocks you may not fit in well with that answer. You're supposed to say "I don't know". Unless you live in the maritimes, like Polydunami over there
08,01Shimmer: i'm made of cake
08,01Sylandest: really? *really*?
08,01not Peter Davidson?
Canadian_brony, I actually live in Vancouver.
08,01not Tom frakking Baker?
Canadian_brony: Darn you internet! It's all your fault!
0,14Matt Smith is best Doctor :3
:(
¿Alguien habla español?
08,01Polydunami: <333
SaxyPretender: I <3 David Tennant, and nopony's telling me otherwise! :D
08,01and DeathStar <333
Polydunami . . . I'm in High School and I can't name 5 capitols if I tried. How do you know that?
BowDownToTheInternet it's Canadian Humour
Elpinkie: I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DAT! :'(
Canadian_brony: Be glad you're not a Yankee. We have to learn 50 of stupid things
0,14In all honesty, I'll admit that Tennant is THE Doctor, but Matt Smith is my favorite
Fu then
hehe, Regina
We were taught the provincial and territorial capitals in school. I guess I just have a head for those things :S
8,6anyone want to join us for some random mod game Shamroc is picking?
08,01Canadian_brony: i came out of high school knowing a lot of science and maths, but absolutely, and i mean absolutely absolutely, no geography or history
Slyandest: You should have said "fantastic"! Its the only Doctor Who-ish kinda fitting thing i could think of.
08,01because in Scotland, humanities are electives
08,01are are sciences
08,01*as are
But Saxy, Tom Baker is THE Doctor
SaxyPretender: fair enough, lol
0,14...DOCTOR FIGHT
no se puede entender a aprender español ponies47?
I only know that the capital of Florida is Tallahassee because of Tallahassee :3
Canadian_brony: Did i miss something. What is this "Canadian humor" you speak of?
SaxyPretender: David Tennant uses his swag
Lets see... Juneau and Honolulu, Olympia, Salem and Sacramento
Polydunami: States have capitals now? O.o
0,14Elpinkie, por favor, hable en ingles, es parte de las reglas
Boise, Helena, Cheyenne, Salt Lake City, Carson City, Phoenix and Santa Fe.
Apparently >.>
I thought bronystate rules said only english in chat, SaxyPretender :|
08,01SaxyPretender: nice, i could infer the meaning of that, even though i don't speak a word of spanish
Bismarck, Pierre, Omaha, Lincoln, Oklahoma City and Austin
CowDownToTheSocks it's Canadian HUMOUR (with a U), and it consists of jokes that only Canadians would fully understand
Slyandest: You should have said "fantastic"! Its the only Doctor Who-ish kinda fitting thing i could think of.
08,01mainly from my knowledge of latin
SaxyPretender: XD
It's like making love in a canoe
^Old Canadian proverb

08,01ooooo

08,01because it's AWESOME!
Canadian_brony: MMM Coca Cola :)
Canadian_brony: Hmmm.... I didn't think of that, but hey, sure!
BowDownToTheSocks: Each Doctor has their own magic, hehe. oh, and for name typing, just use the tab button. much easier :D
08,01but only had half a season :(
Quebec is easy
....it's Quebec
Tolver: Tulsa, Montreal and Los Angeles, respectively
TROLOLOLOLO
Tovler, the capital of Quebec should be REALLY to remember
I thought Hartford was Connecticut.
CrimsonPhoenix well, duh
13speaking of which maybe sometime i should stream journeyman project 3
hen3ry, it's Quebec :/
0,14I think it was, Tovler
lol
Quebec City.
08,01Shizuka: I REMEMBER THAT GAME!
Nope. It's Montreal, Quebec, and it's Los Angeles, Mexico.
/me was implying that OKC was the capital of Oklahoma.
Slyandest: Confusion, how does this tab button work for this, i just get a blank box. Also, i just dont feel there are enough aliens in the new series, like space
I'm now chocolate cake. Sorry the e in cake wouldn't fit :(
08,01no-one's streamed Babylon 5 yet, have they?
hen3ry, the shit you're talking about
/me 08,01adds it to the list
0,14er, as in Hartford is the capital of CT
It's Quebec in quebec
I LIVE in quebec
I SHOULD know
BowDownToTheSocks: type the first couple of letters, and then push tab. For example, for my name, type "syl" and then push tab
yeah, Hartford is CT, not New Haven. Well, 49 out of 50 is still passing.
:$
Sylandest: Oh cool! Thanks!
BowDownToTheSocks: no problem, glad I could help :) its a handy trick
Portland is neither the capital of Maine nor Oregon

11,01Polydunami: No problem. I was just continuing where Sumica couldn't due to his internet issues.
Seriously, Werid all in aquabats?
Weird**
sonicrainboomer259: I like all of the songs. I still haven't even started Portal 2 because steam is being itself. I liked the theme of the first Portal
For some reason I want to hope that's a step closer to weird all in MLP
Iron_Edge I was just about to say something to you, something about the Mane 6 . . .
I love aquabats\
CrimsonPhoenix: all will fall under our power...it cannot be stopped
AND I'M STILL ALIVE

Phase4: no, omg, really?
Thanks, kirx :3
*kirz :S
inkie pie is in Aquabat? She's canon?
hi Phase4. Are you sane?
sonicrainboomer259: Yes, it's quite sad. Sometimes when i'm drawing it that song will end and i just won't notice so i get bored not knowing why. Then i quit drawing. See, if that song were longer maybe i wouldnt get bored as easily
00,02Canadian_brony, i think i am
Phase4, it's not your fault.
Phase4, I admit that's pretty cool
Ohai Phase4 :)
http://www.tvguide.com/News/Weird-Al-Aquabats-1048890.aspx BUT THIS IS 1000 TIMES BETTER
Phase4: you may think you are sane
Well, that was awkward :S
*eye twitchs*
I felt like Kammerjunk there :$
BowDownToTheSocks: I meant the whole game,beat in about five hours
Canadian_brony: hahahaha....dont let me get a hold of your OC....or you and a few of the main 6 are gonna have some fun -lol

Can one show contain both Weird Al and Pinkie Pie, as well as the Aquabats regular antics, without exploding into the real world?
StupidSexyCJ: for the moment
RX-78-SweetieBot: u serious?
00,02RX-78-SweetieBot, we'll find out
sonicrainboomer259: i know right? (I thought you were talking about the song before, sorry) I loved Portal but it killed me when it ended... and for that matter when the cake was actually real
Phase4 I was sent it twice. I think my eye is starting to twitch . . . HELP ME?
Iron_Edge what OC? I can't draw
00,02Canadian_brony, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1842/

Phase4 thanks
Canadian_brony: kool, then maybe i'll see if I can convince fluttershy to make you wish you werent single :D -lol
/me drinks more Coa Cola
Iron_Edge: you and your drawing shenanigans...:D
mmm. Coa Cola
Iron_Edge I'm going to tell you this right now: she ain't my fav. pony
BowDownToTheSocks: I have the X-box version,and it's an XBLA title,so it being short is understandable,and WHY DID RATMANN SAY THE CAKE IS A LIE?!
Iron_Edge do you think you can guess who it is? She's part of the Mane 6
Canadian_brony: Really now?? The riddle me this guy....who is? You can tell your brother Iron :)
lol
Iron_Edge guess. There are 5 left
Canadian_brony: Twi/

Iron_Edge still no
Canadian_brony: -lol RD?
Canadian_brony: :D
Iron_Edge eeyup
Guys. Very important thing. I just learned it. Three Deathcaps is overkill. That is all.
GNIGHT EVERYPOONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL AND MAY YOU PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR PASSION
Canadian_brony: Of course -lol
night, Bronysith!
bye BronySith
power PC + aircrack
Goodnight Bronysith! NO SLEEP FOR ME! :p
powerful*
03...
/me puts a sleeping spell on Ponies47
Iron_Edge but the REAL question is: do you know why?
03it doesn't work like that
03it's an open connection, but it redirects you to one of those "pay or gtfo" pagesc
sonicrainboomer259: I have the PC version. I never play PC games and for some reason i thought all PC games were all oddly long(I usually play games on XBOX) So when the game ended so sunddenly, im sitting there like "I should have savored it!!" Anyway, that cake didnt look too aperizing anyway, with pecans and all that
Night Brony- damn he's gone.
she's rainbow dash you dont need a reason why -lol
03apparently you can access Amazon for free so you can "shop while you fly" but that's it
03so, not sure if I could exploit that xD
Good thing I was where this *Show magic proof vest* :)
03maybe cgiproxy hosted by Amazon web services?
*Shows
oh god those things
03yeah
I haven't really had the time or resources to try those
Iron_Edge okay, yeah, but I go deeper than that
03my school has one of those systems
BowDownToTheSocks: what's your Gamertag?
But I've never managed to exploit them
you can try bruteforcing but
that takes forever
Canadian_brony: You've obviously had some kind of wet dream then. -lol or a clop episode :D
sonicrainboomer259: Wooky678
But if you have the username, it's usually a 6-8 character pass
13i'd offer to let people come mow down bots with me but i know asuka starts crying above more than like 3 people when the rest are CPU
Canadian_brony: but I wont delve into what you arent willing to tell -lol
Anyway bbl
sonicrainboomer259: whats yours?
Post Stream over? or continuing shortly?
Shizuka: i wanna join! ;p
Shoulda never named my rocket after Celestia. Stupid thing is trollin me
Iron_Edge, Rainbow Dash may be egotistical, but she still looks out for her friends.
Iron_Edge she is how I first discovered the show, actually
Polydunami: true :)
Shizuka: I thought Asuka started crying when Angel aliens showed up to mindfuck her.
Canadian_brony: -lol love at first sight then. Cute haha.
ooooooooooo hhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiii :)
03LOL bruteforcing
03it goes by email afaik
sadly enough,perfectchief22(it will be my account name on here when i get the ten bucks
03but this is the middle of June, I doubt they'd be doing anything like that
im 2000km from my desktop
Ah
I've only ever used that system a few times
howdy ACS13123
That's a long USB cable! :)
Iron_Edge I watched the Starscream vs Rainbow Dash fight thinking that Starscream would win, but I was totally shocked by the fact that she won. It amazed me that a show MY 6-YEAR-OLD SISTER watches has a character that could obliterate Starscream. The rest is history
So I don't really have enough experience or knowledge to attempt to exploit it
8,6Shizuka's computer is named asuka
I don't even know what the software is
HOORAY! IT'S COLD IN MY ROOM FOR ONCE! *Shivers*
Sorry, can't help you here
ANYWAY

seriously!
/me dances
http://weheartit.com/entry/9114905
00,02is anyone streaming right now?
Nope
My third moon landing, alas, is likely doomed to end like my first - not enough fuel really to make it back to a safe spashdown. Going for 270 rather than 90 was a mistake.
fate has ordained that the three brave kerbonauts who came in peace to explore the Mun, shall rest in peace there.
They will rest in peace... Cozyy and comfy with Princess Luna! :)
Tis a far, far better place than here.
13and promptly crashes
Shizuka jinked
jinxed
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: indeed
13gimme sec, loading it back up
Oh, what jinx dost thou referest to?
13is there an A/D cp map with water?
So, landing on the moon, do you do it by slowing down with rockets in real life, or is the game different somehow? Do you use the normal ship, or do you use a LEM?
The way I do it is this.
Shizuka...uhh....idk..
I have a three stage rocket (technically there's a fourth solid booster stage, but it's just a temporary one)
don't remember
13dust it is
the top stage is my lander. It has one vectoring engine, and six fuel tanks (two tower, plus four attached to the side)
I use the guidance wings as landing gear - the bottom tips of them are just a bit lower than the bottom of the engine
13i'm up
As I approach the Mun in final approach, I try to keep my rocket's nose pointed straight up most of the time, except when I'm tilted to kill any lateral velocity - so when I'm on my final 10k meters to approach, I have ideally zero momentum in any direction except stright up and down relative to the munar surface
Who is streaming
holy holy hell phase
Suddenly... STREAM!
gah
Shizuka: I WANNA PLAY!
suddenly mission
Suddenly, reason to stay! :)
The last thousand meters or so to approach, I try to keep my speed below 20 m/s, and the last couple hundred meters, I throttle up a bit to slow to about 2 m/s, which is a safe landing speed - if I haven't ended up on the side of a munar mountain, anyway.
Sumica: that you streaming?

Iron_Edge ME!!! :d
MadSurge, my favorite is Cerabella, but it isnt who I use.
Ponies47: Word of warning. Don't got past a week, atleast.
mario_pony: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4927/
mario_pony: we didn't break up you have to be dateing to break up
ironic that the spy disguises as a soldier
Ninjazz|DaFeelz: Teh he :$

WallDives: who are your mains then?
http://fav.me/d53rwwc sylandest x Applejack

Iron_Edge Is your name Keith?
MadSurge, Peacock/Double (because I'm such a zoning scrub)
mario_pony: I've been wanting to use that :P
BroKnee: Yes sir....yes it is.
Iron_Edge: I love the sweat running down his temple. :D
hi every one what did i miss
Hey deathstar & sumica have you guys ever played DUKEM forever?
Ninjazz|DaFeelz: -lol :D
Iron_Edge No offence, but I dislike your name, I had to be honest with you
that game sucks
i mean DUKE NUKEM?
BroKnee: Meh, to each his own guy.
well the new one sucks
00,10nope
Hah, sylaandest xD
DUKE NUKEM is overrated.
Hows DUKE NUKEM sucks?
WallDives: I try using Peacock/Ms Fortune/Cerebella :D
ihave the game
BroKnee: to be truthful my actual name is "Gary Markeith Griffin"
Iron_Edge and now I respect you fully ^.^ I like the people that let others have their opinion <3
xxMoopyxx: the new one sucks
Duke Nukem Forever. I believe that's the game they meant to say
MadSurge, absolutely no synergy in that team...
O hai Sumica. Do you thinks it's bad to go over 30 hours with no sleep? :P
O_O
BroKnee: -lol :)
well i have it for the xbox
xxMoopyxx: i have xbox
we do
Iron_Edge you are my new 2nd fav pony :3 Thats saying ALOT
WallDives: I'm a noob :D also the early Duke Nukem platformers are cute
BroKnee: -lol Well I appreciate the kind words sir ^-^
Wait xxMoopyxx I have played with you before on xbox you heard my voice allready right
did it sound something like this
Moooo
Iron_Edge and I appreciate your possitive personality :)
mario_pony: yup
MadSurge, a suggestion, then? You might want to drop Peacock, and put Fortune on point. Cerebella is a real good anchor.
Hey cow334 have you ever been online dude like yesterday man?
Although I havent played you, nor do I know your primary tactics.
no sleep and something something make hen3ry go crazy. Since Ponies47 started out crazy, this could be bad.
WallDives: I like Cerebella's huge range :D
xxMoopyxx: naw I havent been online latley i have been having fun on teamfortress for pc

Ponies47: go to sleep right now

Ponies47 DAMMIT stop doing the eye twitch thing, every time I read it I do it Dx
Iron_Edge: WHAT WY YOU CSLL A FOUL ON ME
MadSurge, I like that Cerebella is completely harmless on the other side of the screen.
hen3ry: pfft. So my mane is all messy *points at mane* and my eyes are bloodshot *points at eyes* I'M JUST FINE! :D
CALL

BroKnee: *Ear twitchs*

hi star
man, why cant I convert "Cupcakes.flac" into mp3 :(
hi Starflash ;)
Hi Starflash! I has been up for 38 hours and 6 min strraight :P
*straight
Gratz Ponies47 :D is that a new record?
58:6 /)
I'm winnning
2 minutes here :D
Starflash: eeyep and I'm still going. :)
Dx it suuuuuuuuuuuck
this game is cool
Final boss is disapointing though
this game ended too quickly
BroKnee: well then i see no point in playing the game yall two are doing
and yeah
it was very short
Spell-of-Gaming theys won't Flash is unstable, very unsecure and (jusging by the current trends) abselete for Video-Viewing in the Internet in a few years
BroKnee: just listen to me when i say this real quick
even with the extra missions
i expected more bosses
cow334 to prove who is superior :p
I expected more act
BroKnee: nonono like let me explian
cow334 okhai
hey a Trailer for the new Amnesia game :O
and yeah a boss at the end of the zone would be better
00,02Lil_B, i blame internet explorer for it not being obsolete now
Never played Sonic Generations :$
00,02that and the mpeg consortium
like a memorable boss for each game that the zone represent
^
Phase4 I use Maxthon, I like the new Option in Youtube to be a tester for HTML5- Video
I would be ok with the eggball coming back for the millionth time
BroKnee: Okay you no how you been up longer then Ponies47 well that is not fair cause a game like that is sopossed to be were you start at the SAME EXACT TIME cause if you dont then NO MATTER HOW MUCH Ponies47 AND YOU STAY UP TOGETHER HE WILL ALWAYS BE LOSING cause you have more ahead of him in staying up so my opionion
00,02ok, i dont know if this streams
I am officially too bored to do maths work now
So I'm going to game instead
Exponential differentiation/integration is so easy
Holy cow334 that was hard on my brain
00,02can you guys see the game?
I don't :(
00,02DAMNIT
cow334 nononono thats not how it is, we both stayed up along time then I said "Lets have a compeition to see who can stay up longer starting now" So I've been up longer but it doesnt count
cow334: It's true :"(
:'(
00,02Y U NO STREAM
Phase4: the stream is laggin
lagging
BroKnee: well what you just said DOSENT MAKE ANY SENCE AT ALL NOW in my opionion
when i was a little filly and the stream was going dooooown , the blackscreen and the laaaag would always bring me dooown
cow334 how?
cow334: sense
cow334 We started at a certain time, the time before that does not count
BroKnee: GIVE ME A SECOND TO PROVE YOU WRONG THEN
There we go, though the stream is constantly cutting out right now...dunno if that's from the game breaking the screen or if it's something else.
aaaaand off to bed so for one last time. http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/328/167/ab1.png This picture has pique my interest for some reason even though I'm sure it's nothing official.
cow334 Gives you 1 second....your time is up
30min until I'll go to my first Brony meetup :3
CrimsonPhoenix: I have my doubts about it's legitimacy...everyone knows chickens can't fly :P
00,02i'm going to assume this is working
OtakuTom, Joke aside
Lil_B: That sounds like fun. I wish I had bronies to hang out with :'(
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that Android application developers are too lazy to implement Flash on their browsers...
This could be an interesting turn oh the show
Ponies47 you are hanging around with them right now :)
00,02excelent, working
CrimsonPhoenix: It's still fitting...unless there's gonna be an episode where Scootaloo learns how to, isn't Scootaloo unable to fly?
Lil_B: *squees* SO TRUE! :D
what's this game Phase4?
00,02trackmania united forever
I'm going to dance off to bed now good night everypony
Cheers.
BroKnee: REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID THE EXTRA TIME DIDN'T COUNT WILL LOOK AT THIS [04:06:26] <BroKnee> 58:6 /)[04:06:36] <BroKnee> I'm winnning BUT IF YOU LOOK AT Ponies47 HE SAID [04:06:07] <Ponies47> Hi Starflash! I has been up for 38 hours and 6 min strraight SEE I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT THE OTHER TIME DIDN'T COUNT BUT YET YOU ARE STILL HIGHER THEN HIM ..............pfft i win fool
OtakuTom, She's still a filly though, she does have all the time in her life to learn to fly
Night ngiht DeathStar :)

holy crap, a text wall
and seriously, a scoot episode is deeply in need

Sleep records are useless since if you're gonna claim your award for the record, you'll fall asleep anyway. :P
Night night CrimsonPhoenix :)

Hey Phase4, before you start playing KSP, can you tell me what Linux distro you use or would recommend? I'm current downloading both desktop versions of Mint (Cinnamon and MATE).
BroKnee: Look what you just said agian was all wrong wronger then anything out there im done i dont even want to explain this to you if you want to have an unfair game the fine do it but i just want you to know you are wrong but lets just let this go cause i i am getting mad and really dont want this to end where i make it that you will hate me for the rest of your life cause to tell you the truth i can say some pretty harsh stuff
dat wall
besides i am a cow i dont know anything
mooo boo
then fine
?
cow334 To tell the truth, go ahead ^-^ litteraly the ONLY thing that offends me is the word "fool"
cow334 And there isn't a single person on this Earth that could possible do anything to make me hate them for ever, I love everyone
BroKnee: bra i said jrop it now leave me alone before i mute you

00,10btw an arrow spike will burn through a tank of fuel before you hit the end of the runway
Why is this game so much fun anways?
00,10and flaps are broke as fuck
Phase4: it is okay if you explode you should have seen Sumica each one he made went BOOM it was halarious :D
So wait... a whip is as strong as a Sonic Rainboom?
Add a vertical fin for stability, and maybe some wheels to help prevent the cockpit from exploding upon landing?
Sumica OtakuTom war right: it's Kerbal, not Kepler ^^
00,10I have managed to fly one safely, just not on stream and it never got more then 12km up
00,10oki

nothing yet:D im home alone:d
OtakuTom that the problem i want to own both but in my choicing i would go vita first
that even looks like a proper rocket
OtakuTom 3ds can come after if they have a redesign.
I think the Vita is going to suffer the same issues the PSP did
I've already played my Vita more than I ever did my PSP, Evil_Spike...lol
There is no reason for me to consider getting a vita at the moment
ok it dicided Ps vita first then 3ds after it get a redesign..
Morning ponies one and all. I greet you with a loving call. ^_^
good morning, FairysHuff.
It's 3 AM here
xD
hello OtakuTom
The 3DS's design is good enough as it is, though I wish I could get my hands on the 2nd joypay attachment. Trying to play Kid Icarus without it can be a pain. Beyond that, I haven't played a game where I thought the controls were bad.
wops
3am is still morning ^_^
It's 6:15PM here in Perth
hello FairysHuff
Morning FairysHuff
Luckeh
I'm starving
Lol
OtakuTom i know the 3ds design is good enough allready the fact is the 2nd controller got to me convern if I should get it now
Because when you live on your own, you can do that
It's a lovely summer day here in Scotland. The rain is lashing down. The wind is whipping the trees. ^_^ I love it.
Also, you can buy gaming consoles which are exactly the same age as you
Mega Drive, anypony?

Congratulations!
somepony get the cider! its time to celibrate!
00,02now what
wrg
Now come down to earth
stranded forever
and crash
xD
My only complaint about the Vita is the whole thing with them cancelling the PSP register/download feature...really makes me angry that I have to rebuy all the titles I want to play...the battery life on the Vita is so much better than the PSP.
Wait, it's older than me by about 2 or 3 years
00,02clearly i should leave the engin in orbit
Phase4: Is it possible to set the audio options to headphones, cause i hear the engines either on the right OR the left side and this starts hurting my ears ...
THE NEW MOON..
00,02diddutz1, i'm not sure
x
GO FIND LUNA
OtakuTom I have to agree on that but im lucky i only own 2 original game.. while other are pirated :)
lol
Evil_Spike: HAH! Your old like me ^_^
I have a few import games on my PSP that I'll have to keep playing on that. Oh! Speaking of which, the Vita is also region free, so you can import games there, too :)
Sadly, the 3DS is region locked...I've got a few import games on my normal DS that I still play.
I can't use handhelds. They strain my eyes.
3RD ASTRONAUGHT FARTED

WallDives: All games include some form of conflict xD
FairysHuff, you mean the ones that I've had since launch that I play with friends irl?
00,10seperation under full burn is bad
00,02clearly i have no idea what i'm doing
WallDives: Wait.... you have friends? O_o Show off ^_^

because Street Fighter/Marvel/SFxT/KoF + Lag = joke
Okay...gotta move to my bedroom...afk a bit.
FairysHuff, I go to tournaments. I have to practice in a lag-free environment against other players...

00,10the scram jets dont do well in thick air
I'm falling asleep again. And only just woke. Damn my twisty drowsy head. >_<
Gosh I frigin wub all ye guys <3 :3
00,02theres no way to land this thing
If I stop responding then I have passed out.

00,10that's why it has chutes and a sepration collar
FairysHuff, coffee or something.
You need moar POWER
Ponies47 ye still up? xD
We need to get an actual designer from NASA to make something on here
X3
WallDives: I have caffeine pills but it seems my heart doesn't like em. Makes it rattle around in there like.... um... something that rattles alot
00,10the problem is the plane desginer is still new
00,10it's very buggy
00,0220K
FairysHuff, then you shouldnt take those.
Really add two more boosters and angle tehm down 12 degrees
you should take off then
00,10the engins will stall at 26k
WallDives: Yup. They don't seem to work anyways
00,10no air
00,02i'm falling
00,02why am i falling
then I dont know what to suggest, FairysHuff.
you're in a bit of a fuel trouble there
Ello there, conquering space again?
hey Malavolent hows your day been
what game is this
xD
WallDives: Nothing you can suggest. This has been a problem for years. And doctors have been no help ^_^ Just have to live with it
alexxm: Good, good :) What about yours?
00,02yeah
00,02i broke it

Does anypony wana play sumthin? I'm bored :/
take care Reddhero12
if anyones wonderung, 0.15 seems to be available at thepirTEBAY
BroKnee: I'm going to go play NWN in a bit if I don't fall sleep
NWN?
Trying out a game by pirating it is the closest way to trying it out properly. :P
FairyHuff whats that
?
that flip wouldve broken their necks
Demos kinda suck.
Spell-of-Gaming yo ho ho a pirate for me
and then they're stranded in the ocean
FOREVER
BroKnee: Never Winter Nights
FairysHuff Never heard of it
BroKnee: You can get it for $10 on GOG.com
kia..
BroKnee: Tis just a pc D&D rpg.
It is also a plane simulator now?
they always die in this game
im trixie rocking to the show got some magic ticks so here we go, were gonna have some FUN hold on to your hats
cute
Phase4: Now you're playing H.A.W.X
BroKnee: If you like magic, fantasy and customising your own character its the game for you.
FairysHuff Sounds like my game, depending on the types of magic
bigger delta wings?
you lost some chutes there
FairysHuff: You know you are a gamer when you can have a sentence contain more abriviations than words
FairysHuff: I thought we had iOS and Android apps for that...
BroKnee: It's D&D based so it has all types ^_^
Om: Too true ^_^
FairysHuff Blood magic? :p
D&D Do and Die?
Lawful Neutral, what?
Spell-of-Gaming: WIth the what now?
Lulz.
BroKnee: Necromancy.
that was quick
LightTrooper105: Dungeons and Dragons.
FairysHuff Blood magic and Necromancy are very different :)
um
LIGHTNING BOLT
...
Flutterchu?
Magic Missile at the darkness.
i'm assuming thats not good
00,02this is not working
Oh my...
why am I finding Phase4 blowing his ship or plan funny..
yes
BroKnee: in D&D you can mix and match everything. Much more customisable that DAO.
Sooo many deaths.
why do they keep coming back just to die
00,02why does the left wing allways lift
Ho-hum, just another day at Kerbal space program. K. I. A.
FairysHuff Idk what DAO is xD
Dragon Age Origins
put the wheels in the wings
I find it hilarious how people die in experimental planes.
Cooking food while listening to pony music
It is awesome
BOOOOOOM
OH! OH! OOOOH!!! Every pony! Could we start a regular D&D get together? ^_^
Pleeeeeeeeeeeease#?
I has no one to plays with. ~_~
something must be off centre
can we have cave johnson commetating on this
I'm already in a Savage Worlds pony campaign
FairysHuff: If you do I'll be the ignorant noob. :D
Hi Everypony!
is savage worlds goof Evil_Spike
/me hugs FairysHuff
Ohai Kriel_Pony!
Ohai Kriel_Pony
hey Kriel_Pony hows your day been
MadSurge: Don't worry, I've only ever played D&D on PC games like Baldurs Gate ^_^
It's relatively easy to learn
Dat SuperBrony64 :3
Dat SuperBrony64
11,02O.O
I tried learning the 3.5 rules but too confusing. So switched to 4
But I've been planning on starting a Fallout Equestria campaign using Cortex system rules
pretty good, alexxm! Well, mostly spent on a programming project, but it is DONE, so NOW im in a pretty good mood!
11,02Dat me O~O
4th ed sycjs
EDIT sucks
3.5 ed > 4th ed
good to hear Kriel_Pony what was the project
Hey, I'm back!
Indeed
Evil_Spike: I wouldn't know. I've only ever played the PC games.
Damn you, government
Has anypony ever used the Cortex system?
11,02I'm off to bed, night all ^-^
Just a project for school, programming matrix concatenation
00,02gnight SuperBrony64
I'd like to play D&D in person someday.
00,02sleep well
Baldur's Gate I believe is based either off D&D 3rd ed or 3.5e
bye SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: Nighty night
11,02I will ^-^
Nothing major, jsut more time than I would like bughunting
Bai SuperBrony64
Night SuperBrony64
night SuperBrony64
so, what are we watching here?
Evil_Spike: No. BG is based on second edition as they still have THACO
Ah
Dear government, why did you have to implement the K-12 system in our country
I'm not completely learned in Tabletop RPGs
Evil_Spike: NWN1 uses 3.0 and NWN2 uses 3.5
Evil_Spike: Neither am I. I learned all I know from the PC games ^_^ LOL
Malevolent, just visit your local uni, I'm sure there will be a few people who want to run a D&D campaign
Or geek shop
Evil_Spike: If your talking to me I don't like just turning up at a place with strangers.
Evil_Spike: Neither of these things is close to me.
Evil_Spike: I'd want to people I atleast vageuely know
*Play
FairysHuff: Well, then jsut make your friends play!
00,02that ran out of fuel fast
Are you part of any brony groups?
00,10arrow spikes sure run out of fuel fast dont they
Kriel_Pony: I don't have any
Phase4: That thing is supposed to get into space?
Fial
00,02Malavolent, no, this is a plane
Evil_Spike: Me?
00,02my spacecraft are marginly more successfull
Well they didn't die, at least
Awww.
You or Malavolent
Has anyone get to the moon?
I have a classmate who knows a lot about the internet, she's a girl. :P
FairysHuff: Well ,then the geek shop option can kill two birds with one stone. Visit regularly, buy some dice, maybie a book or two, and chat people up. Get to know them, THEN game with them.
Evil_Spike: I just joined the Edinburgh Group online yesterday.
Ask if anypony is running a campaign or thinking of running one.
Phase4: ever treid to build a rocket with a plane strapped to it?
Then ask if you can join
haha
Kriel_Pony: Sadly the only geek shop near here is one that only plays Warhammer ^_^ And nothing else.
Gotta love the explosions
00,02Dark_Horst, nope
YAYYY ALL DEAD :D
No Magic The Gathering locations?
not sure if this is even possible here, Dark_Horst
Night every one
Night cow334
night cow334
Kriel_Pony: Shame about that... Lets see... I met one group I gamed with at the local community college where my friend was going
bye cow334
Night cow334 wubs for ye <3
Why did I jsut send that to ME?
spinning is bad for you
Night cow334
Most unis have a gaming club
Kriel_Pony: Because your lost... IN THE INCEPTION! O_O
Why is it that all my engines or boosters are significantly smaller in size compared to the rest of my ship? Is there an option to resize them or anything?
FairysHuff: Um... im running out of options... -I- would offer, but the odds of being geographically close to someone online is astronomical
Kriel_Pony: Very true. ^_^ Scotland?
FairysHuff: Sorry, USA
Kriel_Pony: I thought that ^_^
:) I just realized I have no hangover repercussions from last night - Huzzah!
Not many play here in the UK
so what did you guys think of black sheep
...Meh.
Kriel_Pony: Nah. Don't worry, your warbanner isn't loose ^_~
Fairyshuff where in the uk are you
alexxm: Scotland Central.
i'm in croydon myself
strangely I dont remember much of the movie stream....I do remember Black Sheep
I'm in hell myself ^_^ LOL
FairysHuff: I thoguht hell was in the caribbean....
what happened to the other B movie? non existent or last minute change?
No, that's only when the rum is gone
lawl?
Kriel_Pony: Nope. It's a small town in scotland completely over-run by NEDs >_> Grrr... wish we could own guns.
Kriel_Pony: Non Educated Delinquant. Scottish term. Search it and look at google images. You'll get the idea
Ok guys, checking out for a while. See you at least for European Movie Night! :)
In England they are called Chavs.
Council House and Violence.
FairysHuff: I think around here we just call them douchebags...
Kriel_Pony: If I had a gun I'd call them target practice.
Tripodular Sets, Phase4
00,02?
this cant fail
seems legit
:D
FairysHuff: I could get a gun, but honestly I am PRETTY sure I would shoot myself.
Kriel_Pony: Positives and negatives to having guns legal.
xtreme spinning
Kriel_Pony: Self defence is a + but then every nut job having a gun is a -
00,10damn buffer
FairysHuff: Yup. And me NOT getting a gun because I don't trust myself to use it responsibly is an important part of gun regulation.
yay for owning a gun.
Kriel_Pony: Yup. Crossbows and bows are legal here in the UK though ^_^
carrying a gun where everybody else isn't allowed to is best
00,02hmm
I could do some old fashioned medieval NED hunting ^_^
FairysHuff: Ohhhhh, target practice it is, then!
00,02i think the stream silently failed
00,02back up now
FairysHuff: If the police stop you, simply explain that you are contributing to the gene pool as a whole.
Kriel_Pony: One problem... The meds I'm on cause muscle weakness which equals extremely poor aim ^_^
00,02props to Sumica for the craft
FairysHuff: That is what bipods are for.
00,10this can only end in laughter
Kriel_Pony: I'd probably get a commendation
00,10it totaly worked on bebop
stay on target
00,02seems legit
Kriel_Pony: Can't use a bi-pod with a bow. And cross-bows aren't accurate to begin with.
Dafuq? :D
00,10nose boosters
Phase4: atleast you stayed on target
00,10I should probably build a sepration system
00,10that is so gonna over heat
Kriel_Pony: I don't even know if you can get bi-pods for crossbows. O_o
wat
00,10meltdown
all of my wat
phase cut
00,02this is a smidge unsafe
FairysHuff: There are some accurate crossbows out there. And you can indeed get bipods for them. Once, for a school assignment, I guilt a crossbow out of scrap metal fro man old truck. Found some site online with bipods. this WAS years ago.
the enginse
Wat?
A...smidge...a SMIDGE?!
00,10have to throttle down to use the chutes
*cough* do a barrel roll *cough*
>.>
<.<
Ninjazz: >.>
Ninjazz: Yes, Sir!
I like the physics in that last one - the thrusters didnt burn off the parachutes :)
:$
Use the boost to get through!
slippy is worst sentient being
lol DO a barrol roll
It's too back heavy
XD
Kriel_Pony: Damn you got the skills yo O_o
I can't let you do that, star fox.
00,02it makes a nice boat
00,10indeed
I'm on a boat!
00,10I keep trying to get it to the water with out breaking off the boosters
:D that multi billion dollar boat
FairysHuff: It wasnt too tough. My school had a metal shop.
Everybody look at me cause I'm sailing on a boat!
never thought i'd be on a boat , its a big bluewatery road
MegaMoonShine: riding on a dolphin, doing flips and shit
-_- so sleepy...
you're good but i'm better
FUN FACT: what people think is a barrel roll is in fact not, it is a Airleron Roll. a barrel roll is something entirely different
00,02i should probably not be attempting to make this work
00,10you dont have that much control over parts
Phase4: Try and lif the sidewings JUSt a smidge upwards so they look like a extended V?
Sumica: You should be able to, can't you make the wings into a V shape? A very vide V?
nope
lol
a back flip? thats not good
Clearly a success.
needs more thrust
This IS designing a method of effectively killing the crew, right?
too much in the back and not enough in the front
...or less
If I understand the physics of our world's logic, it should have pemanent uplift with the aerodynamic supporting the central force of the propupulsion....
Damnit, now I want this game. :P
Rain: some people like it that way
:S
What IS this game?
Kriel_Pony: Kerbal Space Program
it looks like the space shuttle doesnt it?
Phase4: Can you try something?
inb4 it orbits the sun
00,02Vordox, yeah
too much in the back , not enough in the front ? so its a mulletcraft ?
The front wings, can you move them into a V, a very very wide V shape?
00,02not sure what you meen
Or do they HAVE to be horizontal?
dont know if works
no elevator on the right wing?
gonna splode
It's too back/top heavy
00,02i have no vertical controlls XD
Not this time though :P
no elevators at all
yea knew it
eueu so close
well that ended about as expected
From now on i dub this craft , The SPACEMULLET
Is this game free to play?
lol
it cant get enough lift its to heavy
/me glomps and hugs Rain
:3
hello Sumica, how has your day been so far?
00,02gota go have dinner soon
00,10wait you got the flaps to work?!
00,10my day goes well
yay ^_^
heavy plane is hevy gonna splode
WErm...
now they will die a bit later
Phase4 and Sumica: You know about the backend controls causes overflips? >.>
Liiiiiiiiiift
00,10not sure if airboarn
and
nope
IT SAVED
00,02ok....
00,02that didnt kill anyone

hi PrincessLuna.
It IS possible for a space plane to lift off, right?
Hello there, PrincessLuna.
Iunnno. it mneeds to take off first. i think he need larger or more wings
/me attacks Sylandest before he can do anything
With hugs. :)
Ninjazz: Uh huh

Yuh huh.
With hugs. :|
/me has been glomped
with hugs ;)
:$
so I can see, lol
hey Sylandest
morning, d3rb!
Yeah. Build it like a jetliner or a fighter plane, then tweak it until it can make it to orbit.
Sylandest: Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii der
hey Sylandest hows your day been
Om and Ninjazz: Have I missed much today?
Sylandest: I dunno?
alexxm: good, hehe, I just woke up
Sylandest, just alot of explosions.
Om: you've been unconscious this whole time, haven't you? :D
Ninjazz: rocket explosions, I take it?
hey did anypony catch the lottery? i missed movie night
Sylandest: I wouldn't say unconscious...
Om: then what would you call it?
d3rb_: lottery is today
Sylandest: I'm not tellin :x
whats with that, does it alternate each week from the friday movie night to the euro night?
Yup
Sylandest, yes. :)
/me just finished watching How to Trait Your Dragon
ah okie dokie!
cmon tron! (my b movie choice)
Om: uh-huh... Ninjazz, what has Om been doing? :D
Sylandest, same old Om.
oh Anything above 10 m/s enough to escape Earth gravity. Howevery if you go to fast the craft will burn up
I'm going back and forth on whether I should even bother with my ticket this week, after everything that happened this week.
what do you mean?
atleast they lived
Ninjazz: hmm...I'll take your word for it. I'm still waking up so I cant say im entirely functional myself right now XD
At least the pilots lived this time
I was on an honor ban all week.
/me splashes water into Sylandest's face
oh, what happened Kandarihu|BuddyBear ?
/me sputters and coughs
Ninjazz: oi! what-*cough* was that for?
/me holds Sylandest mouth and nose closed
Sylandest, only trying to help. :)
Holla! :)
Om: wha-mmmfmfmmf! *waves hooves frantically*
morning, GilDash! :)
Sylandest, Om: Oh, this I gotta see. :)
Hi GilDash!
GilDash... You're early... :S
GilDash: w-wait, its not what you think! :$
Ninjazz: It's half one on a *Saturday*. That's late. :D
so they banned you Kandarihu|BuddyBear ?
No
GilDash, *donks himself on the head* Of course! I forgot about that! :D

14y u no shot the album
Anyways, hey there, GilDash. :)
14YES IT'S 64 KBPS ;_;
Om, thank you. :3
Ninjazz: And how long did you sleep...?
Good morning, everypony! :)
RaveBrony: ohai
morning, RaveBrony! :)
14I use it as alarm clock
hey RaveBrony, how are you?
GilDash, another four hours I think.
Good morning RaveBrony
hi RaveBrony
hurr
Hey there, RaveBrony!
/me hugs Skylands and Xeli
Ninjazz: What am I going to do with you? :(
Ninjazz: That isn't very long.
yeah it's easy
Starchaser: You still here? D:
logs are harder than exponentials x_X
GilDash: I don't know what to do with him...pony needs to get some proper sleep
Well... sorry for disappointing you. :'(
Also volume/rotating areas fml
/me waves to |Discord|, Sylandest, d3rb_, Obsidian, and Mutterguy :)
I hate doing that
/me hugs Ninjazz
00,02RAGE
Ninjazz: Just sleep, silly. :(
00,02it deletes unattached componants
00,02Space time
oops
Ninjazz: you haven't disappointed us, you just need to sleep more!
14o.o
Ninjazz: Yeah
GilDash, what do you think I try to do every night? :(
Or... morning. :S
I decided to hold myself to much stricter standards. The following day, an unkind word from another user drove me to ban myself for 16 hours. I kind of made a bit of an indiscriminate move a couple of times, so I added more time to the ban. It became 96 hours
Ninjazz: Just lie in bed and try. Even if it doesn't work, your body will eventually adapt. :(
This is gonna be so awesome!
I'll try...
hang on, you implemented a self ban on yourself?
/me hugs Ninjazz.
Ninjazz: It will al work out xD
|Discord| or messy!!!
Yes
ok fair enough
:o
Mutterguy: Most likely both
Ninjazz: As long as you're *really* trying and not lying to me, I'll never be disappointed. :)
To the mooooooooooooooooon!
GilDash, okay then. ^_^
success
yeah that can cheerfully escape the olar system
Within an hour of the ban lifting, I AGAIN made a jerk of myself, right in the middle of BMN.
lol, so more time i guess wasadded
GilDash: How did you sleep? When ya know...You eventualy did go to sleep :$
Om: I slept. Borning as usual. :S
*Boring
Dat misspell.
I born in my sleep.
hmm...borning....
birth by sleep
:S
... Gimme a break guys. I *just* woke up. :D
ICBM
/me hugs GilDash
GilDash: Nevar!
So 1/4 of the way into space
GilDash: I just woke up too, actually :D
Well, my interpretation of Bronystate rules say that each punishment has to be worse than the last.
GilDash, when were you one for taking breaks?
to the mooooonnnn
lol those pilots
Ninjazz: It's called sleep, Ninjazz. :(
TO LUNA!!!!!!!!!
/me sighs
Ninjazz: Some of us need it more than others it seems...
Always with you and my sleep problems...
Oh, the launch is actually successful this time?
Ninjazz: I worry and care. :)
Ninjazz: Yes in deed.
uhoh
How come the cameras on the three guys are lagging when the actual stream isn't lagging?
WindWhistler: That's how it is in game.
But its not going to Luna. :(
GilDash, I appreciate it. I really do.
Ninjazz: we merely look to take care of you, as you would do for us :)
GilDash: Well, that's slightly annoying.
WindWhistler: 'cause
Sylandest, I try here and there. :$
I shall say nothing on this topic!
Ninjazz: I'm not looking for anything in return. As long as you're happy, I'm happy. ;)
orbit
This game is very confusing.
so did you learn your self impossed lesson Kandarihu|BuddyBear ?
I'm thinking I'm being too strict with myself.
/me restrains to state he is never happy
Who chose these cowardly pilots?
SPACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEE
i agree Kandarihu|BuddyBear
uh oh
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Probably. Just chill and have fun. :)
^
Ninjazz: You were happy this morning ._.
WE'RE LOST IN SPACE
WHERE'S MS. FRIZZLE!?
/me slaps Ninjazz
/me snuggles Ninjazz.
I was?
/me hugs Ninjazz
/me sighs
the magic space bus!
But if I'm not as strict, I go back to being a troublemaker again.
You guys... :)
00,02shit
Ninjazz: you shall be happy, from all the wubs we give ya! :D
magic scool bus
00,02going too fast
This is all Janet's fault.
they are so dead
Sylandest: We?
00,02and out of fuel
00,02so ditching back to the planet it is
Ninjazz: Why do I always drag you down with my sleep talks? :(
Om: well, there's me, you, GilDash...thats a good start
Now they have to go all the way to Pluto to find Ms. Frizzle and get back to school.
oh i knew i should have stayed home today
Inb4 they realize the moon is the other way
abandon ship?
the pilots know it, they are screwed
GilDash, you make me think about it... :(
Sylandest: I preffer to think of it as friendly support :$
How are they still getting miles?
Rocket Men! Burning out thier fuse out here alone....
I hope you have plently of OXYGEN! you know... for the crew...
Ninjazz: It's in my nature. Even if I have to be cruel to be kind. :(
All this sleep talk is making me tired e_e
They're still going
00,02perfect
LOST IN SPACE
00,02orbit lines up with the moons
LightningDashFast: I already said that.
GilDash, then I shall react how I feel. :(
Om: fair enough, lol
So then they'll eventually get to the moon?
00,02eventualy
00,02i meen, months and months in ideal circumstances
Is there a way to speed up time?
00,02but yeah
i wonder if we will ever go back to the moon
00,02it just so happens there is :3
Ninjazz: You'll drag me down with you, but I'll keep pushing anyway. I'm too stubborn. :(
yeah they have abbout 2-3 weeks....
that costs money which no one has
But they'll probably die by then.
hello everypony :)
00,02the real problem is a: my useless engines
00,02abd b: this orbit decends into the atmosphere
00,02and'
But hey, at least they'll reach the moon.
WindWhistler: Eventually, it may take a few trips to land though
GilDash, that will only make me feel worse. :'(
/me sighs before hugging Ninjazz and GilDash tight
So I looked this game up on Steam, only to find it isn't on there.
Ninjazz: It will me too. I only hope you'll do something about it. :(
Ninjazz, GilDash: you two ponies need to perk up. We're all here, and we're all together. We should be happy for that, no?
00,02so....
00,02those engines will return to the earth in....
Phase4: Wouldn't going directly upwards help? Or is there something about physics I don't understand? :S
Ninjazz: Buuuu. Just eat some toast!
00,0212 hours
I suppose so, Syl.
Wai, why am I red in your chat? I wanna be green!
that's goona leave a mark Phase4
00,02its in an orbit
wait*
00,02Mutterguy, in the ocean
Om, I ran out of bread! :'(
That's a huge piece of space debri
00,02though that was pure luck
can we ff
Ninjazz: ._.
you hope...
/me snuggles Ninjazz tightly.
00,02no, i know :P
Wait, there's another shuttle out there?
00,02it shows the orbital path
So you have six guys stranded in space?
00,02WindWhistler, thats debre
00,02debrie
Oh.
00,02i cannot spell
WindWhistler: three
debris
debris*
00,02there are others stranded in space though
/me sighs contently at all the affection he is receiving
00,02about 6 to 12
You horrible person. :|
lol
Ninjazz: no matter what happens, you always got us :)
at half a million feet, I dont see it gravitating back to earth - at what point does Earth's gravity end and Space begin?
but its for SCIENCE!
00,02there goes my engines
WindWhistler: Hey, *they* volunteered. :D
00,02oh well, time warp time
Ninjazz: Unless ya know.
ASA: No Worries mate!
00,02i just realised that this rocket has no way to land
Ninjazz: your problem tell me... i fix for you
GilDash: They got assigned to a terrible person.
00,02oh well
Phase4: I'm ashamed of you.
MEH....slight technicality
crash landing
WindWhistler: They got to live their dream! They got into space!
Phase4: that's what water landings are for
Spectrum_Rush, sleep, I guess. I can't get a good night sleep.
WindWhistler: Well, some of them... :D
And I know, Sylandest.
00,02Cypresswolf, i'm going for the moon
GilDash: They look awfullly terrified.
awfully*
Can you get to other planets?
WindWhistler: They're *always* terrified. :D
Ninjazz: iknow that problem i have that problem
THose engine will burn up in the atmosphere.......... right?
Ninjazz: ok heres waht ya do
oh hay, the moon is slightly moving.
Phase4: Tell them the mission has changed, they're a space colony now
So, how much of this capsule can be considered as living quarters? How long can the Kerbals be expected to survive?
00,02allmost time for another burn
Ah, they're not gonna make it, are they?
Ninjazz: figure out when is the hours you need to be awake school,work,watev
3rd phase
Spectrum_Rush, I'm in summer vacation.
00,02oh shit
Ninjazz: Then you've no excuse. :(

Ninjazz: granted you'd miss a day withh that second one
BOOM!

Wow. That was an awesome way to go out
Ninjazz: warm milk
6_9 I just don't know what went wrong

GilDash, you've had alot of concerned ponies pushing you to go to bed, before? :S
in ruby pinch we trust one wat
It is working?
OMG HOW
Ninjazz: No. I've had a bad enough sleep cycle to almost cripple me before. :(
Mayday!! Mayday!!!
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
inb4 it orbits the sun
holy shit!
Were going dowwnnn!!!!
GilDash, Ah. I can see why you would be concerned. :S
Phase4 has build a super unweildy rocketcraft that can't stand up to the rigors of space
well theres your probleam
:( if you stay up long enough to get into a good cycle of naps then you don't actually need to have a long period of sleep.
all dem parachutes
trident nukes
Ninjazz: If I can minimise the mistakes in other people's lives, I've considered mine to be worthwhile. :)
WIN!
Ninjazz: GilDash can be very convincing. Specialy when it guilt trips you >.>
Om, tell me about it... :S
00,02this is Sumica's pyramid
00,02i'ma make it bigger
00,02and then launch
Go for it
Phase4: godspeed, good sir
Om: I don't try to guilt trip. I simply tell it how it is.
lets do this!
WIN!
lol
O.O WTF
dat thing there
needs more boosters
but can we make it orbit the sun
i want this to work so bad
GilDash, well... you're doing a fine job, if I do say so myself.
/me tackles Invi
GilDash: how so? it minimizes the amout of time you have to sleep.
GilDash: Fiar enough... but there are times...
Well, I gotta go. I'll keep this stream on mute and hope it doesn't lag me too much. I'll be back for either HUB stream or EMN, whichever comes first.
Ninjazz: That's not my goal, and you know that. :(
So I leave the stream for like 30 minutes and I come back to this.
later Kandarihu|BuddyBear

Fill you middle
We can make it bigger, faster, stronger. We have the technology.

GilDash, I feel guilty. It may not be your intention, but I always feel guilty for those sad faces you keep leaving at the end of your sentences.

Spectrum_Rush is that a chellenge? ^^

DoVahDaSh
Ninjazz: It's how I feel. That is all. :(
oh shit
why does my internet hate me
whoa
so you don't want to try to add a new stage to the pyramid Phase4?
Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon Delight!
/me Solarnuclearhugglompwubbles Invi :)
fus roh yay
00,02i dont know how
:O $%&%^&*!!!!!
whats the game called?
kerbal space program
/me is evaporated
GilDash, and you know how I feel.
Klaypex: Kerbal Space Program
thanks
Ninjazz: Tired :D
they will make it to the moon
Om, always. Usually very or very very tired.
why does my internet hate me
hell, now I feel tired
its free?
whatas it doing alexxm ?
Ninjazz: Yeah. When I get tired I get flippant and stupid xD
Like right now!
the one thing i hate about this game is flying the rocket really high. then "YES look how high it went" then you have to wait till it hits the ground :/
Om: Yes, you do. ;)
Gildash: with naps you actually reduce the total amount of time needed for sleep because sleep is more effective in naps. So rather than sleeping for 7 hours in your offtime you instead take a short nap when you get home, say 30 minutes, then throughout the day take small 30 minute naps. What should happen is you end up sleeping close to 5 or 6 hours while still being alert for the whole time you are awake.
GilDash: I WAS RIGHT!
Ninjazz: how active are you?
TO THE MOOOOON!
d3rb, not so much.
/me gives Spectrum_Rush a hugwubble with the power of puppyface pinkie pie
08,01hehehehe
maybe some exercise might make you feel better
100 m\s
08,01hey Phase4!
doesnt need to be much, dont need a gym membership
*morning
hello
08,01norming Sylandest
200 m\s
This game needs more space
300 m\s
08,01so i got chatting to a really hot girl today
its drifting
/me is diabeetused so hard he became sugar incarnate
Invi: ^
Sylandest: You must be jelly
Its Game over
Hello
Om, Ninjazz: we have a very open marriage :) :D
Um... what is this?
08,01and it turns out she likes sci-fi, but hasn't read much of it
Hello there, Jewel.
hey Jewel
Sylandest: I see..
Sylandest, Wow.
hi Jewel
Sylandest: Sounds like me and Cherry. Minus the marriage bit. :D
sup jewel
Gildash: your right, that is the problem with it. If you have a lifestyle that isn't consistant enough for naps at the same time it falls apart.
over 500 m\s
Jewel its kerbal space program
Sylandest: Sounds like me and myself, oh and I. I is a hoot.
GilDash: hehehe, it kinda is! sorta...:$
Oh. So simulated space ships?
idk
i think so
wtf
!dns tatooine.sw
hey Jewel hows your day been
Unable to resolve tatooine.sw
Those people in the corner look scared.

08,01so we swapped facebook details and i said i'd lend her some Asimov
But..I thought you were mine Ninjazz
And just starting alexxm It is only 9am for me
Unable to resolve tatooine.sw
Om: You'll have to introduce me to this "I" of yours. ;)
/me 08,01hugs the hell out of Ninjazz
in a nutshell Jewel yes
/me is crushed with love
GilDash: but, you can also replace the smaller naps you would take during the night out with longer naps on both before and after it. It increases the amount of time you have to sleep from the all nap system, but it is still less time than a solid block of sleep.
chat derped
GilDash: HA! I almost typed somethign REALLY stupid :P
refresh time
CupcakeWarrior, I was kinda... forced into it... :$
08,01anyhoos, she was into pi
08,01

08,01anyhoos, she was into philosophy
GilDash: That would be me.
08,01so we started discussing posthumanism
Philosophy drives me crazy. >_<
GilDash: I married them.
08,01so today was quit cool

08,01Om: i have a voice?
Ninjazz: If you were sleeping *properly* you wouldn't have missed it. :p
GilDash: That might not be entirely true
Phase4... why are they screeaming?
GilDash, if so, tell me what time is it there right now?
00,02Mutterguy, cause they are all going to die in an explosion

Ninjazz: 14:27.
00,02planned for the next version

Ninjazz: it is 9:28AM were i'm at... i have not slept
Show off.
Ninjazz: tiis not a good thing

Ninjazz: I don't remember. Early in the morning for me, so it would probably be late afternoon/early evening where you were.
Is it me or is there no sound on stream?
Spectrum_Rush: Go to sleep. Don't make me to what I do to Ninjazz to you too. :)

Reddhero12: They are going to have her
vinyl scratch = normal name, dj pon3 = stage name
Then we must stream it D:
Reddhero12: Who is .."we"? YOu?
Reddhero12 it will probably show up on youtube so no need to watch it, unless you like the show.
they will probably put pinkie pie's apperence on aquabats up on EQ
00,02awww
EQD
00,02the engines i dumped are at escape velocity
00,02so theyre gona fling of into space

00,02the engines are definantly there
00,02wonder where they went
/me wants to bring in the southern birda
birds*
prolly had a structural failure
Phase4: they probably broke off when you seperated
Sumica?
00,02shouldnt have
StinkomanFan: Phase4 is streaming
00,02shit
00,02too early
MY EARS.
Haha
boom
WHY DO I HAVE THIS HIGH VOLUME!
That was awesome
ded
WHOA!
Does ANYPONY have the HUB we can give it to the Stream?
:D
Phase4: The sound from the game is way too loud :P
Ah...
you killed yor pilots xD
GilDash: are you here?
Why is Ask Jappleack never features on EQD?
00,02it did it again
Pilots tend to die
Can you build something so explosive that it blows up the moon? Or at least part of it?
Boom
I know some stuff in there is kind of mature
Lord_Celestia: you like tacos?
But it has a really, REALLY good story now
gogogog do it
Everyone likes tacos
StinkomanFan I have the Hub but my reciever is not hooked up for streaming.
Reddhero12: The same reason they don't put on other things of more mature content
I'm back everypony!
Name a ship "Nightmare Moon" and land on the moon, where you stay for a few thousand years.
I don't think they even must on the .mov series by him
They put NSFW links
00,02it bugs out when you restart the flight
But not Jappleack? D:
Back from about 30 minutes of Rayman Origins
I haven't seen any on it
whoa
it's already 59 days since the MLP season finale
JET!
wrong link
JET!
valoreins: how are we still sane? :D
JET!
I hear there's another pinkie pie reference in Aquabats today
dunno lol
Let me tell you, precise platforming is never a good idea at 10:30 at night
JET!
It's "hidden"
Lord_Celestia: cause i heard you like taco's and bacon http://imgur.com/gallery/GMqWl
they will stream Aquabats today, right?
Woodentoaster of The Living Tombstone?
0,5Dark92Enigma, please stop saying Jet
I assume so
they didn't last week
Ask Sumica
I like this song.
I have just read a fanfic about vampire-Twilight, and I'm in an emotional breakdown. I need love.
:(
/me glomps LordCelestia
0,5Pff, fanfics
Is it called Blood is thicker then Friendship?
There are good fanfics
The only good Twilight is the one that sparkles
Well Excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me LordCelestia, but that's the name of the song (Paul McCartney, remember)
Like Fallout Equestria
0,5No, not at all
there are worse fanfics o.o
Memme: was it called Blood is Thicker then Friendship?
00,02this seems to be working
good one
Somebody write a version of cupcakes only set in the Twilight universe
No
Jewel: I think it was called "Nocturne"
Lol jiggly
Ah ok. Was it any good?
Twilight isn't a universe silly. She is a unicorn, Jigglysaint
I LOVE when people make my favourite pony go dead/bad/psycho.
hey guys haxmega is streaming the hub
:(
Jewel I dunno if your being serious or just trolling.
So far, all the ponies have been very stressed at some point
Being silly Barbetos
Don't advertise other streams, Starchaser
somebody streaming Hub?
Jigglysait I think Haxmega is
0,5Dont advertise or link them here.
oh
I guess you can't link there though
Nope
We are here for bronystate, not a random streamer
He is on justin.tv though. Just google Haxmega, you will find him.
but bronystate won't stream hub
Staaaaaaaaaarrrchaaaaaaaaaaaaseeeeeeerr!! (Not Starscream, right?)
One is smiling yet the other two are panicking?
Not until Aquabats
Obsidian: One is high.
Do the pilots even do anything?
Jewel: I think you just need to keep them alive.
Seems legit
Won't they live as long as you don't explode?
Damn, my copy of Flash just crashed
Jewel: I don't know. They might panic.
hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
Hmmm
Interesting
What is this song?
00,02two tanks left
alexxm just fine, but i was sad two days ago, because my younger dog (not a puppy anymore) died this past week

Zombie sheep which eats humans.

Anyone know which song this is?
08,01so far, the Do Not Seduce list is: the groom, the parents of the bride and the groom, the brothers and sisters of the bride and the groom, the bride's 83 year old uncle, any bridesmaids under 20, any friends of the bride who are married and in monogomous relationships
SOunds interesting
Airpuff: Really?
i liked black sheep
Memme: indeed.. :$
Not the uncle!
hii
08,01GilDash: i... may or may not have slept with the bride before >.>
00,02i forget which one is which

StinkomanFan we don'tget the hub in the UK
HI ME!
valoreins|Away: I saw what you drew for Flare, and wow, that was amazing.:)
08,01StinkomanFan: i don't live in the US
The Hub doesn't exist in Sweden, right?
Phone is slow at school AND this library
14I have nothing to do this saturday
:$
14._.
The Aquabats season finale is in 20 minutes and nopony can stream it!
00,02k, i have a good orbit
08,01you have to understand that when this happened, we were both lonely and vulnerable, and we're both hypersexual
I'm packing when I get home
StinkomanFan: Believe in Sumica
YES!
I thought Sumica was streaming it
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT
THIS SONG IS YES!
/me 08,01learned that word yesterday, and has been using it a lot today
Hopefully it was when she wasn't dating the groom
*it wasn't
This game should be streamed some time: http://supersmashland.com/
Sumica's asleep!
nto was. Was is bad
THIS.IS.SCOOTALOO!!!!!
Andrew.
08,01yes?
Nothing :P
there is no, i mean NO good sparta remix but the one and only original...
alexxm by the way i know who derpy could be in wwe
08,01we were actually dating for about 2 weeks
What is with people wanting to do Sparta remixes
alexxm Pm me for more
08,01and we both resolved never to speak of it ever again
Ah ok then.
08,01but this is the internet, so it's fine
THE USS VIBRATOR
I don't want to learn now outside of uni
heads be rollin'
14lol
08,01but yeah, we both agree that was a mistake and a half
08,01and it took years to rebuild the friendship back to its previous level
08,01before that, she was my very best friend
Phase4: Is it supposed to spin around randomly like that?
14according to the law, I can't use a knife for self-defense, even if anyone else has one o.O
08,01and it's still not quite back to that level... things still get a tiny bit awkward sometimes
00,02YES!
/me looks for pepper spray
00,02i can transfer into mun orbit
O.o
Phase4: Oh well... I see...
Uh...
All of a sudden; phase Became the Luna Master
I like when it is busy
00,02Memme, not sure what you meen
Makes this go by faster
00,02yeah, i figured out how to fly these things
Damn it, why am I lagging so much?
lolconcealedcarry
Phase4: Be careful to not hit your other ship
/me lag glomps Evil_Spike
Castlevania Music/Touhou?
Phase4: I just saw your spacheship spin around. I was confused.
00,02yeah
00,02they do that
08,01but i wouldn't do anythign with her now; her fiance is one of my oldest friends
00,02and i have a full tank of fule left
00,02along side the landers
08,01Wrek: oh, aye, you'll be working on the design later? that message?
05y
Phase4: What happens if you explode?
WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE THE AQUABATS ;A;
00,02Memme, then the astronaughts die
00,02Wrek, do you have the hub?
Phase4: And..?
Bronysith i'd be happy with eithor as the doctor
ewconcealed carry
Is there a Hub in Sweden?
00,02i dont think so
they should just hold it in the air and wave it around
00,02worth a shot
I don't think so.
05nope, i dont live in united styts of murica
while their eyes are closed
so much safe
r
: P
and wouldn't it be swedish?
Well...
Someone Phone Sumica then?
Memme we don't get the hub in euorpe
Or Send a SMS
08,01so basically, the bride thinks in very similar terms to myself:
08,01"andrews sister is much too young for you. my own sisters can take care of themselves, but i suppose it is traditional for the best man to sleep with a bridesmaid, thus you have a choice of siobhan or matt"
/me 'murrica
alexxm: Oh. That sucks.
i wish i had the hub :<
What is this now?
apparently they are gonna release aquabats in the uk o-o
wat
brb and Lol
08,01Bronysith: John De Lancie
this game looks confusing :O
I have an idea!
immapony: Agreed. This is too complicated for my young brain.
Maybe if we say Sumica's name three times he'll come
o.o
08,01i love our conversations:
00,02i'm good for an orbit
08,01 me: siobhan would have to be very drunk to sleep with me, i think. matt... not so much
08,01 Victoria: Well then, that's that tradition covered
00,02wonder if i cant get a landing
Some little girl kept blurting
does anypone else find it funny that the astronaut on the far left is having a great time, while the other two are flipping out? lol
:) I got some money to get through the week and Im waking up with pancakes & the last of my sweet tea
StinkomanFan: try for five times in less than 10 seconds falt
"What's in a Pokemon?£
"
lokwut
00,02lol, that other flight is still orbiting
lolwut
*flat
08,01i miss those two
Phase4: What? Can that happen?
08,01i get along so well with both of them
Phase4: Can you crash into old ships?
this song confuses me.
00,02Memme, not quit capable of that much percision
Sylandest: He's has something other than oxygen in his air tank. :P
Sylandest: Yea. The one on the left is high.
lmao
Phase4: But it could happen? It keeps the old ships?
14o.o
.v.
We're trying to get to send Luna some food
to the moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon
She grabbed a bunch of Pokemon DVDs LOK
Food....?
LOL*
14pokémon DVDs?
14in a library?
14o.o
StinkomanFan: And there has been trouble getting the food up, so she is starving now.
Don't tell the Pilots that though
00,02Memme, it could happen
Phase4: Wow.
Obsidian and Memme: I can see that happening...counter-balances the panic in the ship with relaxed calm XD
/me has only now realized that the orange planem is future mun
hubs playing ticket master
Yep
Sylandest: Welcome to the future! : D
We have them
Mostly Advanced gen
08,01you have to understand here that the Matt in question loves his dirty jokes and puns, has a penchant for Gilbert and Sullivan, two degrees, and is one of the funniest people i know
00,02i'm looking good enough to attempt a landing
00,02its getting back thats hard
And some of the 10th anni ones
08,01so yeah... that's probably happening
Phase4: YOU HAVE TO GET BACK TO!?

Phase4: Oh you! :D
Phase4: I am confused. Explain the situation. What is going on, what's your plan, etc.
LUNA SHALL FEAST LIKE A QUEEN
Phase4: it will completely make my day if we reach the moon before I go to work. Is it possible?
Phase4: and you will be the one to accomplish that goal
00,02this is my plan

14I don't take any book from the library since I found a...bad surprise in one
Nice : D

Hi I'm back
00,10good thing i did't put the updated chute on that one
That thing is gona fall forever
why Sumica?
00,02Sumica, why?
00,10nah that type of chute is a drag chute
and it would take forever to land?
Anyone seen some good movies?
FOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR
00,02that other one
00,02that exploded on the moon
00,10the updated fully opens at what ever altitude you deply at
00,02might actualy be able to make it back
supersora10: Did you see madagasgar yet?
00,02need very little force to escape mun and transfer orbit
but it has no thrust at all
oh wow
00,10also you dont have the updated chute so that would meen you would have no chute on this
Incoming parachute
We have touchdown :D. Horray
~yay~
huzzah
24 hours of lemans is on
00,0214.3 max gee force
00,0212 day 21 hour misson time
00,02all in all, a success
00,10some day kerbals will invent a boat to go save them.
00,02Sumica, we can only hope
Man, I wanna play this game, but the demo's boring...
For now, imagination.
Da heck iz diz?
00,02the one on stream now is the one that crashed into the moon
IDK
Sumica: you almost had that failed plane become a boat several times
just hope
:D no water rescue
/me is bored

00,10what do you meen almost?
00,02this is the one that made it back
/me is with WindWhistler
00,10I got it all the way to the ocean with two solids straped to the roof
Rofl
It didn't actually have anything left to move with in the water did it?
Dat rocket
Who's this song by?
00,10my tower of power
Phase4: yours coulda made it back to if not for that trollameter
00,02XD
00,02yeah

00,10you might be able to mod the ToP to land
00,02i should totaly be in bed

Awesome jet
SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!
Phase4: save that recording

Yay 8-bit
Starchaser:

00,02too heavy
The see me rolling.
00,02well i'ma stop now
00,10yeah the saddle liqueds need to be slung under belly
Well, any landing you can walk away from is a good one... even if you're swimming instead.
/me gawks at pony merch
00,10so you can shed them
lawl
Did you guys see the second to last episode of ledgend of korra?
nope
>Second to last
It's already ending?
but I want to
00,02NOOOOOOOOOOOO
00,10I have managed to get that same desgine to around 20km up but then it gets too light due to fule burn and the SAS loses controll
00,02FLASH!
00,02Y U DO THIS
Is Legend of Korra almost over already?
00,02:(
No but I wish I had seen the episode
00,02the recording didnt work
It cant be :<
00,02was anyone else here recording?
!
Legend of korra is awesome
Phase4: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Yes it is. The last episode is next saturday and is an hour. You guys should do a lvie stream of it.
00,10it's ok Phase4 we all saw it
00,02:)
00,02but no recording :(
00,02oh well, i'll try again tomorow
00,10fmle sucks at recording any ways
GarrettBrony: They should honestly make more episodes...
The season is ending, I think.
GarretBrony exactly
Not the series.
00,10shame no new korra for a bit
GarrettBrony: Next week is the finale
FillyFlam: REALLY?!?
Phase4: remember.... you made it to Luna
I've watching Korra since the day it came lol
Huzzah!
hm
Sumica: there was a new episode 1 hour ago
00,10yeah you are alive on luna
I think Advanced Task Killer is breaking this
I saw the first like 3 episodes, then forgot about, then started watching it again.
00,02yep
I watched the first episode and I loved it
00,02trapped forever
00,02with luna
For some reason I havent seen the rest
-ponkie pie forever-
00,10I could be ok with that
Yeah the first episode was epic
Well, it's a continuing story. It was planned from the beginning to last this long. More episodes are going to require more planning.
00,02i've got the transfers figured for mun
They decided to rescue nickalodeon tepurarily.
00,02so tomorow i might be able to attempt both landing And takeoff from the moon
so is the stream down
00,02mun';
Phase4: http://fim.413chan.net/fic/src/130221079136-Luna_happy.jpg
05you still streaming Phase4?
00,02nope
00,10oh there is a new korra today
00,02was on stream WAY too long today
Sumica: It ended a long time ago
00,10guess I have to stream it after movie night
Sumica: yes, it ended a half hour ago. And the finale is next week
Phase4: One hour Terraria, 3 hours TF2, 7 hours of Space Program. XD
Prepare you're selves... Wrek is going to stream.
05Sumica: nah i got the post show covered
00,10time zones are like magnets, no one here knows how they work.
WOOP WOOP
05gotta draw
Aww man that means I missed the new episode!
00,02this is what happens whenever no-one else is awake
time zones are dumb
00,10that's fine wrek
00,02Spectrum_Rush, :)
Phase4: XD We'll NOT Criticize you...openly :P
00,10you have to sleep some time
00,10and you got a 9 hour head start on me.
Oh you're drawing? Imma txt my friend bout that.
I kind liked the one idea that had everyone going by UTC and just having things open during daylight(ish) hours
Is anyone else livestream is loading so long?
so 1700 was 1700 everyplace
This is the problem with western animation. Sure the production values are higher, but everything lasts for no more than half a year of new episodes at a time, leading to inevitable reruns.
Yes mine
But if it closes when the US is at night, the australians and asians won't have anything to watch.
Mine too
The stream ended.
00,02minmus will be a chalenge
00,02a lot further away than mus, return trip will be dificult
I was liking that Flying Derpy song that was going on before the stream cut out
00,10the trick Phase4 is to warp while still on the pad
Well I got nothin to do before I go to a friends house
We're eating cake :p
00,02Sumica, yeah, but i dont know When to take off
00,10wait for a good shot at it from the ground
what time is it in the US
(To be honest, I wouldve preferred Blueberry muffins)
?
Chocolate cake?
Wrek, sorry that pic is taking a while... my comp is derping xD
Over here it's 11:06
9:07am Pacific
My fam is hosting a BBQ today...I guess I'll spend most of the time grabbing food and being here
AM
00,10there is an orbital caculator for the game

but luckily I found them right before we left
00,10radial moters have too hight a poly count and lage my system and the bfe clips the tower
i saw all the stuff Phase4 had nad I was like. where did he get that?

/me runs
Only if it has heather dale
:3
alexxm: In the original comicbook continuity, Dr Curt Connors became The Lizard whilst attempting to regenerate his missing arm. In the trilogy of films directed by Sam Raimi, he was a recurring character but did not transform, although it is rumoured Raimi wanted to introduce The Lizard in Spider-Man 4 but faced studio resistance. Ironically, The Lizard will finally appear in The Amazing Spider-Man, the reboot.
oh crap
howdy
ment to pm
hello peeps
I think I heard of the lizard, and not from the movie
Spectrum_Rush that wall :3 fun facts tho

The Lizard was always my favorite Spider-Man villain.

CrimsonPhoenix: Well, she is the most compex of the charecters, and she acts the most like me.
i cant realy pick a favored of mine-pony yet
and fail
Mydesktop is dazzling currently so yes I do admire Rarity alot
What about derpy? She is the symbol of us bronies.
How about we stop this fight about which pony is best cuz they are all best ponies. except for Fluttershy shes best pony
dat white
/me hugs Phase4
Majestic_Sparkler: She's number 2 on my list.
/me 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
icybeauti, are you me
Madsurge the only fabulous pony ^-^
Spectrum_Rush: ... :$

CrimsonPhoenix: Nope.
icybeauti: Derpy is the best <3
hay Panda ^^
Derpy is number 3 for me.
next thing you'll say is that Fluttershy and Rarity make a cute ship?

1,11Alright, with less than five minutes 'til Showtime, it's time for the announcements.
1,11First and foremost, BronyFunds has been extended by another week. At 6pm EST every day, they have live bronyfunds streaming. show your support for some unlucky brony artists.
1,11Second, if you want to have your Youtube videos featured in BronyState's youtube playlists, just send an email to us, which you should already have if you're getting the newsletter
11,01We're still at $880
1,11Remember that the email must consist of the following:
1,11Your BronyState Username
1,11Your YouTube Channel Name
1,11Type of videos shown on your channel (PMV, Music, Let’s Play, ect.) (separate each with a comma)
1,11Specific videos you want BronyState to feature (give the title and the link)
1,11Please remember that only brony-made content will be accepted.
1,11And last but not least, our B movie has been changed.
1,11Instead of Max Magician, we'll be streaming Black Sheep. Faar warning, it's weird as f*ck.
