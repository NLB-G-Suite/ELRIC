I'm falling asleep again. And only just woke. Damn my twisty drowsy head. >_<
00,02theres no way to land this thing
If I stop responding then I have passed out.
brb
00,10that's why it has chutes and a sepration collar
You need moar POWER
We need to get an actual designer from NASA to make something on here
X3
00,10it's very buggy
00,0220K
Really add two more boosters and angle tehm down 12 degrees
you should take off then
00,10no air
00,02i'm falling
00,02why am i falling
xD
00,02yeah
00,02i broke it

00,02this is not working
Oh my...

Sooo many deaths.

00,02why does the left wing allways lift
put the wheels in the wings
I find it hilarious how people die in experimental planes.
Cooking food while listening to pony music
It is awesome
BOOOOOOM
OH! OH! OOOOH!!! Every pony! Could we start a regular D&D get together? ^_^
Pleeeeeeeeeeeease#?
I has no one to plays with. ~_~

I'm already in a Savage Worlds pony campaign
Hi Everypony!
It's relatively easy to learn
11,02O.O
11,02Dat me O~O
4th ed sycjs
EDIT sucks
3.5 ed > 4th ed
Hey, I'm back!
Damn you, government
Just a project for school, programming matrix concatenation
I'd like to play D&D in person someday.
00,02sleep well
Baldur's Gate I believe is based either off D&D 3rd ed or 3.5e
Dear government, why did you have to implement the K-12 system in our country
I'm not completely learned in Tabletop RPGs
Or geek shop
*Play
00,10arrow spikes sure run out of fuel fast dont they
Fial
00,02Malavolent, no, this is a plane
00,02my spacecraft are marginly more successfull
Well they didn't die, at least
Awww.
Has anyone get to the moon?
Then ask if you can join
haha
No Magic The Gathering locations?
Night every one
Why did I jsut send that to ME?
spinning is bad for you
Most unis have a gaming club
Why is it that all my engines or boosters are significantly smaller in size compared to the rest of my ship? Is there an option to resize them or anything?
:) I just realized I have no hangover repercussions from last night - Huzzah!
Not many play here in the UK
...Meh.
i'm in croydon myself
No, that's only when the rum is gone
lawl?
Ok guys, checking out for a while. See you at least for European Movie Night! :)
In England they are called Chavs.
Council House and Violence.
00,02?

seems legit
:D
xtreme spinning
00,10damn buffer
carrying a gun where everybody else isn't allowed to is best
00,02hmm
00,02i think the stream silently failed
00,02back up now
00,10this can only end in laughter
stay on target
00,02seems legit
00,10nose boosters
00,10I should probably build a sepration system
wat
00,10meltdown
all of my wat
00,02this is a smidge unsafe
the enginse
Wat?
A...smidge...a SMIDGE?!
00,10have to throttle down to use the chutes
>.>
<.<
I like the physics in that last one - the thrusters didnt burn off the parachutes :)
:$
Use the boost to get through!
lol DO a barrol roll
XD
I can't let you do that, star fox.
00,10indeed
00,02i should probably not be attempting to make this work
00,10you dont have that much control over parts
lol
a back flip? thats not good
Clearly a success.
needs more thrust
This IS designing a method of effectively killing the crew, right?
too much in the back and not enough in the front
...or less
If I understand the physics of our world's logic, it should have pemanent uplift with the aerodynamic supporting the central force of the propupulsion....
Rain: some people like it that way
inb4 it orbits the sun
00,02Vordox, yeah
Or do they HAVE to be horizontal?
dont know if works
gonna splode

Not this time though :P
no elevators at all
yea knew it
well that ended about as expected

Is there a way to speed up time?
00,02but yeah
yeah they have abbout 2-3 weeks....
that costs money which no one has
But they'll probably die by then.
hello everypony :)
