Footballer, right?
Hey everybody :)
Wrek: DAT guy. eh
Hai The_Engineer :)
05big nose, speaks with his mouth closed
Oh here comes another chinese earthquake
05good guy though
Haha
Wrek: Haven't met him
Also, I like this Battle Theme for Sombra http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1FdPXlsWw&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz
Mind doing a Sombra drawing, Wrek? =3
Something awesome, yet feared
Hi The_Engineer :)
05yes i do mind infact
Mind do or mind not do? ;)
Why do I keep thinking of Sombreo when I hear Sombra
i had a thought for a drawing today 2 for u
05i wont draw sombrero untill hes worthy
05chrysalis was worthy
05(im talkign design wise)
hmmm??
05talkign villains
ah bad guy discussion
Draw her with insect skin rather than fur
Woot, Sombra was bad
?Å
Design wise, he was messy
but I've seen some reaaaallyy good drawings of him, that make him beautiful
Ponyville seems to get less and less a nice place to live each season
didnt they say sombra was supposed to be the sauron type? "evil, you dont nee dto know why"
but hey, i've seen things that make be believe he will be back
same, the horn
Dark_Horst: not really
Hopefully Sombra improves his vocabulary if he comes back
But he seems like the typical evil overlord type
SpadeMagnes[School]: wha? he said 4 words
Enslave the masses, rule with an iron hoof
that sort of thing
:L
All I remeber was him going on about crystals,slaves and grahahaha
Or maybe it's crystal hoof in this case...
Hah
otakon: there was a vector of trixie with a suspicious looking necklace. i suspect t was from that preview they had thrown out at some poiun t
he was voiced ? oh yeah , grrr , muhaha , crystaly , thats mine ..... did i miss any ?
screenshots, i beleive it was
or a clip
Dark_Horst: O_o
Don't talk about unaired episodes
i do not know
ever
Dark_Horst: SHHHH!
it is a ban-reason
seriously!
TrixieMuffins: ahh my slaves
otakon: you wont get more out of me then that
So is Gyrobowl no longer our god here?
THANK GOD!
but yeah, i beleive we will see him again. or his influence
I wonder if Paddlin' is stil in effect?
mmight be wishful thinking
but a man can hope
05ahem
05ill let that slip
Hi again folks!
Someone type the forbidden word
05but
05NO
05FUCKING
HE KNOWS!
05S2 UNAIRED STUFF
05EVER
Welcome back Everlasting_Joy :)
Do I even want to know what other anchient evils are in equestria?

and it's S3!
05S3'
Ty
yes, seriously, noone mention previews, songs, names, anything-
SpadeMagnes[School]: well remember Taurtaros?
00,10but will I?
Dun dun duunnnn
Sumica: will you?
05sumica is a real hardass
05with nice tits...
We've had a Dark Goddes of the Moon, a God of Chaos, A changlign invasion, and a evil slave master
...
05ahem*
dear lord
lol
Wrek: O.o
Wrek he's a GUY
00,10yeah I will cause I dont want to read up for it
uhh
i stay clear of spoilers like the plague myself
Do I even want to know what other shit will break loose
but that one screnshot got the drop on me
sneaky bastard
id like to see some more Blackmagic-Celestia personally
SpadeMagnes[School]: well the next is gonna have to be a Military Dictator bent on conquest
00,10if I have nice tit's it's cause you made them that way =p
Blackmagic Celestia was awesome
I say some Griffin Warlord
Also Can Celestia go ONE villian premere with out failing
05>casue you made them that way
Sumica: Horses don't have tits :P
05>I AM GOD
Wrek, the tit-god
Lmao
God damn it celestia...I hate you sometimes
/me facehoofs.
SpadeMagnes[School]: um she didn't even DO anything, probably stayed back in case Twi and the gang failed
00,10two point ooooooooooooh
I would enjoy if Celestia actually did something in a season to help
I think both Luna and Celestia stayed back to see what would happen
Although WHY they didn't bring the EoH witht hem is BEYOND me
SpadeMagnes[School]: how did she fail with sombra?
I still want a Luna and Celestia ep :'(
Instead of sitting on her flank and doing jack shit
Well it was explained in this case
Seriously WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC ITEMS IN EQUESTRIA WITH THEM?
Im pretty sure she got mind controlled
00,10http://tinyurl.com/cv9qh59
EoH would have floored Sombra in the opening act
besides- she's basically a goddess, why should she bother with things she don't have to do?
otakon: becasue reasosn
Well its her fucking kingdom
Shouldent she defend it?
Sumica: ah, Professional Wife Toss; My FAVORITE EVENT!
She tried once, and she did once before
Sumica: I laugh everytime i see that :D
otakon: remmeber how they said twilight had to face it alone, since that was her test. that alone renders the elements useless. you need all 6
but with Twilight, she wanted to test her
Element of Harmony would NOT work on Sombra
00,10nah EoH would have just you know turned him in to a foal and fan faavoret charicter
Sumica: ah the fine sport of Epic Wife Tossing
yeah~~ that's true Dark_Horst
Fyi
Im getting tired of Celestia gettign Twilight to do all the work for her
I'm not, but hey, I am a total Celestia nut
otakon: also, in the end the keyrole was cadance, who finally got her assigned role by kicking him out
She didnt do anything to help with Discord, she got utterly beaten with Chrysalis
no elements rewuired
lol I guess
*required
00,10it's like freelancer all over again
EoH might only work on some cases too
00,10just instead of "trent you go first"
Sumica: lol inb4 Foal Sombra pics pop up
05why cant it jsut be celestia doign some really powerful shit agaisnt a realyl powerful foe
05actualyl doing shit
PS2 is almost done installinggggg
00,10it's Twilight you must face this alone"
Whats the point of having the elements of harmony if they never use them now?
^
05and twilight needs to fix this otehr stuff kreepign up behind them
Wrek: She did to Sombra...
Wrek: i ask that myself all the time
I'd like to see Celestia flaunt her power, but S3 premiere said why she didn't
yeah if you notice they USED the EoH against Sombra the first time actually
Vordox: yeha, but those are all past events
oh geeze sumica, Juni was the least helpful pilot I have ever seen
we wanna see some up to date magic whooping
and considering turning him to shadow didn't seem to affect his powers that much
Speculation : The Elements were so far used to a) stop NMM , b)stop Discord , they kinda "fix" things that are corrupted or upset the natural order . Sombra was just an evil guy , dont think the elements would have worked on him.
00,10and then we all remember it's a kids show
The elements of harmony are just usless rocks now
^
shhhhh hush you
Sumica: Exactly
TrixieMuffins, also a good point
Dark_Horst: They stilled happened :P
I was upping Sumica's comment.
TrixieMuffins: they used them on him before to turn him to shadow remember?
I know
true
05kids show or not, i like coffee.
And I can only agree with you, Everlasting_Joy.
At least I think they did
Vivix: My point was the same before
._.
otakon, really? I have to rewatch it again
00,10I like trains
Also Twilight must do it alone? What about her 5 friends?
/me waves his hand, since noone listens. :P
Choo choo
Oh sorry Vordox, didn't see I think
Vivix: well it's CLEARLY Luna and Tia blasting Sombra into shadow.
hiya Vordox
/me slaps Vordox back down.
yes
Sit down, whoever you are.
Sumica: I HATE TRAINS!
00,10and on the note of freelancer all the battle ships in that game sucked
Hai and ai
but with the EoH or without them?
And this is why you need to replace your blood with coffee Wreky
What about the whole friendship crap you've been getting twilight to learn? is that pointless now?
/me crushes a train with his mind.
Vivix: maybe without
00,10they had so many blind spots for fighteres to park in
/me wonders why he is playing a 12 year old game
otakon: i dont , i may have to rewatch the episode , i only saw Celestia and Luna touch horns and defeat him , didnt notice the elements in that
Well Vordox I took the first Steps towords the Walk cycle :( ... or rather a run-cycle
Because the age of a game doesn't denote its quality, Deacon.
Deacon: bc ot
I think it was without too
Lil_B: Use the template
s AWESOME!
giving is some taste of badass princesses
So if Celestia made twilight do this alone, why bother have her learn about friend ship?
that makes no sense
Friendship is something she has to learn, same with the EoH
this was another test
Vordox I do, but I can't do much more than have it next to it and try to resprite her so she looks like the template
because overspeculations?
00,10She realise twilight was carrying the rest of the group
Im DLing Planetside 2. Is it any good?
Ah try that Lil_B
They are doing somtehing with Twilight
00,10secretly they all got solo asignments
the whole premiere feels like it's setting things up
Well yea...Twilight is the only one who does the fuckign work
eeyup
we probably will see waht is going on during this season
plus the whole Infinity symbol
yeah
Her being "ready"
and Luna's words-
and the GODDAMN HORSES!
05im still waitign for crackle to show that there is no more powerful entity ever
that's why I loved the premiere, my little nerd went crazy with joy
Seriously what's with the horses?
Vivix: like in S1, first ep (apart from the pilot) is about the gala and so is the season final?
yeah
we might see some arch like that-
it feels like it at least
otakon maybe foreigners?
Arabian style horses visit Equestria
probably
i waiting for spike to grow huge hair(spikes) and start glowing with power while yelling at the top of his lungs
Mornin' everyone. :)
00,10forget the horses I want more early gen throwbacks
Haha
^
00,10where are my fucking sea ponies
Also what was Sombra's obsesseon with stairs?
Sumica: lol CRAZY FACE!
/me licks AdamTheDuck
lol Sumica
/me noms on Lil_B :P
SpadeMagnes[School], he had a love affair with a slinky
Sumica: Fun fact, Faust wanted to make a sea ponies episode, but it never got made
/me is nommed on
There has GOT to be seaponies at Some point
Maybe there will be
Sumica: Cherilee and Scootaloo meet their G3 counterparts :D
So we almost had one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8NaesRxxck
SpadeMagnes[School] I guess there are many never-done Episode concepts by Faust and the others... We need a lost MLP-Files Show
Also pinkie has the secret of hands now
One of the top comments is
Crippleloo
Sumica ikr, this season needs more sea ponies
Lyra must be sad
"I think the animators are fucking with us..."
^
I think the Pinkie Clones could morph slightly, hands and faces
I think they are otakon.
I don't think Pinkie can
I would be damned if the animators werent screwing with us
00,10this is why he was obsessed with steps in the castle http://tinyurl.com/cpavrr9
otakon: Hahaha, i saw that :D
05Sumica: and slinkies
hehe
Slinky slinky everybody loves a slinky
well if they make a sea pony ep. s4 withh be nothing but background ponies talking
Vivix: really? Pinkie breaks EVERY rule known to EVERYONE
Sumica: oh God WHY WON'T IT DIE?
GO SLINKY GO!
Yeah, but I don't think she can, since only the clones did it
Sumica: My eyes!
but, you never know with Pinkie
Slinkies!
Everyone loves a slinky
Why does he have a Loki name tag?
It's fun for a girl and a boy!
(also Sombra)
Sumica: Soon™ http://derpiboo.ru/157865 ...Maybe™
summica
why
just.... why
you can have your slinkies, I'll cuddle with my log anyday
00,10because
Who came up with Slinky? "We need a unisex toy.." "How about a...metal spring that you push down stairs?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmW6ErFS5xo&feature=related feels for lyra
Log! Log!
Its better than bad
Vivix: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slinky
00,10it rolls down stares alone or in pairs
Wow... dat giuf Sumica sent... I know the Artist >.<
no childhood is complete without a slinky
Everybody loves LOG
00,10yes yes Lil_B many do
Its Log! Log!
it's big, it's heavy, it's wood!
Wiki <3
Our slinky would always tangle
so we only had it for like 3 days
IT'S LOG! IT'S LOG!
IT'S BETTER THAN BAD IT'S GOOD!
I find it weird play dough was origionally wall paper remover or somethign like that
Vivix ah, hate when that happens
so sad ;__;
SpadeMagnes[School]: gotta love how they keep saying "FUn to play with not to eat" but keep making molds that are FOOD SHAPED!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiE3Jhtd85A&feature=relmfu
Seriously just give them ANIMAL MOLDS
00,10ofcorse realy a slinkie would not work on those steps that Sombry had
true-
stop making them out to be FOOD if you can't EAT THEM GODDAMMIT!
its pony land, everything works
Sumica: Thats why he turned evil
He lost his slinky
horse dicks everywhere
they could have, square slinkies,
otakon it's their way of saying you can't sue them if your child decides to eat the,
any1 finished dl'in yet?
90% here :(
I still find it funyn Nightmare Moon was made because of a temper tantrum basically
that go around circular staircases
94
made by pinkie
so we have Luna and her Abacus, Sombra and his Slinky
:)
00,10as a foal he loved his slinkie
SpadeMagnes[School], not a tantrum, something deeper
SpadeMagnes[School] didja know it's on steam now
?
00,10so much he sot out the worlds talliest tower
Deacon: yeah well little kids are stupid like that AND they really need to stop making food molds
lol brb
Hah
Bacus and Slinky would be a hit childrens-show
Abacus*
00,10when he found it he climbed to the tope and pushed his beloved toy off the top flight
well fuck my mb/s is goign slower and slower the closer i get to finishing
Did Luna never think most ponies didnt enjoy the night because most were....I dont know..asleep?
inb4 sombra x slinky shipfics :)
I was just thinking that XD
00,10and watched it fall off the edge after only a few steps
D:
00,10the crystal empire would rue the day
Hehehehe, that's a good origin story
magical enchanted slinky that turns bends?

Pea soup Wrek? Did you make it?

05i will not have to serve
Drink cider and dont learn anything
08,01fair enough
Lucky you Wrek

Really I dont see the issue with investing in that machine...personally
Ecoyli exactly!

08,01you have balls
08,01but you're still tiny and adorable

SpadeMagnes[School]: They just Had to make an ep focused on AJ i guess

>Family founded ponyville
That's so cool Wrek >w<
>Poor as shit, what

05orkar inte fara till skellefteå
Downloaded!! Woooo
05eller boden
Myah
Wrek: Oh.. I see. :L(
I dislike both shooting and the army, I love that they exist, but I don't want in
Hate all that cuts but hey, we need the economy balance
sad
"Trying something and deciding it’s not for you is one thing, but coming in with your friends solely for the purpose of grazing off samples and taking no less than 12 servings of meatballs over a five minute period (yes group of college students, I’m talking to you) is just plain wrong."
there more after RaveBrony :'(
05as a famous writer once said
hiya Shizuka and Rain how are you two today?
ok
Ello broknee state
05a good general does not win his battles through fighting
wut o_e
How are you this fine afternoon?
When I tried installing MoP from the ground up reinstalling WoW, guess how long it took
05but that the opposign army surrenders at hsi feats before the fighting occurs
Wrek: then through tea parties?
hallo HoodyNinja
Wrek: Sounds like Putin
Interesting
I started it at 9:00 AM, I got done at like 8-9:00 PM
Hi HoodyNinja :), still sick atm :(
But, in order to do that you would have had to fight before
ak4.... that's a swedish version of the g3a3
Hai HoodyNinja :)
thelonepony: Sucks, man. Hope you get better.
If your enemy is greater, elude him. If equal, prepare for him. Is weaker, CRUSH him. - Sun Tzu

Ecoyli: Sounds wrong...
05xD
I fucking hate this anchient artifact show...
this seems problematic when you are fighting against a not organized militia
Does what 'Empire" you choose matter??
thanks HoodyNinja :)
They never fucking find anything
thanks HoodyNinja :D
00,10I almost joined the the army
/me wears the bucket, as a hat :3
00,10but they did't want to let me do what I wanted
Why Sumica?
Wrek: seems almost like a G3
I should be in school today, but I overslept~
Is it just me or is Wrek's text color a touch darker?
Wrek: yeha, that'S an g3a3 with 2cm more butt B)
I really dont want to join the army
00,10so I passed on it
08,01i'm thinking of joining the Navy
SpadeMagnes[School] is that a show on discovery?
and always remember that when sieging a stronghold or a Town, your army should be 4times as large as the defenders (actualy army strategy book)
:O
08,01i don't think i'd last very long
HoodyNinja: you lucky bastard :D
05Venus: brign condoms you gusy go port to port >;3
doesnt surprise me though
Venus: But that would mean excersize
I would rather not die for a country that is full of idiots and money grubbers
:'(
13something sail the seven seas IN THE NAVY
Good advice there Wrek
00,10they would not tell me the job I would be doing cause it was clasafied
Venus: You could sail the seven seas; put your mind at ease...
militairy tech. if germany invents it, germany sells it
ALL FO IT
Shizuka: love that song :D
Shizuka, DAT VILLIAGE PEOPLE
13:3
I do wanted to join something, but still not sure, I do like those benefits
00,10turns out they wanted me to fly combat drones
And now I'm getting that Simpsons episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserves.
naturesfury: Does what empire you choose matter??
I would watch this artifact show on History channel/discovery channel, if they ever fucking found shit
Dark_Horst and usually does something to it that the people who buy it get slightly lower quality than germany itself
Formerly known as just the YMCA
00,10and I see shizu did not get enough sleep cause she is silly
134-1
Is there a term for someone who lives in a country but sort of hates it?
RaveBrony: havent gotten there yet
Lil_B: yeah. ak4 seems to have 2 cm more buttstock than the g3
otherwis,e no idea
SpadeMagnes[School]: Republican?
Hmm
Silliest of the Filly Foolers :P
RaveBrony: but probly
00,10*rimshot*
13i was going to say democrat :3
SpadeMagnes[School] something about cynic or something
RaveBrony: ahh now im there
Wrek: Does what 'empire' you choose matter?
did someone say...
05yes RaveBrony
SpadeMagnes[School]: Reminds me of the time I volunteered to go looking for artifacts in some dude's field. It involved a lot of not doing anything. FFS Indiana Jones and the Unrealistic Represention of Archeology
00,10I was gonna say north korean
REPUBLICAN?
13HoodyNinja: but if you think about it the independents are the most disillusioned these days
Because I really hate my country, but I cant do anything about it
Noooo, im not good with decisions like this!!
Eh
so which empire are we all going?
dunno
RaveBrony: Just wait till we're all decided and what not.
I try to stay away from polotics
RaveBrony: planetside 2?
alright son, lemme lay the smack down on you
Alchemist: Yep
I feel like founding the Republic of Dave
is like A1
When was planetside 2 announced?
its the number one
SpadeMagnes[School], a few hours ago
The boyband?
I'll be President Dave
05SpadeMagnes[School]: it released today

Dark_Horst I only know one example where they cross weild some parts in the gun to make it less noise, while other people only get paralelly wielded which will make them louder

my mom is making my whole family go out into the country to be together for the last day on earth
I still say the world will end by zombies
Buytoast: Do you have a choice in the matter?

i belive the dinosuars will come back and kill us all
the end will end with the WiiU aIn my hands and Bronystate in my Browsert

Sumica: Are people too stupid to think the Myans just...stopped making the calendar?
They have a rotary calendar
00,10http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm
I think 2012 is when it returns to 0
not when it ends
Ill be a skeleton buried in the ground when the world ends....lol
maby the calendar maby idk? repeates itself?
She wants us to each have a hatchet in our rooms for when it happens.

05is my response
I wish I was joking.
naturesfury, I think that was the mayan's point
05to the 2012 doomsday talk
How stupid do you have to be to think the world ends just because one damn calendar stops?
Wrek: Hah!
/me Sup guys; I think we've made enough calendar for now. We won't need to update it for another 2000 years so I'm going to go take a smoke break
00,10check my link Buytoast
stock up on guns
You can shoot tornadoes
I thot they found more tho O.o
/me I'm sure nobody will freak out
Wrek: what if all the power companies in the world decided on december 21st to just shut down power for like 1 hour? that will freak people out
Why are you stopping on 2012? Thats when the WiiU comes out
also, for the mayans it was 13
not 2012
I think alot of shit's going down on the 23rd of december regardless
The Myans predicted the WiiU :P
my mom already has these big ass zombie posters hanging around the house Sumica, we got preparedness covered
05to be honest many thigns freak people out
SpadeMagnes[School] dont say that, there may be good consoles in this generation yet
Yep
I think most people will remember dec 23 a few weaks after
It's true.
just like last time the world ended
December 21st will be the day they run out of this year's "Tickle me Elmo"
Exactly
Wrek: To be honest, I dont believe shit till it happens

And I feel fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
Twinkies
Sumica good point
Nothing will.
SpadeMagnes[School] not if they are the cause
Arent they going away soon too??
In the end, all that will remain is dust.
The 21st is the date when the Auster-Hagen Key countdown runs out...
you seen all the panic buying?
Dust and burning wind.
twinkies were supposed to survive a nukular explosion just not the end of the world
So why are cockroaches thought to be able to survive the end?
Scoots said Hostess went bankrupt O.o
Arent they closing?
RaveBrony: they did
Cockroaches are believed to outlive man, not end of the world
13hostess filed for liquidation
On the day of the rapture, all relegious people will be whisked off to heaven. and finally. Finally, the world shall know peace
13but they've agreed to mediation with the union
Hostess snacks were never that good...
Ah
00,10I liked the cupcakes

Some doctor is getting santa of all people to eat healthy...fuck you healthy food

/me throws a slenderman into the chat
EspyLacopa: Aaaand I'll never listen or click your links again, nice work EspyLacopa .
/me is friends with Slenderman

SpadeMagnes[School]: You did this

i'm good Eli
so im looking at all the errors for this and almost all of em say. if u have this error uninstall game reinstall. such complexity
Hi Eli :)

[SWAG]Haku: you said that last time. i still don't get it.
So We're All Gods

SWAG
It was a clan made in Fluttershy room
okay all bbl
pony pony pony SWAG
ME3 is calling me
[SWAG]Haku: sounds like a stupid excuse to say swag in my opinion. nothing more
Haku is the only member left, since no others have been seen
i have no idea whats going on
[SWAG]Haku: SWAG! LO AND BEHOLD
Eli yeah, we didnt mean for it to come out as swag. We just turned out to be all gods, so we became the Godly Clan. The name didnt stick
Toho's CGI
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP6Wi0F5JGY
[SWAG]Haku: change it maybe?
Eli why?
Vordox thats not the Godzilla
[SWAG]Haku: i have a swag little brother, so everything swag ticks me off.
im sorry to hear thatr
[SWAG]Haku: That IS the Godzilla, made by TOHO THEMSELVES
Yeah
I know
but its not the one coming out
That godzilla only cameo'd in another movie about dreams

[SWAG]Haku: Got to admit ONE thing.. Zilla isn't bad
Nah not a bad monster

[SWAG]Haku: Indeed. The speed and agility it has should

Invi: Destroyah
oh...GAK
<,<...
haseo348: since the begging of time
lol
[SWAG]Haku: Oh...my...hof
eeyup

/me cuddles Invi back
1991 one kicks..the year the snes came out....
I would totally make a Godzilla deck out of this shit if it was real
Vordox, http://images.mediabiz.de/flbilder/max07/mbiz07/mbiz14/z0714079/w225.jpg :3
[SWAG]Haku: Wait...Kaijiu Gojira/Godzillla?
Noone willing to take the hit for snes?
Invi: Dat spelling
any1 know if they made an outfit yet for ps2?
gak.
ikr?
Vordox Gojira was the 1st godzilla who died in the first godzilla film
Hai Vordox
lol
1992! yay
[SWAG]Haku: Wait...THOSE TWO ARE DIFFERENT`?!
... Yeah
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Little, Brown Books Covers and More Information!
Godzilla is a bigger, better monster than Gojira
[SWAG]Haku: I mean, the difference is Gojira and Godzilla to split them apart canonically?
brb
yes
But..
Oh wait..
/me slaps self
Gojira died in first film, Godzilla died in 22nd film, and now we have Godzilla jr. and Godzilla 3rd
[SWAG]Haku: Junior I know, but 3rd?
Final Wars had Juniors son
wrek or Sumica u there?
[SWAG]Haku: Oh shit, that's true, I remember that one
Eeyup
[SWAG]Haku: Little shit. :P
[SWAG]Haku: So...now..about Gamera..
So all in total, we have Gojira, Godzilla, Godzilla Jr, Godzilla thr 3rd, Space Godzilla, and the baby from Son of Godzilla
Anyone see the fight between Godzilla and Zilla.
Godzilla vs Gamera vs The Giant Claw
[SWAG]Haku, do all the mutant godzillas count too?
[SWAG]Haku: XD
Which ones?
[SWAG]Haku: Mecha Godzilla isn't canon? :P
Nyra, we just had a video ^^
Mecha Godzilla was just a robot
Where Invi?
Funny how we're breaking the rules just for the sake of the kick counter now.
Wait, I thought Godzilla Junior was the baby Godzilla from that movie where Godzilla is parenting. :P
Nyra, somewhere way up there in mah logs ^^
The 2nd Mecha was just the Gojira's bones in robot suit
[SWAG]Haku: Aye, I remember that....
Vordox no, the one from SoG never made it into any other films
Damnit I need to rewatch ALL godzilla.
Oh okay. We have to watch all the Godzilla films now on BState.

Good question Invi.

having multiple moniters is hard..
o..o
haseo348: Nooo, it's fun.
Well since I won't be able to play this game on my computer, I'm curious to see what this game would look like on minimum settings, like what I'd be using if my computer COULD run it
Shizuka, what do you think of a Godzilla Weekend (The Godzillathon)
13iunno
Come on....
thats to much godzilla D:
[SWAG]Haku: But Ghirodah has been his rival for...err
13never was a fan so i'm not the one to ask
i mean yeah its fun and extreamly use full if you play games like wow and stuff but i find it hard to use both...
Godzilla Hater!
Vordox true, but really, Monster X didnt look ANYTHING like Ghidorah. He just looked like a new monster.
can we talk about pokemanz?
[SWAG]Haku: You had NO connection to that Monster X was Ghid at all'*
Not the first time I saw the film
Ghidorah, was badass. But Godzilla was badass-e-er.
I wasnt thinking when I watched it
Nyra this is fact
Nyra, Destoroyah is all i have to say ^^
Don't you mean Canon?
hmm.. Destoroyah vs Gigan...
[SWAG]Haku: Hehe, You know, Space Godzilla is "Family" to Godzilla or just random chance?
wrek stream?
Gamera is cool too! D:
Vordox he's family
hm who was gamera again...
the flying jet turtle
13okay godzilla nerds
he has his own movies
Does that mean that Godzilla once made love to another godzilla?
13godzilla the animated series
13go
woo
Shizuka: OH GOD
i would not mind
I'm just gonna say yes
no shizuka! spare us that mandess!
DOO EEEET!
Vordox When Mothra flew into space after fighting Godzilla, he accidently threw godzilla cells into a black hole or some shit. and they mutated into SPACE Godzilla
PonyBean, the thing with the rockets in his ass ^^
[SWAG]Haku: .... Aaand my science side cringes. :P
Invi,yes! xD

[SWAG]Haku: Would Godzilla 1959 be counted as...err... B movie`?
Hi Canada_Brony. *starts arm waving*
I am delighted you are all here.
Vordoz yes, since its a cult classic and a low budget movie
Excellent. Or should I say, HAZZAH!
Thank you all, for all of you are my friends.
[SWAG]Haku: Hehe, will remember.:)
hey guys
[SWAG]Haku: Also, lol at the ZILLA card XD

Hi @ all

Well, how has all of your day's been if I may ask?
how've you been Netis
How are you?
Hi FlutterMEDIC :)
Hai Netis
Hi Netis
I am feeling quite delighted.
Always good alex and you?
how about one of the Assassin's Creed games? (excluding #3)
Tiring, Canada_Brony, very tiring. Hasbro is trying my patience.
So how is Planet Side 2 so far?
hey everypony :D
*:)
hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
HI!
how've you been Sketch_Toku_Brony
Hey Sketch.
Already been exhausted by the waiting of the third season, yes?
howdy Sketch
Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Oh god, using irc on a nokia is shit XD
/me is a sir.
No, waiting for the legal documents to be sent from Hasbro, so I can sign them.
[SWAG]Haku: O.o
im good alexxm just kinda bummed about how the mlp game gives you BARELY any gems and expect you to spend over 100 gems to get Rarity and Dash :S hope they make a Bit to Gem converter or some easy way to get gems...
[SWAG]Haku: WHAT?! Clover is Kaiju?
seriously, who is streaming?
Vordox it's a giant monster so i guess so
Which legal documents may I ask, Nyra?
alexxm: Coool...
The copyright allowance for the movie I'm making.
ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
What is the movie about?
Its already been approved, just waiting for documents to ship.
Nyra whats your movie about
<--- oh look. graphics oooh aaaah
Generally, its going to be about the revenge/return of our favourite cheeselegs bug.
Nyra: cool
Nyra chesselegs bug?
And, of course, every other villain in the series, including King Sombrero.
Chrysalis.
oh chrysalis
alexxm: you know...because her legs look like cheese
The ruler of the Tacocrystal empire.
FlutterMEDIC yeah i just realised that after i sent the message
Lol, yes even him.
Although Hasbro is giving me a headache in itself, finding a crew/team is even harder.
Why, when will this movie be announced and where?
The movie will be announced, via 'recruiting video' on EQD and DHN.
Why? You ask Canada_Brony.
Whats DHN?
Because noone is willing to at least try their hand at such a momentous project.
I would like to see it, of cource!
DHN = Derpy Hooves News
Ohh. Thanks!
I wish to have it released within a year - year and a half.
Hopefully, I will get some more application for crewmen/women.
applications*
Can I help?
nyeh
Nyra: what are the requirements?
Everyone is welcome to at least try.
Thats all I ask.
What can I do?
Wait what are we talking about now?
I was gone for a while
In terms of what is required, currently, anything.
A movie Nyra is making.
I need everything from concept artists, to animators, to VA's.
Sound guys/gals, so on.
Oh, ok.
where you gonna animate this thing?
I would love to help.
whats the movie about?
Cheeselegs.
what?
Chrysalis.
[SWAG]Haku: Chrysalis
Oh well thats cool
Nyra: CrimsonPhoenix?
Yea.
Can i do some VA?
i'm not much in the artistic department, but i can do a lot with manual labor
/me nyehs
Do you live in Canada?
Haku lives in Texas
If anyone here wants to at least get in contact with me, maybe try apply for something/anything, shoot me an e-mail to my production company e-mail nyraproductions@hotmail.ca

He was a good man and will be missed but i plan to live up to his name by doing what i can
RaveBrony, you're supposed to go to regions that your faction is trying to conquer or places where the other factions are trying to conquer. You fight for your side.
Mi PC just passes the minimum reqs with the ram and vid card too :D
I couldnt find my side! Lmao!
Went from old AMD Processor (2.1 GHz) to New AMD 965 Black Edition (3.4Ghz) and upgraded graphics to GeForce 660 ti
I was on a bridge! Haha
Well said, Omega.
I believe the same of my Grand Father. Didn't really know much of my "Dad".
wow i have an hp pavilion g7 laptop with 640gb of mem and 6gb of ram
The 2 people following me got sniped or something. and I ran into a enemy person who had ammo in his gun xD

so, how about those ponies
Ponies? Ew

Dark92Enigma: that's what I was thinking
alexxm: he's obbsessed with the machines
i want to read that eqd post so badly
alexxm: ESPECIALLY the DirecTV signal
Dark92Enigma: I didn't say it couldn't be rationalized

alexxm: i didn't, i moved here last sunday, no spoilers
I think some of them have

Hey,Mods.
Ill link it if you want,

ive seriously never heard of this
My day's been great, thanks, Canada_Brony
how old is this game?

i fixed ma lag and i hear Wrek
Its pretty damn recent CupcakeWarrior =_=

sombra sombra, is that like a dance? sombra sombraaaa~
Canadian_Brony: srry im used to sayin dat
We should totally watch the iron giant for movie night sometime
we have
a couple of times actually
good movie
scout19_tf2 s'alright, I'm used to getting called that.
Well we should do it AGAIN!
too bad it's not showing a marathon this year on CN for thanksgiving

oh, are we playing planetside 2?
because i have that game :D
What do about justin.tv
Obstruction detected. Composition, Titanium alloy supplimented by photonic resonance barrier. Probability of mission hinderance, ZERO PERCENT!
Zacklego: wut about it
05if you are usign chrom the stream embedd will nto work, firefox and or IE will work.
05otehrwise jsut press play
yeah, dean was cool
it wont play
wrek, imma play ;d
so that's why it's not working for me..
Do what the Wrek says!
Wreck it Wrek
Thing is, I would know how a Photonic resonance barriar would work too...
YESH
Ermahgerd, Erm ah Nerd.
GTFO JUSTIN.TV!
Justin tv wont allow me to view the stream
the photons resonate in such a way as to create a solid barrier?
I will be back

05as i said zack
05are you using chrome?
food words
05Zacklego
05are
05you
05using
05chrome
05if yes
05thats your problem
:[
lol
Rose`: The most likely way you could make a forcefield like that is via a mass-energy conversion. You sake the light(Photons) in their energy state and beam it across into a solid state. Thus, making an instant wall.
05switch brower
05s
Wrek: I think you mean Browser.
brb gonna fix lag again
maby we should put that info on the screen for now or something
DoctoDoctorWho, wouldnt you need projecting and recieving points?
YAY i fixed it
i'd assume the former, considering that there is a lack of knowledge of the properties of light in a hypothetical solid state?
;)
Rose`: I imagine that would be what the pylons on the sides of the gate are for
bc this has happened like ten times since Ive been here
stallion1: what?
the chrome issue
im starting to feel like some tf2 like always
Rose`: Wait, Im the doctor, and your rose, dammit.
rp?
:P im confused
And we're talking theoretical physics, holy shit.
I will be villian #5 who jumps off of cliffs
if it happens that light when in a solid takes on a physical weight, or is affected by gravity in an exadgerated way (in consideration to its normal behavior) couldnt one hypoteticallys have a central pylon with a sphrical field generated? if such a thing were possible, one could theorize that adjusting the power or flow of protons thru the pylon would increase or decrease the area of the
field?
also :D, this is awesome, DoctoDoctorWho
:D
:P
ooooo
jumps off cliff
oh goodness, DoctoDoctorWho! look at us, gossiping about theoretical physics like a couple of old housewives~
housewives:D
Rose`: Well pleasure to make your internet aquaintence, I see this blossoming into a beutifull friendship
Blossom, rose, haha
ha!
i see what you did there :3
puns <3
and i assure you, the pleasure is mine
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/000/681/what-you-did-there-i-see-it.thumbnail.jpg
hehehe
its not everyday that one gets to have a conversation about the possible configurations of hypthetical technology based on theortical physics :D
OHAI
but what is your take on the photon sphere possibility?
o hey wuts uo Pinkies4thWall
*up
What's this? a new streaming stie
?
*site
As for the central pylon, Im not sure that would work in a linear gateway manner. The majority of human construction is very uniform, assuming it even expands in a sphere anyway.
true, and that is the main premise of this theory
Wrek: so how do i join you?
And oh how I love it when I get to dabble in the technology of the future.
IKR!
/me gives Wrek a peck on the cheek >////<
SuperBrony64 you there?
Hey guys whats up?
Rose`: If you dont mind me asking, are you employed?
im a medic in the unitedstates army
but im applying to a college for theoretical phsyics
needs to read more
Rose': hoorah
Huh, oh. um, oh.
yourself, DoctoDoctorWho?
Hey guys whats up?
hello Chip_Chop_OC
Wrek: TakingTen is me
I am new to role playing and bronyism, do we do a lot of role play here?

Hi, Pikachu. :
Safety Torch?

That roll is weird in first person
oh herro skyrim
wheres the dragons!
Since when could you roll?
and barrel rolls
sneaky...
every starfox game DUH
SpadeMagnes[R]: it's always been an ability for sneak
SpadeMagnes[R]: It is a skill in the sneak skill tree
Hi Pikachu :)
Oh, no wonder I never knew about it
watch starfox all of sudden appear
I was not the sneaking type
any second
BARRELS
any second.....
hi pikachu

Dang

DoctoDoctorWho: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate
Take ALL the books
I try to sneak but I tend to carry alot of shit with me
ahhh this quest
Scoot-Scootaloo: So im a unicorn? :P
Twilight Sparkle demands it
DoctoDoctorWho: A state or territory partly controlled by (but not a possession of) a stronger state but autonomous in internal affairs; protectorates are established by treaty.
is he doing dark brotherhood questline? i think thats what it is
SHe. :)
i have no idea what be going on
pony_7973: Thieves guild
*SHe
Eh I didnt deal with the brotherhood
second guess
Ladders are always good :D
*She
I slaughtered them all, thats the most interaction I ever got
i remember doing the darkbrotherhood questline where there was one part you had to kill the bride at a wedding, and if you did it without anyone noticing you would get a bonus
not anymore
i killed her, used invisibility, and ran out without anyone noticing
I love increasing your reputation with people allows you to pilfer more stuff from their houses
kill em when your done
SpadeMagnes[R]: Did you only do one playthough, I did two, one fighter, one sneaky
Dude he's right there
it wasnt until i looked it up that i learned you were suppose to push a statue above her to kill her
ladders are only good if they dont give you splinters
apperantly turning invisible is too obvious -.-
Solves everything
AND THEN EVERYONE DIED
Did you not dump any poison into the beer vats? :D
Even teen pregnancy
ded
You did! XD
Was this the right choice morally?
who cares it's SKYRIM
Morality is silly in a game like Skyrim LD
*:D
Well I have this thing where I tend to always try to do the right thing ..dont know why
SpadeMagnes[R]: probably not, but thieves don't care because you didn't kill him
shizu check under the bed of that guy :p
Ah memories of KOTOR where I killed juhanni and A LOT of people
so lost e.e
Mortality is always easier with a mortality meter for some reason

He metabolic processes are now history! He’s off the twig! He’s kicked the bucket! He’s shuffled off the mortal coil! Run down the curtain and joined the friggin’ choir invisible! He is an EX PERSON>_>

SirGamjalf: very bitter with a slight taste of sour
AssaultWithEmbraces: Okeydokey!
Skyrim does get very dull when you've done the main questlines.
I would not eat them in a house, I would not eat them with a mouse; I would not eat people here or there; I would not eat them anywhere. I do not like green flesh and man; I do not like them; Sam I am.
/me hugs donutpop365
didn't you wanted to do that thing, sprunkls?
At least if you're looking for the patron deity of peeing on children >_>

howdy AJIsAwesome :)
hi Sylandest
Did anyone else suddenly disconnected?
Nope.
SlushTheWolf, nope.
no
ok. weird.
The possiblity of a planet that is inhabitable is probably very low
13BILLIONS AND BILLIONS
oh, sorry, late howdy NocturnalBlade|AFK
None of this crap makes any sense
10 planets?
Pfff... jupiter? what the fuck could live there?
The fucking lace has massive storms dumbfuck
*place
13you missed the earlier ep where we tripped out to floaters and sinkers and hunter
xD
This guy is spouting such bullshit
Shizuka, you guys were talkign about poop?
panda
That...makes no sense
wipergone2 ^^ yes?
13SpadeMagnes[R]: just wait
13also recall that when this was made, the cold war was still a thing
nuke
Where the fuck is this twat getting these figures?
13literally out of his butt, but that's not the point
Im no scientist but this sounds like he's pulling this shit out of nowhere
the same place we get statistics.
our imagination.
imaginaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaation
13the point is you can start with the huge huge number of stars, the huge huge number of planets, and whittle it down by modest amounts to reach the number of alien civs
Even those even exist
The possibility of any other life out there is slim
13well, there's a huge amount of planets
to those who think mlp has plot holes: http://www.derpibooru.org/158669
SpadeMagnes[R]... and why are we the only lifeforms?
13and it's entirely possible life likes to get started, organic molecules aren't hard to make
eww why are you using purple text?
Also where the fuck was this guy getting ten planets in our system?
moobull69: thats pink....
moobull69: Because she's the mod and purple's her color of choice
ten is a nice number
We only have 8
kina puta la caleros say heet cinqo meat satay weh Adam
kekekeke
Purple is an awesome color.
13but the rest of those fractions demonstrate the problem of timing, that to actually contact an alien civ we'd have to find one that has a planet, evolved life, reached intelligence, reached high tech, and didn't blow itself up
We have 8 planets in our system...what the shit are the additional two?
13pluto was still counted at the time
In otherwords, its plausible that we arent the only lifeforms in this vast universe....
13ten is a round number
ok battle kid is hard a shit can be
13not only plausible, almost certain
Jmo, o.o
<:
13there's simply too many planets out there for us to be alone
I still dont get why Pluto isnt a planet anymore
Shizuka, and then there are moons that are speculated to have/had life that you can include as well
13too small
13its moon is bigger
Thats a shitty reason
I say plausible because its only still theory, Shizuka. Until we prove it... we cant be certain... you know?
13there's also bigger asteroids in the asteroid belt
we've discovered only 10 so far that could 'support' life. thats the problem.
13if pluto was counted, we'd have to count i think two asteroids from the belt too
Even if there is life out there, I dont buy the bullshit theories about aliens communicating to us
13no there's pretty much no chance of aliens contacting us
in that case, the number should be bigger than ten
Also, what if the aliens are violent?
no chance? enlighten us?
Then we're fucked!
aren't we violent enough?
13even if there's a pile of civs, space is still hugely huge
'hugely huge'
lel
ignore how huge space is, so why?
13you can't ignore how huge space is
So even if there is life the chance of us running into it is slim
I just did
13when light takes hundreds or thousands of years to get anywhere
13you can't communicate
SlushTheWolf: Not if the aliens have flesh melting ooze guns
you assume no one in the future made something to go faster than light
NO EINSTEIN
BAD NO TREAT FOR U
moobull69, can't ignore physics
13you can't break the light barrier
Ah, TV that Twilight Sparkle would like.
ah. "Invaders from Mars" type of aliens.
you can't say for sure
13it's plain impossible to break the light barrier, physics doesn't permit it
what did I just say?
Aliens could either be peaceful or be a conquesting nation
The physics in your theorys
Shizuka: No, but there are ways around it that are allowed.
Were watching a dead guy?
13wormholes are pretty much the only open option
THAT WE KNOW OF
Shizuka: Warp drive is also allowable.
I say we dont try to break physics
Physics are good
moobull69, when you discover something, then that can be considered
oh goody, dead guy movie
GabeMouist you believe in religion?
Yea... in alien standards, Earth wouldent be that special
Hello Everypony
Dat name
:3
moobull69, how is that even relevant?
lol
Hi.
dat boner
Boner: leave
As Dash said: Ok, bored now
13even by now our radio transmissions will only be a few dozen lightyears out
Oi Panda, you say to change your name please, not leave.
yes it is actually
Oh how this reminds me of spore
Starwars? Thats much more interesting than this
ikr
all of you are talking about high school crap
Jesus what are we watching?
13says the guy with 69 in his nick
Jmo, and I say leave... why? because pandas dont like boners.
and HAH I doubt aliens would nto cause wars regardless how advanced they are
13Boner: Change your nick please.
That's your own problem.
Not ours.
Aight
Wow that was a fantastic time to look at chat.
Jmo ;A; its the reason I cant repopulate!
Why are we atching this?
Why aren't we? :3
Back w/ new name
Because this makes space boring.
guess what? over 100 years ago motorized carriages we're unheard of!
A bit better
Hi again Paco!
But now? we can go well over 250
hey
Paco?
13on specific tracks sure
Yo
Taco
13you don't do 250km/h on the standard highway
the point is, your thinking in restricted realms
yo pacoooo
Ugh I'm so tired.
The possibility of finding a planet like earth is incredibly slim
Ohhai AJIsAwesome.
Hey buymyshirts
donutpop365: Go to bed? :)
yolo buy my shirts bro
dat number
Our galaxy is huge you are 120% right
no :3
Oh boy filler!
806.4619
we may never be able to even get out of our own
AJIsAwesome: I JUST finished reading for an assignment thing. Now I shall fall asleep to nice music :)
I think.
I'm just gonna put this out there: It's a little arrogant to believe that we are the only lifeforms in this entire universe, dont you think?
BUT, don't think it isn't possible because it could be

Man, I remember when this show was first broadcast.
Who is paco?
thing is, if it gets up to speed how does it slow down quick? We donoo lol
BlaxBlain: That one's safe.
This went south rather quickly.

Nope

We can create the technology to get up to speed (not now later)

We can only hope.

sorry i'm just gonna leave
I might go soon. But I will stay for a bit, FOR SCIENCE
Well if we get dominated by aliens maybe it'll have the Watchmen affect and cause humanity to unite for better purpose.
And maybe scallops'll fly out of my pants.
what the hell are you watching??
Cosmos
Well personally I'm watching german metal bands on youtube.
haha sounds nice
I have no idea what they're saying, but it's still nice to listen to.
ok now this is boring i think i might actualy DO my homework for once
shizuka, if you can understand this you may understand me: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory\
ugh kill that last \
Have fun with your homework SnowlightDream.
13right, you understand it
thanks :)
You can go beyond light
Hardon colider?
dat hardon collider
Physics gives me a hadron.
We are trying to find out how our universe was made and it had to have gone faster than light
Wouldn't a hardon collider hurt?
Depends what you collide with I suppose.
ooh lol!@
I get it now XD
A hardon.
I have a sense of humor come on :P
Also, no it doesn't go faster than light.
If a hardon collided at faster than light it'd probably result in galactic pregnancy.
oh my
Wow, I think I just figured out stars are born.
it could! It could open a black hole
We only have theorys until someone gets sucked through a black hole and lives I guess
13no, the LHC and friends approach the speed of light, requiring monumental energies to do so
13but they do not break it
The king is making his speech.
The king of what?
king of england
This bit of Beethoven was used in The King's Speech.
But we have a Queen.
he must have fun in his imaginary spaceship :3
Admittedly, she doesn't really do anything but still.
where did u read that?
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44629271/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/neutrinos-clocked-moving-faster-than-light-speed/#.UKx7q4bmqj0
YES it is trying to go faster than light
where did u read it wasn't?
13apparent FTL is legal within relativity because the spacetime distorts around the object
Nope, the neutrinos were an equipment failure
13the object itself is not breaking lightspeed
And then the neutrinos will mutate and then 2012.
13that too
And also not related to the LHC.
Shizuka: Like I said, warp drive is allowable.
But if you go warp 10 you'll hyper evolve into a giant catfish-newt
SO I can go faster than light as long as I go around it?
Shizuka: Now all we need to do is develop technology to shrink and expand local space-time and then carry it aboard a vessel.
13no, you can go faster than light by the accounting of an outside observer
13but you yourself cannot exceed lightspeed
ooh god, you beat me at my own game
13not really, you just have no idea what you're trying to argue
You assume anything going faster than light gets sucked into a black hole
13um.. no..
which yes your idea is right
13are you high?
atm no, wish I was :(
weLL
This is depressing
What is?
I come on and the first thing I see is a big BOOM
It kinda is I guess sorry shizuka
lol
I will be good now promise :P
Show of hands, who's still alive?
now, is it ok to talk about S3 EP3?
Shizuka: 1. moobull69: 0
/me flails around
/me raises hand
Mayjoo you should have been in bed ages ago.
It's 1505
You're 1505. >:I
Lel
You know, shizuka could ban me if he or she wasn't such a nice person. So I am not going to push my luck
On the one hand, it's awfully quiet, but on the other the alternative is vast amounts of gibberish as is the usual for this chat.
this guy is deep yo
Why are we watching this :'(
Panda: Why are we keeping score?
BlaxBlain: Why AREN'T we? :3
AJIsAwesome, because I am bored.
S'hard not to be bored at 7AM tbh.
So great that everyone fell asleep.

Do it, SB.
11,02I copied it though from the show /).(\

SuperBrony64: Regardless, it's pretty good.
I played the Rayman Legends demo at gamestop, me and my friend had so much fun. He was dying of laughter because he didnt know what was going on but he liked it alot and so did I
11,02Shizuka: O U
SuperBrony64: that's fine ^_^
^
SuperBrony64: it's still really good ^_^ you should try drawing more
I still need to find the time to.
nice sb64 like the art :D
SB draw more, or I will make the cookie companies go out of business too

that sounds sick dude'
I'm going to bed. See you guys Monday

Yeah, Im going to have alot of fun with that :P Gotta wait for the admin to tell us when though

porn*
taoumi, that to
pronz everywhere in Vegas
:D
AJIsAwesome: lol i guess if ya count Tosh.0 showing a thing of MLP and Tosh deciding "Hey! ill show Shy and Dash doin..that" then idk :D he's funny but MAN did that bit in the episode wierd me out 0_o
also a bunch of people dressed up as many characters
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oh yeah.... I saw that. Even though Tosh is known for this kind of stuff, he went too far with that.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I saw that on YouTube today. :I its only gonna spread the mentality that all pony aficionados are cloppers
even more
AJIsAwesome: yeah agreed
oni_link: yeah :S
i seen a guy dressed as Sylvester with two beers in his hand, he looked drunk
Then you know how the furry fandom feels
I still laughed but at the same time it kinda sucks
killerpony7733: I do and I sympathize
the cat
same here oni_link
Or anime fans if you think about it
so i just played the new DmC demo
what did you think about it Sketch_Toku_Brony ?
it was AWESOME /)^3^(\ felt like a dmc game dont see why so many "Die Hard" fans are bitching about it just its an AU story,totally gonna preorder it :)
that game is going the route of Sonic 06 in terms of it cannon but if its fun, Ill still play it
morning
off to bed, hope to see you all tomorrow night
*it not being cannon
Hi, aniderp. Bye, FlutterMint. :)
goodnight FlutterMint
hey aniderp
night FlutterMint
elo aniderp
13oh carl, if only you knew how the oslo accords really ended
Sketch_Toku_Brony: AU story?
Sadly, Dr. Sagan, there's more profit in death than in life.
NASA is preparing to announce a "History book level of finding" finding from their Lunar drone.
13>hopeful
13carl, you never saw honey boo boo
Mars drone
Soryy
oni_link: Alternate Universe,like instead of Dante and Vergil's parents being Sparda (Demon) and Eva (Human) like 1-4 told it,its Sparda and Eva (Demon and Angel respectively) and other slight changes kinda those What If? issues of SpiderMan (like IF he embraced the symbiote rather than get rid of it)while still keeping the original story intact
Sketch_Toku_Brony: ah. but if it still feels like DMC at heart then I think I can overlook that
And with that, I think I'll go to bed. Night, all.
Thanks for the stream.
oni_link: yeah it plays like it,even better imo lol if ya pratice enough you can pretty much beat most enemies and not touch the ground AT ALL :D so cool!
Java they recently said humans could settle for lng periods of time, also more evidence of water, lower radiation levels than expected, and we know the descovery has something to do with the prove useds to study compounds in soil and air thats intended to look for organics
DocSane: good night
I bet its amino acids or something like that Java
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I want it in that case :3
probe, i meant probe
Well, they already announce that there's no Methane there.
oni_link: eeyup totally gonna preorder it when i can :)
But we can always introduce methane if we want to
Sketch_Toku_Brony: NICE :)
Java they redacted that claim?
yep
No Methane
Arsenic life all over again huh Java?
I hope so.
I meant that they retracted that claim as well
Thanks Shizuka
well thankfully most of the Tosh mlps vids are blocked :S thats a relief
hm
Thnks for streaming, Shizuka
NASA is like "Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to announce stuff prematurely now"
Java lets hope for some interesting organics
I hope so.
Java lol inb4 That what SHE said :D
XD
oh y'all
so did anyone hear about a REAL Slender game being devoloped?
I don't think so.
The publisher is too afraid of lawsuit
The creator of Slenderman said "go ahead" but the publisher is like "What if they sue when this game become successful?"
yeah it is being developed by ParsecProductions and Blue Isle Studios. a sequel supposedly
Too much copyright troll in the US

Java: HUB?

Sketch_Toku_Brony: GotJ?
George of the Jungle
Yeah, we need something super hilarious here.

^
00,10they just green screened every thing in to an already made movie
They actually took new shots for several scenes don't exist in the original movie
Sumica: that chicken is yummy
AJIsAwesome: I think Kung Pow's always been a B on the spreadsheets
Okay. Thanks, J_E_Smith71. :)
they used foodtage from an old unfinished movie, which is why the also cant do a part 2
Also green screen is still expensive bakc then

oni_link: thats what SHE said :D
00,10I am useing it on my engi
I'm not Batman then......
why are you lying to us!
Sketch_Toku_Brony: lol o u XD
00,10also got some nice composat armor
I'M AQUAMAN AND I KNOW IT!
wooo
But no one likes Aquaman :I
T_T
I would say something else but I can't think of anything else
Java so you have a seapony then?
im pinkie and i know it
nein!
No seaponies in my kingdom!
not so tigggght
I can't stand their shoo be doo!
but its catchy
Sumica I still freaking love my MAX units armor and helmet and what else i put on it. It makes it terrifying to the enemy i even boosted morale on some players to charge up from behind me following me up to the enemy XD
I know T_T
I lol'd at Rarity's whining and I thought it was cute too :I
but it's sort of giving me a headache
shoo be doo shoo be doo
dat MM2 :)
Luna Shepard?
theres only a dark ending though
00,10I am glad they removed same side clipping on troopers
ah mega man, never played it
What game are you all talking about?
Looks at stream without sound O.0 dafaq
lol now i wanna hear MM2 with lyrics :D
only play megaman 2 weeping_pegasi82
lois and clark?
Stream has sound
gotta run gotta run now
Guy Smiley!
PrincessLuna: I'll try and bye! :)

00,10think my firefox died
no no, lyrics to megaman 2 with lyricssss
bye bye princeluna
we should look at some more moonbase alpha trolling stuff :3
im staying :D
Actually, I think Megaman 2 is an overrated game.
^
much like FF7 xD
/me stabs Sumica's firefox to make sure dead
Its also the only one ive beaten XD
Yeah the sequels had improvements
3 doors down?
nope nevermind
GameBoy Mega Man 4 is my favorite
Don't get me wrong. I think it's a good game, but it has way too much hype.
3rd was my favorite for the slide
AJIsAwesome: just like SMB3
PrincessLuna: i wish the rights to MM were in Inafune's hands :( not sure what capcom will do
oi!
oni_link: Precisely. I find Super Mario World much more enjoyable than SMB3.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: aslong as its something decent it isnt too bad
So.... what you guys impression on Wii U?
The stream just rippled away
AJIsAwesome: I like em both but I cant take one over the other
Nintendo dying Java
:(
Java: I want it
Don't say that
00,10settings, I be playing with them
PrincessLuna: yeah i guess your right,if they dont cancel it anyway :D sigh hope MM makes a great comeback :)
I'm not really following nintendo anymore
Nintendo is the only pure video gaming company now
I still need to get it.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: MM is dead though :I
I want Sega to come back
Java make a new Dreamcast?
Once again, Nintendo has some neat capabilities with the hardware, but not enough good titles for it to really be good
Sonic has died over the years I think
Sketch_Toku_Brony: well battle network was an interest MM
OF COURSE!
I want Sega to focus more on their other franchises rather than just Sonic, IMO.
Java: they have potential, colors and generations were good.
mica i love you
oni_link: Yeah only thing big coming is the Sonic/MegaMan crossover comic
^
Sonic is still alive and breathing
*^^
umm... please no
Sonic Colours are awesome
J_E_Smith71: Oh yeah the Archie comic crossover :O
aww mica why dident you play it?
Java: sonic is on steam now..
I enjoyed Sonic Colors/Coulors a lot.
Yes,
00,10cause this is not over yet, duh
PrincessLuna: THere's nothing wrong with that.
Also a lot of discounts this week
PrincessLuna: yeah i liked those as well though i kinda grew out of them cause they were a little repetitive
nothing wrongggg just seemed kinda random to see sonic on steam one day
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeahhh i stopped at 2 xD
00,10so other then my playing around hows it looking?
Why not? I thought PC gamers keep asking for more games?
PrincessLuna: It allowed PC gamers to play Sonic games.
00,10better worse dont know?
Sumica: good so far
mica you seem to always stop the ponys half way
Sumica: Love these new toys you have
PrincessLuna: its 5-6 for me :D Star Force was neat
um
...
Plus, have you seen what people do with Sonic Generations nowadays? It's pretty interesting.
oh god
all my yes!
YES
fluttershy likes it..
What is this?
she said yay
AJIsAwesome: Yeah and theres a community that is dedicated on hacking those games and making em better and making new levels
(i own sonic generations on steam) :D
AJIsAwesome: ah man i need to get that :D its pretty cheap now huh?
/me comes back and sees old gen ponies
So much yes! \:3/
:D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Think it is now.
/me dies a little inside
i thought she said candy
oh gawd what did we do to deserve this punishment ;3;
super new, better than normal new?
rainbow dash always dresses in style~
would it kill some people to actually work hard on a television show?
Sumica: New material for people who want "ponies"?
weeping_pegasi82: Yeah, her name was Laren Faust
lol there needs to be mod for Fallout where the mutants are G3 ponies :D
Well im sure some people would die of natural causes while working on a tv show..
Sketch_Toku_Brony: YES. :D
did someone ask for ponies <.<
I think so
no asking for ponies..
/me cries in the corner
AJIsAwesome: yeah and use VATS on those abominations :D muhaha
or this happens

00,10seems my controlls are being silly now
oh great, that face :I
the test is to bring Celestia... a shrubbery!
uh oh
Sauron
^
PrincessLuna: YES :D
I also want a reason why Celestia puts Twilight through these "tests" instead of doing these things herself. Maybe her powes is fading? I wust wish they'd give us an explanation.
who here likes King Sombra?
so basically they banished him to Canada?...
weeping_pegasi82: I do!
weeping_pegasi82: I do, just not his representation in the premiere of S3.
AJIsAwesome Well hopefully they'll explain
crepy eyes :|
Not vanish, I think that curse is to teleport them to the future
oh snap
AJIsAwesome: maybe shes a candidate for something in the future
killerpony7733: Me too.
00,10guess i just have to lear hot keys
AJIsAwesome! :$
MadSurge! :$
00,10pausing stream
Sketch_Toku_Brony: a nice one, not too expensive
lol this reminding me of Oolacile from Dark Souls :D kingdom/city vanishes for thousands of years :D
YOU SHALL PASS!
DERPY! :$
PrincessLuna: oh yeah :D
hahaha :D
and then Sumica comes back with that trollface pic
/me is hypnotized by buffer
weeping_pegasi82: round and around and around
I like Celestia (I prefer her over Luna, but I like both equally), and I wish they'd give her some more character development so we don't see her as just a ruler.
A lover perhaps?
uh... I'm back
00,10nah just bumping the quality up a couple knotches
the next level of studies = sith lord twilight?
Java whooooo~!
ah
ha I don't think so PrincessLuna
She has potential to be one of the best characters in the show, IMO.
Luna just looks all boss while celestia shuts the door
I still wonder why Luna look at Twilight like that.
PrincessLuna: maybe that dark power made NMM one way or another?
AJIsAwesome, WHAT!?!?! I HAVE A BIGGER PERSONALLITY THAN MY SISTER! HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE ME?!?! :'(
song~
Java: she's luna she doesn't need a reason
:O two Lunas?!
Boooo song
:/
I don't mind this song, I just don't think it really fits with the situation.
I felt like the first two episodes' songs were rushed and just throw in
00,10I like the poses when she ports
00,10some realy good animations in it
man how i WISH that teacher pony was voiced by Bill Nye :D
indeed those poses
00,10such as the wind blowen mane
TEL'POR'
Sketch_Toku_Brony: if only!
Oh no she didn
aint nobody got time for this!
rewind button
Well I gotta go. Thanks for the stream Sumica and hopefully you get that monitor soon then
bye oni
bye oni_link
Bye, oni_link. :)
Welcome to Syberia
Bye oni_link
all the scarves!
or alaska
so
?
why did shining armors magic have to be pink?
weeping_pegasi82: Why not?
pink is manly
Before the 1930s
weeping_pegasi82: because pink is MANLY
thats one of the things!
AJIsAwesome: just doesn't seem to fit him
yes^
Then those moron said that pink i girly
sacrifice scarves to appease the dark king!
In magazines, then people act like sheeple
/me digs Sombra's roars and wails
Pink is a colour, it means nothing.
True
00,10yep I defenatly like this new toy
my god
hornblocked
MAGICBLOCK'D
What did Shining actually do in that scene when Sombra was attempting to engulf Shining?
pink can be good in SMALL quantities unlike other shows that is just an avalanche of blinding pink
Oh, Rarity. :D
I thought Sombra will possess Shining
*faild
Rarity is about to faint
Java: As did I at first.
00,10censored because it was too intense for children AJIsAwesome
^Lolol
00,10wait till the unraited DVD comes out
instead of that dance, she could have used that energy to keep her spell going a bit more..
somehow I doubt that :D
Sumica: It would be interesting if there was a deleted scene that was removed from the actual episode.
00,10unrated DVD also has spikes batchlor party
^
has anyone seen spike
yeah it's going to be WILD
{TY_RANCHULA}: He's on screen?
crystal what now

cwystals
I love rarity in this episode

Rarities day complete.
00,10Trixie dose quite the sausay dress tease
.....
oh wow ponies outside movie night
uh....
yes, Celestia sent you all the way to the cold north, to write a paper. Clearly she meant that..
eeyup
00,10oh wow valoreins out side of Ban
Letaaaaargic...
makes sense
Outside movie night? WE WANT PONIES!
One of the reason why Sombra isn't a bad villain.
*reasons
lol Sumi it was a nice vacation
AJIsAwesome: mind block?
She doesn't WANT to remember the memories of Sombra.
Like I said, time travel magic
hmm it seems to be past 2 am...
SuperBrony64
Sumica yeah its more...fluid and expressional?

I like the bongo part

Wish it didn't exist
valoreins: AJ's his favorite? Hmm, you learn something new every day.
CyberTheDjPony: Yep

because background ponies dont get songs :P
CyberTheDjPony: Yep. :)

Sketch_Toku_Brony: it is on the Round Stable forums :D
If there's an alternate dimenstion or plane of existance in the pond, I don't see it as murder. If there isn't, then that's possible.

If Linux could run all my games, I'd gladly try it.
Though Windows 7 isn't so bad. I haven't had any huge problems with it so far.

You owe me nothing.
o u :>
best gift is giving

playing with desktop ponies aniderp?
I've gifted over $700 worth of games on Steam and asked for nothing in return.
Wow!
hey jaymooo...buuuuudy
Shoo you.
i let the move/wake up
maaaate
no one likes a kissass d3rb
:D
Nooo d3rb, noooo.
Ain't wooorking
:)
i dont want games, i got enough sitting there doing f all as it is
now derpy dropping mail xD
aniderp: Isn't it adorable? :D
yea
aniderp: I love Desktop Ponies. :>
she flies upside down
i havent played with it in months
blasphamy, use it daily
I made a little sprite of my OC, and she makes cloud art sometimes. :>
its distracting me
That sprite ish so damn cute.
hi
Hiyo kimplix
it distracts me..
how's everyone today?
aniderp: Oddly enough, it helps me stay focused on one activity.
aniderp: My eyes like to wander, and without DP on, it usually wanders to the other computer, where I get distracted by the internet.
well they move and then i watch them
distracts me when im on the net..
I have two versions of my sprite. One that moves around the screen, and one that just stays in one place and hangs out.
/me rolls around
I usually have the sitting still one turned on when I'm doing stuff
like now im following dash
I like having my pony in the corner when I'm making art or playing games. :>
i dont know how to make gifs..
lolsweater
*version
I have enough jumpers
You should re-type that sentence.
Gold_Demona i want one too :<
Scribblenauts Unlimited Delayed Till 2013 in EU/UK Territories, Not in Australia/New Zealand
Fml.
yes it is broken
It's a pain in the ass, but it was worth it to have my own sprite. :>
stralya, best place for games
Oh.
So, if you're in Australia or New Zealand, relax, the game will be out on the 28th of November
Huzzah!
i want my one alicorn to be on desktop pony
I can't make sprites from scratch though. I used bases for almost all of the gifs involved.
Gold_Demona how you did him ?
05driver udpated
05starting up
Rocket: Downloaded a ton of bases and edited them in Photoshop
*what
Oh god that should take years to do that xD
i know how to fuse pokemon..
last friday i started and quite good at it..
Rocket: Anything animated takes a long time to make.
Lawl
I'll pass.
Took me several months to make my pony with as many behaviors as she has.
And that's with a lot of copy pasta
Like I said, I can't make animations from scratch
my short attention span...
makes me oh dash boom again
heh
derpy eat muffin
05sorry for that inconvenience ^_^
like i said it distracts me
For those not interested, ignore me. :P
Gold_Demona: CAN'T IGNORE YOU :3
Aw, why not? I'm boring. :P
05ok hit play now!
Gold_Demona: HA
Yay, Wrek unesploded his computer.
lol
Kina puta la caleros say heet cinqo meat satay weh waaah
Hrm
oh awesome, you uploaded more Gold_Demona :D
Making preparations to throw out old furniture and replace it is tiresome but satisfying :)
Morning y'all
Hiyo OmegaSlayan
Hola amigo
now the stopped
Ohai OmegaSlayan!
Wrek streaming?
Eeyup
cool
Nermnermnerm
nerm?
Nerm.
00,10well I feel dumb. that feel when you dont realise 32bit system caps at 4gigs ram
Lel
Ermagerd Jermer
Ermagerd Derma
:D
00,10so hears hopeing I get my system upgraded by friday ^_^
im gettign paid today!
since friday im not..
lolz at 32bit 4gb ram cap
http://i.imgur.com/sImlC.jpg picture looks rather good against the black background on my lockscreen.
I like the Pinkie in the corner thar XAX :>
Gold_Demona: I slide the pinkie to unlock the thing :D
Sumica: How much ram do you have in that rig, Sumica?
That's what I figured. That's cute. :D
00,10more then a 32bit system can use
I got pinkie pyro as my background
:P
how did you gtet that pony?
00,1020gigs with Vram
on your ipod
lol
i want derpy on my ipod touch
How much without vram
to unlock it
You durn whippersnappers and yer newfangled iPatch critters.
xax how did you get that pony slider?
aniderp: Cydia.
Wrek, did you asplode again?
what?
You have to jailbreak your phone
Sumica: Wow. I couldn't imagine using even my tiny 6GB (my lowest spec) without x86_64
^
i have an ipod touch..
Same thing
iTouch, iPhone
how to jailbreak it?
Sumica: ...20... whaaaaaaa
Egh I'm not going into that, you could potential screw it up if you don't know how to do it properly.
Overkill.
It isn't worth it just for a damn pony slider .-.
not for me then..
pontentially*
XAX: Depends what you use it for.
Not that I'm calling you stupid or anything, it's just a complicated procedure.
00,10gonna take ages to back up my pony PMVs
SafariMonkey: Completely true.
Sumica: Remind me of your PMV directory size?
XAX: I'm considering making an upgrade straight to 24GB
00,10over 100gigs
You would only need 20GB RAM if you were a major video editor while multi-tasking with other things.
._.
There is no significant value in that much for a game.
Sumica dats a lot of poneh
gamer*
00,10keep in mind the ram is shared with video ram
It's about 3 World of Warcraft files
00,10video card has 2gigs
*file folders
Jmo: I'm not a gamer, really, I just enjoy the occasional game. I'm a 3D modeller, animator and programmer front and foremost
That's still 18 gigs.
00,10and I do alot of multy tasking to stream
...true. Streaming takes the hardware.
rofl
Not much hardware.
so, there is a possibility of Sea-Ponies https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/19/3FIzkz1xcEa3OEHrBM_sCQ2.png
SafariMonkey: Have you animated anything pone?
In order to use up 18GB, you would have to really push your system to the limit by running so many applications,t hat would include 1080P Media encoding, HD Converting, playing several games at max, running a browser with TONS of pages open, even still that might only hit the 12GB mark
that*
Then again, there will be the restriction of your GPU
And the load it will put on the CPU if it isn't that decent.
Jmo: Or do some hardcore simulation, like me
why does everyone here work as eather an artist, an animator or a Programmer here?!
My PC is old enough I'd have to build a new one to update the hardware. =/
Haven't seen how much simulation grinds up hardware.
I opened 400 calculators on a school computer and it used 4 gigs of ram ^__^
/me sits upside down
Lil_B: Or all three, like me? :P
School computers are pathetic
00,10would explain my strugeling with KPS too
Jmo: Simulation is primarily limited by ram. The more ram, the higher resolution you can simulate
SafariMonkey I haven't seen your work, but the fact that you work in these fields is enough :P
Wouldn't it also be limited by GPU
Jmo: I5's with 4gig of ram and a gig of VRAM
Due to the massive amount of pixel generation
Not exactly horrible
i5, horrible. lel
SafariMonkey it just bugs me because that's the Stuff I wanted to learn at first, but there was nothing available here, so I'm doin chemistry now :/
I don't WORK as an artist, but I do make art. :P
Lil_B: I'm going to do Maths at Uni, because that's my real passion
http://derpy.me/tOeDP
05FUCKING NGHUEGHNWEU
Hiiiiii
o.o
SafariMonkey sounds good, I like math... sometimes...
I liek Chocolate milk
Jmo: Simulation isn't limited by the GPU as the GPU doesn't need to be doing anything while it simulates...
i liek coffee
So............ i heard you lieks mudkip
Give me an example of a simulation program
vidmaster4694: mudkips is best pony
i meant as in the meme

whats this song, has a nice beat to it
00,10but the long and the short is I am trying to back up my pmv's
Sumica, if you're upgrading to 64-bit Windows 7, I hope you don't plan on playing any games that use Game Guard
00,10I dont use game guard sence the gameing abortian that is PSO
00,10gameguard was banished from my system
PSO?
Sumica: <.< You played PSo2?
Sumica, I see. That's a good policy. When it comes out in English, we're going to have to demand that of SEGA
00,10no the first one
Vordox, Phantasy Star Online
oh
00,10er wait sorry PSU
Er, yeah. I've had a lot of troubles with Game Guard on Japanese PSO2.
00,10not PSO

Mayhaps you should eat less fudge.

Fudge is too good to only eat a small amount of it
Like lays potato chips...
Mmm, applepie

Yes they are my fetish
Hmm, Bacon

Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh, I make the best alicorn OCs with that app.
[Turtlism_Girl], it's kind of become the bane of the OC community, this generator that you linked to.
What is happening with the ste=ream?
Kandarihu: Why?
*Stream
>OC community
lel
There is no other way of easily creating OCs is there?
Drawing....
drawing is fun
Kandarihu: Oh, I see. I can't access it ATM, so I didn't know what it was like
What about us people who have no artistic talent?
I wish I could into drawing.
If I had artistic taent I would draw one but I simply cannot
I'll try to actually practice one day.
then practice
I've been practicing for 13 years I'm never gonna get better. Hell in kindergarten when everyone was drawing stick fihures I just mixed colours into a disgusting blend of brown grey and green.
boop
stick figures are awesome :D
Night guys.
i know an epic stick fight vid
way back then and still in good use now
Ah kindergarten. The first time I had the urge to kill someone... and myself but mainly someone... Such a bitch...
I want to go to sleep but my dads in my bed because of the AC so I'm on the couch and I can hear my sisters HORRIBLE taste in music with fangirls SCREECHING!

No. Call the shots. Do you think that if a band edited a pikachu slightly and basically parodies pokemon and put it on a shirt to sell they would get sued?

Andrew W.K Ready to die: Megatron, lead singer. Starscream and knockout, guitarists. Airachnid, drums. Soundwave, Keyboard.
:3
Especially the ones with a crapload of frosting.
I prefer muffins, personally
Chocolate and Vanilla cupcakes are delicous!
I LOVE CUPCAKES WITH A TON OF FROSTING!
and even the frosting inside
what is there to talk about cupcakes? there's nothing left to add to the discussion
I HAD A CUPCAKE MADE OF FROSTING! :3
I just eat all the frosting before I eat the actual cupcakes.
Chocolate muffins are clearly superior
^
^^
I do the same Dinky
I love that cat :3
(>^_^>)
http://www.sanger.dk/
I don't like too much sweet, so I prefer a nice muffin. But then, I'm weird
that's a funny way of spelliing banana nut muffin
Cupcakes > Muffins
DinkyDoo: Really? I do it the other way around.
Cupcakes = Muffins
I guess..
Muffin is a bald cupcake. :P
Muffins > Cupcakes
Cupcakes = Muffins.
Muffins are bald cupcakes.
Pffft, peace talks
I'm gonna go get a cupcake, I actually have some.
Gold_Demona: And that's why cupcakes are better! Frosting!
lol
DinkyDoo: I am jelly.
Muffins are quite different....
But muffins are fine just the way they are. :>

Bald, cupcakes?

SafariMonkey ooh, that looks lovely *drools*

Henrietas a bitch
I likes cornbread. :>
Whatever you want it to be.
Frosting is the second best thing since bread
Sliced bread* :P
I'll be honest, i HATE anything which is a pastry that has something chocolate
Is there stream?
No, just bread.
meow
Frosting > Sliced bread
Cupcakes the actual food > Cupcakes the fan fiction.
That OCD owl
yep DoctoDoctorWho
cornbread is always good, except with lima beans
Cupcakes are better than Cupcakes.
I HATE chocolate cake
SploogeTheFish: I prefer banana chocolate cake.
:3
I hate chocolate cupcakes, but if its a normal cornbread i absolutely love it
^
the only chocolate i ever liked was milk chocolate
