00,02ok
at this part of the level, Valve just wanted to show off their physics i htink
00,02so 3 cinderblocks about balances the board

And lazers
:D
ruuuuuunnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
00,02ok
uhh
00,02so 6 blocks achives about the same balance with gordon on the other end
00,02therefor
00,02freeman weighs 3 cinderblocks
therefore he weighs about 30 pounds.
there for i dun really care
even if they're 20 pound cinderblocks, he only weighs 60.
I weighted 60 when I was 10. :/
11,02Night all ^-^;

minor latoration = 8 health
Failing carefully

00,02also is that the right way to do it?
00,02with crowbar?
You must construct additional pylons
crowbar is always right way to kill anything that's not immortal. If you don't have tactical nukes anyway
ya crowbars are the way to do it
Yeah, someone was yesterday apparently
And now it's raining
00,02i hold down the crowbar button
00,02they die
00,02you cant explain that
being shed.mov'd. that's....not pleasant
crowbar + force + skull usually is a good explanation.
i watched it on my own
inb4 barnacles
brb

that rumor has been bugging me for quite a while
*Everything else is a waste of time

00,02i think i know the problem
...He likes ponies?
00,02settings were all wrong
oh
my
ded
is the stream still lagging for anyone else?
Hallo~
What's going on in here now?
Hugging is uncomfortable.
Sorry.
'S all cool.
i am
It really is, though. I don't know how to act is social situations.
Why would you actively tell anyone unless they ask ....
just don't confess like you would if you would be gay or something
most people could not care less
just think about it you're confessing about watching a cartoon
a cartoon
it's like HEH I'M WATCHING SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS
exactly
I tried to draw on my iPad. It did not turn out well at all
it's not like you're gay or something, it's a cartoon and you should act as if you're watching any other cartoon
I don't think I can confidently keep merch and clothing though. I
just don't.
00,02k
00,02something else time
I had a McDonalds Pinkie Pie clipped to my school bag for like... a month.
+Phase4 bastion time?
*park

hanging it from my bag*
*and just
Why do you want to tell people

I think there was a live action Asterix at some point,.
i've never heard of them. they any good?
11,01Should I be in my maid outfit today?
the boring one
11,01:p
TO IMDB!
A Movie....
(I had that on VHS when I was a kid)
Not as good as the actual comics, in my opinion.
There is another one?
11,02It has a 7.5/10...which looks to be an A Movie as well
it's the old boring one
I remember having one on VHS.
11,01What tasks do you give a * ?
>_(\
i loved all of the asterix films,my favorite as the olimpic games one :)
That's all.
the other Asterix movies are pretty cool
<-<
really why?
00,10inb4 I cant find it
Rating apparently.
MORE REROLLS?
11,02Based off of the rating, I'm going to reroll, it looks like an A Movie to me.
11,01I've never heard of the movie.
14/7/11: NEVER FORGET :p
There needs to be a definite limit.
11,027.5/10, same as the A Movie
11,01Was the budget high?
good
Rerolling again?!
No "between the range of yaddayada with a budget of flimflam"
For flipping .
the amount of rerolls in this channel are too goddam high?
it's animation, it's limited release, it's FOREIGN
oh for f*ck's sake another re-roll
re-roll
That's racist yo.
XD
11,02Next reroll is...
more bass making time for meee!
11,02128
Budget and production
omg i want my pick
goddammit when did a 7.5 become HIGH?
Idek.
by*
Sooooo
00,10must be to make up for not having to reroll at all last week.
Oh mai gaaaaaaawd.
rerolls are fun imo
people get more chances
but it's fluctuated
it adds to the tension a little
it's me
Reroll EVERYONE
Maybe we can take some of the best A's and the best B's we've had and create an average.
ITS ME!
yeah
Fluctuation means the definition isn't really very good.
I can FEEL IT!
it's BIRDEMIC!
Inb4 it isn't.
http://i.qkme.me/3oo2xp.jpg
Inb4 goddamnit.
LOL!
<otakon> goddammit
honestly, Rotten Tomatoes
^
It's a bad sign when not even the mods can apparently agree on the criteria.
Why would A movies have low ratings?
otakonfoals can't arrowforce.
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
And the Asterix movie did have a high budget for an Euuropean animated film.
I'd like to think A movies are just newer movies.
But yeah... For example, all the Monthy Python films should be considered A.
it's Birdemic I can feel it
Curse the official ratings
If they pick mine, it wins. Toho studios didn't really HAVE a budget at the time.
pandastore for a snack?
that's why it's a lottery.
brb
http://www.mypandastore.com/
Intermission cycled twice.
11,01The best damn movie ever.
we*
11,01Of course.
get on with it!
sooo they are sorting the entries from the last time ?
Godfather?
Twice
Again.
I think they're discussing A/B critirias now.
yeah get on with it!
Not discussing re-rolling.
Just make up a vote.
Seriously
/me discusses rerolling
standardize it off Budget only
Come on

This may be the longest intermission I've witnessed.
Why does this have to happen /during/ the lottery?
Aaahhh!!!!
Pirates, not the caribbean one... The Porn movie
Come on

When it comes up, it comes up.
i mean that budget is the main factor imo
http://i.qkme.me/3oo2xp.jpg

00,10You all do remember that nick changeing during +m is not primited right?
It isn't?

8,6Ok, 1 last thing

seriously, we've had a mod win EVERY LOTTERY in one catergory for the last MONTH.
ok i am back, sammich and cuppa in tow
Ikr? Hax, man. Hax.

NO!
is +m on?
and I know not ALL of them enter the lottery
still, four weeks of four picks
Hmmm. That remind me... gotta go check if I even did get the newsletter.

The only illusion that the mods win a lot is because they're a group.

ROLFE.
NO SPOILERS!!
i haven't shed tears in years. idk why.
it was either him or some other actor
everyone dies at the end
sorry i like changing subjects xD
Baur.
Is this supposed to be a horror film?
working at an ice cream shop
>miss eman
Wasn't he here... yesterday?...
no
No a comedy
or something like that
thus causing no time for visits
mostly comedy
he was here once this week
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/264/049/cc5.jpg
Wait, is there such thing as a horror comedy?
because they're kinda opposites...
it's a parody of Frankenstein, and a really good one
imdb says it a sci-fi comedy
Yes. This.
Darn it why do i always say horrow instead of horror
The closest that Mel Brooks has ever come to horror was "High Anxiety".
Ahahahahahaha
Miss...eman?
Ahahahahahaha
Dude,
