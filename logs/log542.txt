Hello everypony. What's on the stream?
Depends on how expensice the 3DSXL is
nes is 12 bucks for gods sake
I think the WiiU is 300 bucks
SNES games were $60-$70
And we can get a good amount of cash for the atari
and the sega cd
But he's not a fucking seller.
and the sega 32X
Went for tea, what's happening?

:P
1327000-27050 forwarded?
13something like that, forget the range
I prefer console gaming
KILL ALL THE THINGS!
Juan
FAIL!
Failure.
00,02whats the client limit cvar?
00,02Shizuka, only need 3 actually
13hm..
00,0205 15 and 07 i think
13heard it's best to forward the full range
20 seconds
13i'll look it up
5
4
3
2
13oooo there's an autoblacklist and an autofavorite prompt cvar
13like if you quit a server shortly after joining you can have it prompt to blacklist that server for you
13or fave if you were on for a long time
00,02dis is working well enough
I have returned, with sour keysp
:p
13uh oh update
00,02udp 0 0 *:27005 *:*
00,02udp 0 0 *:27015 *:*
00,02udp 0 0 *:27020
00,02dems the ports
/me noms on his excuse for food
3Phase are udp? you the pea UTP Uduhpee
3Phase Udupee
13yeah i think the guides i read say to just forward 27000-27050
13since all source games use that range
I'll take ease of console use over constantly having to update and tweak just to get it to START any day of the week.
13you don't have to constantly tweak...
13you tweak once
13um.. no..
13ja... and the point is you do those because you want them...
most tf2 cosmetic mods dont get touched by updates anyway since they are client side and dont effect gameplay
13consoles you don't even get the choice
1377F rain :<
Well, I think I'm going to attempt to eat Chinese food cold
dang thats hot
k ^_^
13otakon: except when it doesn't
13which is horribly pathetic to hear of games that have performance issues on a console
I havent played my 360s in over a year
or crap console
13or both!
Yea, I've never understood why certain games have problems when they're designed specifically for a console, especially the ones that are console-exclusive.
/me is back (gone 01:20:27)
usually do to development deadlines
due
yep

00,10indeed
13Kammerjunk|Bday: Myst was originally released in 1993
Oh, that's pretty neat.
00,10nice job on the mane, I often hear complaints about it.

13i keep saying myst defined mein childhood... i know just about everything there was to know about the series
ham you make that sound like a bad thing
Shamroc*
13well and ja i have memorized myst 1-3
Books defined my childhood.
...
13which ist why i have had writers block on riven for a year
Myst was also one of the first games to be released on CD-ROM. In fact, it helped boost CD-ROM drive sales
I've been playing TF2 too much, I was playing L4D2 earlier and I thought it was TF2.
omg myst
13graphics flickering is gone, stream is nice and smooth~
