so none of my fimfiction fics have updated....
3heheh, that's silly
i guess drawing is all that is left
Very_Silly_Filly: quite, but probably nothing nuclear.
Very_Silly_Filly: It would probably just be filled with excessive /me use, knowing this chat.
Then again, every time I hear a bad joke, the screen would be shot with a rocket launcher
it would be like MSTK3000 times a houndred
Very_Silly_Filly: caps locked but now with voice
Indeed.
Very_Silly_Filly: It'd be organized chaos.
Everlasting_Joy: With me around, it's more than nuclear :)
Jim: you make it sound like a bad thing
moop
Very_Silly_Filly: Oh you :).
Very_Silly_Filly: very chaotic
/me is away: I SHALL RETURN DO NOT FEAR
I work with plasmoid and quantum technology
Very_Silly_Filly: Kicks and bans and glomping everywhere

And then I appeared and stabbed them all with a phaseblade
in the meantime draw the reg room ;p
3She might just choose her boyfriend
Do you think someone would explode if they hit the ground as the fastest possible speed?
Spike: Nice moves, smart guuuuuy.
Very_Silly_Filly you technicly can't stab with a Phaseblade :/
Spade-Magnes[R]: sonic explosion
I'm being serious by the way
lol
dohoho?
Man? Dohoho
it depends on the nature of the phaseblade tbh
Lil_B: Using solid objects with plasma technology mixed with quantum alloys and nuclear fusions, I think yes. For it's a solid laser
Spade-Magnes[R] physicly speaking no, but it will defenetly look like a small exploson
Like a lightsabre, but solid
oo
So even at a high fast fall the body wont fall apart?
Only cost me 294 Million quid to develop :)
Sexy tiems
The landing would gib you easily
Very_Silly_Filly: technically, lightsabres are solid :p
Very_Silly_Filly I think it will melt its way threw you, not really "stabbing" you :S
Fair enough
Lil_B: Oh you
The point is, it hurts :) and does it's job
i once had a dream i was an icecream and the sun wanted to kill me

dari is smiling, I think
I think you kind of like the attention
Tovler: So do you think he meant we would be surprised in a GOOD way?
dari: You know we will anyway. It's as inevitable as the cliffhanger.
Club Nintendo platinum status for 3 years running.
camera

we'll totally get resolution here. I have a good feeling about it
Tovler: not being rude but what does that have to do with anything?
HE GOT OWNED

The Wii at least had Twilight Princess. 3DS had nooooo games until SM3DL and Mario Kart unless you count the remakes of OoT and Starfox

The girl is a walking disaster
It's her Hasbro
Spade-Magnes[R]: O_O
o.o
:> User0
Plus there are no games she would play
so it would be a waste of cash
13trixie ist in mexico?
yeah
There's only like 5 launch games that I want on the Wii U… wait that's actually a lot.
isadly yes
Meanwhile: it explains why i never sleep
She never plays any of the games I have so...
why did everything become comic booky?
Spade-Magnes[R] I read the story, and sorry for taking a while, had to eat. And it doesn't really seem dark, unless thre are more chapters
there*
Biglaw: thats pretty much it apperently
zombiU wii fit U (lol) nintendo land, assassins creed 3 and i think wii sports U if its on it
He's very quiet.
Also I never like playing with my sister with videogames
She sucks... I get bored constantly winning

My sister would break my controllers.
I stoped playing video games with her a long time ago.

or somthing
I'm up to 29 errors now... This is the opposite direction of progress...
night, alexxm
Believe me, yes he is
He's trying to. But he's not very good at it.
Also at this rate my sister will never get a computer, thank god
i'll go with something it sound about right
She does stuff she isnt supposed to on her school comp
?
I'd laugh hard if 3DS ambassadors got $50 off the Wii U price.
LOL
What happens if we get to New York and it explodes?
Best question ever.
Smart Hiro...
yeah
teleport?
"I cheated"
again?
i thought they already got their payback
they want moar
so what movie is this?
They only cashed in on half of the pay back
Most people would hate ratting people out but I enjoy ratting out my sister when she diserves it
oh, that tv show
denied
God I wish i could actually buy stuff from the E shop
So, any word on what the trilogy is going to be this week?
twilight_sprinkle: refined
Vordox: no fair adding letters
/me checks to see if e-shop games can be gifted
lol
Freeze frame.

00,10Kandarihu, you should check out the newsletter some time
her?
newsletter?
oh...shit
woah
Hai Sumica
Oshi
Sumica: Nobody's got a newsletter in ages.
....
Oh boy
ohai Sumica
sssssssshhhhhhheeeeeeeeeettttttttttt
aw
00,10if only there was a part on the site where we posted the news letter.
oh shit
I wana see the gore!
that sounds like a pipe dream, Sumica
8,6ages = 1 week?
Lame....
Sumica: Ikr, you should start doing that.
I just looked at the newsletter on the site. It's last week's newsletter.
I don't need to see this while at work...
I'm sorry for not checking that before checking.
I hate the 3ds has horible ds game quality
and the change aspect thing sucks
Er, before asking. I should've looked, then asked.
....
Sumica: Oh and even better, you don't have the most recent newsletter up. :P
....uh oh
oh mai
THE 3ds is good
daw. I missed Band of Brothers yesterday.
8,6the newsletters don't come out until Monday evening usually
Oh fuu....double rift......CRAP
it is good
00,10Did't read it did ya
dat fuuuu face
its jsut the quality for ds games is kind of crap
8,6so the one on the site right now is the current newsletter
Spade-Magnes[R]: Buy the right ones
00,10namely the part where it says the folowing weeks trilogy
DS games look a little muddy on the 3DS but I don't mind.
who dafuq cares about the quality Spade-Magnes[R]
The aspect ration thing is stupid though
*ratio
the doctor
Spade-Magnes[R]: the quality isnt the game whats inside of it its what makes a good game
soo chat is ded once mor
Well, according to this newsletter, we're watching Final Fantasy The Spirits Within and Tremors this next weekend. And the trilogy is Naked Gun.
Sumica: Daaaah there it is.
ee
oh god the spirits within :|
So are you doing it again?
Sexy tiems
<Tovler>DS games look a little muddy on the 3DS but I don't mind. <--- i mind alot... i bought a dsi xl just to avoid that problem heh
00,10*headdesk*
So much secks today
Head, Meet palm :D
Palm, apply direct to the forehead.
Meanwhile: hoof, not palm
hey Sumica, did you say we had to resign up for the newsletter or some such?
Look. This isn't even worth the trouble. I have other stuff that takes priority this week. I just wanted to know what I'm missing out on.
COSMIC!
/me applies his palm to User0's forehead.
Not to mention the change aspect ratio makes every thing small
Kandarihu: Band of Brothers if I'm interpreting it right.
00,10Dont know there RyunosukeKnT, would have to ask shizu on that one.
Ha, down to 22 errors...
13ping?
sorry to ask this but i really really fucking want vvvvv lol anyone has some points to gift?
pong
ah
/me glomps Shizuka
Pff I wish
Sumica: I don't see the newsletter in my inbox
User0: Wasn't it 14 before? :P
Well, Band of Brothers isn't a trilogy, even if one were to apply discontinuity to bad installments.
...What is Claire from Resident Evil movies doing here?
Vordox: It went up to 25 at one point, and now I'm down to 20
00,10it has not been sent
Okay then.
Dat tense situation
CUPCAKES
Dat trying too hard.
its funny how the day we were watching band of brothers after i disconnected i checked what was on tv and it was like 4 band of brothers movies
But I can honestly see how a Band of Brothers marathon can replace the trilogy event.
I swear the E-shop taunts me with all the games I could be playing
so this week is Band of Brothers?
DDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
00,10seeing as it's around the same time as we would show trilogys yeah

Alchemist: u have seen the pinkiequest right?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jGn7sPZEWk

Alchemist: well brodyquest is the original

CrimsonPhoenix: ...
cachi01: nope
SORRY EVERYPONY D:
Pool noodle is best noodle.
I ACTED TOO QUICK
Alchemist: WUUUT u know the TOOT TOOT spam thing
13the button marked pool noodle is of course part of the orbital cannon controls
Don't banish me, or throw me into a dungeon
13it's perfectly nonsensical, people call me crazy when they hear of it
TO THE DUNGEON 1 THOUSAND YEAAAAAARS
CrimsonPhoenix: 1 MILLION YEAR
or throw me in a dungeon in the place you will banish me
But the one thing they're not counting on....is the Spanish Inquisition
YO EARL! Hey! You're Fired! You butt!

hiro is best hero
cachi01 I really dont know... :(

Shit
13i only have one upvote for my rocky horror joke in /r/tf2... makes me sad
Blacked out again

CrimsonPhoenix: I need to ask my staff friend about this event...
00,10oh it's this show.

00,10shame they never made a third seasion
Idk what that is, but if I did and I'd seen Rocky Horror I'd probably vote it up.
User0, you mean the fire?
CrimsonPhoenix: indeed
YES YOU ARE

It was the highlight of bronycon after all
Sumica shame they never made the second half of that second season
Schizo is not a power! It's a mental state. D:<
Sumica: WUT? i just found out this series was good
User0: at bronycon? theres a vid on youtube, it was just a lamp
CK|Catnap: Not this type
Sumica: that means no more funny hiro for me :(
OH NUUU
twilight_sprinkle: I realize, but I can poke fun that he wasn't being a good staffer :)
/me is ded
Bam, turns out it was her all along.
Vordox: Having another personality isn't a superpower. :P
What a tweest.
00,10alow me to refrase, they made a third seasion. But it sucked outlod so it never happend
It's not another personality
CK|Catnap: Check what she can do

User0: lul, they head of staff was getting trolled about it too
I'm back, what are you watching?

00,10this looks like early seasion 1, cause Dale is still around
waaaaaaaat
twilight_sprinkle: I don't know the head, but I can still have fun with my friend.
I set the screen
It's not another personality? Then what the hell is it? Because that's kind of what they're indicating so far >_>
I´ve*
You'll see
Because chat must be allowed to live naturally.
THANKS SUMICA FOR THAT SPOILER; YOU SHOULD BE KICKED for spoiling
not possible
I'm annoyed at the "'X' NEVER HAPPENED" thing that fanboys always do.
mmmoney
It is a flowing river from which thoughts flow and cannot be interfered with artificially.
Sumica and then you kick me for requesting a random video :D
all my wut
hiro is indeed best hero
Vordox: you know Sumica is the bigest hypocrit here
.............HEROES??????
00,10no i kick you for requesting the same thing 15 times after i said no
/me nuzzles Sumica.
You must let chat regrow it's shattered bones and breathe anew, not staple it with braces.
Hiro Nakamura? AAAAAAAW YEAH!

13i wonder if i could ask to have it changed to degreaser... that is my standard..
8,6not sure which one though
Jim: He's a slient protector.
kirzstryfe: Which is your fave? :P

Spade-Magnes[R]: yay there is an AVGN vid in the related vid =D
for some reason I'm glad I showed you that
i even have a wrench you can borrow
Hard hat, goggles, giant wrench, one glove, overalls.
How the hell is Avgn in the related videos?
and I am done for the day - back down to 14 errors!
8,6was thinking cardboard and lots of duct tape for the wrench
Dispensin an erec-nope.
Well, 14 compiletime errors, I don't even want to know how many logical errors I have....
8,6lol
sumica wanna murder some kerbals?
XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhjk5x54bsE&feature=BFa&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Heres Turntable Turnabout if anyone wants it
moop
hmm
I am watching the bronycon fire incident
Meanwhile: he is a little tall for an engi though
they SHOULD have shut the power immediately
Irrelevant.
00,10No kerbal right now,
Awww
But slaughtering kerbals is fun!
8,6wonder if I could scrap together a sentry with some old camping chairs I have
00,10Seems there is somthing from bronys coming up on attck of the show in a few min
kirzstryfe, red or blue engi?
kirzstryfe: just steal the one at the valve hq
Sumica will you stream it?
Lets hope that ends well...
8,6probably blue, because literally every tf2 set I saw last year was red
Its up in about 9 mins
attack of the show sumica?
00,10No, Scoot is. If I stremed it we would have to wait 4 hours for it to come on in my time zone
Where do you live anyway?
00,10it's a tv show on G4
00,10I live in Vegas
R.I.P the bronycon light fixture :(
I live in Wisconsin
moop
cachi01: and then they proceded to have derpy say it was her fault
i wanted to slaughter some kerbals but the game wont work
DX
I like blue more as a colour personally. as for sentry, how long is it until Megacon?
00,10it's kinda funny people from any other part of nevada say they are from nevada. But people from vegas will say vegas instead of nevada.
it just shows the logo
Spade-Magnes[R]: really? LOL
again
Sumica: Attack of the show?
steal the red one at valve hq..and paint it blue
cachi01: yea after the fire a person in a derpy costume said it was her fault
Attack of the show is usually horrible
Vordox: TV show on the G4 channel
00,10yeah, "attack of the show" is the name of the show
8,6it's in late feb or march this year I think
Where+
And on that note, I'm going home
I might be back on later, but that seems unlikely at the moment...
Ah well that's ages. You could go full on with the frames from those chairs.

I'll play KH when the final mixes come stateside.
4 towering engine
uhh
Who is streaming...plz say your name in the stream.
I don't know. KH 2 was a little confusing, especially if you didn't play Chain of Memories. The combat system was weirder too
WallDives: that will happen when hl3 releases
KH 1 KINDA SUCKED
Yay
But KH 2 was 20% cooler
KH 2 was my first KH
card based gameplay was eh at first
Why is Re Chains so much better than the origonal?
cachi01, I'm aware. you also owe me a set in Skullgirls.
i know
I only saw part of KH 1.. didn't like it
ok.
Maybe because it works better with its 3d and camera
kh bbs was pretty good
00,10oh nice
00,02kerbal space program, 20% more explosions than the leading brand
but the day we were going to fight WallDives i didnt found you on mah friend list
Phase4 there is no leading brand
what was your gamertag?
What does it take to become a Moderator in Bronystate?
Oh boy....
Phase4: and shrapnel, dont forget
I wonder when they held that contest that Kurt Zisa won

Virgin sacrifices.

flutter_spin Sorry
00,02Sumica, what do you meen no good? all the good will come of this

Fou_Lou nope. unless you message them
twilight_sprinkle: There's a black cloth, a black, red, & blue balloon toward the back near left center, Im under the red balloon

AttackPony: Possibly set a record for killing them
Shamrocs with forever alone head ... now i want to do that ..
Sumica: You would be executed for wasting so much money

Oh my god it's 1:51 in the morning

Spade-Magnes[R]: Because you'll DIE if you don't.
I'm off to bed
well this wouldn't get off the ground on my PC, simply because the first frame would be off the runway
Night

/me grabs Sumica "Destruction, destruction everywhere!"
Are we EVER gonna get off the runway?
l
Im amazed at just how absolutely HUGE Houston brony meets have become - first was was a few weeks before last year's Oni con - had 12-15 show up for that, the 2nd meetup had 18-20 then I missed the next couple of meetups after that
0FPS = my average framerate
they always get buggy like that. if you reach too many parts, they just repell each other ont he runway and bug away
I don't think you have enough rockets!
Let's get more expendable people to die in this explosions
who'S streaming?
00,02Jim, mabey
/me sits on Dark_Horst
Sumica: launch it in that state
Dark_Horst: Sumica is
meh!
LAUNCH
Who would be more expendable than kerbals
Shamroc. The knight that says..."Meh"
Gerbils
JESmith71 they get revived in pagan rituals everytime. they made a deal with mephisto and ar enever able to die forever.
Sumica: THIS IS THE SPLOSION THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!
or Guinea Pigs
Lemmings

You want to know the amazing skill of the fandom?
OperatorPony: No advertising other rooms in here.
Problem? i think it's the sollution!
Sumica: that should stop the uncontollablility
00,02OperatorPony, no channel advertizing
/me gratefully accepts said plushie
Houston is a force to be reckoned with - and NO mistake ^_^
They made artwork of chrysalis pretty much 20 minuets after she showed up
The space ship needs more railings.
/me lies in Meanwhile's lap and watches Sumica build death traps
Dark_Horst dayZ is maybe going to be a stand alone game. I am awainting the events before I'm going to buy it ^^
So this spaceplane looks legit

I could never get into Myst...I might try realMyst though, especially if it's free-roaming.
Dark_Horst: jet engines fail around 16-20km
Shizuka: oh well, Pool Noodles work good too.
oh god buffer
/me takes back the MIGHTY GLOVE OF SLAPPING +5 from Shizuka
Pool noodles are best noodles

welcome to Pan Galactic Spaceways, we are now cruising at an altitude of 180 km above Kerbal, and as soon as we quit spinning, we'll send out the robots to clean up all the vomit in the passenger compartment.
"They say LC is like NY with everything squeezed together, and RC is like LC with everything squeezed together, like a corperation-controlled village"
Lol perfect music
this is what I imagine Kerbal people sound lik
/me rocks from side to side to the music

good to know
00,02lol extra question mark
Hi Lunaughty
00,02braind erp
come here a minute Meanwhile
yeah, drop the externals. when they're empty, they're throwing off your center of mass
Phase4: yeah drop the liquid ^-^
SPeeking, lets find luna
Lunaughty: Why would I do that?
TO THE MOON
lo9l, no momentum to drop
Meanwhile: heres why
/me drags Meanwhile to another room
/me did not ask for this.
dat shanghai
/me is happy
TURN FORWARD TURN FORWARD!!
/me returns five hours later with Meanwhile
you think you'll survive re-entry?
MAKE EM EXPLODE
/me looks no different than he did five hours ago.
well, they're still alive
and then the externals hit the ship
o.o
MAYHEM
O_O
/me licks Meanwhile
<3 this song
Meanwhile: moustache still in one piece?
hiya Chrysalis
oh I only think about that video
when I hear this song
ohai ota
Wait...that's the actual original?
Oooh dis soong
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3232/
Sumica: aim for the ocean?
fly through an asteroid belt
CrimsonPhoenix: eeyup
otakon: Please. It break skulls.
aaaaw
he;'s trying to land back at the pad
Meanwhile: I would pay to see that
yeah. landing _anything_ other than by parachute splashdown is a crazy exercise in this game. especially with framerates
HAH
get into orbit and run out of fuel Sumica problem solved ^-^
you is falling
Meanwhile .. wth just happened?
he's falling very slowly, it's ok
Faster!
Louder!
Stronger
ponibas: I am loathe to speak of it sufficed to say it was unpleasant.
O BY SWEET MERCIFUL SEXY MOLESTIA! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS ?! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2198/
lol
00,02this game doesnt simulate re-entry
it gets better
Bronysith: Your caps lock.
00,02so you can just falll
Bronysith: I don't even
Bronysith: eh
What the hell is this song?
Phase4: is it planned?
Not even disturbed buy that
*by
hen3ry 1200m/s isn't slowly
holy shit fluttershy
it's Flutter-Rex
00,02Fou_Lou, dont know
invi that's total speed not falling speed.
/me takes Bronysith and kicks him to the moon
This explains Meanwhile s behavior completely http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3296/
DO.NOT.WANT
the Phase4 has been doubled
00,02dont think so, having to make my rockets re-entry capable could be booring
Come on go fast
00,02why do i keep typing 'booring'
Bronysith: i like this one better http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/245/4
Phase4: should probably an option
jesus Bronysith, one does not simply grape people in the mouth
part cow Phase4?
* http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/245/
hen3ry the upper height things says that it is still about 1000m/s ^^
i brokes it
Jim: im a timelord Bronysith not jesus.

Attention, this is your chief flight attendent speaking. We are currently hurdling straight for the Kerbal ocean where we will surely die a horrible death. Yeah, sorry bout that, and if we survive, please remember Pan Galactic Airways for your next flight.

Broneysith,if that's the face of his Nightmares,what's the face of his Nightmare MOONS (bad pun i know)

Meanwhile: it's like it is staring in my soul
00,02turn the rockets on
FIRE THE ENGINES

Like a eagle pilioting a blimp
Spitfire: Nah, Derpy Doo/Ditzy Doo, whatever you call her
Dis song.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4680/
Bronysith: Mhmm. Fun fact, I don't even have nightmares. Nightmares have me.

RoboGerbil: Midnight_Tempest is sleeping
it will do neither. It is a trollchute
Vordox: it will always be derpy hooves to me :3
Meanwhile's face when someone sits on him without permission: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1970/

Phase4: Hey he's doing better then i've ever seen you do
SO SLOW
Flying like an eagle, piloting a blimp.
Bronysith: That's my face in general anyway.
Come on step it up
newp
00,02Sumica, if you can go in reverse, theres a way to make it detatch
so, who else things he's gonna slam nosefirst down as soon as the chute opens?
Meanwhile: i thought your face was the megusta face
this game needs more ponies
He's gonna explode no matter how he lands
Meanwhile: or the FfffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU face
Bronysith: that's my moustaches face.
00,02its an artifact of how they make it disapear when you land
but in 700m, it's gonna open
the chute is already open. or you mean when it billows?
you're doing good sumica
00,02incredibly anoying when you accidentally do it
is his mic delayed?
/me falls laughing
nah, but the stream is
Damnit non fittig music
Xaiden just typical stream delay
NOW THAT I HAVE SAID IT
That chute is the equivalent of leaving a restroom with toilet paper stuck to your shoe.
Come on faster.....
LOL!
dat europony
NOW DIVE
00,02Sumica, you have landing gear right?

The reply is massivly delayed
Sumica, since you cant meet luna, you should meet the sea ponys
why do you need recovery anyway sumica?
id rather deal with molestia than a perverted chrysalis
/me runs to Canterlot because apparently that's how this works.
YAY

00,02nope
00,02no chutes

stupid lower layer of the atmosphere keeps you from getting any real speed on contact.
What the helll kills them on impact?
Lol the music..
Spade-Magnes[R]: well
K.i.A
How does water make them vaporize?
00,02the seperators survived ?
Spade-Magnes[R]: probably the sudden speed change from 280 m/s to zero.
No explosions. Good day was had.
Spade-Magnes[R]: going that fast from that height and into water you might as well land on concrete
Spade-Magnes[R]: if you were travelling at that speed and hit water, the ship would disintegrate
soo then
Spade-Magnes[R]: at that speed solid ground and water isnt that much of a difference to crash into
00,02Spade-Magnes[R], programer lazieness
i wanna do somthin that isnt l4d2
Spade-Magnes[R] try filling up your bath tub with water.. then slapping the surface as hard as you can
yes, stupid, I like it
/me is never riding in a Kia again
STUPID STUPID YAY!!!
here is Meanwhile when he was born http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/807/
MORE THRUSTAHS
Bronysith: It's funny because those were my first words.
This will tottaly work!
and imeddiatly after that i get an invite to play l4d2
uhhh
lol
Dont worry ribs grow back
Sumica: put cockpit on just one rocket, lets see what happens :3
Sumica: counterweight the back
Alright gentlemen, we need a new method of getting into space. Fuel Efficient Hybrid thrusters, NOPE More Rockets :O
Raiht :)
lol
Spade-Magnes[R]: no they don't...
it looks like a *gets slapped*
Inb4 ka boom
It is now the Heavy Camelback

Not enough blush
Nice music for a launch...

It's very legit
Bronysith: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5600/
and then it fell apart
FIRE
sumica it's intel equipment
Spitfire: It will fly upward catch a draft wind and tilt to one language veryinig on the wind. Then spiral. Then death upon impact of surface.
00,02it'll snap off on landing
Anddddddddddddddd
Sumica, Final Countdown?
Spitfire: I know. I've tried -lol

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN!°!!!!!
Game says "I know better than you, lol... let's move all the thrust to stage 1.
No
Land it on the moon
Then play sweet victory
unless it's designed to spin
=D
symmetry is overrated.
Sumica but what about space drills
Sumica: To quote death the kid. "I NEED SYMETTRY!"
and/or crash
Yes My Little Can Can :)
Play alexs ghost remix
00,02hen3ry, its real fun when it moves thrusters that are ontop of fuel tanks to before those tanks are seperated
okay, this may fly
No it wont
Wtf...
LOok a tthe thrusters...
Phase4 I hate it when it does that
Sumica: put the drag chutes on on takeoff
that arent on...
Phase4: Yeah, I know that.
WElp

Ponies47: Happy
00,10nah just menus and mun
Fastah
mitamaking: :|
11,01Ponies47: Drive home by myself for 11 hours with no AC through 100F + weather.
11,01With anxiety.
pony_931: Fitst get a name, second random pony fansite that shows ponies and other videos live
11,01Hate to trump you.
pony_931: We do stuff, often movies and games
Nittany_Discord: Ok yeah that is much worse O_O
Drop the bass
dat song
FUCK YEA THIS SONG
11,01Hoping my cat doesn't die from the heat.
WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THIS BASS
DROP DA BASS
11 hours from SC? That'd be.. either NY or Texas.
11,01She panted the whole way.
11,01But made it.
/me dropped the bass
Man Pinkie you are loud
will the space debris stay between flights?
Nittany_Discord: How old is your cat?
00,10Pick that up Chrysalis
DAT MUSIC
Jim and mitamaking: Thanks guys! I take it at the moment we're all just here because we can?
I made you a bass, but I dropped it :<
/me drops all the bass
11,01hen3ry: Pennsylvania.
Fou_Lou: Yup
Pinkie Pie is in the house tonight
/me picks up the bass
DJ PP
11,01I think she's 5 now.
20% moar bass
/me comes up to Meanwhile: May I have this dance.
Nittany_Discord: Ah, you drive slower than me :D
/me drops ALL the bass
/me pumps it through speakers
Wubwubwub
11,01hen3ry: I was towing a tralier.
11,01*trailer
Nittany_Discord: justified then
My god
/me takes AttackPony by the hoof. "You may."
Confound my chat derps hold on :|
11,01So I had to drive slower.
Nittany_Discord: Ohh. I hope your cat is doing much better
carry on
pony_931: Currently there's a stream up with music and a mod playing the game Kerbal Space Program
Are we there ye!
11,01I usually make the same trip in 9 hours.
If I could just bump this
*yet
11,01And she's doing better.
Who's playing? Sumi or Phase?
Irish_Pony: so its theoretically possible to get so much up there and into orbit that you cant get through it?
It would be so awsome
Are we there yet
yeah if you'd mentioned the trailer + 11 hours, I'd've guessed Baltimare
sumi
11,01Sadly, I missed Bronycon. :<
Heard the ping
Back
:l
Fou_Lou: Tab fail. And yes
11,01I almost went.
BASS+HIGH PASS FILTER= AWESOME
SPACE DEBRI!!!
11,01But I didn't make it :<
Fou_Lou: But space is infintr you silly filly.
Jim: Sweet :)
Nittany_Discord: Same. I missed it. :<
LUDICRIOUS SPEED GO!
00,03There will be another time~
Nittany_Discord: I know what it feels lik to drive in that kind of weather without AC, though the distance is different
Iron_Edge: but not the space around your planet
lmao
Oh dead
oh dear
/me dances with Meanwhile happily
11,01I just hope I can go in January.
/me listens to Bass Muffin again
Iron_Edge: either it will fall down or leave orbit.
dat reentry angle
Play the song of time!
Um..Sumica...you wanna check on your ship?
Fou_Lou: It will hit the rim of space and game programming will tke it from there
Fou_Lou:
inb4 ded
00,02wait
That thing is going to leave a crater the size of New Orleans.
00,02i see no chutes
V A > V A >
Iron_Edge: lol
phase there are none
nah... game slows you down when you hit the lower atmosphere.
Fou_Lou: Irregardless. It nearly impossible to hit a piece of space debris unless your piloting is just that good.
So much pinkie cant handel it
theres a new post of creating your own mane 6, that'll be interesting
http://i712.photobucket.com/albums/ww128/BigCatt378_1/1324072809815.gif THis picture goes well with the song
It wont work!
00,10flap to the beat

Ponies47: Other people?
Meanwhile: You read that without the 'L', didn't you?
v v A A > >
Iron_Edge: Thats why i said theoretically
AttackPony: Who me? nah/.
AttackPony: Nope just sing it outta randomness by myself :P
/me raises an eyebrow at Meanwhile
uhhh
Iron_Edge: you just have to get enough up there to hit something
dat canard
:P
Ponies47: Don't be ashamed to be a brony! dance if you must, even with people watching.

i get a feeling were watching 2001 on friday
GabeMoist: ...nope, still can't fin the innuendo in that.
WELP
annnnnnnnnd backwards!

Why does the boss music versus the XIII fit so well with this?
dashierulez: np
what's the name of this song?
FIND A PET>this day aria
inb4 it does the same exact thing
Sumica how about you just duct tape about 6 rockets to the cockpit?
Bronysith: oh shut up
Hi, i'm new to bronystate, but i'm not new to ponies lol.
You just have a vendetta against that song
Spin Sumica, SPIN
SapphireCake: WELCOME TO CHAOS
Welcome SapphireCake!
welcome SapphireCake!
SapphireCake: Hi and welcome
Sapphire Cake,welcome to the brony state addiction
SapphireCake, you may be familiar with ponies, but that will not prepare you for Bronystate at all
Bronysith = Discord? 0_0
this day find a pet
welcome SapphireCake. You'll never sleep again:D
Welcome to Bronystate SapphireCake. Please dispose of your sanity at the designated sanity disposal containers at the main entrance.
00,02Sumica, needs another set of rockets ontop to balance the underneath ones
SapphireCake: you and me both. Just got here a few minutes ago and I already love it!
SapphireCake: and you learned how to ping. good job
SapphireCake: welcome to the Bronystate herd
Shutterfly: goodie
WELP
Huh?
Sapphire Cake,You will get addicted.
Well, those broke
11,01Now let's spin apart!
Do a flip!
it's a center of gravity vs center of thrust issue
acs26
I watched the first episode
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
this day find a pet while giggling at the ghostie at the gala to become popular so smile smile smile
Sumica, what if you created a rocket stretched all the way to the Moon without taking off
I got hooked the first 2 hour
the next day
8,6usually when I start off a drawing I'll draw a rough skeleton to get the pose right, then adjust it as I draw
Why am I watching this?
WG: oh hey. your that one guy from a fewe months ago
SapphireCake: What you are now witnessing is our beloved Sumica doing space experiments.
/me 11,01is glomped
I didn't wanna watch it
hen3ry: and a failing sas issue
almost stabilized...
Well actually i'm not a brony, i'm a pegasister.
NONSENSE
/me dances on the plane
we are falling
Damnti, gotta learn to type words normally
00,02GabeMoist, would crash and burn
AttackPony: Where can I find this game anyways?
the sas isn't failing, it just loses the ability to compensate when the wings lose air
SapphireCake: So am I /)
Yay :)
Shutterfly: steam
Phase4, how do you know?
Sumica: guiles theme fits every wehre
Now BOOST! :D
You can stop now SAS
00,02GabeMoist, too heavy
yaybilized!
BOOST LIKE SONIC UNLEASHED
grats on the stabilizing
cachi01:of course :$ hahaha
prepare for orbit!
WG: so are you a brony?
I think Sumica is going into orbit
Don't think so
or not
Phase4, have a Kerbal hold the base like a ladder to keep it upright
or the sas got crazy or a xenomorph fucked everything
DIVE
Neither a hater
prepare for a verry narrow orbit!
8,6Dive Sumica, Dive!
So I just looked up the top, whats Friday Movie Night?
mach 5 GO!
WG: okay thats good. at least you dont think we are demonic or gay or anything like that lol
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
11,01Sumi Drill!
BREAK THROUGH THE KEARTH
00,02GabeMoist, why not a giant ladder then

Well, I do like bronies actually
BLOW IT UP!

So I just looked up the top, whats Friday Movie Night?
1 hour dungeon
Well I'm Free, Free falling!
lol i'm draw a rough pose, of course that only makes me use more eraser ._.
it feels just like we're falling for the first time
Phase4, the game doesn't let you build ladders, I don't think...
ON A QUEST TO FIND OUT WHO WE ARE!
don't make me watch episode 2
/me 11,01dusts WG
i*
SapphireCake: That's when we show two movies and two pony episodes, every friday
WG: dude. just watch and get it over with
Stayin' ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!
Nittany_Discord: havent we been over this a while ago
BOOOM
But a ladder to the Moon would be ideal
this might leave a mark
oh all right
8,6it's all in how much pressure you use when you're sketching it out
Oh awesome. i'll be there :)
11,01superretroworld: Wut?
GabeMoist inb4 asteroid
jettison that weight!
/me passes popcorn to the chat
Can you crash into the sun?
8,6lots of little strokes make lighter lines that are easier to erase
Nittany_Discord: maid service
yes you can
Aaand, KABOOM
is it possible with what you have?
not with that plane
BOOST
brb I'm on a mission to kill a dam bug that just buzzed into my room
YES
Spade-Magnes[R], probably, we just haven't gotten there yet
it doesn't have the delta-V to escape Kerbal
11,01You are not my boss.
SapphireCake: very important. whos your fav pony?
USE THE BOOST TO GET THROUGH
dat 8bit art of the dress
Three Hour Dungeon!
I'Ll do this in incognito mode in case anybody wants to look up History
Nittany_Discord, But I am
:\
8,6then when you have the final pose, go over it a bit sharper, then as long as you have a decent eraser, you can get the lighter marks off without smudging everything
SapphireCake: beware the minefields
Bombing run?
What are those pink things?
Oh boy

Xaiden no

OMG
No curve huh?

00,02nope

Oh snaaaaaaap

Sumica, let's go to Mars
That's going to another galaxy
THE HELL DID YOU DO
Dat...what even is that?
8,6he's orbiting the galactic center, can't you tell?
dunno, just saw an amusing reaction face
Vordox: Wheres Mario then?
Sumica: can you fly INTO the sun with that rocked?
I think you'll reach Equestria at that rate
ahoy Betelgues!
You built a monster SUmica....
00,02Sumica, warp to the escape, i want to see what happens
Fou_Lou: you need more control to actually hit the sun than you do to escape from it.
alpha centauri or bust!
you never reach escape
Tell me, do you guys like hot dogs?
go for the optics!
whats the hell is his orbital path/
lol
Frank: depends
Optics?
damn thats slow
/me finds Reach, meets the spartans
Like an Aimpoint PRO?
his orbital path is escape trajectory from the sun, Quick_Thinker
Bronysith: On what?
now blow it up!
Frank: what kind of hotdog?
68 years
sun escape actually
LOL|
Frank: like nathans or what
Go take some food then Sumica :P
Higher warp should be possible -.-
68 years
you are always at 68 years, that number never goes down
00,02Quick_Thinker, he's hit escape
what
Frank: or are you being some hater guy?
00,02he will be going up forever
well this is only destined to win
dat 68 years
00,02XD
This is my reaction to Bronysith's antics http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4100/
00,0268 years to escape
68,35,3 is apparently maxint or something.
WE CAN WAIT THAT LOING
LETS DO IT
so whats the longest any pony has actually been in a escape path
And, he shall now go 10000X speed
Biglaw: He already is
OH
00,02Biglaw, he's going like 50000 speed
MY
GOOD GOD
You need some fitting music Mica....
GAWSH
it never gets there
trust me here
Sumica: whats your speed right now?
i think they would run out of food and oxyge before they get to this point
Space Odessy!
11,01Watched the new FiW. Not that great.
Hai Nittany_Discord !
/me licks Phase4
Been meaning to get ahold of you!
Fou_Lou he was at about 6000m/s
Nittany_Discord see Anthology 2?
11,01Hi Vordox
Needs more power!
Nittany_Discord: I agree, FiW 7 was a disappointment
Sumica: Flower Duet is fitting for this.
Oh my, the George Takei pings are back.
i hear typing!
Nittany_Discord, The new song and Raincloud are the only good part
click
Anthology 2 was great
yay

Nittany_Discord: And tbh, you should keep it that way and save yourself an hour.
00,02suddenly music
it's umm,m from that one show
I prefer the Stewie Griffin version of the Shatner abortion of Rocket Man.
Nittany_Discord: 1 hour 30 minutes and 1 sec long
with that one thing
Meanwhile: it great, quit being negative
dats better
I've heard this before... Just not sure what.
Alright, what should I get my Arabic friend for his birthday?
/me has never heard this song before
Spade-Magnes[R]: No. I was bored after 20 minutes and turned it off and I am as entitled to my opinion as anyone else.
lol, 10km's
never heard this before (should i be ashamed)
^
Quick_Thinker: I've never heard it before either.
ok so how many time did he succeed and explode i was away?
Any day now

Quick_Thinker: GOGOGO!

/me eats brains.
Quick_Thinker: GOOOO. Now
its too late whats the time 9 O CLOCK
I've gone out far enough that you can't even see the sun anymore, and still 68 years, 35 days and 3 hours to escape
And then Sumica made a bunch of obscure referances.

Well, at least they vsurvived
You're the waffle in this scenario Sham.
well, most of the boosters survived
ok
Sumica: probably to heave for the outer boosters
back once more
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDTIONAL PYLONS
go back to thee first drill
OK. What the HELL kind of design is that?
Gen 1 pokemon are the only games in the series where pokemon can die - sure a few pokemon synopsis in the later gens mention them feeding on one another or something, but G1 doesnt sugar coat it
The Kerbals are okay!
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PONIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSss
perhaps you need some more attachments on the rockets?
You're the waffle in this scenario Shamroc.
Sumica is streaming right?
yeah
this can not end well...
wait so how does a pokemon die>
You must construct additional nostalgic fear.
i kno it can faint but how does it DIE?
You must construct additional rockets.
You must construct additional what the bleeding hel.
Wait. You went straight from a remix of Lavender Town to a remix of Giggle at the Ghosties.
Quick_Thinker: In gen1 when you get to Lavender town, you find out Team rocket killed a Marowak, leaving its cub Cubone an orphan
Quick_Thinker: Ask Gary about his Radicate.....
FIND A PET :D
dat 8bit find a pet
C:
13and then shamroc was the waffles
HAH
uh huh
The waffles Shamroc! What do they mean?!
AW HELL YEAH Tank FTW
Spade-Magnes[R]: Level 20 :p
okay fine but how did it die i mean did they go beyond fating it?
Now try
launch!
lvl 50 Tank 600 hp

so like ash in episode 1 in a way
yep
Congratulations! your Spaceship has evolved into a Boomstick!

Night Nittany_Discord :P
Band of Brothers
MahBoi777: just tired from the con
Miniseries, not movie
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Hope you had fun, though. :)
So, how was the con? I just saw some of the livestreams

Oh, never heard of it. Thanks bye
BRB Gonna go take a shower :P
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: OH, did you have a good time?
dank u
Who was at BronyCon?
I was
me
I am so Jelly
i have bugs undermy skin i need to scratch them away
ah, yes. the collaborators.
i seen the voice actor panel
What are they doing?
So... what is going on?...
Punishing the women who slept with the Germans
taking revenge on the people who collaborated with the Germans
they don't notice thesoldier?
hey CCCP!
nazzys O_O
AttackPony: Ninjazz theyre cutting their hairs for sleeping with germans
Irish_Pony: Ohh
I see.
MahBoi777: WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? CCCP?
there taking off the hair because they slept with germans
French resistance?
CCCP: uhhhh, yes. >.> <.<
Dutch
MahBoi777: oh ok ;)
operatorMike: Dutch. They're in Holland
Pland had best resistance fighters
:$
its the dutch a place calle Eindhoven
Poland was one of the first places that had to HAVE a resistance. They got hit very early in the war.
eeyup
brb ponies the anthology 2
urgh nickname didnt leave.
haha
Enjoy, XAX_.
will do
hi XAX
aaww
:( poland
We come bearing cigs and choclate
00,10damn that's a big candybar.
He's never tasted chocolate?!
wow
MahBoi777: Ninjazz enjoyed myself i did, got some nice merch and pics got JDL's autograph so yeah fun times
That's just wrong.
Sumica: well considering you could be behind enemy lines for days or even weeks without food...ya....
Meanwhile: rationing and shitty economy
Meanwhile in the Future we have small candy bats
bars*
if he's, say, 6 years old, he would have been too young to have any before the war, then the war...
00,10APC's your doing it wrong
If he's only 6 at the end of the war (1944), he'd have been born during the war.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: that's great!:)
IED!
Did they have APC's back then?
what was that?
00,10bit early for that operatorMike
cigarettes. that will help her feed her baby
Oh, she's double-screwed. Baby's half-German
Ninjazz: not really
Thought so.
:( cigarettes
trade them for food
Ninjazz: no
Those were C rations. It was food
half track!
:( war
whoa
00,10oh hell, neck shot
war...war never changes
war never changes
operatorMike: /)
what is it good for?
Damn! MAN DOWN!
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! sing it to me now!
ouch
This is REALLY making me miss playing WW2 shooters and Company of Heroes.
War is good for keeping Nazi's fromk taking over the world, that's what it's good for.
Jspang1: /)
Suzika, Get to COVER
DAnce like MAD
Ninjazz: dont play cod 2 that game is bullshit
CoD 2 was awesome
i tried it on veteran the other day and it was imposible
I think FPSs are an army plot to train everyone for combat.
of course
was COD2 one of the WWII ones?
yep
Jspang1: I meant WW2 games in general.
"Hey! Listen!"
Ninjazz: ik
is Brothers in Arms:Hell's Highway a good game?
oops
LOLOLOLOL
00,10Ramiriz
Ramirez?
Lol
This series was really fantastic. A great follow-on to Saving Private Ryan'
Ramirez!
Inb4 APC130's.
RAMIREX
Ramirez! Take down that fence with your face!
Get yo' spoon, Ramirez!
RAMIREZ TRAVEL BACK IN TIME AND KILL PPL WITH A DONUT
Ramereiz, Get on that MG and save Private RYAN and TOM HANKS
WE'RE GANNA PAWNCH HITLER IN THE FAEC!
DONUT is best weapon
Ramirez, go 66 miles an hour on this tricycle!
RAMIREZ DO EVERYTHING IN THIS FUCKING WAR BECAUSE WERE TOO BUSY GETTING SHOT
that pile of grass seems legit
DAMN IT RAMIREX KEEP UP
RAMERIZ, DO NOT, AND I REPEAT, DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR!
Fegelein!
Great, shot
...
OH YEAAAH
i love how the others being all quiet and the other guy is like HEFRON
LOL british
Rameriz!!!!!!!!!
MahBoi777: lol
MURICA
Ramirez! Take out that tank with a spork! Dont have a spork? well go find one! Here's a twizler to defend yourself.
wow that logic
He's boned
bloody well
Meanwhile: hey look its your brother
Rain: mw2 in a nutshell
Irish_Pony: Ikr.
Damn Brits... Why can't they just fire first and ask questions later like they should.
Too bad none of the soldiers have any sticky bombs
AttackPony: Brony Hitler lol
Should have fired.
00,10baka
Rameeerriez, take the name of Shizuka!!!
MahBoi777: Oh god lol
DocSane they were your best friend in cod 2
stupid english man
13ping
Damn tank.
xD
Shizuka! You are now Rameriez!!
Shizuka : PING!!
that tank was well hidden
ITS A TRAP
yeah night everyone

Ooh, they got a panzerfaust
13<33
00,10hey jenkens
<33
/me hugs Rain and Shizuka
They need a Laurenfaust.
operatorMike: Stop reading my mind!
Shizuka: you two sillies :P
00,10da hell is he doing
Must crawl faster! Much faster!
is he tryign to ESCAPE The rolling tank?
MahBoi777: Ninjazz if i have a day when im not busy... or just lazy i'll have some con related pics
Sumica: trying to get away?
"PULLL!" *trap Bird swings out* *Bang Pang*
yes RainBowJack, and I even gave Lauren a gift
Back from my shower :P
00,10nice shot with the rpg
Nice!
just stop crawling and you wont have to worry about out running it
I lvoe Rifle Grenades
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: ooh, nice, I'd love to see em when u do
Foiyah
wb Ponies47
Sumica: thats a grenade launcher
That wasn't no rocket propelled anything.
MahBoi777: Thanks :P
Wow really PaladinDrakkenwolf what gift?
Just a grenade.
"Back up, back up!"
"Ouchies"
How many tanks have we lost just because someone wanted to get a better look?
chat=ded
THAT'S rocket propelled
RainBowJack: I made Lauren a portrait of her OC
00,10Irish_Pony it's a riffle mounted nade
cool
00,10it uses the bullet to fire.
Sumica: then instead of RPG shouldnt it have been RMN?
Sauerkraut! Autobahn!
yeah, a blank usually
Ninjazz: like they couldn't see it
00,10it's still rocket propeled
just like most of them..
Yay for bloodshed
Aren't they using Recoiless Rifles, anyway?
It isn't rocket propelled. There's a small pyro charge that lofts it.
Yup.
There's no rocket engine of any type
00,10gibbed
a rifle grenade is NOT a Rocket Propelled Greande
moronos
moronos? really?
It's Forest Gump's ancestor.
Shot in the ass....AGAIN......
Damn.
Rifle Propelled Grenade:P
yeah those were ecoiless rifles
funny thing is you dont need the launcher to use the rifle grenades, you can just prime em and then throw em
RUN FORREST
Save Scootaloo!
RUN!
Why would they save chicken?
00,101 bullet, 4 holes
PaladinDrakkenwolf: yeah but that defeats the purpose of the laucner
FlareChaser: so they could fry some later
bad
Nix is lucky
why war we playing Band of Brothers
Luck
And that's why you MUST always wear a helmet.
Lucky bastard.
MahBoi777: woo~
thats it?
Helmets work!
Nice helmet
WW II helemts were crazy heavy. There was an outer helmet over a steel liner.
I thin kthe steel was the outside part
Damn :P
wonder how much they weighed
There was steel on both layers.
probably 3+ pounds
Hiiyo guys!
Often in movies, the "helmets" you see are actually just the liners
How we doin'?
hi SolairePony89!

Oh, the shrapnel

Suprise attack! GO!
Um, he can't fight that many
it was a piece of fents
DocSane: Not only that, but if he did succed in killing them there'd be a whole army to decend on him
Now THEY DIE
dat piss.
Damn Krauts.
dafuq don't do it man.

MURICA!!!!
Stab, stab, stab.
Dat TF2.
^_^
FACESTAB
They'll be wondering in a few minutes
SolairePony89: they're just chillin
you gotta feel bad though, only a young kid he killed
You're dead. That's good. Amen.
Facestab!
nooob!
MahBoi777: Chillin' while their friend gets stabbed
Stabbing must be one of the worst ways to die.
kid no older than 17 he just killed
MahBoi777: Lazy bastards :P
ikr?
Because you'll be all "Hey! Stop it! Stop stabbing me!"
CoD.
^^
thats what CoD multiplayer is like, DocSane.
Xaiden: He might not of even been German. There were plenty of soldiers fighting forr Nazi Germany that weren't German
Call of Duty was practically the video game adaptation of Private Ryan and this show.
Plenty of Czechs, for example
war... is hell
SolairePony89: Still doesn't clear the fact that kid was most likely still a teenager
there should be no war.
DocSane: Except CoD never made me cry. Or ever will.
Xaiden, that's war for you
Well, there can be no war as soon as we eliminate violence from man.
Xaiden: I'm pretty sure he was a teenager and probably not German as well. Double suck :(
GabeMoist: Why we should always avoid it
is it almost ending?
And that ain't happneing any time soon.
SolairePony89: Exactl
00,10Suddnly reminded of gundam 00
teenagers scare this living shit out of me
Xaiden, It is well that war is so terrible -- lest we should grow too fond of it. - Robert E. Lee
aww...
00,10the kid that he tryed to take careof.
Again, you'd think that Nazi's comrades would at least give a bit of a shit
Damn...
and he dies
he still alive o_o
he caught?
Don't think so
No
the Germans in this area are mostly REMFs.
damn
i.e. Kids and old men
and some SS
Well, BJ Blastkowitz has to have SOMEBODY to fight.
DocSane: Gotta be a pretty small amount of REMFs if we got our asses kicked that hard during Market Garden
That guy looks like Samwise Gamgee.
Is that Sean Bean?
Meanwhile: holy crap ._.
well guys g2g to sleep see you tomorrow and remember ponies, smile
and porn
bye!
night cachi01
Cya cachi01
Nighty night cachi01 :)
smile porn?

'Ello SuperGotenks1989
What was the movie?
game review?
Wait, thats the end? really?
random videos?
It was an episode of Band of Brothers
:P
SuperGotenks1989: It was a TV show, and I have no idea if we're gonna watch more episodes
FlareChaser: There are more episodes.
00,10mfw I check stream, see my desktop pony on it and try to move her.
what movie did i miss?
sumica, what's next?
Oh, good.
kidzrul434: No movie! TV show!
Lol Sumica.
Did you stream Ponies: the Anthology 2 yet?
00,10ep 5 of BoB
kidzrul434: An episode of Band of Brothers
Sumica: Oh, you!
SuperGotenks1989: Yes, yesterday
It was awesome wasn't it?
it was EPIC
IKR?
I have yet to see it, and I was at a con which premiered it before Bronycon, dammit!
/me snores.
It wasn't identified as Anthology II in the schedule, just Anthology.
00,10it was good but could have been better
Band OF Bronies
EVERYONE DIED.
THE END
For some reason, I really hate people right now, but you guys are cheering me up.
._.
Sumica: More BoB?
FlareChaser: The feeling will pass.
Yes, I think more BoB
00,10what happend FlareChaser?
OH NOOO
what's after it?
oh well
00,10yeah showing two eps tonight
00,10then 2 eps tomorrow and 3 on wendsday
Sumica: Meh, some stuff happened in another chat room..
For July 4th, you need to stream 1776.
Oh, I will be hating people for the next few days. But, they're out of strangle distance for now.
00,10oh
I like the winter episode
one with the medic as the main character
FlareChaser: Chat room rage vanishes like tears in rain.
lol
Will you stream the July 4th showing this late too? You know people won't be around early since some of us may be out for fireworks
DocSane: No no, this was Dashiesauce...most annoying room of all time it will make you want to scream at a wall.
noyhing
FlareChaser: What's a Dashiesauce?
Well, it's like 3 am here in England so I gotta go to bed. See ya later!
Night
DocSane: some channel on ponychat, can't talk about it here.
Night SuperGotenks1989
cya super.
i just love these interviews
The best thing about this show was seeing the actual soldiers who are portrayed in this show.
Yay for mips.tv
And by that, I mean fuck mips.tv
00,10yeah it will be some what late JESmith
yay~
He was good son. Maybe even the best.
No, just that one chatroom makes you feel like you're the only logical one there.
._.
Totally not a cocky statement
OH THIS EPISODE I LOVE THIS ONE
being the only logical one is overrated, in my experience.
Xaiden: Because during main showings the main chat room is usually too fast to read.
00,10daaaaaaaaum
Dick
Massive dickhead
SolairePony89: Oh, but its true... ._. now lets stop talking about this.
Xaiden, because on new eps, the main chat is closed and the other 6 are opened, so it is easier to keep track of
this show is awesome :D
Me
Xaiden, no
we're all on all 7
Xaiden: No, I'm in Twilight. It's all the same channel.
Xaiden: No.
doesnt matter we all see the same stream
HAHAHA!
Im on spike
jarate!
Rain: thought spike had no chat box?
I'm just on the main room.
adasdad: LOL
it doesnt, Xaiden
Xaiden: some of us use our own IRC clients
^
I'm in the main chat.
ohhh cool
Xaiden: I'm on Rainbow Dash,but it's only the same room as every

SolairePony89: Are you only realising this now?
acs26: thats never gonna happen, even when I try.
Flarechaser: >:o

MahBoi777: I'm good ^^

Homerun he's outta the park.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, its ok. lots of people like to call me that because I seem to be kissing up to the mods, when in reality Im actually friends with them >_>
sup guys
D'aww Rain. I don't think you're a kissass.
Hey FeArLeSs_0117
Meanwhile: Im suprised you know what baseball is :P
wats on?
so wuts this movie?
00,10Keep in mind Rain has been around before most the mods were even mods.
Band of Brothers
Irish_Pony: I have no idea how it works, just that you say homerun outta the park when something good happens.
yup ^_^
I know that, atleast, Sumi.
Meanwhile: meh, more or less :P
Rain is a Bronystate Vet :P
I LOVE this movie
/me was around before Rain was. >_>
OPEN FIRE.
Rain is foooreeeeverrrr!
does Rain have any Bronystate purple hearts... or green clovers?
He has a Silver Star
I am the grumpy old man of this website.
no, I just have Bronystate Gold
My brother says bronies are gay,
then i show him this
he shut up
im at a hotel, so internet is complete shit
XD
Xaiden: Your brother's wrong. We have proof.
nice Xaiden /) :D
your brother is in the closet and likes to call others gay because he doesnt like what he is
yes we are a happy bunch
Meanwhile, I'm the really old shriveled guy of the site
That mortar's doing A LOT
Xaiden: Surveys reveal that 85% of Bronies are stright.
it's Raining here ^^
I'm happy :D
GabeMoist: Only by like, two weeks. ^^
/me hands MakerDusk a juicebox
everypony : /)
(\
isnt kencolt the oldest?
RainBowJack: (
why not? (\
Xaiden: I suspect most Bronies develop a crush on one or more of the characters.
00,10Rain was one of the few to watch me stream gta4 at like 1am
Bronystate: (\
(\
Ghosties is best longest member here
SolairePony89: /)
MahBoi777: (\ :D
00,10back before bronystate became popular
Im trying to convince him to watch the show and im close to breaking him >:D
XD
Sumica: aww i wish i coulda seen that
furry crossing?
00,101am streams had like 3 people
Xaiden: Don't force him.
Meanwhile, That's a pretty significant difference http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/71135_359018670840_5910189_n.jpg
adasdad: STOP READING MY MIND!
yeah back when at this time of night, there were litterally 5 active chatters
left FLANK
Sumica: DAMN! How long ago was this?
GabeMoist: lmao.
im showing him funny scenes from the show
two weeks ago
:D
Rain: wow
not torturing him with it
00,10back before I even had +
^
00,10i was just a viewer alowed to use color
before you had color even
Xaiden: I've noticed there can be stages to getting into the show.
oh boy, not the yaa again
What made you so special, Sumi? :T
I still remember my reaction when Sumica was allowed to use color XD
so who was the first mod?
00,10I had the Hub
^
Ninjazz, he could stream the new eps and nobody else could
Xaiden: Often in the order of 1. Ridicule 2. Confusion 3. I saw one and it's way too girly...
did anyone see PARTY.MOV?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yeah, it was kinda dull.
Xaiden: 4. This isn't bad.
Ah. I remember now.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yup
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I'm sure most of us had, and I'm pretty sure discussing it is against DA WOOLZ
Xaiden: 5. Why is Twilight Sparkle some damned adorable?
Ponies. Ponies everywhere
because that is just her :3
If I had a better memory I might be able to get nostalgic about it.
ah i see my bad but MAN was Spike funny as hell in it :D
Sadly all I can do is be a miserable fuck and hope nobody gets too offended.
DocSane: Ehhhh Im a Fluttershy kind of brony, since i actually reflect her in a way irl
DocSane: Since im shy as HELL
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Spike is the best part of the .mov series. Sad that his own episode was an April Fools Day joke
Xaiden: But you get what I'm saying.
DocSane: Yeah kinda
CHARGE!!!!!!!!
Xaiden: Basically, I just described how I and a friend of mine got into it.
BANZAAAAAAAAAIII!
:O
One man army.
Dumbfuck
Shoot Nazi's. Like a boss.
And this is where Han Solo runs into the room full of Storm Troopers
these germans suck at aim
got to love that M1
LEEROOOOOOOOY
Poor Germans
like shooting ducks in a barrle
00,10I even failed my interview to be a mod.
Those Germans were just caught flat footed
^
Poor Germans hehe
At least you got one Sumica.
Sumica: then how did you....
I would make a terrible mod
Its not a war its a massacre
why don't they have guns
he had to wait until they were hiring again, Irish_Pony
00,10I was talking with Rain, and a few other long time viewers about PC specs.
Eagle3302: Like I said before, poor Germans
being a mod would be irritating as hell.
most of us would make terrible mods :D
If I became a mod, bronystate would be burned down within a week
riots everywhere
00,10and DCD and Dari asked me if i had a capture card.
MahBoi777: Some kind of glitch won't let me see that.
If I was a mod I would do nothing at all, just ignore all my duties...
I wonder what would happen if I was a mod :P
im playing a song and the explosions are going with the beat
Ninjazz: oh okay
boom, boom...
see what they did there, they said they were polish when the were really in the SS, a GERMAN ONLY SECTOR,
I dont care about being a mod. I'd just like to stream one day
If I was a mod then I'd be the same as I am, just more useful.
I would not want to mod e_e I would be a poor mod
Being a mod... isn't fun.
all dat power
SolairePony89, unless you are an employie here, you are not going to be streaming here
I just wanna be a viewer :1
Meanwhile: No, a stash of cinderblocks doesn't count.
Oh no! You lost one guy after you killed dozens of Germans!
i wish i could be a mod
AttackPony: does too.
Ohwait, SS
Nevermind
Meanwhile: As soon as someone used caps lock, cinderblock
Rain: I figured :(
Ninjazz: want me to resend it?
00,10I hear tell that bronystate gold members will get to stream.
I love how the M1 ejects its magazine when it empties
I couldn't be a mod. Computer doesn't have the RAM, school and I'd have a fit if someone mouthed off to me
Sumica, sweet
MahBoi777: I think i might need to restart my chat.
Really, Sumica? :O
I'm a diamond member
DocSane: I love everything about the M1
Bronystate Gold is worst meme. Even if I'm on Bronystate Diamond by this point.
diamond is the hardest metal known to man
Ninjazz: okey dokey
How do you even know what you have?
Wrek said something about Deluxe membership. When the hell do I get that?!
inb4 Bronystate Platinum
GabeMoist: diamond is not a metal
Irish_Pony: It's a joke :P
I don't get the whole Gold and Platinum thing. Wut?
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, it is
now all I need is a better comp for streaming and for bronystate gold to actually allow for streaming :3
SolairePony89: then I have Diamond Gold :P
Rain: Ikr.
AttackPony: Like I said before, it's a joke :P
I have Lead still :/
/me has Bronystate Uranium
SolairePony89: Ohh
You know how are we even ranked as members here anyways? 6_9
Ponies47, that info is for gold members only
Why do you want to stream so much?... Oh... you want them to scream for ponies so you would have an excuse to show "ponies", right?
SolairePony89: say whaaaaaaaaat? :D
/me has BronyState Dirt
Ponies47: We're all equally ranked as zero.
Ponies47: mods and ponies?
I'd stream Madoka
who remembers when our comments would be blocked by 1,0SOPA?

Winter Wraps Up a Smile
yeah, just beat Castlevania: SotN in just over 11 hours...game seems shorter than I remember it originally.
it's because you're grown up and it's easier to think now
OohShiny: might be it, last time I played it I was like 14 or so.
Ponies47: my brain is now derp
dear God....that was 14 years ago then
man, my childhood games were so hard when I was a child
/me Thinks Rugrats was awesome and then Al lGrown Up ruined it -_-
but right now they are so buckin easy
Biglaw: Why? :p
OohShiny and then you discovered cheat codes
nah
Ponies47: RUBBAHFUIT
there were no cheat codes for sonic
OohShiny: yeah, I feel ya, had a more recent example with Shadow Hearts series. When I first tried it, couldn't get the hang of it at all. Got it again a few years later and I was playing through relatively easy
Biglaw: That song is really silly but funny at the same time! :p
but Megaman is STILL hard as bullocks
totally
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZBysLAVUc
Mega Man, hard? lol
ah, Nintendo Hard games
man, just compare Megaman 8 with Megaman 5
OtakuTom: the hell you say!
megahard I say
megaman 5 was just buckin hard
OohShiny: yeah, 8 had frustrating bits(DAMN YOU JETSKI!) but it was easier than 5
anyone know who writes the music for fim?
I wish I had access to stream right now...I'd show you how "hard" those games are...
Darl Souls = Satanic on 1st playthough, cakewalk on other playthroughs
OtakuTom: let me guess, you can beat Airman on one life without getting hit?
no
I always get hit
at least once
Maybe not without getting hit, but I can beat him no problem.
there is a song on that you know
shall I pull it up?
Airman gataosenai?
AIRMAN GA TAOSENAI
Friendship is fabulous :D

The only stage from any Mega Man game that I have trouble with is Quick Man and the one spiked corridor in Wily's Castle of Mega Man 1 (due to the random nature of the moving platforms. They can make it impossible to get through if they move in certain ways)

Biglaw: IKR! Finally someone gets it!
Phase4: can we join yet?
13phase has server live?
00,02not sure this computer is powerfull enough
00,02Shizuka, yup
boom dead
00,02well not online yet
Owned
00,02gota foward ports
Oh come on...I understood the joke when it was first used on The Simpsons :P
00,02its allso consuming 80% of the cpu
it's gonna explode!
00,02model name : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+
WTF BOOM! UHAHAHAHAHA
I'm going to eat some bread. See ya soon
Ol' Betty can't take it
wait
the bread went bad ;~;
go go PONY RANGERS!

he's gonna die he's gonna die he's gonna die
00,02not sure if broken or REALY broken
Well there's your problem
SolairePony89 I'd eat some chinese, but based on the results of the past 5 hours, I don't think so
Meh changed my mind LP
:P
Biglaw: Aww. Chinese is awesome
1327000-27050 forwarded?
13something like that, forget the range
SolairePony89 It is :I
I prefer console gaming
KILL ALL THE THINGS!
Juan
so OP, infinite rockets
Lightning-Quill: I'd switch to PC gaming if I could. But alas, I has no moneys
FAIL!
Failure.
/me goes to scout out for food
00,02whats the client limit cvar?
00,02Shizuka, only need 3 actually
13hm..
00,0205 15 and 07 i think
13heard it's best to forward the full range
20 seconds
13i'll look it up
5

2
ehhh pc gaming doesn't appeal to me plus all the games I want are pretty much xbox exclusive
ah yes the "Joys" of PC gaming
13oooo there's an autoblacklist and an autofavorite prompt cvar
13like if you quit a server shortly after joining you can have it prompt to blacklist that server for you
Glorious PC gaming masterrace!
13or fave if you were on for a long time
13yeah but the thing is when you invest that time you get the game to run exactly the way you want
00,02dis is working well enough
I have returned, with sour keysp
so many senturies
:p
13uh oh update
00,02udp 0 0 *:27005 *:*
00,02udp 0 0 *:27015 *:*
00,02udp 0 0 *:27020
00,02dems the ports
Shizuka: but sometimes you have to invest time JUST TO GET IT TO RUN AT ALL even if you meet requirements if you're missing a goddamn udate or some .dll you can't find and wasn't included in the download.
/me noms on his excuse for food
3Phase are udp? you the pea UTP Uduhpee
3Phase Udupee
13yeah i think the guides i read say to just forward 27000-27050
3I know your name
13since all source games use that range
I'll take ease of console use over constantly having to update and tweak just to get it to START any day of the week.
13you don't have to constantly tweak...
13you tweak once
13run forever
3sorry, but really what is that for?
Shizuka: and then they update it and you have to tweak it again bc your past tweaks either no longer work or make it so the game no longer works like it should.
13um.. no..
otakon: PC exclusives and mods make PC gaming really hard to resist, despite the complications
13apart from custom mods you put on, like the hud i use for tf2... updates almost NEVER require you to redo tweaks
Shizuka: when I say "tweaks" I mean any player alterations that the designers did not do themselves. this includes mods.
Phase4 do you live an an apartment, by any chance?
13ja... and the point is you do those because you want them...
hey, Shizuka. whats the temp in your house?
most tf2 cosmetic mods dont get touched by updates anyway since they are client side and dont effect gameplay
13consoles you don't even get the choice
I've been playing my PC much more frequently than my consoles recently.
13yeah the hud i use only gets broken when they add a weapon with its own charge bar or something, and the hud is updated the same day
1377F rain :<
Shizuka: but I'm saying is you don't have to worry if so and so program is up to date or if this and that is supported. You buy a 360 game, it works on a 360 PERIOD.
13but i will give it a try cause i want to find the cvar for phase
Well, I think I'm going to attempt to eat Chinese food cold
dang thats hot
k ^_^
13otakon: except when it doesn't
Yeah mods don't appeal to me I tried them and I wasn't happy with the results
Biglaw: Why not heat it up?
13which is horribly pathetic to hear of games that have performance issues on a console
I havent played my 360s in over a year
SolairePony89: it's the middle of the night, and I don't want to wake anyone up
13console is a locked down known platform... if your game can't perform perfectly on it then it's just a crap game
Shizuka: What cvar? :o
or crap console
Biglaw: I doubt your microwave or oven will make THAT much noise
Shizuka: that's called broken, and is usually the result disc damage more often than not.
13or both!
lolz
or a BAD GAME DESIGNER
SolairePony89: alright, spring roll time! :D
Biglaw: spicy mustard ftw!
yay
so many windows
Yea, I've never understood why certain games have problems when they're designed specifically for a console, especially the ones that are console-exclusive.
/me is back (gone 01:20:27)
those windows
OtakuTom: well, name an example if you'd be so kind. Just to get a feel for what you mean?
wb APS
otakon: Sometimes bugs are just to many or to hard to fix at times
usually do to development deadlines
APS: I'm pretty sure someone asked you to turn that off...
due
DeadpoolDash: And money. Can't forget about that
yep
SolairePony89: yeah, but that can happen in any game regardless of exclusivity
XAX, i have no idea how to turn it off for mane chat
13thing is consoles also have a lengthy process of certification, which i find is seriously dragging down the quality of games that have to be developed for console alongside PC
13for instance
13portal 2 asking you not to turn off your computer
Sumica hair is Haaaaaaaaaard ....
13or really ANY game asking you not to turn off your computer... that's a required prompt on console games because you CAN
otakon: Exaclty my point. It happens everywhere, even on console exclusives. Sometimes you just can't fix ALL the bugs
I haz a spring roll :3
Guize. MW3 campaign on PC, the FPS cap they put on the game is 45. I remember listening to an interview with the devs of MW3, and they were bragging on about how it was going to run at a constant 60 FPS on console. Wut.
Well, I'm just tired of the swarmy PC "Masterrace" acting like their games are so goddamn superiour and us console gamers have zero right to playing games.
XAXpod: wat?
well, anyway I gotta go for the evenng
otakon: Vocal minority. Or at least I hope they're a vocal minority
FPS caps can be changed on PC usually in a settings ini
take care all, lovely discussion Shizuka :)
see you otakon!
take care all
going to bed guys, night
DeadpoolDash: I'll give that a look
See ya otakon
Bye otakon :3
bye otakon!
13we get signal~
13i think
Main screen turn on
Bye otakon :)
13oh nope still have to let him reboot~
No
Its YOU
Hello Captain
All your base are belong to us
Of course I get called away before I can give otakon an example...and now he's gone...lol
I was gonna use Onechanbarra: Bikini Samurai Squad as the example...lol
OtakuTom: Ha, I remember that game
13okay NOW
13we get signal~
woo signals
The gameplay is decent, but the fact that they couldn't even get the video to sync vertically just...really made it bad...lol
I'm downloading steam :3
OtakuTom: I heard there was A LOT bad about that game :P
HMMMMPH!
Wuts the ip o3o
I'm just talking about the technical aspects...not even the story or anything like that.
The first console Matrix game was horribly broken
Ah
Enter The Matrix? I have that game on PS2
It was meh
You know, for vegetables and some dough, spring rolls aren't half bad
There are several pints in there that completely break the game
parts
Biglaw: It's Chinese food, what'd you expect?
Ok now I'm going to play TF2
I'm an idort so I ain't giving an apple
Have fun Ponies47
BONK!
But yea...Onechanbarra...I felt like I had to buy the game just to see how bad it was.
Ponies47: Team Pyroland 2*
And it's pretty bad
It's one of those ones that's great to pull out and show friends after having a few too many drinks.
OtakuTom: I dont think anyone had high hopes for that game
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT

oni_link: He was.
brb
Okay
hi APS
Gamer Luna is best Luna.
Om, hai
indeed
I don't have patience to play as an Engineer. I usually go with Scout or Soldier.
I prefer Pyro. There's nothing more satisfying than the sound of an Axtinguisher crit.
back :P
oni_link: i go pyro, lots of fun lol
And if you have hit dings on, it's even better.
13hai bronystate~
ohai Shizuka
hi Shizuka
Shizuka: Guten Morgen!
hi Shizuka
Pardon any spelling mistakes, I cannot into German.
Hay siwuka
Om: I guess you're right, as always
Kammerjunk|Bday: Pyro is fun, I'll give you guys that. But to me , that bat crit sounds heavenly :)
KiwiBoi777: When am I ever right xD
Hi Shizuka :P
Hiii Shizuka
that sentry is goin nuts lol
KiwiBoi777: Not definite. Can differ from person to person.
HatchetRyda: I know right? :P
KiwiBoi777: Oooh fair enough.
Nooo! Sentry down
thank you Kammerjunk|Bday
Sentry-go-go-down-n-up!
oni_link: i feel like joining them in a bit but i also feel like sleeping lol
Sleep is for the weak.
HatchetRyda: You should play a game at least :)
On a related note, I am very tired right now.
sleep is for the strong
Kammerjunk|Bday: :D
it can help maintain a strong and heathy body
so haha
ok, maybe one game lol...but i have to cut off the browser so i can run tf2 better to tata for now everypony
*so
Actually, when you reach a certain point, your body undergoes a hormone shift. This makes your body less tired when you normally would be tired. However, you still need the same hours of sleep.
Okay, have fun HatchetRyda
still sleep isn't for the weak
so ha
Sleep is for the weak and old.
SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK O_O
And people who are tired.
/me Yawns 'Yep the weak' Yawns agian
Dat Hi five
/me smells lying
/me yawns to make Ponies47 more sleepy
Yawning is a curious thing.
Its contagious
it's contagious isn't it?
/me Yawns 'Curse you xmasskills' yawns agian
It is. One theory as to why we yawn is that it's a herd instinct, and yawning tells other flock members that you're tired.
hey kids! I'm back! :D
Resaluta, FlareChaser!
Hey FlareChaser :)
...wat
Kammerjunk|Bday: And we haven't evolved away from it yet :P

MMM... dat serious Derpy
halo evry pony
scottish-geeky: hello :)

scottish-geeky: I love vrazy Twilight <3
Ah.
/me glomps Sumica
*crazy
00,10ooooof
Lol
Ponies47: i know now run to beed u silly filly
13Phase4: polys were flashing white on the terrain
13are
00,02oh wow
I'm a filly too
00,10dat TheGreatAndPowerfulT arts
00,02it lags epic bad when i look at the island
00,02i can fix this
13oh dear..
Sumica..is neat is it not?
I take it Myst isn't the newest of games?
Glomp ALL the mods!
00,10indeed
13Kammerjunk|Bday: Myst was originally released in 1993
Ah.
13until The Sims came along, it was the best selling PC game ever
Oh, that's pretty neat.
13realMyst was done in 2000 i believe, on the first generation of the Plasma engine later used to do Uru and Myst 5
00,10nice job on the mane, I often hear complaints about it.
/me glomps Shizuka
i did yell that is was hard like 1 hour ago lol
Shizuka...is now silverscreen....have fun with the random facts every 20 seconds
13only when i know things :3
13i keep saying myst defined mein childhood... i know just about everything there was to know about the series
ham you make that sound like a bad thing
which according to what you said in tf2 Shizuka "is all the things"
Shamroc*
13well and ja i have memorized myst 1-3
Books defined my childhood.
...
I have such an exciting life,.
13which ist why i have had writers block on riven for a year
Myst was also one of the first games to be released on CD-ROM. In fact, it helped boost CD-ROM drive sales
I've been playing TF2 too much, I was playing L4D2 earlier and I thought it was TF2.
omg myst
13graphics flickering is gone, stream is nice and smooth~
I don't wanna play this
I speedrun Myst about once a year. My best time so far is around 4 minutes.
I've been playing too much Black & White 2. Not Pokémon, the game where you're a Greek God.
One sec, people are fighting across the street, I wanna see this :P
13yeah but myst is easy to speedrun... just memorize pattern 158, flip the switches, solve the clocktower, get white page
Shizuka: you have gmod server
13or speedrun the losing ending and do it even faster
Byee everypony. I wuv you!
So this is a very free ending?
how are you DeathOrange
Yea, I know, but it's still fun...lol
Why am I still afk...
cya fillyfillyy|afk~
a very free game*
now bye
Ok yeah. I better go now. GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)

goodbye Ponies47 !
nithe Ponies47 my your dreems be awesome

Sweet dreams, Ponies47!
Dreams? :'(
DREAM
sweet, a new DCS game is coming out: P-51D
/me Is sad now
Dreams about ponies my good sir~
Ponies47: why
Have fun with them.
Oh it is sad day for I never dream anymore :(
13why is the library so lag..
You do dream.
you just don't remember it.
Ponies47: i never dreem in the firtst place
Only some dreams you can remember.
Shizuka: Because books!
Myst was one of the first Adventure games I ever played. I'm now a bit jaded when it comes to the genre, 'cause I end up comparing every adventure game I play to it, and I still think this series did it best.
I haven't had a dream in a long time :(
13yeah but there's no physics engine at work here
13the bookshelf is static
Ponies47: i like not havng dreems just the black it is comfroting to me
Myst is too scary for me.:'(
/me glomps everyone.
hello FlareChaser
13>myst
13>scary
/me hugs FlareChaser back
I wish I had one petabyte. That's enough for 20 million four-drawer filing cabinets full of text.
Hello scottish-geeky~
scottish-geeky: Me not having dreams makes me hate sleep more :(
13dat 10 minute light cycle
I remember being real scared the first time I played Myst, not knowing if there was going to be anything jumping out at me or anything like that...lol
Ponies47: ohh
/me hugs Ponies47
/me hugs back
>Born in 1995
1996*
Ok I better go to bed.
Nighty night :)
Never having played so many great games is bad.
Night, Ponies47.
I still prefer the old point-and-click version. I think having movement like this in RealMyst kinda breaks it, and makes it more likely to miss something important.
13yeah you might miss details
13but i greatly prefer the free movement
chat derped
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
13brings more life to the world... myst was pretty CG plastic-y that robyn talked about avoiding in riven
Have you read any of the Myst books, Shizu?
13yup
13did marrim ever come out? i forget
I'm trying to remember if it did. I was following it for a bit, but stopped before any sort of announcement...
13dat shizu spoiling things for phase in steam chat :3
KiwiBoi777: frute
/me waves

/me brings out a juicer
13i even memorized the notes for the spaceship entry...
Shizuka: I sense that you really like Myst.
13well not the note notes but i could sing it...
Fine I'm going to bed
Just do what I do.
O_O
It doesn't look like Mirrim ever came out :(
Goodnight Ponies47~

It looks like the only books that were ever published were the 3 from The Myst Reader (Book of Atrus, Ti'ana, and D'ni)
Oh well, today is my lucky day~

13yup
13i had all three in paperback but tiana disappeared on me :/

FlareChaser: This day is going to be perfect?
Kammerjunk|Bday: No, we're not singing.

Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, I forgot the rest of the song, so please don't sing along~

I don't know the song either. But thanks.

Meh, shippings.

Well, yeah, I like the sound of rain, but I hate being IN it.
Shizuka: rain is awesome
04I like watching rainfall...I don't like storms, though
Ghosties: i love it when it storms
Whenever theres a storm, one song comes into head.
04The best thing ever is rainfall in Autumn in the evening
I hate thunder, it's too loud.
Song of Storms~ awwwh yeaaah.

Ghosties: agreed
Ghosties: oh god yes <3
FlareChaser: lolz

04And I LOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEE snowfall, probably because we rarely ever get it here
also Ghosties i never got that ghost you were sposed to send me...
04And I love winter
Ghosties: winter dos not like me
Weather sucks, really. It's either too hot, too cold, too wet or too loud.
04I sent it to you, Shamroc
Winter isn't cold where I live at all, everyone else thinks it is, but hell it isn't for me.
DeathOrange: why so quiet
