the ears might actually be too low for a horse- yeah- usually horses have them pretty far up
so Stellvia is the name of the space station?
Dunno how to explain it, but I'm just not too terribly interested.
Right , my perspective is crap , i need to train on that :D
make a vanishing point, and raw him as a very basic shape, just to train on it
DJ out of f:(king nowhere?
What about the head , should i go to more simlyfied version?

well- hm- the ears are a bit loow, as Sumica said- but otherwise, it is manly- pronounced
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates - December 6th
Right gonna fix the ears
tonn of tnt
I'd keep it at that level, jsut for emphasiz
Thanking a bot post.
his hooves-
Lel.
RD looks like a pair of technicolor pliers.
they look a bit rocky
Ah
how can i fix :P?
but that really depends on how you see their hooves, as mlp-ponies vs horses/ponies
Thats i dont know
Ah, simple PMVs.
If i should go Mlp way
or semi realism
00,10well it's just the fettlock thing
i came to dig dig dig

Hi guys
Wait
anyone here?
Hi, Lindeman
hi Lindeman
hey Lindeman
TWIST
Oi Max
00,10hello Lindeman
Whats up?
Heya Lindeman
Yeah Jmo ?
Did I tell you to name your oc 'Avion'?
Hi Lindeman
Yeah
Thought so.
heh
xD
and remember, the front of the hooves basically should be a bit smooth transition from the leg
A lot of people hate Twist for some reason. I think they missed the point of her character.
What are you talking about?
Bet you can't guess my OC's name
and the shading should be smooth too, it's a nail
The derpy was doubled ^_^
It's Snow.
wrong
00,10I like twist, just hate her voice
its Ember xD
Horrible oc then D:
-_- More Stellvia? I'm out.
Jmo: :C
Snow, Ember
I see what you did there.
ehehehe.
:P
00,10yeah cc.....nm rage quit
Smart.
Wasn't talking about yours either Max.
That cc guy complains too much about stream.
What is this show?
00,10I am noticeing that Jmo
I like stream ^_^
Some people just want to see the stream burn...
I'm abit curious abou the foreleg max- but it can be hard because of style differences?
Needs to lighten up and just enjoy what's on.
I love this opening song :).
00,10What's the saying, You get what you payfor.
^
As thou are taking time from their day to stream whatever is on.
Vivix: Yeah i reused my OC front legs
Sumica: but we arn't paying anything
mm-
So it didnt quite fit
ahh
00,10Exactly Snow
Im going to remkae the body now
What would be a good pose?
cause- this really depends a bit on style and preference- but horse forelegs are a bit complicated sometimes-
Yeah agreed
00,10She over thinks
but if i would pay i would ask: show me some stuff, i don't care what
Giving all this advice yet I see barely any art from you Vivix.
Well, I like the pose, just a bit more natural perspective, shows a lot of strength
08,01my OC?
08,01where?
In making xD
No-where.
Jmo I spend all my art in paintchat ;__;

Well, it's a bag, that's obvious, but what is in it and what is that symbol.
08,01MaxTheBrony: you're such a talented artist; i love it so far and am excited to see what you'll come up with

MaxTheBrony: was that as commission or just for funsies?
A plant in a bag with whole dug and a spade laying around
dunno
and yeah Max, you're good, but improving is always good, so nice to see you asking for critiques
with a hole dug*
Kitty, kitty, kitty!
Snow: a comission for free :)

Vivix: I love getting Critiques ! :) Thanks to you and Jmo and lots of others

Kuwagamon looks like Kabuterimon a little, just evil and red. And ugly.

Bye Snow. Take care
bye Snow
Bronysith: maybe because she has work to do......or it's too exhasusting for her.....or it's not her thing.
Shizuka: I try them, but only the ones where you can do things without knowing perfectly the characters' moveset
i dunno
aaand nobody saw what i did there
bye ^^
Shizuka: ergo, Mortal Kombat is a terrible game
Bye Snow :)
Snow i did!°
Snow: The Digimon state? I saw it

Starlight_Phoenix: Sumica is
00,10Is that any thing like the Avatar state?
Sumica: :D
Shizuka: i understand, even though i grew up with MK, SF and the MvC series
Avatar state?
Sumica: you should stream Avatar more often
not avatar please
13i grew up with.. myst... and doom sans monsters
00,10but I have streamed it all the way through twice now
yes, avatar please!
Oh F*** YEAH, DOOM
Sumica: then stream more Dan VS :D
Don't answer that mail, Izzy
myst was great
00,10I need to see if I can get S2 of DanVs
It smells like a scam.
Hey everyone.

AssaultWithEmbraces: ofc he will answer it
hi Nittany_Discord ^_^
13hai nittany
At least it's not a Nigerian prince.

Nittany_Discord! *dusts and cleans*
Hello Nittany_Discord :)
/me licks and glomps Nittany_Discord
Heya Nittany_Discord :)
MadSurge: And Izzy learned noting from the movie, computer gets BSoD from a viurs, digital worrld destroyed. The end.
Lost my colors but not my hat.
Hi Nittany_Discord!
00,10sure was lucky all the crest were hidden in the same desert
AssaultWithEmbraces: well they still didn't get nuked right?
oh, THIS ONE
why all the crests hidden in the same desert
MadSurge: Nope. They killed Diaboromon at the very last second.
I WON'T SPOIL
Sumica, yeah it kinda appears rushed how fast they get their crests
dem glyphs
but it's great
Of course it's a trap
alexxm It's a small digiworld after all-.---
AssaultWithEmbraces: I still prefer the Digimonless movie on that :D
ugh, the animation for this is so....strange
"It's not like we're in a computer"
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THEIR NOSES?!
DIGITAL world.
and why are their hands so large?
lol
Wow, I forgot how derped everyone looked in the first season
Oh god, Izzy's eyes.
Bronysith: I stole them!
They're spaced out like a bug
Bronysith: and next, THEIR FACES
00,10hacking montage
/me 08,01dogs
No they're not, they're just files!
Bronysith: and their eyes
Bronysith, and their hands
the animation is not my cup of tea
god, what were the animators on?
And that's the same place our noses must be!
So this is the off model episode? :D
The Digimon look fine, but the human characters.... ._.
00,10if they are on the internet then where is all the porn?
Sumica: Ikr
Sumica: 4chan
and where are the ponies?
Silly Sumica, this is a kids show << >>
ekips: they still didn't exist then
Sumica, not in the desert ^^
MadSurge: no....this is actually a relevant episode.....but the animation is wrong
Most disappointing internet world ever.
00,10wait if every thing is made of data.......
there must be an island of porn files somewhrere there
00,10then they are the porn
dun dun dun
13http://i.imgur.com/zI5B5.jpg
Dark92Enigma: yeah, therefore the offmodel episode (with story) :D
Izzy's compute is loud.
Shizuka: nomnomnom
Shizuka: nuuu they killed Santa ;A;
Not Saaaanta!
It's a trap!
oh Nanomon :d
:O Nanomon!
Shipping!
it's because her nose is back
Now kiss!
Let the shipping begin! Oh wait, it already has.
hey you jew shoud kiss
they have no eye color
or well

dot*
so, theoretically they could clone themself?
dat sphinx
SPHINX
nose problem
It's Etemon!
00,10Tai you troll
Now flip him off!
KILL HIM NOW
00,10Tai is full of stupid
Concert Crush (Love Serenade): Breaks the opponent's heart and makes their fighting spirit vanish. Dark Network (Dark Spirits): Attacks with a dark sphere that consumes everything it touches.
Sumica: in this episode, Tai is at his stupidest
tee
TROLOLOLOLO
Taitroll
YOU'RE ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE RETIREMENT
Just data.......if i would play a drinking game everytime he said that, i would DIE
that'S a nice dea for a drinking game, btw
00,10IR dont work il that
HOW CAN THESE PEOPLE LOSE TO A SINGING MONKEY
etemon doesnt seem very observant
STUPID
I wouldn't be so quick to trust him
STUPID 8 YEAR OLDS
AssaultWithEmbraces: evil vs evil?
Song

/me Deep down the corners of the Digiworld/ way back up in the woods in the evergreens
'dat Johnny B Goode
MadSurge: But still. Sounds like a scam
use your serenade atack
so much better than the english version
^
indeed it is
Sailor moon transformation sequence, go!
thank you i'll be here all da----wait nopony got my reference
IMO they're about the same
you obviously have no idea what a sailormoon transformation sequzence is
Bipolarized, but they don't become nude. they rather get armor than loosing cloths
still, the animation isnt that great, probably just nostalgia glasses
Bipolarized: come on, their transformation sequence is shorter.
Bronysith: yeah, maybe
back
nostalgia glasses hit the fans of this, i can see the appeal of this show, but the animation just aint for me
AssaultWithEmbraces: I found them on youtube, but lost them
Dark92Enigma: Aaaaaaaaaugh
yeah yeah, block the only digimon's way who has already defeated him once
JUST DATA........Stop saying that Tai! :[
both Japanese and English have equal amount of annoying voices and good voices....also the Japanese soundtrack doesn't fit the situation at times
OF COURSE
He's quite suprised to hear that
Tai
you're a pansy
well yeah, that'S him right there, not some projection. he's data. if he gets deleated, he's not only dead but nonexistant
lolcactus
00,10You had one job Tai
*cactus with boxing gloves
DAT 8 year old just cusses
Is Tai really worrying over Sora........or his pride is hurt.........NOPE. his pride :|
dirty dirty show
There's nothing wrong with being afraid for your life...just don't let it stop you from acting
Damn isn't a swear word
Giant monsters can't take out a monkey that is one third his size
LOGIC
*Digilogic
00,10he did't say damn
MadSurge: Anime logic, to be exact
00,10he said fuck
Serenity: come on, In Japan they have less censorship. they're free to say SHIT
Hey guys, I DIGIMOOOOOOOOOOON
MadSurge: Um...The same reason a level 1 Rayquaza can't kill a level 100 pichu
I should really take my ping off monkey, MadSurge keeps setting it off. :P
why woukld you do that
Sumica: Them sneaky bastards...
And yes. HIS F***ing pride is hurt :|
Also, how'd you know?

The chances of him being awake now is quite small
It's 2054 hours here
00,10that's not late
So he must be at least 5 hours ahead presumabally
He's 13 hours ahead of me
AssaultWithEmbraces: 11 hours behind*
I think theres just a little bit more then something wrong when the Wii U is more expensive on amazon then it is on ebay
At one point in the year, the Aussies are 12 hours ahead
Oh
AssaultWithEmbraces: Wait, I derped
It is 13 hours ahead
If you think Greenwich os +0:00

Come to think of it, I guess the failure of this show can serve as an effective argument agianst piracy. This show was probably pirated like crazy instead of being watched normally. So without the support from ad viewership, it was cancelled after 2 seasons.

I needs that. Seeing as AC6 was my first
dat solidier
09,01they seemed to loosen up for the 3DS
Shark bait
Shizu is like a honey badger. dont give a shit about getting hit
Catching the bus, a lot harder in GTA4 :D
I'm getting a wii u when I have a job
09,01so the 3DS has a pretty damn good lineup for the short time it has in the market
which will happen sometime next year
09,01and the Wii U probably has the best third party support of any console launch ever, all things considered
dem poor hotdogs
true
porr hotdogs
Sumica: go home. youre drunk
I want a 3DS XL
Sumica: go drunk, you're home
09,01don't, get the regular model
RarityDiamondBelle: please be joking
yay
09,01and then buy the Nyko PowerPak+
the Xl's are never all that good of an idea
I jk
you can't play Elite Beat Agents on em
too big
ITS A BUS
BUUUUUUUUUUS
09,01it runs for like 10 bucks online and it doubles your battery time
Beside's it's the same damn thing just bigger.
bus!!!!
09,01and it ain't false advertisement because I own it
cool
so I can't sue you for liabilities?
What's so bad about the basic Wii U?
VenHur, it has nothing?
I play this song when i see Babs Seed
And the Deluxe pack?
09,01on the 3DS XL's defense, it doesn't seem to just stretch the image, it seems to work at the same native resolution without stretching
Shizuka: theyre flying FOREVERRR
VenHur: it has slightly more then nothing?
dat lag
:D
also VenHur the deluxe is black
LOOO
OOL
the shizubus livesssss
dis is where bab seed came from:S
people hate the Wii U because it's a Nintendo console
Shizuka, wat r u doin
that's more than enough for me to get it
Shizuka, you lost your bus, U MAD SISTAH?
09,01ALL ABOARD
09,01THE SHIZUBUS
09,01HONK HONK
Buytoast: I like nintendo though...
and the Wii U
Free of charge, THE SHIZUBUS
and the fact that you can attach a 2 terabyte external hardrive
really it doesn't look too appealing to me until Pikmin 3 comes out
The hell...
Shizubus is the best bus.
then i'll be all over it
Fact.
:3 Nopony should die - without riding the Shizubus
Wait,Pikmin 3?
dat bus
I'm Pinkies4thWall, and i approve CriticKitten's message
Pikmin 3 WAS going to a launch title, but then delayed it to 2013.
Sumica: u shud help shizu befor she gets pissed
Shizuka
Stop
They're making a Pikmin 3?
I can't breathe
Go home bus your drunk...

Guys, I just refreshed Youtube, and they ONCE AGAIN changed the freaking layout!

09,01did they change it back?
apparently I'm the only one who hasn't seen the new layout
09,01or did they change it into something new?
well i gots to go cya everypony:)
it's garbage
09,01cause it could be because they hadn't finished implementing the layout changes or something
bye scout19_tf2
On the other hand, Windows 8 is a bad operating system
hell, i still have a tab open with the old layout
i'm trying to savor it
I mean why did Microsoft remove the Start menu
I tried to check out the changes to Youtube and saw nothing different.
They hadn't finished changing it last time.
Buytoast: I've reopened youtube a few times, and its still the old layout
I think you have to empty your cache
or something
computer terms
I wonder what the help forum is like right now
lol Kokore no *BLEGH* :D
There is possibly a shitstorm right now of bad layout threads

Lel?
So cute
Laugh if she went blind in one eye from keeping that eye patch on for too long
I don't think it works that way
ha
I'm constantly trying to get a Twi toy
WHOA
Awwww.
Shoot. XD
Eh, I'm sure eyes deteriorate in the same way as muscles atrophy if you don't use them
over already?
Well, when I say I'm sure
That was the whole thing? :D
I actually have no idea and am just guessing
/me dances
09,01pretty sure you can't go blind that way
09,01specially considering that's the method pirates used to get night vision
since the eye is already acustomed to the dark
NewDCD: Pirates w/ night vision? :D didnt know that
NewDCD: orly?
NewDCD: I didnt know that
09,01not exactly but they kept an eye covered at all times in order to make it be adjusted to the dark in case of a fight at night
PARTY!
FIRE PARTY CANNON!
NewDCD: Ah, I see.
Get to know all of them, then party!
Brony_ponies: study them, and send them back to their home realm before the governments of the world come to me for hidden magics and technology
I think QI told me that at some point
About pirates
or they have an eye infection...or its a dragon's eye...or something else entirely
09,01I like this song better than main series' opening

09,01dawn of the Tyrant's Eye
lol, MLP:FiM has 250,000 votes. The bronies are winning in a landslide
09,01I voted for Young Justice
09,01#YOLO
i voted for animaniacs
GET THE YOLO OUT!
XD
You like underlining text too, ay?
09,01That said we're pretty much rigging the votes and that's soemthing I seriously don't like
yup
it's awful
you can vote multiple times, just refresh
[]DeadpoolDash: Really?
yeah
0_o
Imma go and vote 100 times right now
O_O
naw, i voted for the last airbender
:>
Dat abuse of Medical supplies
voting for what
oh nvm
people are voting for horses in some online poll
KrazyNoobs: please dont
celestia is best horse
queen horse is far from being good
Korra was good, but too short and the end was kind of slapped together at the last minute.
no, the pink is best horse
now yellow quiet
there's a horse you can get behind
Buytoast: you voting for OP Show, or superh hero people
?
korra is overrated
cowvarkian 4chan /mlp/ (I just went on) has a thread on voting 100 times each.
I'm going to.
dont
do
KrazyNoobs: thats exactly why you shouldnt do it
it
if i were to vote for that thing i'd be for gravity falls
AssaultWithEmbraces: aggreed
avatar is pretty overrated, although from what i saw of korra, i liked it
KrazyNoobs: I don't recommend you do that.
KrazyNoobs: Why?
09,01OH LORD
What's the problem with it?
I just voted once
I like Gravity Falls..
09,01BRACE YOURSELVES FOR DARK SWAG MASTER
uh oh
What's the point?
KrazyNoobs: Because that's rigging the votes.
I love MLP:FiM 100 times more than those other shows, so I vote for it 100 times.
DinkyDoo: yeah, me too
OH BOY
KrazyNoobs: go die in a pit
BRACE FOR SPAGHETTI
Fine, I only voted 14 times, I'll stop
cowvarkian: Bit harsh?
Oh, my.
AJIsHaunter: just a little
Six hours of meditation.
O_o
If you don't want me to, I can see where you are coming form.
*from
oh man
What's the point in making it win if it doesn't deserve it?
Let's move on now
Nice pyrramid
one person with a voting script could win the vote
obviously
Suddenly, I begin to burst out laughing.
they get to say that it was the best
ANYPONY else on YouTube? i don't know how to post bulletins anymore BECAUSE OF THE NEW LAYOUT
Buytoast: in an internet poll? ooh, how prestigious
they'll grasp at anything
09,01YU-HEL-OH
ANYTHING
Dark soul FROM THE SHADOWSSS
Dark92Enigma: Yeah, I saw it. It'pretty annoying.
Oh gawd
*it's
Buytoast: aren't we part of they?
oh man
09,01OH LORD
Dat epic suit
I'd like to think we aren't part of they
09,01OH LORD
̲My body
well, mlp Is a good show, maybe it Does deserve to win. korra is the only other thing on that list i would consider voting for anyway
So what, this magic stuff is all a joke or something?
09,01THEY JUST
09,01THEY JUST
09,01OMG
OH GOD
Becuase hey are fucking retarded.
09,01GUNDAM X REFERENCE
09,01<3
they*
the dark Flame Master cannot be stopped
AJIsHaunter: we're just getting used to the last one......and i don't know how to send them anymore
T_T
they as in who?
Don't shoot somebody on accident!
09,01The Dark Flame Master would be useful to have in case of a T-Virus outbreak
oh no
The Dark Flame Master is about to cap a bitch
NewDCD: lol yes
The Dark Flame Master musn't shoot anyone on accident.
trixie_sprinkle You are smart. I think MLP:FiM is not better because of the show, but because of the amazing fandom that revolves around it.
Young Justice does have a good over-arching storyline
NewDCD: Oh god yeah
lol
Dark Flame Master has some spaghettio going on
Same with Legend of Korra
But truly, South Park is best animation
AssaultWithEmbraces: Some epic spaghetti, at that.
HES SO COOOO.
Lawl
*COOOOOL
....
KrazyNoobs: please be joking
oh man
korra is entirely overrated
it's too much
09,01Yuuta used SEXY VOICE
AJIsHaunter, the hottest spaghetti out the pot and the freshest Ragu
09,01it's SUPER EFFECTIVE
im ready o sit there and vote for mlp all day if it would mean south park wouldnt win
Who agrres that The Legend of Korra is over rated?
End of conversation, let's please move on from this stupid argument.
but thankfully thats not a danger in any case
I ma, play some operation Raccoon city
*Agree
DinkyDoo: it is, but I still like it...
trixie_sprinkle: I never liked South Park from the start.
legend of korra aint all that good
Define where you think people rank it and I'll tell you if that's too high.
Buytoast: true
09,01problem with Korra: too much emphasis on shipping over plot
09,01plot is good but DAMN
NewDCD: theres an emphasis on shipping?
09,01it's not a romance show, don't try to make it one
I fail at drawing, so I trace...
mlp Does deserve to win, not a lot of competition in any case
trixie_sprinkle: I don't think it should win
I like MLP: FIM and Gravtiy Falls.
Ehhh...
Plus, it's condensed into a short amount of episodes, so the pacing's pretty bad.
Eh, it wouldn't win if people actually played fair, I'm pretty sure.
Korra would have been a lot better if it had the 26 One Hour episodes it was originally planned for. They cut out a lot of story and development
cowvarkian: well what else should? its an empty list, only korra is good
trixie_sprinkle: uh... no?
WORLD DOMINATION!!
/me eats potato while argument continues
trixie_sprinkle: about everything on there except for bob's burgers and family guy are any good
and south park
do you even gravity falls?
cuteness_kitteh: D:
>biggest fandom
Buytoast: I do even gravity falls
Y-You monster
Not likely
cowvarkian: so...... the clone wars is good?
potato_pony: N-Not you...
Also fair as in one vote each
Rather than all the people going around voting 100 times
clones wars is kind of meh
trixie_sprinkle: I think it is, but I'm a rabid fanboy, so my opinion is invalid
trixie_sprinkle: star trek has a bigger fandom
hell, there's probably people voting a helluva lotta times
Most fans of other shows aren't ridiculous enough to do that
BUTCHER WOMAN!
/me steals cuteness_kitteh's potato "Shhh everythings okay little guy"
So much spices.
hello...
/me chews the bit she had on her spoon slowly, staring
cowvarkian: this is the computer-graphics one, right?
trixie_sprinkle: yes
Hai Kululu
Hi Kululu
A Cricket.
Its a very pretty cricket at that.
lol
cowvarkian: but its...they brought darth maul back as a cyborg...
Why did I just say that....
cricket
well time to update my bios
/me simply eats another potato ¬3¬
ku, ku, kuuu
If anything, I'd like them to make a new poll and only allow one vote per person. The fact that you're allowed to vote multiple times on one show or more is a huge fault in itself.
AJIsHaunter: i hope they do it soon
damn it
brb
thelonecubone: Agreed. Rigging votes for a show is NOT fair.
there we go
"3
:3*
I don't mind people voting for their favorite show, but if they're rigging the poll by voting multiple times for that one show, then there's a problem.
/me chews her other potato menacingly
shit i'd join a napping club
Buytoast: ikr
napped all the time in high school
/me watches in horror

Shizuka: a little help here? i can't send bulletins from YT anymore due to the NEW F***ING layout.......for now all i can say is:
The Rhineland is truly the fine land.
Shizuka: Shizu, this is uh....I think, the TENTH time that Youtube had an update!
00,10I say english cause yeah easyer to follow
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYUM
KrazyNoobs: you have come in when the stream is offline, this is what plays lol it's the mod's OCs ^_^
ENOUGH WITH THE PADDLINS
00,10Luna is luna
Shizuka: Doesn't the people over at Google even LISTENED to us?!
Sumica is Sumica

Oooh
I LIKE this new layout of youtube
/me hates the moderators
Dark92Enigma: Oh you XD
Bye bye SlyTag~
00,10cool story SlyTag
WHAT IS THIS? SOVIET RUSSIA
?
00,10screensnapr.com/v/1jQlhv.jpg
13NO
13THIS IS PATRICK
Sumica: Actually it's sort of a lame story
Should I open LAN on my Minecraft world so you'd all jump in? Wait, that'd suck
wtf, why is everything on the new youtube layout so small
And then sudden Shizu
i'm no Krusty Krab......
the proper term
is compact
Lyra is fucking adorable.
Shizuka: WHAT? I thought this was the Pizza guy from Pizza castle! D:
13the proper term is mobile >>
/me that's the name of the restaurant
the proper term is crap
Well, I DON'T! Okay?! I can't seems to find the "Next Video" or "Previous Video" buttons! Not even "Autoplay"!
DAAAAAAAAAAAYUM!!!!!!!
13it's the mobile UI stretched to desktop size, done horribly
Sumica: oh my
/me continues ranting about the moderators from his air duct
Shizu is ALWAYS sudden. She's like a ninja or something, srsly. :|
What a load a bullshit Google had doned...
looking out the window... that's a paddlin'
00,10why would I want my PC version of youtube to be mobile
whatever UI is it, it's better named PUI
00,10I have my vita for that
KrazyNoobs: Bronystate mods OCs, mostly.
They should feel bad and they SHOULD!
because it stinks
00,10and it looks cool too
AJisHaunter Oh, OK.
13also owing to the length of the film
13i will use full length intermission in the middle
*sigh* I think we better get used to it then...AGAIN...
MOBILE LAYOUTS: YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, YOUTUBE
lol
That's the picture you get whenever you "speak of ---"
Shizuka: and i can't send bulletins---wait, i already said that
looks like youtube got updated again
00,10you can say it for now KrazyNoobs
00,10it should die seeing as hub stoped showing them
Sumica: Then you obviously don't want Windows 8.
It's built for mobile platforms.
I searched up "Talking Ben" and voice search thought i said "how give me a boner"
13also given the volume leveling on this movie, you'll probably want headphones
00,10you are right i dont want it
00,10it's suck and fail for games
Thanks, Sumica. Who here misses... *inhales dramatically* ... GAK! ... *me gusta*
THEY FINALLY UPDATED THE RELATED LINKS
FINALLY
13also that statistic is correct
KrazyNoobs: lol
It's suck and fail in general.
Well, stinks to miss the next stream, but I gotta go...
1340k troops in the navy, 30k died
...
bye
we need bulletins
bye SlyTag
13it's the worst casualty rate in any military that continued to function
we need creeper-repellant. badly
As is every other Windows iteration, in keeping with their pattern
If anypony hates the new layout, say I.
13just watch the movie silly ponies :)
Peeks back into chat. Oh wait what movie's coming up next Shizuka?
The prince is having a ball!
What movie, exactly?

SuperBrony64: ...Your kidding me...Your kidding me, right? :|
It's the same one they've been trying to cram down people's throat for months
Nope.

HELLOOOOOOOOO NURSE!
13kmplayer doesn't seem to like swapping the audio streams on this
00,10oh well
FAHKING HOURS VID :[:[:[:[:[
13it's weird, after swapping sources the video plays at half speed, even after switching back
aw so close
Shizuka: you said this was to long for BMN, and yet Enthiran is about as long and was played
LOL
13gomplayer does it fine but it has too much UI
13SpeccyRush: not caring, playing now :P
ok DanielBronies126 please stop being like that...either behave or leave
00,10ewwww gom
13way too much ui on that one
NO I NEED WATCH OME MLPS
SOME*
then leave and watch it
00,10only use I had for GOm was playing anime that had the opening and endings as seprate files
Kkk
Shizuka: well that's better, actually will get to see it instead of hoping it'll get picked
did he actually leave?
Dat french music
...
0_o
13okay so this guy says "herr kaleu", it's a shortening of "herr kapitanleutnant", captain lieutenant, the captain's full title
13that i know of, the captain is never actually named beyond that
also I'm pretty sure most of you guys won't care about this but
Youtube is bugging me to use my real name
13they are in La Rochelle, France, occupied territory
fun
I get what they're trying to do, but it's kind of annoying
This picture right here made my whole birthday http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mekxkglQSB1r6c0zro7_r1_1280.png
13also this guy just won an important medal, but even better
13he is actually drunk
"I was molested, captain." "HEY ME TOO, WE'RE BROS NOW." Methinks the captain doesn't get it. ._.
13he is actually doing this scene completely smashed
really now?
im playing BRICK FORCE
No better acting than like the real thing.
...that man needs mad props...and more beer
13lag test, he just took the mic
He's walking he just spoke.
00,10no lag shizu
he just spoke
13awsm
hello
aaaa
aaaaaaaaa
13but also, he's the second actor for this part
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
13the first actor was let go
13FOR BEING DRUNK TOO MUCH
lol
damn
:D
13as you'll see, while they're nazis, they don't much approve of the regime
so inspirational!
spam evepypony
watch at fullscreen
DanielBronies126: why
omg internet, why you so bad tonight :|
13the german navy was quite a bit more independent than the rest of the military, it was common for the commanders to talk smack about their superiors while out in the middle of nowhere waiting for orders
Those silly Nazis
good for em
13pretty much
trixie_sprinkle you spam it if you watch at fullscreen
Presents a whole new side of the war, this does
just drunk soldiers, eh
13this being the directors cut there's some more character development and longer scenes than the theatrical version
/me facedesks.
ASS
13i'll pass on some of the other fun tidbits from commentary as we go on :)
13this is all one shot
ha
yay~
13it cuts on the closeup of the bullets there
LOL
FAIL
13otherwise one continuous shot
00,10nice shots
Shizuka: explains somewhat how Karl Donitz became hitlers succesor
NICE SHOT MAN XD
13thomsen's actor drunk again
yeah I know
13gratuitous english!
trixie What is Das Boot
13so there's hidden cuts all over this sequence to hide the fact that it's the same model
Shizuka
DanielBronies126: the boat i think
Huh, clever.
Boat???
13now, maybe you'll recognize it
Didn't catch them either.
13a fun story from the production of this movie
yes DanielBronies126 ,i just checked, it is
13when they came back to la rochelle to film these last shots, they found their main model was missing!
"Unterwasserboot", yes?
I recommend the book. The movie can't impart the same tension.
So what?... cinema was an war?
unterseeboot
lel
back, from very long afk :'(
"untersee". Should have known.
Ha, that's awesome
didn't that movie have nazis too?
13X3
Conspiracy~
NAZI IS COMING
XD
We won the war, we get to keep it :P
13nah spielberg gave it back
13but there was like a hairline fracture in the front third
THOMPSON GUN?
<.< narwal?
LULZ
13there's a shot coming later of the boat going out to sea, like thirty seconds after that cuts out, the boat started to collapse
Shizuka: drive like you stole it
we will win the next one :P
what is this about?
SkunkTauri: unicrons
00,10hope they give the guy a air hose
nah, just hold your breath and fire the gun
Sumica: Not hard for Aquaman
aquaman is best nazi
13i'm thinking if you're on the surface and have to defend yourself with those guns
13you're pretty much screwed
cowvarkian: unicrons XP
XD
huh?
Well, yeah.
13especially seeing how badly they fare with basic combat as this movie goes on
torpedoes are limited. the deck gun is usually directed to the rear. for escape
13now this is also one continuous shot
Sumica: THey'll talk about the depth these coffins operate at later.
13the set does not come apart, the camera has to move in among the crew just like the actors
some pretty cramped quarters
i was afk so long because i have a new puppy to watch XD
13it's mounted on gimbals, so later as depth charges hit, the set really is shaking that much
00,10so um, should not all that gear have been stored and sortted before they left port?
-And British sailors who've had enough of your shenanigans...
is there a scene where they say "Splashes" or something like that Shizuka?
13i guess it would take them so long to get to combat heavy waters they have plenty of time
Sumica: that would make sense though
They are cramped and you have to almost press up on the ladders to climb up and down
or else you'll bump your head
I've visited a few ships, I could never live in such tight corridors. Those things make me feel claustrophobic.
das boot?
13before he made off with it :3
i've been on one
They're interesting, SkunkTauri
spent the night in it
im kay with this\
smelled funny
looks really cramped
Loading Completed
They are cramped
Gotta move to the side and all
13SkunkTauri: the camera makes it look bigger than it is, just think about that
Brick Force Load Completed
13the set is absolutely identical to the real VIIC boats
speaking of cramps, combatives is painful.
GTG im playing Brick Force
This is my only problem with this movie.
13so yeah claustrophobics need not apply
The U-Boats were NOT crewed by boys.
Not this early, anyway.
a boat under water, seculded from prying eyes, full of men for long periods of time
they must have been bored ;#
Rose`Vased: I see what you're insinuating there...
13more inaccurate is how these guys celebrate during combats, they were in way too much danger to do that IRL
ikr
not to mention the food would eventually aquire a taste of diesel Shizuka
Shizuka: but, you also have to worry about radiation leakage too
Yuck.
13ALAAAAAARM
uh oh
they're slow underwater...most of the time they are above surface
tasty tasty diesel food
Dat ass
SkunkTauri: thats what the engineers need to worry about
13again, the set is one thing
o.O
13the camera is rushing through there with the rest of them
00,10human balist
13the cameraman had to wear like full body padding :P
13that's their smaller model diving
Poor camraman :(
camea
13there's room for one stuntman to pilot it
camera
man, just seeing that one iron strut hanging there
would make me nervous running in those quarters
I know it's redundant, but I simply adore you for this Shizuka.
The Skipper is also Duke Leto Atreides in Dune.
13<3
That fello
That guy's voice sounded creepy
13by the end of this movie, you will all know that "tiefer" means "deeper"
Sumica: Yeah, they finally build them so there's no more snakes on them.
This was a childhood movie for me. XD <3
Yeah... "Deeper" comes up a lot in this movie.
they must go deeper
...i had to do it
learning german with Das Boot
13aw don't freak out the poor war correspondent
13cowvarkian: actually that's how i first saw this movie, we watched the six hour TV format version in german class :P
go to 260
huh
throw caution to the sea
I voted on the english version...
oh cool dis das boot?
yup
no, its my little pony the musical
13nope it's sailor moon super happy time
which version
ja
13jcelios: directors cut, 3.5 hour
and a burger
131997 directors cut specifically i think
08,01did somebody say draco malfoy?
I heard there are cuts of this movie that go on for an ungodly amount of time because it was going to be a mini series or something
13yep
now that you mention it, fries and a coke wouldn't be too bad
and mozzerlla sticks
13"the original uncut edition" i think is the six hour tv format they shot it for
SHIZUKA!!!!!!!!!!!
Buytoast: and heart attack on a bun?
Buytoast: Mmmm sounds delicious. I'm jelly
psh, we all die some day
Buytoast: some sooner then others
too old
hizuka
shizuka
13wat
13weylin|Blarg: no you had to translate the audio by ear :P
can i watch mlp server plz?
welp
...maybe I should have just left the joke there
13DanielBronies126: wat

Idit Movie
/me wants more ponies
Kick.
Now.
what now
idiot movie
but after the movie
are you mocking german?
13the first watch officer there is pretty much the only ardent nazi on the boat
that's as bad as mocking Uncle Sam's home
DanielBronies126: Then go watch somewhere else. SImple as that.
No need to bring your whiny ass here.
13canary canary <3
???
LOL FAT BOY
i swear
120% loyal
I apologize Shizu. But I am not in the mood for idiocy tonight .-.
13:P
13canary gots teeth :3
I can. When provoked.
13yes the captain is pretty much openly mocking hitler and the nazis, this stuff happened
And people thought all Germans were for the Nazi party
Hitler Youth group?
13because the 1WO is the only hardline nazi on the boat
OH MY GOD
"N-A-Z-I, OUR FURHER IS PRETTY FLY!"
00,10good song
yeah like Boy Scouts but they brainwash them into nazis
13over the course of the film he'll be the only one to keep his uniform in order and shave
Why am I feeling like I've seen this before?
And then musical number
:D
13there
why o i get a disney ibe from this
13that shot with the guys on the deck
and he's not even from germany. tries to be more german than the germans.
*vibe
13like thirty seconds after the cut, the boat broke apart
I don't think I have but I think I did.
13THANKS SPIELBERG
U JERK
08,01DAS BOOT
THANKS OBAMA. ....wait.
08,01SHIZU <3
13:3
FUCK YOU, SPIELBERG! YOU RUINED OUR BOAT!
CriticKitten: >.>
that's what happens when you deal with a passionate MURIKAN
08,01weylin|Blarg: it's called a boot
Buytoast: A MURIKAN from MURIKA?
08,01Shizuka: have you read the book on which this is based?
13it's "das boot", with the o pronounced long like you're from minnesooooota
CriticKitten: what other kind
he's the only one with a north german dialect
Shizuka: doncha know
cowvarkian: The kind that comes from Texas. :D
CriticKitten: well that works too
00,10damn fly
all our sailors are from northern germany
13real enigma machine there
that guy is pretty fly
coo
13i forget who loaned it to them for the production
Dat fly
booo, Buytoast
don't blame me, blame visual puns
08,01weylin|Blarg: kein problem
00,10pretty fly for a rabi?
13pretty fly for a .... na... zi?
Imagine how much it's gonna smell in there after a few weeks.
;v;
our technology museum has one. it's still working perfectly, Sumica
Much less months.
a priest a rabi, and a horse walk into a bar....
Shizuka:
so
Hi SpeccyRush
08,01aber ich denke sie es gelesen
13this is the kind of boredom they would have between combats
AssaultWithEmbraces: was here the whole time :P
almost
don't they have the internet? jeez
00,10they need an ecxbax
08,01Shizuka: i should show Dark Star at some point
SpeccyRush, really? You didn't talk much
13director petersen had the walls sprayed down so that haze would hang around
Shizuka: I always see a little haz around lights and stuff
*haze
wait a second
Nice.
did they have showers?
they didn't im guessing
AssaultWithEmbraces: never do,
00,10no Buytoast
Buytoast: nope
oh man
08,01what's showers, precious?
00,10they just roll down the windows
Showers are for quitters
lol
haha, windows
real men don't need showers
13Sumica: pff that's about as funny as a screen door on a battleship :P
So yep, people in the water for long periods of time, all stink and covered in man sweats
00,10atomic hand grenades
00,10ejector seats on choppers
00,10nope
My OC is now a mare
13THAT IS ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE INFORMATION
13THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO KNOW
these things are huge
00,10ewwwwww
goddamn the stench must be horrific
eww
duh
That grease?
13WER WAR DAS
00,10he gonna cry?
haha
:_(
13oh this is far from the worst thing that'll happen to the guy this movie
romantic
how do you see the clearance marking if it's ultraviolet... wait, that's the point, right?
/me 08,01forgets that most in here are infrared clearence
poor guy :c
weylin|Blarg: he deserved it
13fun is mandatory
13the computer is your friend
mandatory fun is worst fun
he's the overeager idiot in the group who makes nothing than trouble
wrong chat, my bad DaringDerpy ^^;
oh ^^
letters? he should brought his laptop
what's he gonna do, send the litter out in a bottle?
Shizuka: I imagine that going to ridicuoulsly upbeat music and dancing
*ridiculously
is this u571?
08,01is there a rifftrax for this?
^
13don't think so
13you could look :P
Oh shit
00,10doubt it
This isn't high-profile enough for it.
Rifftrax riffs on Blockbusters.
13well they do smaller things too like shorts
Randomnerd: thats funny.
13but ja das boot might be out of their range, would have been more relevant during MST3K, but they did bad movies then
08,01pppppppppppp
cowvarkian: This movie was a big deal, but who in the English speaking world watched it?
13you can see the dubbing at work there
pi
Randomnerd: theirs an english version
13Randomnerd: it got big over here too
Randomnerd: I like foreign movies...
13all the actors spoke fluent english so the english version is still them
And the British basically would react to the movie with "Well, they had it coming"
/me 08,01can just about understand about 50% of the dialogue
13even though it was marketed as "the boat" everyone knows it as das boot
08,01the book was called U-Boat
you'd think they'd at least shave their heads or something so the grease don't bug em
....
what is he doing?
This is not a blockbuster.
13lemon with milk i think
Is that sour milk?
08,01hey shizu, fancy spending a few months in germany with me next summer?
(Condensed milk)
Shizuka: why do I get the feeling that guy will be sick at some point
....even if milk is from a can, I'm sure its a bad sign when you have to chew it O_o
What shorts did Rifftrax do?
13i know they did one got fat
13there's a few others, public domain shorts
08,01also, i discored the other day that for about €200, you can get a europe-wide train ticket, valid for a month
08,01unlimited travel on the mainland
/me licks Ruggy :3
Shizuka: Yeah, I loved the shorts on MST3K. "Why don't they look?"
Shizuka: will we see some wolf pack moments?
wow... team fourstar riffs dragonball evolution
hello :)
Black screen?
RDash5000 hello :)
Ohai RDash5000
13so the long shots of the boat in the water
BS?
13you can tell it's not actually humans up there
13the crew are basically barbie dolls
B SCREEN?
Funfact: Admiral Doenitz was the last ruler of the Third Reich.
08,01okay, just looked it up; the person who told me about it was looking at the wrong thing
08,01it's €600 for a month
Lag vid?
still good for a month
08,01or maybe i'm looking in the wrong place...

rules and stuff
13i love you hydrophone guy
ring ring ring ring hydrophone...
He looks like a young Liam Neesan.
Neeson.
13ha he does
did somepony say, LIAM NEESON?!
High Spirits is a good movie....
That has a young Liam Neeson in it.
13what's that mister engine? kill them all?
testing
hmm
they call him "the ghost"
can't see shit
now the fun begins
They translated "Scheisse" as "Oh, no!"?
13ikr
Couldnt you just make one up
lol
13i think the english is much cleaner
it is
I read "He is both asian as zeus"
00,10......
00,10they wisper
13because sonar
sonar
00,10then stomp around and knock shit over
So the destroyer doesn't hear them.
*nod*
I wonder how it works with the alarm bell
13magic
13might also be to have a sense of calm
boats are very skitterish creatures
you must whisper when approaching them
else scare them away
They're huntin
several weeks?
00,10uhhhh
that's what robots are for
13dropping the lights lets their electrical system work better
00,10why dim lights
The Destroyer has ASDIC.
00,10ahh
*interrail pass
european master race
It might not have a Hydrophone, but it has an early form of sonar.
13this shot was apparently a bit hazardous to get a model that close to a camera in water
oopsie
SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
13the british destroyers did have sonar though
uh oh
13the set really is shaking this much too
Oshit
so far a total failure
08,01cowvarkian: aw
the weather makes it easy to escape
Yeah, ASDIC. The British overplayed its accuracy, for obvious reasons.
13DaringDerpy: not entirely, they could get away using full engines but would make them easy to track
like in star trek
I'm not sure if His Majesty's Navy has hedgehogs yet.
13thus why hydrophone guy has to keep track of where they are, you pretty much have to sneak away from destroyers
so fucking SNEAKY!
Bet the Nazis wish they were Reptile right now.
>.>
13this is also a bit psychological against the crew, the captain is making sure the crew don't think he's scared or anything
13captain is in control, even if he isn't
reptile the invisiblessed
00,10lol for a second I thought hydrophone guy said left full rudder
00,10was gonna say damn how can he tell
he's a wizard
13shshshshshshshshshshshsh
I were a bad captain. My left eye twitches when I'm stressed too much.
That's true in any Navy -just as they get to speak more freely, they have no authority higher than the Skipper.
/me plays jaws music
13just look how much that's shaking
that was OBVIOUSLY a tiny model
._.
13crew's expression of fear is pretty genuine
whenever someone says skipper, I always think of gilligans island
^
shake shake shake
13the explosion shots are 1500fps shots of small explosions in the tank
00,10See the world they said
Peace Treaties used to have provisions excusing acts of war committed after the end of hostilities, on the grounds many ships would not get word for months.
00,10join the navy they said
13the model is like 3 meters they said? i think
13meet interesting people then bomb them
they said
:D
i fucking love you guys.
I know
It'll be for the Motherland, they said
13oh and like i said earlier, probably best to have headphones for this movie, the quiets are very quiet and the louds are very loud
RIP Headphone Users.
/me has headphones
13it's not like a huge jump
waaaaaay ahead of you shizu :)
13but it lets you hear the quiet stuff without having speakers up too high for the more bassy explosions
00,10um would they not pick up the creaking?
true
13probably why he's saying to go deeper
13mask the sound with more water
Shizuka: full volume all the way and not afraid of anything, I have spare speakers anyway
We must go deeper
Sumica: Ambient noise, could be their own ship.
13that too
play dead..."we sink, go away, destroyer!"
go DEEPER? *inception sound*
^
You sunk my battleship...
http://inception.davepedu.com/
THE BUTTON
13eeyup
00,10rocks fall
oh shit
They're in deep shit now.
o hai is it movie night already
hm
If the hull is cracked enough for water to leak in, they're in real trouble.
not yet
13nope, shizu special :)
no pony_26 , just watching a movie
and an awesome movie so far
hull fixed
what movie?
13150 meters underwater
13destroyer still knows exactly where they are
^
they were at full speed
Das Boot, aniderp|bestcakeever
ok
13captain has a habit of talking to the opposing team
What's also important is you never see anyone else.
You don't see the "Tommies".
Did they cut out the part where they leave the sailors to die?
13Randomnerd: nope that's in
13this has more than the theatrical version, but mostly character development stuff
lalalalla
it would ruin the atmosphere to show the others
13he's counting depth charges, destroyer ran out of ammo
13yay we didn't die this time!
we should all wish Ponies47 a happy birthday :)
we did :P
13not so much knowing how much is left
lol
cuz i just did
just how much isn't there?
13they're probably going to walk away eventually
13like they did
hm...
is that guy ever off his hydrophone :P
he is married to it
dat jaymoo up?
13maybe a backup at best but probably only to sleep
13i think we're coming up on the halfway mark i'll intermission at
hydrophones should be built redundant...at least three of them, with operators
space and man power
13^
if it fails, they are blind
13u-boats were surface boats that could go underwater
13not really the other way around
they have to resurface to take fresh air quite often
compressed air tanks
o dear....
13i think the thing i read said the VIICs were limited to 10-12 hours underwater at the very best
:D
/me dances :$
lol
uh
u gonna get raped!
13as you can see, the crew is a bit bored
they need to get entertainment somehow
ah yes, the Deutschland Disco
a classic
Nice...um...oranges?
/me dances
they had no internet down there
PUT SOME PANTS ON :[
13NOOOOO NOT OUR FOOTBALL TEAM
And io was like OATMEAL? ARE YOY CRazy?

:D
13just wait
13well
13not for that
13but the gag keeps going in a sec
MFW the boat has a surgeon.
Shizuka: they needed their best excuse for a party. THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM LOST. they needed to drown their sorrows somehow
eww hairy meat. D:
Wasn't that just Hydrophone guy?

that's moldy food isn't it
thats quite a transition - inspection to dinner :D
eeeeeeewwwww

damn
hahahahaha
13the set is shaking that much too
WELL WELL, Banzai, what do we have here?
the translation could be more precise ^^
"hag"
you got the floor wet...
I dunno Shenzi, whaddya say Ed?
jaymoo? ;_;
I was watching Youtube videos when the design was suddenly changed
/me laughs
he didn't say hag, she said matress
That's some stiff-upper-lip bull right there.
Keep in mind, these things are very large coffins.
^
One small malfunction and everyone dies, huh?
13pretty much
its running windows ME also
lol jcelios
13the blue lighting is probably also good for simulating night, plus the engines being able to recharge the electrical system
Shizuka: it doesn't help that all of them have two days until retirement.....
when too deep, it just makes *pop* and the hull folds together :)

13director petersen didn't realize how it happened so he wanted a second take
and Shizuka we're in the same time zone, my fellow Minnesotan :)
And they say acting is a 'soft' job :T
13the movie was quickly rewritten to put the guy in bed for the rest of the voyage
Shizuka: and he broke---oh wait that's legit :O
German actors are best actors
Soo...this is Das Boot right?

Something I've wondering for a while. That purple stuff that dark spyro breathes is called convexity, but I've never heard it mentioned in the games, unless it's mentioned at the end of DoTD. Where did that name come from?

oh shit
00,10some ones popcorn is done
/me aliens motion tracker
Oh damn
you see what happens when you pee in a can?
you doom your u-boat
13one of the notes about sonar tactics is the depth charges are shot off the stern of the hunter
Buytoast: No, you attract deer
13the sonar pings cut out JUST before the explosions go off
worst
00,10we are underwater yet on fire I am so confussed
fire is bad
y6ou attract blood thirsty water deer
the killers of the sea
13FIRE BAD
That too
13TREE PRETTY
They still have oxygen, Sumica
00,10not yet
Shizuka: No trees in the ocean
hehe
13now they have smoke
ohai Shizuka and CrazyHippie C=
bullshit they have trees in the ocean
00,10some one roll down a window
remember when spngebob broke his ass?
POLO and hi Marco
13eh just put a dyson bladeless in there you'll be fine
:>
Think about being in a metal tank leagues under the seam inhaling smoke and all of your fresh air not existing.
sea*
13X3
13pssssst, capn, we don't want them to hear you
you don't need freah air when you've got guts
and an iron will
the fire already took a lot of the oxygen anyway
13shshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshsh
13it's like halloween only actually tense
13SHH SHH SHH SHH
13PING PING PING PING
xD
boom?
00,10marco
Hai
lel
aliens motion tracker noise...
You gun die. :D
13another note about depth charges is they're really only lethal at or below your depth
13captain you are not very good at this
13you're supposed to say POLO
CAPTAIN, SHUT UP
00,10realy Shizuka?
Who pinged?
the croc is coming for you captain
00,10would have figured any thing close
13well close too
00,10seeing as water dont compress
Polo: Have another
13but they work by making a pocket of gas which smacks the water against itself
Right, that's enough
Out of me, at least
13the gas wants to go up so if a charge blows above you it's mostly going to direct it's force up
They're going down?
00,10they should shoot that gun at them next time they pass overhead
underwater?
13so they're diving because the destroyer thinks they're higher up
They would die from the pressure
13and might drop charges to blow up there, not down where they really are
00,10they should crazy ivan
13but, as hydrophone guy's panic indicates
13destroyer ain't fooled
00,10some one just had an idea
00,10judgeing by that Lightbulb~
shoot the torpedoes
better yet
Whoa, we're watching Das Boot? Wish I'd known earlier
someone get on that deck side gun
they need aplane XD []DeadpoolDash
13can't really shoot the torpedoes UP
It was announced last night
HELLO!
No problem, just switch your deflector shields to maximum and devert power from the repulsors.....oh, right
space ship
I wasn't here last night
You know guys? I can't draw anything, not even ponies or something original...
Hey there, Silverfish
Er, Sliverfish
I gives up.
08,01i need somethim meaty and deep fried
13thank you for that brief dark green cut movie
/me 08,01goes a-hunting
i'm sure they can do like an underwater backflip and shoot em as they move and stuff
[]DeadpoolDash: Thats no moon
13might just be me though, i have to watch this on small screen to stream it
08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: unhealthier
*Gives Polydunami some chewing gum*
why do i always miss the survey on Thursday night
13that much rumbling gon give them away
13230 meters
its only 7:35PM on thursday
Wow, you even got my favourite flavour! Trout flavour!
Uh guys, the ship is creaking
:3
13popped bolts are an extremely bad thing
That's...not a good sign. At all.
too deep
Shit
13just one is reason to GTFO and go home
momomomonsterkill
13but then we have half the movie left
I don't think I can imagine how scary that would be
Well, bolts popping would mean plate separation, potentially, so yeah. Pretty much the worst possible thing.
plate?
13the hull
13a bolt popping means the pressure is starting to crush the hull
you think they just wrap one piece of metal around like a burrito and send it out to sea?
Im gonna go guys. It's getting late. See you later!
Buytoast, well that was the latest at the time
later CrazyHippie
13they're in deeper trouble than before here because two destroyers looking for them
13way more depth charges to send in
SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT
The hull is a bunch of plates held together with bolts, jcelios. So if bolts start to pop off at high pressure, water can start to slip through the plates
FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
well, at least they're not leaking fire
oic
But they're leaking water. You can't swim to safety in fire.
This movie is not for those who suffer from claustrophobia.
And thus, the whole damn ship could sink or come apart if the pressure continues, as the loss of one bolt weakens the whole structure (and thus puts more pressure on the bolts that remain)
or hydrophobia
13that would have been a charge above their depth there
Or possibly both
or who have massive PTSD
So yeah, they're kinda in deep shit here. O.o
13heroic BSOD
goodnight guys :) thanks for the stream Shizuka!
g'night RDash5000 :D
gnight RDash5000
this can't be good
He's lost it.
Night RDash5000
he should try yoga
13and you can all guess what the captain went for
i'm guessin he got a bad case of cabin fever?
THE VODKA
no wait
what they said was more like "he's gone"
A WRENCH!
so what's this movie about Shizuka ?
Argh, my internet connection is crap tonight
Bolts aren't the only things that can crack under pressure.
CriticKitten: Well said
so what's up all?
you mean glass?
and what is this movie about? Or mini-series I should say
otakon: We're watching a Shizu special, Das Boot. :3
thank Midnight_Fyre
Hey, it's an otakon~
CriticKitten: and I missed most of it :(
I was at work late tonight
Only about half.
It was pretty damn busy
DAMN
They STILL know where they are?
Where do you work, otakon?
he had to say it
AssaultWithEmbraces: dishwasher
And still know they're down there, too. Shit.
otakon: oooh
Sinking fast?
everything lower than 200 is bad
They need to find an escape route fast. ._.
1390
13the boat's only rated for 90, anything below that is bad
....weird cut
oh
What is going on?
13clearly not dead
They're only rated for 90 meters? Shit, depth charges can get well below that even in the 40s. O.o
Everyone is sleeping?
In the time it takes me to fap, Romney makes 1500 dollars
lying on the bottom of the ocean, ballast pumps not working...must be of of the less funny ways to die
-_-
DaringDerpy: time to drink their own piss
it was cramped, hot and you were at risk of being crushed to death at any moment really
it's the kind of job I let other people do
utter goddamn nightmare fuel
and that's IF you don't go insane first
Still is, but imagine that. You're in a tight space and your boat is designed only to reach a 90m depth....when depth charges can clearly get well below that mark if they need to. No wonder the casualty rate was so high, the damn boats weren't nearly deep-sea-worthy enough for modern naval warfare. :/
Hufflepuff potato?
13let's review our cast
Is this a dream>
?
WHAT IS LOVE?
Now that statistic at the start of the film doesn't surprise me. I'm actually more amazed there were any veterans of those damn things at all.
oh no
someone set the ocean on fire
13it's a tanker
they waste a torpedo for a dead ship?
Wait, they hit it with two torpedoes didn't they? Or was it three?
13one i think
if I recal they called them cows or something
And it's STILL not sinking?
13there were four in the convoy
13or might have been two
13but one last shot to make sure it goes down
13leave nothing for salvage
goddamn
Oh, if it was just one, okay. But two or three? Wow, the damn thing's durable, gotta give it that
....
13captain is understandably angered
holy hell
Nice way to alert your enemies where you are, guys.
oh wow
are those germans or enemies>
13brits
enemies
That's....ugh
ah
survivors
They....they just abandoned them>
._.
CriticKitten: ofc, it's the war
13well
13two things
The ideology of ''For the Empire"
they can't risk being caught
13one the captain is quite mad that the brits left their mates
13they had way more than enough time to rescue
13but our heroes here can't take prisoners
No kidding. Six hours is plenty of time.
wow
13a) not allowed by the rules of engagement
that's just... wow
Movie ended?
no real room for em
Yup.
can't bring a prisoner on a U-boat. No room and way too easy to sabotage
Still....
damn ive missed a part, what just happened? who abandoned the brits?
13so yeah
much less food etc.
13war is hell
the brits
Ugh, that's awful.
abandoned the brits
hm ok
wow
trixie_sprinkle: The Brits abandoned theirr own men and left them for dead
It happens
civilian tanker captains
I'm more appalled at the fact that the Brits just ditched their comrades.
13like we saiid, the german navy was notoriously displeased with the regime
AssaultWithEmbraces: why? was there a battle going on?
13and yeah that's a bigger wtf why the brits left them
they had 6 hours to save em
and they didn't
trixie_sprinkle: Well it was a war
That's just disgusting, honestly.
CriticKitten: war
AssaultWithEmbraces: i know but im asking why they were abandoned
Being left on a tanker full of burning gasoline for hours....
Some of them on fire....
/me shudders
because someone decided it were too risky
AssaultWithEmbraces: not asking about germans, i meant the brits
well maybe they could've...
13and worse still the ship goes down, now you're stuck in the middle of nowhere
sandiwhced them all together
and there's blood in the water
Yep. You get to die of thirst.
In the ocean.
even if sandwiched, thatd be more weight, more supplies, more stink, and its cramped there already
CriticKitten: Irony
"When I give the order"
should've built fireproof row boats
Which is fucking AWFUL.
Buytoast: out of what?
If you're lucky you'll just drown.
AssaultWithEmbraces: i knooow, im asking why the Brits abandoned the Brits
it's winter there
If not, the salt water dehydrates you and you die a bit more slowly from that. Either way, just ick
trixie_sprinkle: Who knows? Germans were wondering the same thing
trixie_sprinkle: couldn't risk being caught
I think.
ok
trixie_sprinkle: it happens all the time. forget the glory and comradeship nonsense. in war, people get sacrificed
We should watch Stalingrad
DaringDerpy: i know, guess russia wasnt the only one who did that to their soldiers
Incidentally this same thing is happening to US soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan who are out for long tours of service.
modern war is extremely clean compared to back then
That much time in a high stress environment just eats away at a person.
13ja here's something to get you thinking
ugh
13lt werner is basically the author avatar
13the author did not like this movie
i know i've hit rock bottom when i type /join #bronystate
the book is far better. as always
13now, just about everyone who ever sees das boot goes "how the hell is this glorious"
Midnight_Fyre: probably
13which makes you wonder
No kidding.
13what was the REAL war like if the author thinks THIS is glorious
Japan doesn't have a Military now
This movie's fucking depressing.
back then they were a imperialist war machine
And if this is glorifying it, then how mind-numbingly depressing must the book be
my brain's definitely full of fuck now
and Germany's just conquered Europe economically anyway
13that too
13going to keep trying to find an ebook of das boot
be happy if you've never seen any war
13that order is suicide
mycutiemarkisagun: Yes and no. Although they don't call it a military, their "self defense force" is actually one of the most highly funded and advanced armed forces in the world.
Shizuka: yikes
13they're in the atlantic
....
13they've been ordered to italy, which means going through the strait of gibraltar
13the most heavily defended pass in the seas
GANGNAM STYLE HAS
which is full of mines right?
japan has a ministry of defense again for a year or so
900 MILLION VIEWS!!!!
otakon: yep
yeah
they have problems with china and north korea
basically suicide mission
well its either that or run outta fuel
The rudding fuck is their CO thinking?
and supplies
oh north korea
13orders came from higher up
if it's the only port left
Then the real fight is just starting for them
shame on all these pussies for giving us North Korean invaders instead of the Red Chinese horde we deserve
Red Dawn, that FPS whatsitsname
With their ship so damaged....
There's no way in hell they should make it. o.O
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Equestria Inquirer #62
North Korea couldn't militarily occupy Camden, New Jersey
only one man went crazy
One man can threaten an entire ship
create doubt, 'spread' insanity, etc.
North Korea has a big military, but it is incredibly outdated and they have little fuel
Midnight_Fyre they have a sekrit weapon :x
*weppin
mycutiemarkisagun: sekrit?
13i should show red dawn rifftrax some time
weppin?
Shizuka: yes please :)
mycutiemarkisagun: Homefront?
they have no blue water fleet
Shizuka YES
...the original Red Dawn? Oh lord. XD
yeah homefront
the Sean Connery riffs alone will be worth it
SEAN CONNERY!
13it's mike and... i forget who's with him
the original Red Dawn is like All Quiet on the Western Front compared to the new one
almost everybody dies in the original Red Dawn
I believe it. I didn't waste my money to find out
at night?
bad show
no
13probably because of spy planes etc
they're doing it in secret
yes
Pft, what else are they gonna do? They're basically screwed anyways, may as well try to be sneaky. XD
and the director did wanna do it more as a grim survivalist sorta deal before the studio intervened
Midnight_Fyre: have you seen Wreck-It Ralph?
theyre entering port....
AT NIGHT
00,10playing around with new parts on kerbal.
hiya Sumica what's up?
otakon: nope. I'll wait till DVD
Midnight_Fyre: :( it really isn't the same experience in this case
00,10manage to launch probe on a solar escape course
yay?
13look how haggard they are
yeah look at these asshats
fresh food
all dressed up

hahaha
lol

Midnight_Fyre: Celebration Day?

aaaaaand i have returned! ^_^
Midnight_Fyre: oh
wb NocturnalBlade
....dat food
heya NocturnalBlade :)
These people are flaming asshats.
Did I miss anything?
it isn't easy here
13look at this first world problem guy
IT ISN'T EASY HERE?
Damn you, Germany. You're inciting gluttonous desires within me.
I'm also a big Led Zeppelin fan. I think there are only 2 or 3 Zeppelin PMVs on Youtube and one of them is mine
Oh he fancy, huh?
punch him
PUNCH THAT PONCEY FUCK
now kiss
EW HE PUT IT BACK
This man is, to steal a Yahtzee phrase, the ponciest ponce ever to ponce past a poncing parlor. :|
And I just want to reach through my screen and deck 'im.
Wait, did I miss something? Where are they?
They're on the Weser
in dock
ah
13german barge in spain refueling and rearming them
13they've been ordered to italy, and must pass through the most defended area in the mediterranean
what year is this again?
1341
13i think
so early?
thanks
Well it fucking sucks, thanks for asking
I'd say 42 or 43
not sure
Yeah, the U Boat fleet got wiped out pretty early in the war, really
13late late 41
God, that chicken looks delicious
I think
dang i missed the chicken :(
wikipedia says 41 too
....uh oh.
Dat face.
13not a happy face
Something isn't right
oh boy
And see, that's some good acting. Just his face expresses everything you need to know.
13request to return to la rochelle and get out of the coffin boat, denied
so the big bosses are still full of victory and superiority
damn
All that bread
expressing a negative emotion facially isnt that hard though
Question is, why are they sending this boat on a suicide mission? How late in the war is this
?
13who knows
1341
late 41. the invasion in russia just got stalled
This is still in 1941. The Germans are high on hubris
Well, at least the bigwigs are
Oh, so there's still a few years yet.
At least with the world concerned with Germany
they expected to have moscov before winter
13feel really dumb that i don't remember, pearl harbor was 42 right?
So this is a bit surprising. They're sending one boat? Baffling. ._.
No, that was 41
So it already happened
13how soon after did we join in ?
yes, a few weeks ago in movie
13that might be part of it, send the u-boat to reinforce italy
It was almost immediately IIRC.
Basically right away
hitler declared war on the us right after pearl harbor
December 7th, 1941
13so it was 41
Yep
13so that's my best guess
Since at the time, the US was basically getting primed to join Britian prior to Pearl Harbor anyways
holy hell
The boot is over there stream.
See it?
Thus the whole reason the Japanese attacked: hoping to disable our fleet so we'd take longer to join the war
it's the 71st anniversary of Pearl Harbor
africa war maybe
13or that
never really ended
Germany and Italy declared war on the USa on Dec 11, 1941. we rciprocated same day
Might be. But wouldn't they want to send more than one u-boat?
13is it terribly dark for everyone or just me because of my lighting
No, it's dark
Shizuka: for me too
it is dark
13hm
It is kind of dark
but it's the picture
Think it's supposed to be.
13i turned the settings up but ja might just be the point
Shizuka: just the point
....
That's a lotta ships.
lol half
my last train goes in 45 minutes -_-
can't see the whole movie
13he said they have 12 u-boats in the atlantic, dunno where the rest of the fleet would be at the moment (surely they have more than 12)
13so might be more u-boats going in
13just not as far as our guys know
They had somewhere around 200 IIRC.
13little better?
Maybe a bit less
too much gives me a headache
Well, wait. No, this was WW2....
/me ponders
So they probably had as many as a thousand, even.
That picture
Their production rate was higher during WWII because of the huge growth in tech between WWI and WWII.
13fullscreen might help you guys if it's too dark
That much I do remember.
13dammit johann
Shit.
OH SHIT
welp dead
well shit
Is that Werner?
That blood squirt
They spotted them before they could dive.
They're screwed.
and then the Captian literally went down with the ship
great...the navigator
Wait what happened?
You know I know these guys are the "enemy"
With that many ships in the area....they're almost assuredly going to get sunk. ._.
AssaultWithEmbraces: they got spooted
And there's the captain
for the extra drama
But I want to see them LIVE DAMMIT!
also KICK ASS MUSIC
being spotted in the middle of an enemy fleet
They got spotted early on, too.
time to dive
damn he jumped down
Before they could get close enough for the long guns not to be a problem.
What happened to the dude?
uh oh
13strafed by plane up top
not THAT is going manual
Oh god.
their diveamabobber is stuck it seems
yeah they're going down
....
holy hell this is tense
They're going down much too fast.
WAY too fast
O_O
nope
13shades of lemongrab there
O_o
and that's it
/me chews her fingers intensley
game over
and here comes the crunch
the end has come
And then...BANG
Yup. Bolts blowing.
.....
:(
the journalist guy is still there?
We have maybe 45 minutes to go in the movie
That guy looks like his head is about to blow. literally
They're dead.
13bottom
I was out the last 10 minutes or so. Where are they going now?
Shit
13down
now the fun begins
ded
damn, tough luck
off the scale is bad
.....oh no.
they're NOT DEAD YET DAMMIT!
tey ded
They're gonna be stuck there, aren't they. ._.
We've reached rock bottom, guys.
saved by rock
Saved by Tom
Please, please tell me I'm wrong. Because otherwise that is the most horrifying possible way to die.
And the look of fear on their faces
CriticKitten: no idea
buried alive
13they'll come back up
german engineering
13the movie ends on the surface
of hell
oh, this CAN'T be good
Not even buried. Alive, trapped in a metal box under the water. Water slowly leaking in....
and everything bronke
Slowly?
*broke
what were they waiting for?
CriticKitten: yeah best not to think about that too hard?
*this
When I watch movies or shows what involve water or drowning I feel I can't breathe at times. Its really disturbing.
My god, the feels I'll feel at the end of this movie ;A;
I have always wondered if that is just me though =P
...
And then chat died XD
Good night everypony. Thank you all I had a wonderful birthday today! ^_^

P.S: I HATE the new Youtube layout...

hm.
they don't even translate half of the text
VerHur: Mee too. Is it just my imagination or is the sound quality different too?
Just when I get use to a Youtube Layout, They make it more confusing

So, let's review. They're trapped in a ship slowly filling with water, diesel fumes, and battery acid.
all this 280 metres below the surface
13way below rated depth
And the bolts are already popping
They didnt run out of air yet?
Oh no. That'll take time, as the diesel fumes slowly fill the cabins.
:P
CriticKitten: I know what I'd do if I were in their position: Cry like a little girl
I'd pray to celestia
I can work like a clockwork under such stress
hey
Maybe I'd try giggling at the water
hi
distracts from the fear
would that work?
1350 pfennig is 50 cents
08,01wheee
Giggle at the Ghosties doesn't apply there, Midnight_Fyre.
08,01i love Community!
nuts
They get major props for being able to even function in this situation.
But... but granny pie!
13i think johann just made up for his BSOD earlier
Midnight_Fyre: You'll be giggling at yourself because you'd be a ghostie
So the Mark went back down?
/me sits in a corner
now the engines and off she goes
13they need to get floating first
Aye.
oh, yes. important detail ^^
Which means finding a way to empty their ballist.
They obviously didn't think this through.
*ballast? I always misspell that word >.>
it's ballast
Without the draining pump, uh....not actually sure how they're gonna do that.
/me 08,01nuzzles AssaultWithEmbraces
How are some people still asleep after all that?
he's hurt
/me has no clue whats going on...
13mister nazi is starting to have a crisis of faith in the system
13notice his stubble
...
navigator half dead, comm dead, navigation equipment dead
Ah yes, eah modern movie about German military members must have a part where they question Nazism
SYMBOLISM
same here Cii
13well, again the navy was notoriously not very pro-nazi
Midnight_Fyre: To be fair, there were lots of Germans who did
true
But that partly because i missed like half the movie XD
Midnight_Fyre: some of the young authors are past that. the conservatives and the leftist still love to incantate nazi
:/
But the regime spun things so that it sounded like everyone was happy with them
(naturally)
....oh, they're having people go to sleep to try to conserve oxygen?
Seems that way
13which i guess makes sense? i'm not entirely certain how your breathing pattern works while asleep
I guess that's not a bad idea, though....not sure I'd be able to sleep not knowing if I'd wake up
13i would think you're taking deeper breaths which is bad
its alot less
is he sneakin food?
00,10your heartrate drops when sleeping
13but then most of them are using masks so balances out
Either way, I couldn't sleep under those conditions
Generally you use up less oxygen while you sleep because your body doesn't need it as badly.
13right
So in theory it's a decent idea.
13any way you slice it you're hosed though
Just not sure if it's enough, though, with the fumes.
13this is the guy that broke his ribs
Either way the diesel fumes are eating up what little oxygen you have anyways, so... :/
great I'm getting skipping
.
?
be thankful you arent these poor bastards
hi
I am
Wisdom TEETH. ALL of them.
13ow
Just because?
13glad mine have come in straight
Shizuka: hi
Shizuka: You have no idea.
Mine aren't perfect, but aren't growing out badly enough to cause problems

I'm still amazed they sent one boat alone through that strait.
with my mouth closed
so did that plane get em while they were in the strait?
My jaws are in so much pain. >_<
Sumica: infinte power?
13ha bad translation
00,10not quite
00,10some drop off
13he said closer to "that's a terrible trick"
so they were in the strait then
Still are.
13yep
I thought he was being sarcastic there
13at the bottom of the strait of gibraltar, hopefully closer to africa
man I want a pocket watch
why is journalist guy still there
They're stuck at the bottom of the strait, unable to move.
be all posh en shit yo
Kill me. >_<
....15 hours?
1315 hours at the bottom of the sea
13there's a distasteful pirate song in there somewhere
That's just....argh. I don't even want to imagine myself in that situation. How they've stayed sane is beyond me. ._.;
00,10I belive it goes In the navy~
Argh, I can't keep a damn internet connection for five minutes

Phase4: hi
And you can see clearly that the oxygen's just about run out.
Judging by their breathing.
so they're goin for teh french town regardless now?
only half a bottle?
13yep
so no answer on the PlanetSide 2 empire question?
13screw the orders, they're in no condition to get there at all
fair enough
what was their original goal?
Yeah, there's no way they could have made it even beforehand.

Obligatory; War, war never changes.
otakon, that's silly. If he's a mod, he is in the public eye. He should be exposed as a poor moderator and dealt with accordingly.

I'm getting my own house!

OtakuTom: yay! I hate moving though

Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 1 days, 8 hours, 58 minutes, 22 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
I'm only talking to him.
13Sumica: ahaa, thought so, seemed high resolution for the SCUMM era
How is that irritating?
so close!
He's getting irritated by himself, SkunkTauri
13nice and smooth
Shizuka: oh so that was a play on words?
Hi AJIsHaunter. XD
13you do!
>lurk moar
I didn't realize
we 4chan now
i see a face too
What kind of face wipergone2?
HAR HAR HAR!
XAX|BrackFlops2: isn't that #brony's purpose?
Har harr harrrrr
13arr spongebob
:p
Geez whats with the hostility tonight?
MakerDusk: o u.
no idea
Who pissed on whose cereal?
I can see a crab soundling like that.. or maybe lobsters.
AssaultWithEmbraces: Chat has its ups and downs, I guess.
Polydunami: oh?, it seems jaymo is purposely annoying him to get a reaction
13XAX|BrackFlops2: well tbf you can fit in at most channels if you just lurk for a while before jumping into conversation
I'm not trying to annoy him.
I'm just generally chatting to him.
Do you know the difference?
do you
do you?
MakerDusk: I haven't been in there that often, though.
I do.
really?
Shizuka: Fair point, madame.
I really do.
Sumica: actually Guybrush DOES sound like you a bit
Jaymo: By telling him to change his name into something specific that got someone in trouble recently?
That was yesterday.
XAX|BrackFlops2: same with me: it's well moderated, so an admin isn't usually needed
he doesnt want to talk to you, so just stop
Jaymo: Regardless.
ok?
Regardless my ass.
lol
13you have to be a foul smelling grog swilling pig in order to be a pirate?
Shizuka: yus
13couldn't you just cut out the middleman and go to demonoid?
lol
XD
Acetone?
HOLY HELL
Shizuka: but the vpn is always wise
13true
SkunkTauri, I shall do as I wish until otherwise told by a mod to not do so.
AJIsHaunter: no no wrong pirates
especially in this day and age
So good day to you.
otakon: Aw, man. :<
13but what is a vpn in our pirate analogy?
other than bronystate, i don't really participate in any other channels except that one
red dye no 2
13other countrys' flags?
that would work XD
Cozy
Shizuka: could you tell Jaymo to leave wiper alone please :)
You would resort to that, wouldn't you.
with canadians getting fined, I finally got one set up tonight
Jaymo: well if you cant stop yourself
13Jaymo: chill yo, drink some hot chocolate
^
13Sumica: BACK IN TOOOOOWN >>>
But I don't like hot chocolate. ;/
13rob paulsen!
Chocolate?
CHOCOLATE?
Jaymo: How about cold chocolate?
If this is tame, I'm afraid to ask what the otherr channels are like
night
CHOCOLAAAAAAATE
13HAHA THAT IS ROB PAULSEN
MEANWHILE
oh yes paint Jaymo aas the enmy when wipers the one who told him to go die for no eason
Dat Meanwhile.
13i knew it right from the "uh sir"
That sounds like the guy who voiced Piglet
ikr SpeccyRush?
THAT VOICE!
13that's so him
Logic is lost.
13pinky
IT'S STANLEY IPKISS
NARF!
Glad to be dead
lol
13he's got that back of the throat resonance that gives him away
Shine on Bronystate, shine on.
Never change.
tm
Jaymo: you told him to do something bannable
oh what?
whoa what happened?
13wonder if because i was on so long?
13well... no that wouldn't be it
stream die for anyone else?
But he didn't do it.
yeah it died for me
otakon: It did for me.
13yeah he's resetting since we're behind
So therefore it doesn't matter.
Sumica said the stream was far behind
Shizuka: oh
Quit trying sprinkle.
Shizuka: I thought it was just me
It is worthless and pathetic.
I had to refresh at times so that I could keep up
13oh maybe that's it, i never have fmle minimized while live
13just hides behind irssi on screen two
Polydunami: same here thoght it was my net acting up is all
Aww. no available surveys.
13also xkcd today is eeeevil
Jaymo: can you just stfu already?
AND WE'RE BACK
13resumed now
Na.
Jaymo: But the fact that you tried to make him do something bannable must be put into consideration as well.
I really don't feel like it.
13settle down guys and watch the classic classic game
^
what eyjey said
I am
He asked what happens when you change your name to it, I simply told him to go ahead and try it.
cept it's not bannable anymore
I didn't force him.
AMATEURS
And that.
So therefore I'm not in the wrong.
I remember that
13ama-ters? you pronounce the "t" like a "ch"
I just simply told him he could do that.
Jmo: dude, just move ON
Tell these tossers to move on, they're continuing it.
13speaking of would that mean "amateur" is descended from french or something?
8,05jmo: let it drop, everyone else: stop feeding the troll and let it drop
otakon: this is the part where you stop trying
SpeccyRush: a guy with that name got banned yesterday, had he changed his name he couldve gotten klined by accident
Jmo: you're worse than I am at the moment when it comes to being stubborn
13maker broke out the colors!
=-=
blixie_sprinkle: that's the actual guy
Oh my I feel so special.
thank you MakerDusk lol
Sven?
I'll drop it, and on the contray I'm not a troll.
uh huh
13sven svensen of the svenland svensens
Shit gets serious when MakerDusk mods bronystate
You know shit's serious when the IRCops show colors
MakerDusk: he's not a troll, he's an aussie
herdminnnnnnd
SpeccyRush: but the point is that if he changed his name to it, he couldve been banned because they would think its him again
LOL
What time does the lottery close? Midnight-ish?
U mad MakerDusk?
I did drop it.
So what the hell?
Kinixys: sorry you missed it alrady
Kinixys: 8 PM EST, I think.
good evening everypony
Kinixys: ended Thursday
Bah!
13Kinixys: we generally set it to midnight friday, which comes in at 6ish pm thursday night
blixie_sprinkle: ou may think the mods are that dumb, but they're not
Wow I picked a horrid time to hang around Bronystate
Spectre: why ou say that?
So how's that weather going
MakerDusk: recalculate then, Jmo be an awesome dude
/me 08,01steals Shizuka
Nice and sunny in Australia.
SpeccyRush: i dont think mods memorize every ip, he couldve came in a few hours later, and get banned
13was just looking for you X3
Otakon: Because I notice quite a bit of tension in here
what on earth is being streamed?
Spectre: eh some minor butthurt from another chat is all really
blixie_sprinkle: you obviously don't pay attention to mod banter then if you still think that
AppleBloom: Monkey Island, if I recal.
someone doesnt know when to drop and argument
AppleBloom: it's The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition

wow lol KrazyNoobs
/me hugs Shizuka
LOL, what is this game, when was it made, and h҉ow much money did they lose off it? O_o
AFK
҉҉
KrazyNoobs: Monkey Island, quite a while ago, and it was quite a success.
KrazyNoobs: What's wrong with clopperS? I'm a clopper. So what. It's my damn life and I'll live it however I like to. I don't see how masturbating to a pony is any different than watching porn or something. I'm not a pedophile I just have different sexual interests. Why shouldn't I do what makes me feel good?
welp
lol textwall
I never said anything about cloppers... today, that is...
13MysteryMare: Not appropriate. At all.
GALDOLF
It was 4 days ago I even mentioned cloppers, Kencolt.
SORRY KENCOLT, I mean MysteryMare
KrazyNoobs: Wrong person. Sorry.
13hey sumi
13i think none shall pass
13dunno where i get this idea though
Shizuka: I know it's not appropriate. But I'm just so damn sick of people getting into my OWN DAMN PERSONAL BUSINESS!
MysteryMare: AWWWWWKWAAAAAAA҉AAAAAR҉D
Um... there was a stuffed something in the church that was one of the things he mentioned.
13then don't share your personal business, and ignore them when they want to pry
pass
^
13heeeeeey he wasn't a real troll
I love having strep throat :<
hes a jedi
a red herring
oh man
i like this
jedi trolls
thatmakeshim even moreof a troll
dat Grog sing
soulrider95: yay im not the only sick person
13"previously owned"
mmmm Grog
13== stolen
And when I'm sick I can't fall asleep :(
KrazyNoobs: I apologize to you Noobs
i dont sleep alt all
I can see that this game, to be successful, had to be made somehwere in that time, because nobody knew what a great game was (although NES and SNES were around, so I am a little confused)... If it were in this era that the game was created, it would have lost money instead of gained it, but, if it was made in the 90s, it probably was cutting-edge for its time.
teax wall
soulrider95: hm theres stuff you can buy to help you sleep if sickness is getting in the way
08,01any vegetarians in?
Thanks MysteryMare, apology accepted. I tolerate cloppers, so I was confused
KrazyNoobs: ;)
KrazyNoobs: This is back when good games were made..... and this is a wonderful game...
13i'm a humanitarian
Honest way? Guybrush, you're a pirate, don't you remember?
Shizuka: You eat people
13well duh
13i'm a purple people eater
MysteryMare: you dont
Lol
soulrider95 I never played it, so I don't know. I probably won't play it, but if you say it's a wonderful game, I'll believe you. My favourite games were in the 90s
geeky-egg: Only on the sabbath.
MysteryMare: lol

Though we all know the best game ever made was super metroid soooooooooooooooo
08,01have any of you ever had textured vegetable protein chunks?
Grog must be the Coke of this world
VIKING
08,01they're generally dry and you add water
/me 08,01uses them in curry sometimes
08,01i just ate some
Textured...protein chunks...
/me eats only bacon and souls
sounds delicious>_>
/me only eats other ducks .-.
08,01i discovered my parents still had some left over from when i was last a vegetarian (5 years ago)
AdamTheDuck: you monster! D:
balls extra
oh my gawd!! Monkey Island!!!
08,01KrazyNoobs: RP?
pirots arnt polite
I think I'm going to have an involuntary protein spill.
-> /me does not always imply RP
I love it when that "italic text with /me before it" is coloured, because of the use of it by an admin.
ADDD
/me still likes white RP
/me hit his head on keyboard
08,01KrazyNoobs: it's called action text
Oh so that's how you do it
Ah, okay. I thought it was RP. Are RP and "action text" the same thing?
13lol
13that persuasion
I could be a vegetarian if I wanted to, but vegan? no way.
its not KrazyNoobs
What is RP then?
role play
I love egg drop soup waaaaaayyyy too much
KrazyNoobs: the act of roleplaying
Let me guess... is google a friend at this point of time?
ok then
How appropriate, You fight like a cow!
Insult swordfighting , best ever
DA MACHINE
/me is happy that "action text" is not bannable.
KrazyNoobs: well no, rp is the act of roleplaying,/ me is just /me, roleplaying doesnt have to be /me
monky
comeat me bro
:D
KrazyNoobs: Actually, it is if you useruse it. It can be considered spam.
13HO HAHA DODGE TURN PARRY
trixie_sprinkle: but people normally use action text for RP, as I see most of the time. Thanks everypony
*overuse
:D
0_0
:D
AJIsHaunter: Just like sym҉bols... okay
lol I'm reading those spash screens as the spongebob narrators voice
oh my
so many hours later, that the old narrator got old and retired so we had to hire a new one
ooh
well kindalike , making love is more like thrust , thrust , thrust ....
13HOW APPROPRIATE
How appropriate, you fight like a cow
13YOU FIGHT LIKE A COW
or Zalgo. I think Zalgo (where it covers other people's text) should be banned. I hate Zalgo, but when used appropriately, ҉ the ҉resul҉t can be interesting
moo
meep
how apropriate , you fight like a cow
I am rubber
You are glue
wait, no
00,02So's your mother
Should have picked the last one.
YOUR MOTHER WAS A HAMSTER
See?

AND YOUR FATHER SMELT OF ELDERBERRIES
SEE!?
/me needs a dispenser here
youre just a chicken, cheep cheep cheep
seams legit
fight some pirates
ITS TIME
Buytoast: nope
Z̷algo sorta enhances text when used properly, but I REALLY REALLY hate those a------- who make it go up and down, causing every comment two rows both ways to be blocked and unread-able.
Z̷
THETH
lol
Oh my GLOB
Er mah glerb
AJIsHaunter: is batman

AJIsHaunter: you vare batman

AJIsHaunter: idk

Z̷

huzzah
KrazyNoobs: Lol
13enough zalgo kthx
ctulutu
*throws out shovels everywhere*
13people tend to corrupt my terminal when they do it
NO....yes
Oh, sorry Shizuka.
YES
13though so far you haven't
13which is good
no
ni
Haven't done what?
corrupt the terminal, KrazyNoobs
Oh, okay.
You could answer almost anything with "Not since the accident."
umm ok then
poor deformed man
:<
MahBoi777: MAHBOOIIII
/me sneaks up behing MahBoi777 and GLOMP
At least my laptop has a decent amount of music on it
If I DO Zalgo, I don't do the f---ed up five-row-spanning and spamming crap that people do.
13oooouch X3
/me hugs geeky-egg and trixie_sprinkle tight "HAI! :)"
Why you little...
damn

hi MahBoi777
/me /me
/me hugs MahBoi777
13get some ointment for that burn
hi NocturnalBlade
Hi, MahBoi777. :)
KrazyNoobs: well you shouldnt do any zalgo here, because it can be harmful
Okay, but I don't have a burn. >:)
wat
hey AJIsHaunter!^^
If it harms anything revolving BronyState.net, it would be my pleasure to give it up on this channel.
its ossible if theres not much rolling friction
the burn thing was about the stream not directed to you KrazyNoobs
*possible
and if the rope doesnt bend in too much
I know, I was just making a rude comment.
13KrazyNoobs: nah, zalgo text just wreaks havoc on text rendering
Okay, but I'll still stop if it is looked down upon here.
how does zalgo do that with text anyway
13danke sehr
http://eeemo.net/ don't bring any of that here, please, but in that link are your answers
i thought letters had to be from one of the preset libraries, how can zalgo change the text
someone forgot about the no non-image links during stream
MahBoi777: http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw767_mahboi.jpg
you spin me right round~
trixie_sprinkle: lol
ah yeah I have my chillwave on here :D
13HOW APPROPRIATE
13YOU FIGHT LIKE A COW
ha
13we need like
13a studio audience show
DAMN YOU ADDD
13and we need that to be an audience callback
Oh yeah?
hm
geeky-egg: O U :D
13like get a crowd to shout it :3
your witty banter is no match, surrender!
MahBoi777: who me
geeky-egg: Adblock is your friend. :)
trixie_sprinkle: ZALGO is just the excessive use of these characters that are added onto regular letters, such as accent-e or stuff like that. Accented letters are normally regarded to as one character, but really, they are 2 bites, and therefore, have two characters. If you were to take that character, its function is to go above whatever it is ordered, to. on http://eeemo.net/ if you click Toggle Reference Sheet, they have a list of these charact
o.o
Dat wall
geeky-egg: yes you, silly
AJIsAwesome: no i dont trust it
MahBoi777: you silly
hm thats interesting, thanks KrazyNoobs
trixie_sprinkle you're welcome. :)
oh ayh
This fight scene is SO EPIC!!! *me goosebumpsta*
Shizuka: Get the whole chat into a skype call and have it in the background when someone is streaming. Have them laugh like a studio audience when something funny is said.
13X3
That escalalted quickly. >_>
Brb
brb
13well, i think we've tried coordinating things like that
XAX|BrackFlops2: :D
13but lag between stream and call makes things hard
Oh. True.
Stream lag...
I'm like... 10 seconds behind, usually
Oh, that was a good one.

Goodnight BronyState. :) Enjoy the Sumistream.
Gold_Demona: I KNEW someone would get the reference ;v;
Hello Bronystate! Helping my mom, an-OOH MONKEY ISLAND! :$
AdamTheDuck: that sucks, have a good one.
Oh.... pressed human skull. I get it. Heh, turns out I actually DO have one of those.
Ohai MadSurge, bye MadSurge :P
hello MadSurge
days?
This sounds like it was made by the same people that made the Kings Quest series.
'ello, MadSurge
Days pass and in that time no one thought to go find Guybrush.
Hai MadSurge :3
They've literally been doing nothing for days.
holy monkey bladders batman!
Worst. Crew. Ever
A pirate that can't swim? Interesting.
Gold_Demona: who should I pick as a B/W 2 starter? :D
again. Pirates. Don't do anything :v
Who needs to wim when you can hold breath for 10 minutes?
*swim
MadSurge: Whoever you like the best. lol. I picked the piggy and named her Bacon. :>
What kind of frickin cannon is this.
It's a Monkey Cannon
Use the gunpowder on it.
Oh geez, it really IS just like Kings Quest. XD
use breathmints in meathooks drink
Make a fishing hook out of Meathooks hand, catch a fish with hard scales, use the scales like tinder and strike the fuse with them.
Convuluted....
It's leaking...
well I be tired, night everybody
Chat's rusted shut.
'Night, AppleBloom.
Husband! Stop texting me! You're supposed to be working! D:<
NOOOOOO, really. The pot is hot :T
night, AppleBloom
Set the map alight.
Does this game have a bajillion funny ways to die, too?
Fire the compass so they have to go find it to get back.
Tell me I'm not the only one getting a Kings Quest vibe from this game... >.>
Gold_Demona: they were rivals at the time
Ooooh
The banana is yellow. NAAAAAAWWWWWWW.
Gold_Demona: this game has the advntage that you can never get stuck or die in dick moves :D
Now I know what you where all thinking "Where is Random we are lacking awsomeness without him he is so greater than us we are lost without him!" But have no fear. I HAVE RETURNED!
Yeah, cuz he game looks REALLY similar to the later Kings Quest games.
Who're you.
back again
hello, aniderp
So who's streaming this fine night?
Wryyyyyyyyyyy http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354877427681.gif
Who're you?
Gold_Demona: to compensate the game has somewhat less logical puzzles :D
TheRandomkid321: Actually, we were all thinking "A sandwich might be nice. Soup too. POssibly some tea."
MadSurge: lol
TheRandomkid321, the mod who will probably be streaming all night tomorrow night: Sumica.
I heard fluttershy! Anyone else hear that?
Gold_Demona: it's still a very fun game though
Kndarihu So I notice Wrek is apparently not in the chat bar... isn't he just about always there?
it smells the new
Gold_Demona: you should try Day of the Tentacle too :D
i shall become famous one day!
TheRandomkid321 people do tend to have things to do on weekdays
aniderp|bestcakeever, what are you doing?
are there any famous photographers?
MadSurge: Day of the what now? O.o

Kandarihu: Sumica.
I gotta head out. See you guys later for movie night!
Gee, I told someone that it was Sumica streaming, only because I thought I heard his voice at the beginning.
/me slaps himself around a bit with a VERY large Seapony.
SuperBrony64 ima drunk

Speaking of Movie night, my mother wants to vote in the lottery even though she doesn't use the IRC.
aniderp|bestcakeever, you can query yours to me~

11,02;3;
Well at the moment I'm having fun with Planetside 2.
SuperBrony64 i astol your beer
Meanwhile: I c, that game looks fun
It's free if you want to give it a go.
00,10Dont realy matter what she calls her self
to me PLanetside 2 looks like any other FPS
Alright. I'm just worried that she'll go by a nick that nobody recognizes, and everyone will ask "who's this person who picked this movie"?
00,10well you realy cant change much in an FPS with out changing it away from an FPS
If you mean you have guns and you shoot people then yeah it's exactly like ever other fps.
Your insight is truly astounding.
hold on i will get my fc again
Meanwhile, for someone like me, Planetside 2 is even more different than it is for you. It just takes me to a web page saying Error Code G25. So no PS2 for me.
who was the other person who wanted me to add?
That blows.
CrystalPhoenix: what is yours?
you wanted me to add?
SuperBrony64: you there?
mica
can you play me1?
;_;
Sumica, the genre isn't really that narrow. It's gone through an amazing level of evolution since Castle Wolfenstein. Pretty much the only thing that's the same is that you're seeing everything from the characters eyes while shooting stuff, usually (but not always) enemies.
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: You going to give it to me?
i pm'd to you o.O

I've had enough of oz for the morning and I have a job to go to
Have fun.
good bye everyone
WHERE IS EVERYPONY!?
I'm lonely... :'(
Thanks for that bit of information.
Yay, somepony's online!
Wow... I have a part of this to myself.
...
D̶O̶ ̶ A̶L̶L̶ ̶ T̶H̶E̶ ̶ Z̶A̶L̶G̶O̶!̶ Follow the rules. :)
That was meant to be crossed out, showing I wasn't going to do that.
Who am I talking to?
:[
Gold_Demona: still here?
aniderp|bestcakeever: Eeyup
Just lurkin'
sea ponies!
speaking of..
YAY!!! REAL PEOPLE
/me grabs someone to dance to sea ponies
5
Sea ponies ftw
I would have to admit, if sea ponies were ressurected, they should make it more of an epic episode than a marketing scheme.
KrazyNoobs, I hope it doesn't happen in the cartoon.
Gold_Demona: I went for Snivy again, he served me well in the other game :D he's "Sir Lagart" this time :D
MadSurge: Awesome =)
I like Snivey. He's cool.
But I have a special place in my heart for Bacon. :>
Gold_Demona: none of the g5 starters are really lame :D
MadSurge: The only one I have a problem with is Oshawott, because his design had a HORRIBLE first impression on me.
Kandarihu They should at least make them awesome if they did do that.
Gold_Demona: :D well at least he becomes a samurai ocelot :D
Talking about Pokemon, ay?
My first thought was that he looked like one of those squeaky clown toys.
samurai ocelot? >.>
Gold_Demona: :D were there any clown mons now that I think of it?
Mr. Mime
Gold_Demona: mimes and clowns are not the same :D
A mime is a type of clown
Gold_Demona: the last evolution of Oshawott looks like it's wearing a samurai armor
*u
MadSurge: Yeah, but I'm not seeing the "ocelot" part...
Gold_Demona Sorry to butt in to your conversation, but Oshawott, in my opinion, is the best starter, because Samurott is strong, relatively quick (base speed of 80) and has a wide range of moves. (I hate Serperior because of it's small range of moves, knowing Normal, Grass, two Poison attacking moves and one Dragon (Dragon Tail, lame move). Emboar is slow. Everyone has different opinions, but, if I have the chance, Oshawott is my first pick.
It doesn't look like a cat...
!cd
Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 1 days, 2 hours, 53 minutes, 37 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
KrazyNoobs: AAHH!!!
Hi every pony :)
Hi Socks
KrazyNoobs: I want quickness, therefore Snivy is my choice. :D
Holy textwall, Batman!
What is the discussion of choice today? :P
And that's a good choice too, I just prefer Oshawott. As stated by me previously, everyone has different opinions, and in some cases, Serperior can be helpful if you are versing Rock, Water and Ground types.
I like the visual design of Generation 5 starters, but not the moves and stats so much.
Statwise all the starters are really good in their own right. I usually just go with the one I like the most personally.
I'm usually not after a specific stat, so long as it's strong in the stat they're best at.
Oshawott has grown on me as I've seen more pictures of it, particularly from the anime. It was just that first impression that put me off. =/
Gold_Demona: yeah really. I give no crap about metagame, I like Snivy because he's smug :3
lol
I like Treecko in gen 3 for the same reason. XD
Gold_Demona I used to do that before I became mad with EV Training, IV breeding and Move Selecting, sometimes breeding with moves. Have you ever tried to get Snatch in a Druddigon? It took me excessive hours of gameplay to get it to know it. Before I did this, I followed my heart, and did want I wanted to do. Obsessing over the EVs and crap like that has made the game, somewhat, less enjoyable, so I see where you are coming from. If you want to fol
KrazyNoobs: AH!!! Again with the giant wall of text!!!
wow dat wall
tl;dr version?
I love walls.
KrazyNoobs: Gens 1 through 4 are exactly the same for me. :D
My fav Gen 5 Pokemon is Mienshao. HUGE attack, HUGE speed, it's perfect.
http://www.fimfiction-static.net/images/story_images/68142.png?1354783344 have some ponies in socks
My faves from Gen 5 are Archeops, Krookodile, and the electric spider that evolves from Joltik. :>
Which is rare, because I'm not fond of most bug types.
*WALL OF TEXT, LOL* Gold_Demona: Awesome. I actually liked none of the Gen 3 Pokemon when they were first shown, but I liked Treecko. I also only thought Snivy was cool after they revealed the silhouttes, but then after more offical information was released, I liked Oshawott. Tepig still doesn't work out well for me.
scyther is best bug
Scizzor is better :>
Accelgor is best bug
dead is best bug
No, sorry, DURANT is best bug.
RoboGerbil: You made me laugh, congratulations.
Anypony else like Mienshao?
I think out of thre three gen 5 starters, The pig is the cutest in first form, but as far as the higher forms, I'm not impressed with any of them. =/
designwise I mean
Mienshao's the one that looks like "Ninja Winnie the Pooh" right?
Anypony else like Mienshao?
Or is that the other one...
Oh wait, no. That's Mienfu
Mienfu is Ninja Pooh
Gold_Demona http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mienshao_(Pok%C3%A9mon)
Ok, yeah. Mienshao is the evolved form
Yeah, that one looks cool
but those 4 would carry me through the 8 gyms
I was thinking of Mienfoo. ^^;
Or try to fish for one in the Safari zone. :D
in Pokemon Black and White 2
I don't like catching pokemon already evolved. =/
i hvant played the gen 5's
I like getting them in their first forms and raising them up myself. :>
I catch them at any stage, I breed them, get the right nature, right IVs, and then I EV train them to their maximum potiential.
thats way too involved
^
I won FIRST in the Autumn Tournament for Pokemon Black and White in 2010, with the name, TATTERS.
Thanks to EV training. It is really helpful
congrats, you have no life outside of pokemon...
RoboGerbil I have a degree in Marine Biology, and a job maintaining and designing the tanks at UnderWater World Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia. Is that not enough?
EV training is too tedious for me. I'd rather just play.
KrazyNoobs: wow you mastered the pokemon breeding in fishtanks too? /troll
Sometimes, I download ROMS, and don't even bother EV Training. The lack of EV training reminds me of when I was a kid, aimlessly playing these games. It was so much fun!
To be honest, EV training sometimes sucks the fun out of everything.
I wouldn't say it's aimless. I aim to beat the game. =P
And then I don't really care after that.
pfft and how do you know when you beat it?
Aimless as in training the Pokemon PERFECTLy, just catching random ones, using legendaries against the Elite Four. Sometimes, that is fun.
is your defenition of beat when the credits roll? cuz in gen 4-5 thats just the first half
When HeartGold and SoulSilver came out, I bought both, I played HG seriously, and SS, I just messed around. It was fun.
I never use legendaries.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YME40ObCkVI
I use legendaries when I am messing around, but I train my team properly when not. My Gen 5 B2W2 team is Mienshao, Krookodile, Haxorus, Cinccino, Starmie and Crobat.
Suddenly random irrelevant link
I hyper beam everything to death.
lol that random link
Dafuq was in dat link
Bronysith Thanks for breaking our conversation, LOL
i think its none piece episode 5
but i cant tell
Meanwhile I don't use Hyper Beam. It is a special Normal Type, which isn't the best, and you have to recharge, unless you are holding the Saphron Quilt, (that's its japanese name, not sure about English, google is my friend)
are those hay bacon strips?
KrazyNoobs: I named my red Gyrados HYPERBEAM and then cloned him 5 times.
That should give you an example of how I regard pokemon.
here have another random link www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba58GJv9SA4
u mean Gyarados
...
I found one shiny before, and it was a Gyarados in Pokemon Pearl. I was so proud of myself, but when HGSS came out, I was mad.
more like gayrados
heartgold?
Gyarados* pardon me.
Meanwhile: call them all guyra
soul silver?!
hm
So much pokemon.
umg
And this was in Gold, before shinies were even a thing.
PokeState.net
HAY BACON STRIPS
OH YEAH?
Yes.
The prince is having a ball!
Doom was my Pokemon. I don't share any of your feelings. ;_;
/me slaps Ninjazz with a steel pipe
Come on, use Mienshao. Even for fooler-around-ers, it is an awesome Pokemon that is utterly underated.
I haven't played any pokemon past Gold, so I really have no idea.
Meanwhile: shinies were a thing in the original gold and silver
"Flutterlu Underated"
Flutterly*
BEST POKEMON in my opinion (non-legendary, non-psuedo-legendary): Gen 1: Alakazam
SpeccyRush: There was like, one red Gyarados. Which I had.
Gen2: Crobat
Gen 3: Milotic
Bye everypony~
Gen 4: Floatzel
One of us is missing...
Gen 5: Mienshao
@ChickenCall who is it?
And KrazyNoobs, stop naming worst pokemon!
:(
what we all doing>
idk
>.>
Seriosly, Meinshoa can go eat a dick >: (
<.<
hello :3
The 7 Flaws of TomSKa made me cry T_T
sup
Meanwhile: yeah, but gen 2 was when shinys were introduced, there was the gyarados which was always shiny there was that egg from the daycare people which had a 50% chance of being shiny when hatched and then there was the 1 in 8142 or so chance of any wild pokemon you encountered being shiny
why havnt i seen this yet... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM5lg0xv3gk
It sucks when an admin says that, and you cannot argue back. :'(
SpeccyRush: Consider my 14 year old self educated.
*Vaporeon
both epic
all eeves suck
Guys i think im the youngest here cuz im 11 years old :P
XD
Espeon is best Eevolution, stat-wise
DitzyDerpy15 well you arent supposed to be here
I like ponies dude
vapouron epic health and 2 epic passives
leafeon is junk, never make one
DitzyDerpy15 Don't admit that here, you'll get kicked for 3 years. T_T
If you're 11 you're too young to be in this chat.
Begone.
14 is the "legal" age
so i cant watch livestreams T_T
Why can't you be like everyone else and lie about your age?
DitzyDerpy15: get the fuck out
If the legal age was enforced several people here would be kicked.
You can watch live-streams, the chat is just restricted
dah gotta head back to something else
DitzyDerpy15: Just change your username, and start fresh
good bye
bye, DitzyDerpy15, have a good one. :'(
Aww look, now you done scared him away from this chat... we could of aught him things...
>Archeops
Get out.
Archeops is awesome
Scoot-Scootaloo you are a bad person and you should feel bad.
Damn, admin disagrees, *goes into hiding mode*
Meanwhile: Says the cynical bastard<3
I'm required to by laws of cynicism.
You're both bad persons.
Archeopteryx was always one of my favorite prehistoric "birds", and I was so happy when they came out with a pokemon of it. :D
well Meanwhile is pretty much the worst person ever
people*
I know what I said.
best derpy evar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xtC5S_tza4
what happen to the youtube layout..?
Allo Snow
Archeops is a good Pokemon, the highest in base total of any non-legendary. Did you know that the Base Stat Total of Archeops (567) is the same as its National Pokedex number? Your argument is invalid.
valoreins|Drawing: it is now shit again
dang it
haxorus ftw
I don't even know what Archeops is.
KrazyNoobs: That's awesome :D
KrazyNoobs: If ONLY it wasn't screwed over by its ability
anyone here played on pokemon showdown?
highest attack stat off all
Scoot-Scootaloo: I know! That's the only thing I don't like about it! D:
Scoot-Scootaloo: id rather have a haxorus :P
It has a really crappy ability. Why do they even MAKE abilities like this? >_<
SuperBrony64
http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/lobby
Now then... tests ahoy
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo!
EWWWW youtube layout :|
@Scoot-Scootaloo: I was just about to mention that ability... that is what brings it down, but it's base speed of 110 combined with it's amazing attack can make a good first-hit on an opponent... but really, it is no long-lasting Pokemon, so I see where you are coming from, Scoot-Scootaloo
fml pokemon
streamstuck?
It's the only reason I don't actually have an Archeops on my team. :<
pony_3045: There is no stream
no sound

Ooh, refresh

IMA FIRING MAH LAZOR
BOOOOOOOOM
How's everyone doing? :P
I <3 THIS SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID
doing gine, HavokPhone
i still love it :D
Dark92Enigma same here
I miss this
I loved this show when it was fresh. I don't think it really aged well, though.
Just like Spongebob. Season 1 and 2 were awesome, a movie was made, and then the new Spongie is complete bs
HONESTY... AJ, is that you?
there was a BRONY!
:O
KrazyNoobs: IMO all 3 seasons were awesome, the movie was awesome, and mostly everything related to Spongebob is BS
SFTER THAT
AFTER*
(right now)
KrazyNoobs: i dunno if you get the idea
The movie was crap in my opinion, it didn't make me laugh, and it was more geared towards 6 year olds than the entire family. I loved before the movie though. One of the most brilliant moments in animation history
lol the Tick towers over everybody. XD
I never saw the movie of this.
Hey, it's this show I never saw!
Plus, I miss Spongebob Squarepants's old character. He was a confident and hardworking sponge. In the new spongebob, he is just a mindless and stupid character who, on accident but way too constant, wrecks Squidward's life.
Eww
dat rod
/me cries
d--do went into the hole
ADVENTURE
TIME
*finntrollface.png*
This animation reminds me of the Angry Beavers
Well, do I need to know anything about this show?
NAH REALLY?!
whuuuuuut is this ? o.O
The Tick
It's the Pyro union!
:D
xD
An old retro show that is rarely shown anymore
lol They even talk like Pyro XD
mmmmmmmmmmfp hfhp hfp hphfphfphfhf m
Gold_Demona: that's right :D
Oh no! Plaid! My one weakness! DX
is it allowed to use the w#f (t) word?
KrazyNoobs: well granted the movie isn't as funny as the series. but i lked the message they were going for
pyro fused with spy
Arcium: we're adults, we won't be scandalized :D
The message was, "No, I'm the greates manager in the WOOOOOORLD"
Time to play episode backwards?
BACKWAAAAAAAAAAAARDS
:DD
YAAAY BACKWARDS SONG :D
yay
vagipony
some kind*
KrazyNoobs: ...wut?
TF2 reference
Dark92Enigma-: If you listen closely, you'll here "Cheers to my sweet Satan"
^
Fluttershy said, "Brainwash adults with cuteness"
isnerfnerf
"fuck this girls, the situation is hopeless, we're getting every spoil we can and then run away!"
It's backwards, so it's about destroying the Crystal Empire by distorting their history.
sounds like Japanese
oh god
the tick
"the Babbling Criminals" :D
o.o
Rose`Kitty: You got a PROBLEM with that? >: (
HA, mayor Blank :D
The Tick was part of my childhood, f--- you Rose'Kitty
KrazyNoobs: lol...no, when SB was about to lose, he said: ''you are what you are, and nothing can change it......but that's ok because i've done what other kid couldn't do'' yeah, you're right :D
:O NOT CLOWNS
/me cries in the corner
/me hugs aniderp|bestcakeever
don't cry
batch, did i not add a smiley face, Scoot-Scootaloo?
Nope
oh, okay then
Naturally, the only thing he has that transforms is his sofa. And it transforms into a bed.

BOOOOOOOOOOOM
WTF BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

plots *snickers*
this is a plot based show
Why can't there be a Tick fandom...
Dark92Enigma-, the proper term is nigh-invulnerable.
lolled
Scoot-Scootaloo: there used to be but that shows like 20 years old
Scoot-Scootaloo: can't we form part of it?
this looks like a job for Scoot-Scootaloo
RoboGerbil, actually, it becomes more episodic for the most part iirc.
Bronytick?
It's a cult fandom. Like Gargoyles. >.>
Scoot-Scootaloo Fandoms are for media that are currently being generated, and if a show stopped being made a decade or two ago, there is no use in a fandom.
gargoyles is so meh
Scoot-Scootaloo: and you get a hug
Oh, I love this one.
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
OBJECTION!
objection
why is it so laggy
Scoot-Scootaloo: from what i could tell, it still has a cult following to this day
RoboGerbil: Because ponies
to be fair there wasn't enough communication media like we have now to form a Tick fandom decades ago
thereis pedophile dancing on teh table
OBJECTION
/me shoots pony_3045

The evil midnight bomber what bombs at midnight!
Ropes, Bombs
guise, I was on /b/... I found some posts about invading brony streams. Will they actually do anything?
dat Bison
Really, I'll link the post
OF COURSE
Eeyes!
ONLY ON THE HUB
KrazyNoobs, threads of that nature are among the few things that are not allowed on /b/. I hope you reported those threads.
MY FACE IS MY SHIED
Oh, I will report them. They are talking about BronyStream4, and hacking it to enrage /mlp/
Dark92Enigma what have you been up to
Nothing about BronyState mentioned, though. :)
alexxm: been good.......waiting until movie night
It's already been reported, lol
Dark92Enigma jurrisac park and rat race right?
alexxm: yep
BARRY
BarryBarryBarryBarry
at least its not barney
..veryveryvery special somepony
BerryBerryBerryBerry
bombs
alexxm: OH YEAH. this is gonna be good
Will they still do anything? There have been enough hacks already, that Discord one, that wierd dancing brown ball and that little black kid screaming about KFC. I hope those losers stop hacking our streams.
KrazyNoobs: To them I say: COME AT ME BRO
They won't do shit~
DRIVE SAFELY
NGAA still says they are at war.
Fuck the GNAA!
KrazyNoobs, the only hack I know of was the dancing orange and the IT'S HAPPENING macro.
err, don't quote me on that..
lol air freshener
dat air freshner
/me carries Scoot-Scootaloo to bed
WTF
BOOOOOOOOOOM
poor talking dog
Sidekick Lounge is expendable.
...then again, it's destruction would mean that the sidekicks are treated with dignity.
There was a Discord one at the same time as the dancing orange, and on MAgic Duel on this other livestream, BronyStream4, i think it was, a GIF of this little black kid looking happy with KFC edited into the images was played with a really racist rapping song. T_T
TL;DR
barry isnt rainbow
Enough talk about hackers, they have no life and they just try to enrage us.
Don't use Mips, done :D
wuss necks?
KrazyNoobs: just like (most of) the trolls
holy shit
THEY DIDNT HACK
http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f66/PhoeKun/taste_the_rainbow_by_atomicfireball-n1298378864290.jpg
KrazyNoobs, I see. If it happened two weeks in a row, they'll try again. Let's just see if they can hack USTREAM.
And we have youtube uploads in an hour anyway, so it's a lost cause :D
I know, but I want to see it at the time it is released.
MadSurge, an hour later isn't live, though.
mister rogers
Kandarihu: like I care, I come here for the people now :D
by the way, no spoilers yet for S3E6, i find that wierd. I think they are doing something special for us, and many other bronies think that, while others think that they just want to prevent disappointment... it's odd, really...
if thinking makes your mind garden grow
it would be a f*cking jungle in my mind
MadSurge, if we become dependant on non-live sources, we'll be vulnerable to spoilers.
Mine is an overgrown mess

That was hilarious actually.
