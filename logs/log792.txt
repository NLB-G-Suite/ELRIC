Some people just want to see the stream burn...
I'm abit curious abou the foreleg max- but it can be hard because of style differences?
Needs to lighten up and just enjoy what's on.
^
As thou are taking time from their day to stream whatever is on.

ahh
cause- this really depends a bit on style and preference- but horse forelegs are a bit complicated sometimes-
Yeah agreed

You like underlining text too, ay?
09,01That said we're pretty much rigging the votes and that's soemthing I seriously don't like
yup
it's awful
you can vote multiple times, just refresh
yeah
0_o
O_O
naw, i voted for the last airbender
:>
Dat abuse of Medical supplies
oh nvm
people are voting for horses in some online poll
celestia is best horse
queen horse is far from being good
now yellow quiet
there's a horse you can get behind
?
korra is overrated
I'm going to.
dont
do
it
09,01OH LORD
What's the problem with it?
I just voted once
uh oh
What's the point?
OH BOY
Fine, I only voted 14 times, I'll stop
Oh, my.
Six hours of meditation.
O_o
If you don't want me to, I can see where you are coming form.
*from
oh man
What's the point in making it win if it doesn't deserve it?
Let's move on now
Nice pyrramid
one person with a voting script could win the vote
Suddenly, I begin to burst out laughing.
they get to say that it was the best
they'll grasp at anything
09,01YU-HEL-OH
ANYTHING
Oh gawd
*it's
oh man
09,01OH LORD
Dat epic suit
I'd like to think we aren't part of they
09,01OH LORD

Same with Legend of Korra
But truly, South Park is best animation
Lawl
*COOOOOL
....
oh man
korra is entirely overrated
it's too much
End of conversation, let's please move on from this stupid argument.
I ma, play some operation Raccoon city
*Agree
legend of korra aint all that good
Define where you think people rank it and I'll tell you if that's too high.
09,01problem with Korra: too much emphasis on shipping over plot
09,01plot is good but DAMN
09,01it's not a romance show, don't try to make it one
Ehhh...
Eh, it wouldn't win if people actually played fair, I'm pretty sure.
WORLD DOMINATION!!
and south park
>biggest fandom
Y-You monster
Not likely
Also fair as in one vote each
Rather than all the people going around voting 100 times
clones wars is kind of meh
Most fans of other shows aren't ridiculous enough to do that
BUTCHER WOMAN!

Why did I just say that....

:3*
I don't mind people voting for their favorite show, but if they're rigging the poll by voting multiple times for that one show, then there's a problem.

They should feel bad and they SHOULD!

13also owing to the length of the film
lol
That's the picture you get whenever you "speak of ---"
00,10it should die seeing as hub stoped showing them
It's built for mobile platforms.
I searched up "Talking Ben" and voice search thought i said "how give me a boner"
13also given the volume leveling on this movie, you'll probably want headphones
00,10you are right i dont want it
00,10it's suck and fail for games
THEY FINALLY UPDATED THE RELATED LINKS

...that man needs mad props...and more beer
He's walking he just spoke.

13awsm
hello
aaaa
aaaaaaaaa
13but also, he's the second actor for this part
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
13the first actor was let go
13FOR BEING DRUNK TOO MUCH
lol
damn
:D
13as you'll see, while they're nazis, they don't much approve of the regime
spam evepypony
watch at fullscreen
Those silly Nazis
good for em
13pretty much
just drunk soldiers, eh
13this being the directors cut there's some more character development and longer scenes than the theatrical version
/me facedesks.
13this is all one shot
ha
yay~
13it cuts on the closeup of the bullets there
LOL
FAIL
13otherwise one continuous shot
00,10nice shots
NICE SHOT MAN XD
13thomsen's actor drunk again
yeah I know
13gratuitous english!
13so there's hidden cuts all over this sequence to hide the fact that it's the same model
Huh, clever.
13now, maybe you'll recognize it
Didn't catch them either.
13a fun story from the production of this movie
13when they came back to la rochelle to film these last shots, they found their main model was missing!
"Unterwasserboot", yes?
I recommend the book. The movie can't impart the same tension.
unterseeboot
lel
back, from very long afk :'(
That silly American director
"untersee". Should have known.
Ha, that's awesome
didn't that movie have nazis too?
13X3
Conspiracy~
XD
We won the war, we get to keep it :P
13nah spielberg gave it back
13but there was like a hairline fracture in the front third
THOMPSON GUN?
<.< narwal?
00,10must be realy hard to use taht deck gun in sub combat
13i'm thinking if you're on the surface and have to defend yourself with those guns
13you're pretty much screwed
XD
huh?
Well, yeah.
13especially seeing how badly they fare with basic combat as this movie goes on
13now this is also one continuous shot
13the set does not come apart, the camera has to move in among the crew just like the actors
some pretty cramped quarters
I've been inside a submarine before on a field trip during my second year of NJROTC
I've visited a few ships, I could never live in such tight corridors. Those things make me feel claustrophobic.
i have never been on a submarine before
13so this is the indiana jones version of the sub models
das boot?
13before he made off with it :3
i've been on one
spent the night in it
looks really cramped
Loading Completed
They are cramped
Gotta move to the side and all
13SkunkTauri: the camera makes it look bigger than it is, just think about that
Brick Force Load Completed
13the set is absolutely identical to the real VIIC boats
speaking of cramps, combatives is painful.
This is my only problem with this movie.
13so yeah claustrophobics need not apply
The U-Boats were NOT crewed by boys.
Yeah, the passageways in a sub are really tight. Cut down for efficiency's sake, but downright terrifying if you hate tight spaces
Not this early, anyway.
some sub men work for year long shifts
ikr
Yuck.
13ALAAAAAARM
uh oh
they're slow underwater...most of the time they are above surface
tasty tasty diesel food
13again, the set is one thing
o.O
13the camera is rushing through there with the rest of them
00,10human balist
13the cameraman had to wear like full body padding :P
13that's their smaller model diving
Poor camraman :(
camea
13there's room for one stuntman to pilot it
camera
would make me nervous running in those quarters
13<3
That fello
That guy's voice sounded creepy
This was a childhood movie for me. XD <3
Yeah... "Deeper" comes up a lot in this movie.
they must go deeper
...i had to do it
13aw don't freak out the poor war correspondent
go to 260
huh
throw caution to the sea
13sub is hungry
13i think the subtitles are geared slightly more towards the english audio
I voted on the english version...
oh cool dis das boot?
yup
no, its my little pony the musical
which version
ja
i could go for a sub
13jcelios: directors cut, 3.5 hour
and a burger
131997 directors cut specifically i think
I heard there are cuts of this movie that go on for an ungodly amount of time because it was going to be a mini series or something
Saturn: no?
Saturn, not that I know of
13yep
now that you mention it, fries and a coke wouldn't be too bad
and mozzerlla sticks
psh, we all die some day

Why am I feeling like I've seen this before?

Much less months.
00,10Hmmmmm Subway

Nice.

oh man
Showers are for quitters
lol
real men don't need showers
00,10atomic hand grenades

how do you see the clearance marking if it's ultraviolet... wait, that's the point, right?
/me 08,01forgets that most in here are infrared clearence
Saturn: >.>
13fun is mandatory
Oh, right, we should crack out our Yellow Submarine references for this movie.
mandatory fun is worst fun
letters? he should brought his laptop
what's he gonna do, send the litter out in a bottle?
*ridiculously
is this u571?
08,01is there a rifftrax for this?
^
13you could look :P
Oh shit
00,10doubt it
This isn't high-profile enough for it.
Rifftrax riffs on Blockbusters.
13well they do smaller things too like shorts
13but ja das boot might be out of their range, would have been more relevant during MST3K, but they did bad movies then
08,01pppppppppppp
13you can see the dubbing at work there
Americans hate Foreign Cinema
/me 08,01can just about understand about 50% of the dialogue
13even though it was marketed as "the boat" everyone knows it as das boot
08,01the book was called U-Boat
....
This is not a blockbuster.
13lemon with milk i think
Is that sour milk?
(Condensed milk)
....even if milk is from a can, I'm sure its a bad sign when you have to chew it O_o
13there's a few others, public domain shorts

BS?
13you can tell it's not actually humans up there
13the crew are basically barbie dolls

It'll be for the Motherland, they said
13oh and like i said earlier, probably best to have headphones for this movie, the quiets are very quiet and the louds are very loud
RIP Headphone Users.
/me has headphones
00,10um would they not pick up the creaking?
13probably why he's saying to go deeper
We must go deeper
13that too
play dead..."we sink, go away, destroyer!"
go DEEPER? *inception sound*

THE BUTTON
This is the problem, the U-Boat is NOT a proper submarine.
13eeyup
00,10rocks fall
oh shit
o hai is it movie night already
hm
not yet
hull fixed
13150 meters underwater
13destroyer still knows exactly where they are
^
they were at full speed
ok
13captain has a habit of talking to the opposing team
What's also important is you never see anyone else.
You don't see the "Tommies".
Did they cut out the part where they leave the sailors to die?
13yeah modern movies would cut away to the brits looking for the sub or something
lalalalla
it would ruin the atmosphere to show the others
13yay we didn't die this time!
the destroyer attacked another sub before. how can he know how many depth charges are left?
we did :P
lol
cuz i just did
just how much isn't there?
13but if they drop like 25 charges looking for one sub
13they're probably going to walk away eventually
13like they did
hm...
he is married to it
13maybe a backup at best but probably only to sleep
hydrophones should be built redundant...at least three of them, with operators
13^
13u-boats were surface boats that could go underwater
13not really the other way around
its a combustion engine sub, its a miracle it even works lol
compressed air tanks
o dear....
13i think the thing i read said the VIICs were limited to 10-12 hours underwater at the very best
:D
/me dances :$
lol
uh
u gonna get raped!
they need to get entertainment somehow
Nice...um...oranges?
/me dances
13NOOOOO NOT OUR FOOTBALL TEAM

he didn't say hag, she said matress
That's some stiff-upper-lip bull right there.
Keep in mind, these things are very large coffins.

13pretty much
13the blue lighting is probably also good for simulating night, plus the engines being able to recharge the electrical system

00,10would have figured any thing close
13well close too
Right, that's enough
Out of me, at least
They're going down?
underwater?
13so they're diving because the destroyer thinks they're higher up
They would die from the pressure
13and might drop charges to blow up there, not down where they really are
13but, as hydrophone guy's panic indicates
13destroyer ain't fooled
00,10some one just had an idea
00,10judgeing by that Lightbulb~
shoot the torpedoes
Whoa, we're watching Das Boot? Wish I'd known earlier
someone get on that deck side gun
13can't really shoot the torpedoes UP

13230 meters
its only 7:35PM on thursday
13the sub was only rated for 90
Wow, you even got my favourite flavour! Trout flavour!
Uh guys, the ship is creaking
:3
13popped bolts are an extremely bad thing
That's...not a good sign. At all.
Shit
13just one is reason to GTFO and go home
momomomonsterkill
13but then we have half the movie left
I don't think I can imagine how scary that would be
plate?
13the hull
you think they just wrap one piece of metal around like a burrito and send it out to sea?
13way more depth charges to send in
SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT
FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
oic
or hydrophobia
13that would have been a charge above their depth there
Or possibly both
13heroic BSOD
this can't be good
He's lost it.
he should try yoga
i'm guessin he got a bad case of cabin fever?
THE VODKA
no wait
A WRENCH!
Bolts aren't the only things that can crack under pressure.
you mean glass?
13THE submarine movie
Hey, it's an otakon~
The BEST submarine movie
Only about half.
It was pretty damn busy
DAMN
They STILL know where they are?
he had to say it
And still know they're down there, too. Shit.
Sinking fast?
everything lower than 200 is bad
They need to find an escape route fast. ._.
1390
13the boat's only rated for 90, anything below that is bad
....weird cut
oh
They're only rated for 90 meters? Shit, depth charges can get well below that even in the 40s. O.o
In the time it takes me to fap, Romney makes 1500 dollars
-_-
it's the kind of job I let other people do
13let's review our cast
Is this a dream>
?
oh no
13it's a tanker
Wait, they hit it with two torpedoes didn't they? Or was it three?
13one i think
if I recal they called them cows or something
And it's STILL not sinking?
13there were four in the convoy
13or might have been two
13but one last shot to make sure it goes down
13leave nothing for salvage
goddamn
Oh, if it was just one, okay. But two or three? Wow, the damn thing's durable, gotta give it that
....
13captain is understandably angered
oh wow
are those germans or enemies>
13brits
enemies
That's....ugh
survivors
They....they just abandoned them>
._.
13well
13two things
The ideology of ''For the Empire"
they can't risk being caught
13they had way more than enough time to rescue
13but our heroes here can't take prisoners
No kidding. Six hours is plenty of time.
wow
13a) not allowed by the rules of engagement
that's just... wow
Movie ended?
no real room for em
Yup.
can't bring a prisoner on a U-boat. No room and way too easy to sabotage
Still....
13so yeah
much less food etc.
the brits
Ugh, that's awful.
abandoned the brits
hm ok
wow
It happens
civilian tanker captains
I'm more appalled at the fact that the Brits just ditched their comrades.
13and yeah that's a bigger wtf why the brits left them
and they didn't
That's just disgusting, honestly.
Being left on a tanker full of burning gasoline for hours....
/me shudders
because someone decided it were too risky
well maybe they could've...
13and worse still the ship goes down, now you're stuck in the middle of nowhere
sandiwhced them all together
Yep. You get to die of thirst.
In the ocean.
even if sandwiched, thatd be more weight, more supplies, more stink, and its cramped there already
"When I give the order"
should've built fireproof row boats
Which is fucking AWFUL.
it's winter there
I think.
ok
We should watch Stalingrad
modern war is extremely clean compared to back then
That much time in a high stress environment just eats away at a person.
13ja here's something to get you thinking
ugh
13lt werner is basically the author avatar
13the author did not like this movie
13said it reglorified and remystified the sub warfare
No kidding.
13what was the REAL war like if the author thinks THIS is glorious
Japan doesn't have a Military now
This movie's fucking depressing.
back then they were a imperialist war machine
And if this is glorifying it, then how mind-numbingly depressing must the book be
my brain's definitely full of fuck now
and Germany's just conquered Europe economically anyway
13that too
13going to keep trying to find an ebook of das boot
13that order is suicide
13they're in the atlantic
....
13they've been ordered to italy, which means going through the strait of gibraltar
GANGNAM STYLE HAS
which is full of mines right?
900 MILLION VIEWS!!!!
yeah
they have problems with china and north korea
basically suicide mission
well its either that or run outta fuel
The rudding fuck is their CO thinking?
and supplies
oh north korea
13orders came from higher up
if it's the only port left
Then the real fight is just starting for them
It's an insult to even suggest that North Korean soldiers could get near the American mainland
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Equestria Inquirer #62

yeah homefront
I believe it. I didn't waste my money to find out
they enter the port submerged?
at night?
bad show
no
yes
theyre entering port....
AT NIGHT
13look how haggard they are
yeah look at these asshats
all dressed up
shaved
fucking clean
I saw Lincoln the other day because I'm a Civil War buff (it was OK), but that was the first time I'd been in a theater in months. Although I'm pissed that noplace around me was showing Celebration Day
hahaha
lol

aaaaaand i have returned! ^_^
....dat food
These people are flaming asshats.
it isn't easy here
IT ISN'T EASY HERE?
Damn you, Germany. You're inciting gluttonous desires within me.
punch him
PUNCH THAT PONCEY FUCK
now kiss
EW HE PUT IT BACK
And I just want to reach through my screen and deck 'im.
They're on the Weser
in dock
13german barge in spain refueling and rearming them
1341
13i think
thanks
Well it fucking sucks, thanks for asking
I'd say 42 or 43
not sure
I think
wikipedia says 41 too
....uh oh.
Dat face.
Something isn't right
oh boy
And see, that's some good acting. Just his face expresses everything you need to know.
damn
All that bread
expressing a negative emotion facially isnt that hard though
?
13who knows
1341
This is still in 1941. The Germans are high on hubris
Well, at least the bigwigs are
At least with the world concerned with Germany
they expected to have moscov before winter
13feel really dumb that i don't remember, pearl harbor was 42 right?
No, that was 41
13how soon after did we join in ?
yes, a few weeks ago in movie
13that might be part of it, send the u-boat to reinforce italy
13with the americans coming
Basically right away
December 7th, 1941
13so it was 41
Yep
13so that's my best guess
The boot is over there stream.
See it?
13send the u-boat to italy to help them out against the impending americans
it's the 71st anniversary of Pearl Harbor
africa war maybe
13or that
never really ended
Germany and Italy declared war on the USa on Dec 11, 1941. we rciprocated same day
Might be. But wouldn't they want to send more than one u-boat?
13hm
but it's the picture
Think it's supposed to be.
13i turned the settings up but ja might just be the point
....
That's a lotta ships.
lol half
my last train goes in 45 minutes -_-
can't see the whole movie
13so might be more u-boats going in
13just not as far as our guys know
They had somewhere around 200 IIRC.
Maybe a bit less
too much gives me a headache
Well, wait. No, this was WW2....
/me ponders
That picture
13lol that sub was early
Their production rate was higher during WWII because of the huge growth in tech between WWI and WWII.
That much I do remember.
13dammit johann
Shit.
OH SHIT
well shit
Is that Werner?
That blood squirt
They spotted them before they could dive.
They're screwed.
and then the Captian literally went down with the ship
You know I know these guys are the "enemy"
for the extra drama
But I want to see them LIVE DAMMIT!
They got spotted early on, too.
time to dive
damn he jumped down
Before they could get close enough for the long guns not to be a problem.
uh oh
13strafed by plane up top
not THAT is going manual
their diveamabobber is stuck it seems
yeah they're going down
....
They're going down much too fast.
WAY too fast
O_O

and that's it
13sub's already hurting
/me chews her fingers intensley

And then...BANG
Yup. Bolts blowing.

.....oh no.

They're gonna be stuck there, aren't they. ._.
Please, please tell me I'm wrong. Because otherwise that is the most horrifying possible way to die.
And the look of fear on their faces
buried alive
13they'll come back up
13the movie ends on the surface
oh, this CAN'T be good

I have always wondered if that is just me though =P

Good night everypony. Thank you all I had a wonderful birthday today! ^_^

SYMBOLISM
same here Cii
13well, again the navy was notoriously not very pro-nazi
But that partly because i missed like half the movie XD
:/
(naturally)
Seems that way
I guess that's not a bad idea, though....not sure I'd be able to sleep not knowing if I'd wake up
13i would think you're taking deeper breaths which is bad
its alot less
is he sneakin food?
Either way, I couldn't sleep under those conditions
13right
13any way you slice it you're hosed though
Just not sure if it's enough, though, with the fumes.

Thanks for that bit of information.
Wow... I have a part of this to myself.

D̶O̶ ̶ A̶L̶L̶ ̶ T̶H̶E̶ ̶ Z̶A̶L̶G̶O̶!̶ Follow the rules. :)
That was meant to be crossed out, showing I wasn't going to do that.
Just lurkin'
sea ponies!
speaking of..
5
Sea ponies ftw
I would have to admit, if sea ponies were ressurected, they should make it more of an epic episode than a marketing scheme.
I like Snivey. He's cool.
A mime is a type of clown
*u
It doesn't look like a cat...
!cd
Hi every pony :)
Hi Socks
Statwise all the starters are really good in their own right. I usually just go with the one I like the most personally.
Oshawott has grown on me as I've seen more pictures of it, particularly from the anime. It was just that first impression that put me off. =/
lol
I like Treecko in gen 3 for the same reason. XD
wow dat wall
tl;dr version?
I like Charmander from Gen 1, Totodile from Gen 2, Treecko from Gen 3, Chimchar from Gen 4 and Snivy from Gen 5 by personal choice.
http://www.fimfiction-static.net/images/story_images/68142.png?1354783344 have some ponies in socks
I think out of thre three gen 5 starters, The pig is the cutest in first form, but as far as the higher forms, I'm not impressed with any of them. =/
designwise I mean
Mienshao's the one that looks like "Ninja Winnie the Pooh" right?
Or is that the other one...
Oh wait, no. That's Mienfu
Ok, yeah. Mienshao is the evolved form
Yeah, that one looks cool
Dragonite is best Gen 1
dragonites pretty hard to find
but those 4 would carry me through the 8 gyms
You cannot find Dragonite in the wild. You can buy Dratini at the Gaming Corner in Gen 1 for 700 coins.
Or try to fish for one in the Safari zone. :D
i hvant played the gen 5's
I like getting them in their first forms and raising them up myself. :>
I catch them at any stage, I breed them, get the right nature, right IVs, and then I EV train them to their maximum potiential.
thats way too involved
^
Thanks to EV training. It is really helpful
EV training is too tedious for me. I'd rather just play.
To be honest, EV training sometimes sucks the fun out of everything.
And then I don't really care after that.
pfft and how do you know when you beat it?
I never use legendaries.

Jolteon is pretty good, but Vaporean is best Gen 1 Eevolution
*Vaporeon
both epic
all eeves suck

Espeon is best Eevolution, stat-wise
jolteon has an epic lvl of speed and damage
I like ponies dude
vapouron epic health and 2 epic passives
leafeon is junk, never make one
