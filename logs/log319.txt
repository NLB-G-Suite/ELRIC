(meant the angry face)
My friends could be real jerks sometimes

what's that?

isn't it impossible to throw a laptop keyboard by itself?
dat Suacy Armor~

hello
Tell me why
Be right back
kk
Its possible if you throw the laptop
didn't see you there , EatPinkiePies
I haven't played Skyrim much, anyway.

aye
dat name
/me doesn't have Skyrim~
though if you're referring to "throwing the keyboard in rage," then yeah, you typically just throw the whole laptop
I've played skyrim waaay too much
Why is it you can only enchant the helms with crap?
none of the enchants are useful
/me enchants otakon's beard~
Reinforce Alchemy and smithing is useful

it's ALL magic boosts or one archery boost
The one with magic resist is quite good though

there should be elemental resists though
no one cares

I'm sayint
OMG the kids are not Immortals anymore!
Well, doesn't it resist magic damage?
rofl!
you killed a child?
2 actually
Stop right theree criminal scum!
BEARD
You can only put Magic Resist on Shields, Rings and Necklaces
I thought it was impossible to kill kids
and even if you don't use magic, i'm sure you occasionally use Restoration Magic to heal yourself
in the console it is
bumtazer is bumtazing
I guess you can mod it
Kill ALL the children
there's Fortify Restoration, which is therefore universally useful
Man
no one gives a damn that he killed to kds and a guard, thats amazing
or, failing that even, Fortify Lockpicking

07,01why does he get auto banned?
00,06Don't know why it only prevents him from coming in...
yes, but at the same time it's not from a first-person point of perspective
07,01not across all channels though?
It was such a sad fic... MLD
or rather, not an unnamed protagonist one
00,06It auto bans if you're not identified.
ohdearheavens not the sad fluttershy
00,06Oh, no, was going to do that today.
who's playing skyrim?
not me
00,06...but once you're identified, even if you're banned, it should let you in, since you have OPs... =/

07,01Any comments?
07,01suggestions / feedback?
Why is the EU agreeing to this shit?!

04What her "unless" means, that is

07,01just as a reminder
08,14was ist the entire world is a distraction for another world
Oh, Goddesses...

07,01Sunday is always problematic for Dari

They'd need to be show quality artwork.
it should probably be a weekday but yeah
04So then the Tobias meeting and the tech meeting next Saturday?
07,01yes
BEHOLD! My bread: http://postimage.org/image/gbuff3u0v/ STAGE 1!

This is an example of her music: http://soundcloud.com/edge7/crossovers
advertisments...:|
That is about as good as i can draw though
07,01sure why not
DUDE I just had the best idea ever
/me listens
?!
PINKIE PIE ROOM PARTIES.
/me is wary, but listens
musiks gone
04...wut
/me tilts head
04........................wut
wait... it's not streamin
04Elaborate, if you would
She's got plenty more.
Bread STAGE 3! http://postimage.org/image/e9ty0uw1r/
That is her.
She's a good friend, as well.
Basically periods of time in which the rules are extremely lax on #pinkiepie, barring 34
...some day in the future , though
no wait, I'll go to her profile
/me noms on uncooked bread
hot*
yeah
bearded bread
/me barfs
04Ehhhhhhh
04Except for like two people
it's BREAD!
04That's why we allowed it
goodlord thats horrible
ikr
buffering this whole time? must refresh
:$
07,01actually I like the idea.. of a free forum to roam...
/me 13dances
STAGE 4 the finished PRODUCT! http://postimage.org/image/3oa2oupq7/
There we go~
dat bread
:\
i'm back
:/
04Yeah, I think an anything goes board would be fine
04Just keep it all...in there
O_o
00,06Well, not ANYTHING.
04Wait
Right gonna go listen to some muzik....Ping me if you need me
it's BREAD
:P6_9:P6_9
00,06But yes.
not pony!
04Should we allow NSFW?
00,06No.
Live Stream ,
:P 6_9
00,06Borderline, yes.
00,06But not NSFW.
fail
Y U NO stop buffering?!
Everything needs more pony
Well how about
gonna refresh...again
1 had been RPed.
04Fine, then at least let them call each other faggots and niggers
And it was a pretty damn good RP, too.
/me goes to get snacks.... specifically TWIZZLERS!!
00,06-_-;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD2TbtxjTho&lc=rMuIn_QPkaICDbsD-bBJQk_p1lPqrhmsDd4v69v2ggM&context=G2da42adFAAAAAAAABAA&feature=g-all-c
00,06I hate those words.
04It's an "anything goes" board for christ's sakes
00,06Soooooo much.
0,5Gumri i was pinged from that "lc" in there
ha
00,06Ohgawdno.
still doesn't stops buffering...
DARN IT
00,06I said I hate those words, I didn't say no.
04Oh, well
04Don't go in there then
I'd explain it, but the Sphere mechanic is complicated.
00,06Everyone would flock to it, and it would be an arse to moderate.
00,06The anything goes forum would at least be easy to moderate because... it's a forum.
going to close the site , open it up , and seee if it doesn't stops buffering
04Yeah, let's just have an anything goes board
04Easier to moderate, like Sprinks said
It's far too early to get voice actors, though.
/me noms on twizzler
Awww...:'(
got home
gimme a sec
04Okay
Yeah~ Stream doesn't work for me~
Confirmed cases: 1 - Vase Breaking Case. 2 - Spike Thievery Case. 3 - R
RD Impersonation Case.

:D i just got a screencap of my character in skyrim riding a too scale pony...
/me perks head up at Honey_Whistle's comment
/me disconnects , then go to sleep
My RD case is probably my most well thought out yet.
Vase Case is decent, but very unsettling until the very end.
Now, I must read "The Natural".
http://i.imgur.com/cHJQu.jpg lol awesome
/me huggles

/me laughs at Midnight_Tempest's pic...

Fur suit cosplays arent neccisarily bad, albeit some are creepy. But not all are horrid.
Yeah, it's actually pretty good. Especially for a furry like me. Although, I don't go that far.
Now I've seen some REALLY REALLY bad humanized Pony cosplays. No effort whatsoever.

Thats because its a sequel to perhaps one of the greatest movies of all time
I've never seen Ferris Bullers Day Off.
Ha ha.
Babes In Toyland wins
I didnt see alot of movies in 2011, and of those...I dont remember much
then, after the votes are in, they announce them.
That was terrible
I think it'd be a fun little event for everybody, plus we would make the mods remember all the worst films they've had to sit through.
0,14...Babes in Toyland...
0,14ugh...
/me shudders.
I think me and Saxy killed ourselves about 5 times
0,14eeenope

Good watcher, best friend.

That's nother reference as well. Heh heh.
11,01WMC night would have the worst turnout ever.
yeah
Lol
I'd be there
11,01Only if we riffed them would it be worth watching.
we'd lose people on that night
11,01Or buy Rifftrax for them.
13nein nein nein WMC means NEVER AGAIN
we need to Riff them!
WMC?
13EVER
11,01Worst Movie Clause.
We wait til theyre's 5 WMC movies, and then have one play sunday-thursday.
lol wut?
then that week's movie would look amazing.
YOU DONT KNOW?
13not if it were twilight
Wanna come with? :D
Speaking of Riff, we should hold a Mystery Magic Theatre 3000. In which some of the mods and select few *coughlikemecough* make fun of a bad movie.
Via Skype of course.
0,14also, I'm gonna ignore all this WMC and just keep rewatching the TEASER
eeenope
FERRIS

Maybe I should fix that.
11,01I'd have to script my lines.

Great movie
I reccomend you watch it if you can
Frankie after the two year time skip is awesome!
11,01Ohai.
Movie Night?
while the other Twilight films were full of stupidity and misogyny and idiocy, but this one has all that AND is trying to talk to us about the touchy subject of abortion.
11,01I haven't seen that movie. Throw it in the lottery.
no
:D
Spam the Mods
oohhhhh
You havent seen Bueller's day off?
I wanted part of this movie before
11,01No.
11,01Yes.
no, because I came on 5 mins ago xD
Its because they are making a sequel
The series that gave us sparkling vampires and Shirtless werewolves is trying to tell us about abortion and maternity. LOLNOPE.
Nope.avi
Oh cmon
and that's the trailer?

11,01It could also be a sign that Hollywood is out of ideas.
Anne Rice's vampires aren't exactly fantastic either. and Underworld after the 1st film is pretty lame.
That too.
=D
/me disappears
yesh!
they have tons of ideas
I dont watch suspense movies like that
Why not?
just look at the Fanfics, comics e.t.c
BEHOLD IT AND TREMBLE!

ORGINALITY
^
YOU CAN DO IT!
11,01They'll drop it once it's dry (Like with Guitar Hero).
hi meh!
but sadly
11,14only reason CoD hasn't been run into the ground is because you can't drag+drop songs like Guitar Hero
11,01CoD is fun, but you can't deny that they are low-effort.
yeah
once you played one, you've pretty much played them all
espically multiplayer
eh whateverr you're at is close enough
^
11,14^
to each their own
lol
11,14well, I like multiplayer games that require a bit of skill and cooperation
CIVILIZATION!
everyone has their own likes and dislikes
I know
wasnt trying to talk you down
11,01I'd rather stick to killing programs then frustrate of getting killed repeatedly by humans.
that's it!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaRZqL4Xg
11,01Hard games centered on stats.
that MUSIC!
lol
I prefer games with a good story line
Best music?
11,01Most of my time playing BC2 consisted of complaining over stats.
they never make those anymore :(
11,01Yeah.
damn inspiring is all
Chrono Trigger :)
11,01I've jumped out of FPSs for the moment.
11,01Saints Row 3 was fun. I actually got every non-DLC trophy for i.t
11,01*it.
lieutenant armstrong ftw
anyone here heard of the book "John Dies at the End"?
11,14only FPS games I'll play are in arcades, where you get something tactile to shoot with
Also, more music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH3mbB3H57g

11,01Betheseda games don't really appeal to me.
......
Hey guys
D&D?
11,01The one I've played the most was FO3.
11,01It's fun when I play it, but I'm never attracted to playing it.

Triangles.

String theory refers to about three things.

String instuments, music theory, and string theory, the physics thing.
plus I've shated it with others in order to spread the pain.
hmm
*shared

Huh? O.o
0,14ahh, strings
That's why. I'm no programmer. Though I tried...

Nuuuu. Ok. xD

I remember o=
0,14the song is kinda in the "So bad, it's good" territory
Ahh.
also, i don't know how Lana Del Rey has a music career.
eh
*pant*...im....back -_-; *colapses*
you okay?
work.... to... hard....
Whatever you do, don't die.
really?
I heard different from the usual source
% on RT
well that's RT
hmmm
this girls not bad
it JUST came out
ok.... never mind
The podcast I like said it was horrendous. The editting and music were even bad.
more evidence that George Lucas needs to retire.
I concur
before he ruins more movies
I think he was just an executive producer of something.
Good thing he retired before he made starwars V10.5 with more Jar Jar
gods more Jar jar? really?
Because Star Wars is pretty much all he's actually directly done in the last several years. >_>
and he's still working as a procuder.
Theres Indiana Jones
Producer, there, am pretty sure.
Procuder.
Yeesss.
He hasn't written films in a while.
I did NOT just hear that. NOPENOPENOPE
>_>
There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies. THREE.
four
0,144
I did not like the "fourth" film.
No, there's three. There's also no Last Airbender movie. :D
you know? with the toasting the fridge?
Not this AGAIN Saxy >.<
If explosion then refridgerator.
oh yeah, I forgot about the CGI Groundhogs
Yes.
XD I remember you saying that Saxy.
no Frying the Coke?
Cocaine?
lol, NC Reference
o.O...
hmmm
maybe but I like it
granted it's not on the level of cancer as Arrow to the Knee, but still.
Arrow>>>>>>Knee
Arroz.
I prefer Foh Shro Dah than arrow to knee
>>>>------(knee)------>
Ar Row Knee!
hmm.....
no idea
also, can I just say? I really hope they don't make Ferris Beuller 2.
Why?
Well, WHEN has making a followup to an older movie ever worked well.
that's why I mentioned it.
Huh? I dunno
Superman Returns
Tron Legacy
OOOh
Ugh, that Superman movie >_<
0,14...all movies that I had no problem liking
Hey, the soundtrack for tron was great
0,14^
which tron?
0,14Legacy
Damn right it was.
Legacy
ok
/me enters the room
Besides the Tron music. That music was amazing.
taking something that's been around that long, and trying to modernize it, or bring it back, doesn't work because the way cinema and storytelling works has evolved greatly since then.
wow, didnt know that
/me gives Saxy the left to stream
0,14woooooooo
Now you have the left to stream saxy!
Tron was still good though.
speaking of movies, when is the lottery this week?
xD Lottery.
I think its either tomorrow or Saturday
Darf...

If the mods would get the newsletter to the home page...
Saxy...
/me blames the mod that's awake
Uh.

trolestia tweeted that
Nice.
and that's why I follow her on twitter.
aww
You have to use it the opposite way you'd use the right to sream Saxy
... I should make a twitter.
Try blowing on the cartridge Saxy
That might help
Did you try a hard reset?
/me blows on the stream cartridge.

That poetry was

But the first verse was ok
The first verse reminded me of Bender

http://derpy.me/z8yhW
helloes
/me just stares at a wall
hurray
Anyway, I won't really be talking much since I've got a ton of meaningless notes to take
just boring notes for spanish about a spanish person we have to do a spanish presentation about
/me glomps fleur and flees before knifes are drawn
not sure
Fleur: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1892/
lets see if some pinkie fixes her
/me stares into nothingness
/me looks at the wall, what's there?
/me stops blinking as she stares at nothing
how*
Yes, xkcd is great
/me 's ear moves slightly at the sound of her name
hmmmm
/me continues to stare
I particualarly like the math ones
Fleur
she just stares
/me pokes Fleur
and Fleur, if you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you
anybody here read dragonlance?
I have previously
just the main series though
/me recites, unblinkingly "If you are to hunt monsters, take care as you may become a monster yourself""
I have diagnosed the problem... its severe stream deficiency...
O.O that's cool
yeah, 5 generations is a little much
/me continues to stare at nothing
/me hands Fleur some CHOCOLATE
/me doesnt move a muscle, still staring
/me stands in front of Fleur, staring right back
/me sits down in the corner and opens his laptop
o.o
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/678/
/me dances around doing a jig then explodes
/me 's eyes slowly move around slowly, independant from eachother
@____@
O_O she's gone derpy
she's been canon for ages
like 4 months
maybe she needs a canon
you mean cannon
ya, that
I know the feeling. I got my older sister to let me have her webcam, and got it set up with a second one working at the same time, and then I realized I had absolutley no reason for having them
O_O uh oh...
/me blinks again
well... she's blinking... thats good, right?
/me blinks twice quickly
um... i'm not sure
once for yes... twice for no?
/me turns her torso quckly and pops her back
=____=
O_O
-_-
O_O
/me turns the other direction and pops her back again
/me starts to back away slowly
why am I awake...? =____=
/me waits in suspense
/me stops moving and thinks, then starts moving towards Fleur slowly
/me blinks a few more times
O.o lolwut?
I was meditating
urghhh...
she's good
:'(
/me hugs Fleur
I'm going to anyway
you ok Shy ?
I wouldn't worry about derpnet anyway
why was I woken up...?
ohaey...
I can still change my name... eheh...
I belive +d was removed as a cmode
yep
might have been me that woke you
I'll be fine because I live in one of the remotest parts of the world
madagascar?
besides we'll have decades before derpnet can figure stairs
good night all
but all the Derpinators can fly!
they dont need stairs!
http://derpy.me/z8yhW

/me probably is
8,1urgh
ohi Saturn
hai Saturn
sucks dont it
NOOOOooooo
8,1im on my phone at the moment, but rural scotland isnt exactly known for its wireless connectivity
I have no phone and am not allowed to visit friends
my TV was also down
I could only get online from the college campus while waiting inbetween classes
8,1ive traced the fault to one of two places: the BRAS server, or its associated authentication database
lol... bras...
Saturn: bras?
Fleur: i've seen epic movie.
daaaaaaamn
yup
8,1in the latter, all TalkTalk broadband throughout scotland and possibly the rest of the uk is down
whoooooooa dang
aliens...
8,1BTw = BT Wholesale
8,1bt =british telecom
more likely to be talk talk
someone somewhere is loosing alot of money
8,1Phase4: scotland has only 1 BRAS. server
^
only one bra
Scotland needs some more infrastructure even then
sure, but only one? no fallback?
it's got more people than NZ though
...I think
never heard of canternet
8,1now, its not certain that the geographically closest BRAS is the one you use, but a BRAS being down still represents a huge problem
ok... a million more
canternet?
8,1i believe there are only about 7in the whole uk
wasnt aware eqd had an irc server
or room, whatever the term is
8,1pony_9851: canternet
it has a channel some place I know that much
eqds irc is noto as goot as bronystates
8,1this is bronychat
8,1eqd is on canternet
this channel is hosted by ponychat.net
yeah, kinda sucks
this channel is best channel
8,1oh, i have is down wrong
now let's not start with the channel elitism
/me is on fluttershy.ponychat.net
i'm on fluttershy too
/me is debating on switching to celestia.ponychat.net
or luna.ponychat.net
you have the ip for celestia?
do they have those servers?
i thought it was just like the mane six?
that was not a sentence i would have ever guessed me saying
yes
well that explains derpy's voice
x3
8,1grr
inb4 Derpy is first canon transexual
^
it's not the best ISPSaturn
i see... i already have the newsletter in my email... but nothing else
8,1if it were up to me, id buy my own DSLAMs and put them in the exchange myself, then lease out a line to the nearest tier 1datacentre
8,1but that would be horrendously expensive
why does #brony exsist?
Yeah it would be Saturn
the first with the link
8,1BronyKing: it acts as a u-bend for sanity
/me has never liked wwan's
8,1its fine in the city
no
then you got it on the 26th?
even in the city, latencies exceed 200ms round trip to the tower and bandwith is low. then again this is australia.
^
reason 21 why I'm not an ex=pat
yeah, i got the one on the 26th
that one does not have the link
>_<
/me didnt get one on the 26th
*Saturn
no the channels don't relate to geography
te channels =|= the severs
well, i know, lol, i just looked at the map on the site
they just have the same names
Saturn: 130ms? i'm jelly. dropped packets wern't that much of a problem for me thoug, normaly withon 2k of a tower
/me struts in.
cool
Hey everyone
turns out i DID get an email dated the 26th, but it was sent to the wrong address
8,1actually, and you'll like this, that's 2/3my average ping *on a wired connection*

10,02Hai everypony ^_^
10,02O____O
Saturn: 130ms over wired?
10,02Hai Fleur :3

8,1usually over 200
10,02Do we not have a stream?
10,02BLASPHEMY

http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-story-of-my-life1.jpg
that's pretty much all the movie parodies
It'll be depressing to see how little we've evolved in 5+ years.
I haven't seen a good movie parody since Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
yfw it was made in 2007
Ratings: 2.2/10 from 59,469 users
"In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark."
aparently it sucks
lol
I've never finished Epic Movie either.
i've seen it through more than once
trust me, dont watch it if you can avoid it
