I'm so proud of myself :')
Who is this violent man who's streaming? >;O
Rainbows it seems
10,02O___o
Starflash, Wrek
how do u rename weapons?
Warning, dont feed enchanted Candybar to Pinkie Pie
Wrek is a violent, angry man
Ooooh its Wrek. nvm then. that's normal~
/me walks away slowly before being nommed
actually no, he's just Swedish
pwned
/me nom-tackles SuperBrony64
they're just awesome like that
i remember when wrek gave a child a candey bar ffor info, tazed, killed, took the candy bar, and threw the child in a river
No lolligaggin'

No gaggylollin.

/me is being nommed
So I just discovered the worst time to find out that you're out of headache pills.
mfw Morrowind music
heyo butterfly_pony
Morrowind...
That NPC...
Eeek, don't use me as a nom-shield :O
/me gives Ninjapony Skittles
what a beastly game
That is, when you have a headache.
Now this I can nom!
: D
/me omnomnomnoms
The soundtrack sounds like Back to the future's old west theme~
i feel for ya kammerjunk, headaches are the worst :P
/me just got 20% happier
never would have seen that one coming Kammerjunk
Well, off the top of my head, I could name a few things worse. Don't know why I'd have them on the top of my head, though.
That's just silly.
dohoho
/me has been sat down
So I made myself a cup of Earl Gray instead.
Lag?
Use fus ro dah for maximum sprint
no lag here
jumping around?
Looks like walking than lag
Jump around.
Jump up, jump up and get down.
oh, hes carrying too much junk
no , the part where he was getting his Necklace
Do ho ho. Wrek is carrying too much junk.
That sounds a lot like me, actually.
Your overencumbered and cannot run~
well, he can sell the extra stuff for money
Daedric is better than dragon armour
jumping :D
skipping through the village~~~~
lol
That's literally the only thing I forget to do when I'm in down.
Sell stuff.
dragon armor is legendary
most of it anyway
in town*
does Wrek have Wuuthrad? does anypony here have a Wuuthrad? (not showing off)
Ugh. How do you ponies cope with laptop keyboards?
They're so frustrating, I could just scream!
/me is a level 15 and should play more often
BUMTAZER is best weapon
I don't, I have an extra USB keyboard
String_Shredder: Mod it!
Kammerjunk: when I dock my laptop, I use a full size keyboard. :)
I wish I could have a type writter themed keyboard~
^
I will die a happy stallion if I'm never stuck with a laptop keyboard for two weeks again.
no you don't Nyria, because typewriters don't have tildes
Yes, quite
/me puts on monocle
ScootaChicken: I can fix that ^^
i don't know why my younger brother is messing with my Privacy >:(
Screw you, table ornaments.
i sweat i thought that "struck with a laptop keyboard"
(meant the angry face)
c
My friends could be real jerks sometimes
c
c what?
You have thrown a labtop keyboard... It's super affective~!
c++
SaLKiD99: I don't know why the film and music industries will be allowed to infiltrate our privacy.
what's that?
Programming software
hi eatpinkpies :D
isn't it impossible to throw a laptop keyboard by itself?
a++ they all say. they love me on ebay
dat Suacy Armor~
saucy*
hello
Tell me why
well , i don't know that kind of stuff
Be right back
kk
Its possible if you throw the laptop
Am I silly if I never knew you could rename stuff?
didn't see you there , EatPinkiePies
ScootaChicken - a laptop keyboard can be removed if you know where the latches are
I haven't played Skyrim much, anyway.
me too
aye
dat name
/me doesn't have Skyrim~
though if you're referring to "throwing the keyboard in rage," then yeah, you typically just throw the whole laptop
I've played skyrim waaay too much
Why is it you can only enchant the helms with crap?
Wrek's saucy armour is legendary
none of the enchants are useful
except for a mage
gray
eeyup
/me enchants otakon's beard~
i beg to differ otakon
99 Chatters but a Hater aint's one :)
MirrorImage: like what?
Reinforce Alchemy and smithing is useful
Alchemy
don't do it
SaLKiD99: Do ho ho.
or my shield of +50% blocking
shoot him in the knee with an arrow!!!
MirrorImage: for a HELM
you called?
a HELM
not a shield
Kammerjunk thank you
ok, so block his sword with your helmet
If I had to recommend something for Pinkies parties, DEFINETLY WAFFLES!!
you're hard headed enough, aren't you?
If I ever hear one of them say that catch phrase I will attack them
D'awww That last NPC~
/me purrs
Guys... I have a confession to make.
/me pets IshBestKitty ~
ok confess
Sometimes... I dream about cheese.
inb4mlphasskyrimreferences
Cheeeeese.
/me rubs against Nyria
*GASP* CHEESE!!
/me d'aaaaaaawwws at IshBestKitty
the Gaurd said that there'sFur coming out of your Ears...
IshBestKitty is so cute~
Throw the cheeeeeeese
and failing those otakon, there's helms that raise the various attack stats (+x% archery, etc) or provide elemental defenses
that means Wrek is a Khajit!
/me purr purr
MirrorImage: no there aren't
are at the very least
there are none YOU can craft
Awkward silence
i've seen plenty of Circlets of Archery, so yes there absolutely are
khajit are awesome
yeah
CIRCLET not HELM
i agree
and helmets can receive that enchantment too
I shall check
*dangles string in front of IshBestKitty*
my Iron Helments have received archery enchantments a couple of times
/me bats at string
ow!
*pulls string away*
*the string bursts into flames*
/me pulls out the guide to check enchantment list
/me chases string
y am i on fire aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
*extinguishes string*
I've heard that it is possible to wear a falmer helmet on top of one of the priest masks
lol, Derpy with a portal gun
yeah
/me lays down "i hate u broknee"
nothing useful for a warrior
except waterbreathing
/me Divided by Zero by accident (can be stopped if wanted so)
yes, go show those Slaughterfish how to fight
KILL
it's ALL magic boosts or one archery boost
The one with magic resist is quite good though
wait.... was that a kid? 0_o
What?!?
there should be elemental resists though
no one cares
Nobody cares~
WIN
Ninjapony: NOT if you don't use MAGIC!
lmao
damn
I'm sayint
otakon - magic *resist*
nope
Well, doesn't it resist magic damage?
agh dead body!
rofl!
you killed a child?
2 actually
Stop right theree criminal scum!
BEARD
You can only put Magic Resist on Shields, Rings and Necklaces
Wrek you evil man
I thought it was impossible to kill kids
and even if you don't use magic, i'm sure you occasionally use Restoration Magic to heal yourself
in the console it is
bumtazer is bumtazing
I love you so much
I guess you can mod it
Kill ALL the children
MirrorImage: I do.
what kind of Enchantment he used?! I WANT THAT
Man
no one gives a damn that he killed to kds and a guard, thats amazing
or, failing that even, Fortify Lockpicking
lol
lol meatpies and dead bodies
0_0
HAX!
noclip FTW
It's magic nothing more
so for a warrior, yes i'll agree, probably not that much good stuff
yeah, he's enabled console commands
that's not to say there aren't valid options
bwah bwaah bwaaaaaaaaaaaaah
HAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXXX
MirrorImage: true, but nothing to really boost a warrior
what times are it in your Cou-OMG HE NOCLIPPED AND KILLED HIMSELF
burn the kid
When someone tries to touch you, you say NO!
Mah boi
Burn the king!
uhh... i meant king

hi stinkomanfan
Hey, StinkomanFan
Hey StinkomanFan ~
and i guess the dragon render shout worked TOO effectively
2 dragons? THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED
Wrek's fighting dragons I see
physics and ponies do not mix well
emangamer: Physics are boring anyway.
Hasbro cannot unto physics.
I never had a dragon attack in a city, let alone 2 dragons at once. But I did have a dragon fight in East Empire Trading Company Cave
^
05that was my dragon
05the secodn one
plus, equestria has different physics
...
SKYRIM
Oh right, that shouty
wrek owns a dragon 0-0
Pinkie doesn't approve of physics anyways
Dragon souls are spicy
WHY do I keep on pressing Ctrl+W?
Pinkie Pie breaks physics simply by existing
What are you trying to do Kammerjunk ?~
I think I'm going to go for a short time everypony

Nyria; I don't know!
Pinkie pie once said "Whats a physics?"

So I'm at this farm in the middle of nowhere, and have been since Saturday. And since I'm at this farm in middle of nowhere, I'm using the room of a girl who's not here.
*sigh* so many are leaving :(
I share my snacks and then give hugs
yeah im going to have to go soon
Well, Pinkie will just break the fourth wall anyway
This girl just happens to be very young and therefore have pony dolls.
otherwise it gets in the way

But GUESS what pony dolls she has?

Nightmare fuel Pinkie Pie.

I've had Pinkie Pie pop out of the back of my head, Grudge style

bye Darf14
Why can't we get an official game based on poni?
hmm...true
StinkomanFan: Fighting is Magic will be out soon
because the synopsis would be odd to handle?
because it would be terrible most likely
THQ would probably do it
*looks at doctor who*
They made piles of crap into piles of... somethinfg better
/me is fetching something to eat
/me is spacing out
Well, other than that OTHER official one
Teacher for a day indeed...

Then who was that white haired guy?
watari?
/me cries as her brother shoots her in the head witha nerf dart
Yeah
death note gets silly when this super detective stuff starts
Spoilers: people die
Hilariously
is that like at the start of 27?
XD
Dken2021: its in the whole anime
i've heard of death note, but i never really watched it. It looks interesting though
I'd hardly call the ware house fire hilarious
people die left and right
Depends on the victim
Hey, I think a cloud moved
RainbowDash it's an interesting anime/manga
/me is getting bored
its about eating potatoe chips
http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/pony-mashup-deathnote.jpg
and cake
13the game is paused... see those two figures on the road, they haven't moved, no NPC conversation lasts this long
Deathnote becomes less awesome without L in the picture, but the rest is still definently worht watching
*worth
L sure eats alot

Holy crap! I see Waldo!
Shinigami? Oh wait ur talking bout death note. Nevermind...

Like every anime ever?
I wonder how he got up there...I've never seen the town from this perspective before
oh you're stil on about death note.

He cheated Derpy_pony
alright im off for now. ill be back in about a few hours
But it is a nice looking town
there's nothing for me to talk about...

Talk about how silly it is for Doctor Who to be a pony
That always works
oh god what
/me is a bit bored
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W14Tw0cv7qA
Doctor Whooves is a silly pony.
/me sighs as she starts to run out of ideas of what to say....and grabs a muffin and noms it..

I prefer cupcakes, though.
Because you can decorate a cupcake.
oh god, he's so in heaven right now

Why have you been eating off food?
Hello Dken2021

4 year old twinkies are better *no they're not*
"Murder is the wittiest reply"-Yahtzee Croshaw
8,1or the carbonara that expired a month ago
damn right it is :D
8,1RAWRity: that's actually quite close to the truth
Jump!
Anyways, I be alive.
I wont eat things that have the current date on, let alone a month after
8,1i ate a cup of yoghurt that expried 2 months ago, and had a pierced lid
8,1it tasted of mouldy cheese

I say we tie them both to a chair and test there blood
reminds me of my Xbox live friends list. I have 5 RainbowDash's
Im making to much a presence... >_<
So apparently, Linux and DVDs from Blockbuster are not the best of pals.
String_Shredder: I wouldn't put it past RD to make multiple accounts of people using her name, just to make herself seem more popular.
Rainbow-Dash: It's okay....
im friends with oOApplejackOo
Huh dat Loud and pink person~

why?
Randomnerd you read MLD?
Just now.
Oh.... okay.. sry
i read it
lol it's okay
Randomnerd you are shedding manly tears yes?
and thus, Randomnerd's depression is understandable
The Manliest!
My little Dashie was the saddest thing ever
No, no... it was pretty sad, but I didn't cry.
try reading Transcendence
Gumri: No, my life is. xD
waht wa?
04There we go
ehh... i think Trancendence is a little long for the Manly Tears effect
waht?
Im sure there is a sadder fic out there but MLD is one of my favourites.
00,06...=/
i wanted to cry...but then i knew that my father's wife (not my mother) would've heard me crying
omg skyrim!
07,01flags really need to be synced..
MirrorImage: it has those Man-Tear moments though
00,06They are.
:"'(
:'(
07,01why does he get auto banned?
SaLKiD99: to what?
00,06Don't know why it only prevents him from coming in...
yes, but at the same time it's not from a first-person point of perspective
/me hugs SaLKiD99 ~
07,01not across all channels though?
It was such a sad fic... MLD
or rather, not an unnamed protagonist one
00,06It auto bans if you're not identified.
ohdearheavens not the sad fluttershy
00,06Oh, no, was going to do that today.
so the connection isn't quite as deep
the part where Dashie runs away and the man is Very , Very Sad
who's playing skyrim?
Wrek
07,01Alright so what's on the agenda tonight?
not me
00,06...but once you're identified, even if you're banned, it should let you in, since you have OPs... =/
00,06So confusing.
04The document I drafted for you guys
im playing on my xbox 360
07,01Mod infractions
/me listens to Japanese Music through her speakers.
04The Mod Infractions & Punishment doc
07,01anything else?
I'm going to have to read something ridiculous now.
04Um

HOLD ATTACK DOES STRONG ATTACK!!!
Hey herostar, watch the all caps.
07,01ok

00,06Eyup.

/me snuggles RainbowDash
So you guys just noticed this?~
2,14 Daedric and legendary
00,06I think it's fair if we allow them AFK messages in their nicks.
0,5Wow
2,14 which means his smithing is at 100
ok , RainbowDash
0,5Yeah i know
0,5Just, wtill, WOW
00,06Like "SirSleepy"
05,15wait...then why do my axes do 107...wut?
0,5I needa start smithing!
04Hmm
/me snuggles back
04How about
I have glass swords with 121 attk
All this skyrim talk...i think im going to leave now. See you guys tomorrow / later for BMN.
0,5Well, time to go make tons of iron daggers
00,06But only if their name is still recognizable.
04As long as their nick resembles their original name
he has cheats. his smithing COULD be at 999
04Yeah
im still a noob on skyrim DX
0,5Daedric aromor?????? Wow
notice what Nyria?
2,14 oh wat? he's cheating?
no
07,01so one main name and 1 afk name?
00,06Nah.
but he used one to stay AFK in the sky
Dken2021: CandyBar and BumTazer as weapons~
00,06As long as it still resembles the original name, should be fine.
04No, they can change their name as long as it resembles their main
thats about it
herostar u should c how much of a noob Twilight is
04But admins should be allowed the priviledge to change to whatever
bye , DashWithRainbows
00,06lol
XD
/me enables godmode
tell him ik where to get a really good mage teamate
04Seriously though, we're admins for a reason
04Besides
ta ta Dashw- damn~
04I like dusk_fly
u mean her herostar?
04I like changing my name to it sometimes
no a guy
07,01I like Lulu but you know it's me.. (LurkyLuna)

04Hah

All that for nothing
there's a guy in a yellow robe
04It's a genre of music
/me kisses RainbowDash on the forehead
in the inn in dawnstar
07,01but yea okay.. so how should we bring this to the team?
04Most instrumental
Wrek , what race do you play?
/me b;ushes
*blushes
ive never been to dawnstar
00,06Also, dusk_fly is a baws name.
00,06I miss that guy.
0,5Dawnstar is boring
04Thanks
talk to him and do his quest, you can either get him as a teamate or get a magic staff doing 20-50 depending on if you steal peoples dreams with it
0,5But theres a daedric quest there
/me is now listening to Intensive Pony Unit
04And yeah, I only saw dusk_fly like three times. And that was at the beginning of the summer
00,06From fukken AGES ago.
05,15Dawnstar, Falkreath, and Morthal suck as towns
eh, I haven't made it there yet LC
0,5Oh i love Intensive Pony Unit
04LONG time ago
fluttercry: agreed, Morthal SUCKS
04Anyways
never been to Morthal either
how do we get his attention?
LordCelestia: Yeah, great vid, right?
whose attention?
2,14 you don't
04Just let them know that they can change their name AS LONG AS it resembles their original name; as long as there is something that is familiar to it
0,5It is!
Wrek's? No shot
2,14 he only sees the chat when he stops playing
Thats garus isnt it?
Wrek's wired in
04So SuperBrony64 could change it to SuperPony64, or SuperBrony32 or something
dang
Mention booze?
i have time for ponies while owning dragons :|
Ping him 1000 times and he probably wont answer until he looks at the chat
go back to sleep Cy
dont challenge me
07,01I mentioned this point because of the discussion with Ditzyhooves
inb4 arrow to the knee
>:(
00,06DitzyDoo?

07,01** nickchanges as moderator / teamleader /tech / streamer
07,01Nickchanges are allowed AS LONG AS it resembles their original name; as long as there is something that is familiar to it..

ValtheJean: so what high brow reason won't you read it?
Wrek is also goatborn.

Given all the mountain hopping he does. XD
04Now on to the actual infractions part

04I thought you were heading home?

0,5Wood
0,5^Thats what the guy is aying :3
and where does that put Vi/DerpyHooves`
0,5Ready?
0,5wood
Hi guys!
ValtheJean: you and your proper rules of writing that if someone doesn't follow them to the TEE it's apparently shit and isn't worth the time or effort it takes to type it out.
its wuld
0,5Nope. Wood.
I think
brb
00,06One or the other, she can honestly pick, I don't care.
and you guys reaaaaally gotta memorize I don't drive xD
SaLKiD99 only the regulars have parts. I dont think you were a regular when this occured
?
2,14 eeyup, that's the reason. I'm just an evil old guy
00,06^ I know that feel
indeed
-.-
A bunneh?
:D
Dovahkiin : Wuud...Nah KEST!!!
random_bunneh.exe
So, apparently, my country signed ACTA.
so yes we're on the way home but I am using le phone...anyways! Infractions?
So that sucks.
dohvahkin is such a fun word to say
FUUUUUUUU
0,5WAT
0,5Which coutnry did this?
Denmark.
poland?
>:|
04Were you okay with the document I made?
/me is having a breakthrough day.
I heard poland is in it too
Aye.
07,01-Mod Infractions
07,01	
07,01Mod infractions can consist of the following:
07,01	-Abuse of power (which includes nick spamming, color spamming, msg spamming, bullying or hazing of certain viewers, attention whoring (i.e. trying to purposefully draw attention to yourself beyond normal levels of interaction with the viewers), etc.)
07,01	-Promoting or advertizing of other streams or FiM related channels within BronyState without the proper authorization of the admins
07,01	-Attacking other BronyState moderators or admins
07,01	-Stream jacking without consent from the mod/admin who is streaming
07,01	-No showing new FiM eps without giving a typed notice to admins
07,01(just gonna run through it)
07,01Any comments?
07,01suggestions / feedback?
Why is the EU agreeing to this shit?!
its not
its done in secret meetings
In the words of the Medic, "I have no idea!"
Oh, wait.
away from the public
I just broke the law.
Assuming you're in the EU you're safe until the European Parliament approves it.
That's how you ask a question~!
08,14there ist no way. .
WTF
dat moonwalk
Dude.
What?
that's the document Ghosties redacted a few weeks ago, right?
13oh... this thread again
Woah woah what is EU messing up again?
07,01yes
nope , he was walking backwards
Oh hi, Shizuka.
07,01we're running through it now
Gumri: Nothing yet, but we're getting there.
'Tis ACTA.
13http://i.imgur.com/W6kEx.gif this thread is now about muffins
Muffins!
yay~
I still prefer cupcakes, though.
oh yeah!
if ACTA was Spyin' us , then how would they find us at all?
Cupcakes are the master desert!
whats the synopsis for the next episode?
SaLKiD99: That's another thing.
is it the RD one?
00,06Again, only problem I had with it is that the part saying that they will have a talk with Luna and Ghosties should be changed to they will have a talk with at least two of the administrators. It'll still be the two of you most of the time, but it's just formality in case one of you is on break or whatever.
It's literally impossible to closely monitor the data of every single citizen using the Internet.
Okay, bread is in the oven
only God can do that
you know , see us all
07,01that's the second part
07,01that's punishments
at the same time
Soon, so can lobbyists.
07,01let's focus on infractions first
indeed
Via 1's and 0's.
eeyup
00,06Again, have no problem with the infractions part.
04DCD said he didn't either a while ago
oh no wrek is sick
well I remember being all right with it....gimme a moment to think
04Dunno if he changed his mind
00,06I see nothing that needs changed, nor know of anything that needs added.
hmmmm?
I mean, Google automatically stores all data entered by it's users, but still they don't actually monitor it all.
2,14 inb4 IMMAVAMPIYA
wat
Jareera is a weird name , because there is a Bookstore called Jareer in KSA
inb4 betrayal
/me wakes up with a start as she realizes that she dozed off...
RainbowDash: I do that from time to other.
Also when I sleep.
07,01good, I like it as Ghosties wrote it. no comments from me
I keep waking up when I sleep, and it makes me believe I got no sleep at all.
07,01Waiting for DCD's feedback
DECAPITATIOUNN!!!
Kammerjunk: Okay... nice to know
I know, right!
/me pokes everyone
Ow.
/me prods Midnight_Tempest
O.o
Bloodband Marauders....I can't believe they betrayed you, Wrek, their name sounded so trustworthy! ;_;
/me pokes Midnight_Tempest
/me is poked and explodes
/me pokes back
/me jumps from the Dummy that got poked by Midnight_Tempest
got something....need a minute tho
/me pokes back
go ahead in the meantime
It's the walrus! Koo Koo Kah Joob~
those are horkers silly
Pft, walrus is best horker.
04We're all good with it
....besides, horker is much too close to hooker. :|
07,01Punishments
07,01Punishment for infractions of moderator rules follow:
07,01	-1st infraction: A private discussion between the mod who has made the infraction and 2 admins
07,01	-2nd infraction: A warning is issued to the mod from administration, and further infractions will result in severe consequences
07,01	-3rd infraction: Temporary demodding of the mod for any set period of time deemed applicable to the severity and nature of the infraction (this includes being kicked out of BronyState skype groups, and not being allowed access to the forum)
04So, we're just waiting for you
07,01	-4th (final) infraction: Complete dismissal as a moderator without chance to return in the future
no it isnt
It'd be easy to typo.
okay so
/me holds
more like whoreker amirite?
which Facility is more Evil : Aperture Science or Rainbow Factory?
When did everything become grey?
in light of recent events
o.o
CriticKitten: Sure, if you accidentally move your hand from the O to the R.
It happens.
hmmm
Discord strikes again :|
/me dances on the chat
nobody replies...
...but why?
/me is danced upon
08,14i jsut dun kno wsa wnet wrgno
08,146.9
04Oh Derpy
Oh, sorry, they're "Blackblood Marauders". That's even more trustworthy-sounding.
I think we should add a clause concerning BS semsitive information
I am trying SO hard to not go all out spelling freak.
13careful derpy~
Chatters ,
Y U NO Reply my Qeustion?!
04Sure
04Sounds reasonable to me
*Question
What question?
be it project info or stuff like with...you know
._.
Oh.
07,01I do have a item for that
07,01hang on
No clue.
/me hugs everypony
Never read the latter.
With one axe swing, you just knocked that dude into the air and sent him flying backwards
Good lawd
what question what?
hi DerpyHooves`
CriticKitten: His arm is augme- Wait, wrong game.
07,01Communication & Filesharing
07,01- make sure you inform everyone who needs to know about everything, even if you think someone else already has. It's better to be told twice than not at all.
07,01- As for filesharing, all movies and eps should be uploaded to dropbox in a timely manner, and images/audio/visual for projects should be brought to everyone involved in the project as soon as completed. And by timely manner I mean NOT on Thursday night.
07,01- make sure to record all BANS!
07,01- Who wants to sign up to help us retrieve the movie selection?
07,01-We want a rotation of certain ponies every week who are responsible for getting the files and putting them in the BMN folder.
07,01Please make also sure, if you are selected to check the quality if it's the correct movie / quality
07,01- Newsletter html uploads a soon as possible no delay untill the end of the week. [techies should get a login to check the newsletter pogo)
/me hugs DerpyHooves` back~
/me hugs DerpyHooves` back
04Jesus
Why is Spike best pony is the question.
Which Facility is more Evil : Aperture Science or Rainbow Factory?
04Dat wall
2,14 Kammer: he never asked for it
07,01Information sharing
07,01- What happends between bronystate stays between the bronystate team unless
07,01- If there's anyone around that's not BS Staff don't talk about BS stuff
that is the question
What a shame.
07,01not complete
Rainbow Factory by far
07,01derp brain
the ponies!
why y no loot ring wrek?
XD
I never read Rainbow Factory, but I know the grimdark part of it.
07,01first sentence is not complete
sounds like you got it covered
07,01if you can help me complete it
07,01we have it covered
07,01for the teammeeting
you're awesome big sister<3
04But we need to add that one thing to the infraction
07,01but I can also add it to the infraction document
07,01the big question is where
Oh great......Tornado watch on my town......:(
There are never any tornados in Denmark.
And yet, we build them to withstand one.
build our houses*
04-No sharing of BronyState information or material with anyone that is not a member of the team
There is no such thing as natural disasters in canada
04Sound good?
"unless stipulated otherwise by at least two members of the admin team"
04What?
We get tornado alerts all the time here in ND. You learn to make sure your wifi works in the basement.
damn it irc chat derp
play Portal 2!
dat derpage
or TF2
could be something we WANT leaked....
hello InsertCupcake
04:/
04We're not doing viral marketing yet
Salvê, InsertCupcake.
oh hai
04We haven't even really touched on something like that
Cello InsertCupcake
04So let's leave it out for now
or , open the Chat Room in the Stream
hi InsertCupcake
making Chatception
hello everyone
yeah but I supposed that when Luna said "unless", there could be exceptions
hi , InsertCupcake
04I have no idea what the "unless" is
04What her "unless" means, that is
Dat pony
Hey InsertCupcake ~
05,15Her cutie mark was XXX hahaha
I suppose it could be something like
true
we should rename Greenland "Iceland"
I don't know why, but I suddenly got Comfortably Numb stuck in my head.
07,01I don't recall it... but either works for me but for now maybe; (No sharing of BronyState information or material with anyone that is not a member of the team) is the best
and Rename Iceland "Greenland"!
I'm blaming you ponies because it's always you ponies.
07,01we can review / update the document later
04Yep
Startled by Song
"what to d'aww" ?
nah, I like them both named that way
07,01so just those two?
04So then I think we're good?
07,01yea for information sharing we are
i wonder when to sleep...
04Again, as a mod your judgment is your best tool
disclosing certain sensitive to a non staff member whom we want on board for a project
Gilda
but yeah
07,01we're not done yet
draw Gilda
choose a random chatter and draw him/her by the name
3:00 AM , 3:15 AM , or 3:30 AM?
as a pony
You really have a thing for Gilda don't you otakon
04That seems to still be encompassed with the rule
wouldn't he need a reference?
LunaTheBeloved: no, but he's NEVER drawn her.
Sure......
I've never heard this song before, but I like it
Hell
draw...
:P
umm...
draw Zecora!
Draw uh~
Draw drawings!
05,15draw an Adam Jenson Pony

Draw me in a seksy pose

Draw horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages!

Randomnerd: Yes.

Oh! Oh! Who's Streaming?

Wrek

But of course.
hi pony_6039
07,01yea I edited that
draw a pony you drawing a pony you?
you guys know when the newsletters are sent out?
04As long as it's just rhetorical, basically
07,01anything else?
/me was away for a while.
and i thought i had a bad hand-writing...no offense
hi Toshatron
04Because I really believe it'll be me and Luna about 95% of the time doing the private discussion
me in a seksy pose?
04I realize that it may not always be that way, but yeah
what did you choose...
i think he should do a film noir pony, that would be awesome
07,01then again we will post all private discussions on the forums
is fleur around???
07,01so you will have the chance to read upo
0,5Oh Fleur

07,01i'll add that line
2,14 no they haven't been sent yet
04What line?
should we show dari and ask if he wants to address anything when he's available?
07,01all discussions will be recorded and will be posted in the admin section on the forums
@Wrek?
SaLKiD99: he chose to test your patience :P
07,01if that's okay that is
lol
oh , ok
I just thought of something....Has anypony done a drawing of Andrew Bird as a pony?
04Dari has said that he thought it looked fine, though there was something he mentioned
04Can't remember what
Andrew Bird? what?
brb
00,06"All discussions will be recorded and made visible to all members of the adminsitrative staff."

If it has a top hat it makes it awesome.
I would cheer if it was.
3:30 AM it is , then
07,01We decided to recruit forum mods and IRC mods.. does this mean that after BS 2.0 the forum mods lose their hops?
08,14Phantom Tollbooth

04If we haven't told the forum mods that IRC is only temp, then we should tell them now
why do i always get startled when a music suddenly begins?
00,06We have told them.
ohh, yeah everything cool <3
04But I think we have
07,01maybe we should do that...
So, guys. What if SOPA and PIPA were distractions for ACTA?
00,06Multiple times.
04Yeah, okay
08,14anytihg i cna do to heeeeeelllppp?
07,01to avoid drama fest
07,01during the teammeeting
04We need evidence probably
0,14...
And what just if ACTA is a distraction for something even worse?
is this supposed to be Fluttershy` or what?
conspiracykeanu.png
0,14and then DerpyHooves` was Terry Bogard
00,06We'll bring it back up, but yeah, we have told them.
07,01want to do that now?
04I say tell them again during the team meeting
13OKAY
0,14^
No! nothing! for the love of celestia just sit there and do NOTHING!
07,01I don't know maybe telling them before the meeting would be better...(again)
07,01just as a reminder
08,14was ist the entire world is a distraction for another world
Oh, Goddesses...
You're a genius, DerpyHooves`!
00,06...tell them twice in the timespan of a couple days?
08,14was if ponies are watching your life und laughing as a sitcom?
/me points behind everyone and yells 'Distraction!' then runs off
00,06Seems a tad pointless, honestly.
13i do not know if i would watch The Shizuka Show .-.
Brillant~!
04Just in case
/me O_o
05,15http://i.qkme.me/35mm2h.jpg
so who are gonna remain as forum mods and who's gonna remain on IRC?
o.O
will some be both?
04Kirz, Shizuka and Saxy, I think, are IRC
wat
07,01Forum mods: LordCelestia/Slurrymoon/Scoot-Scootaloo/Fluttercry
07,01IRC mods: Nittany Discord/Shizuka/Kirzstryfe/Saxypretender
Then the ponies watching me are listing to Andrew Bird with me
04AH, yeah
04*Ah
i want my life to be a sitcom... that would be amazing
Vi: Then the ponies are definitely getting plenty of material to laugh at.
I see

04There's a chance my best friend will be over on Sunday and we're going to catch a PPV
04It's not a sure thing yet, but if he can he's going to visit
i wish i could draw something so awesome like that...
08,14I am in all of your heads. ..
08,14twisting all of your wires
08,14SOON
I wish i could draw :(
i treid to draw spike yesterday with instructions...and failed :/
07,01well.. I guess we can reschedule.... if we talk to our techies..
I can draw. Kinda.... i'm not an expert.. but... i can draw..
04:(
i cant draw a bloody stick man properly
04I mean, the event doesn't start until 7 or 8
well I think me and Dari could...oh wait. Sunday. Bad day for him
04But still...
DerpyHooves`, when that time comes, my body shall be ready.
DerpyHooves' : if you are in my my head , then what character am i thinking of?
my dad can't draw a straight line with a ruler
04We shouldn't do it if Dari isn't going to bethere
04*be there
00,06^
04He is the lead tech
lol
04after all
07,01yea.. scheduling meetings is hard for all of us...
08,14You are thinking of rarity of course
nope
04Just find a good day for Dari and then relay it to the techies
08,14Eeyup
07,01when can he confirm if he's coming or not?
00,06We should try to fit Raindrop and the Tech meeting in on Friday and Saturday next week.
derpy
nope
08,14you dont even know your own mind
00,06Depending on who can do which day.
Derpy, what Musucian am I thinking of?
04Raindrop?
07,01wait...
yes i do ?:3
*Musician
07,01you have friday off?
>:3
07,01that would be perfect
08,14LunaTheBeloved: Pablo Picasso
00,06I do not.
05Nyria
......
Since we only use, what, 20% of our brain?
07,01:(
07,01bah
00,06I meant early in the day if possible.
08,14;3
How do you know that!?!?!?!
That's incredible
That's not leading up to a Dashie joke, by the way.
07,01wat.. if we would have 2 meetings on Saturday?
07,01would you be okay with that?
00,06I would be.
Yes Wrek ~
07,01Ty/dcd?

08,14Honey_Whistle <3
04I don't you guys understand just how long the team meeting is going to be
no
what's wrong bro?!?
Hey Honey_Whistle ~
Rainbow-Dash: Derpy?

04*don't think you guys
OMG DEJA-VU MOMENT
138,14hloy cow werk
flutterwonder :)
I believe it is time I announce my project!
no no and no
Oh yes.
08,14RainbowDash: . . . Flutterbutt
This song.
no
04If our last meeting was NINE hours, imagine how long *this* one is going to be ;_;
I am making a series like Turnabout Storm, if you're familiar with it.
are you now?
What the?!
Indeed.
07,01actually the meeting with Tobias will be short
This song makes me think about when i became a brony *manly tear*
if you give up i will tell you...
07,01it's just a meet & greet
Who is this?
07,01there will be more meetings with him in the future
04But you said the tech meeting
The art, I mean.
/me returns from his pc needing debugging
05,15This was one of the first videos I saw on bronystate
I am the writer, LavenderHarmony is the musician, and we... don't have an artist, unfortunately.
owo!
07,01the tech meeting with our techies... I don't think would last 8 hrs... we're a small group.. it's not like the team-meeting this weekend
this is not a Video
04Wait
guess what im studying
this is a Live Stream! :)
05,15Flutterwonder video
derpy. do you give up?
05,15not the stream
herostar ponies?
04Wait
04Wait
jus so happens to be art
07,01tech-meeting / team-meeting is different
08,14RainbowDash: Ja
both
Once the time is needed, I might need voice actors, and more artists, naturally.
04...the tech meeting is *next* Saturday, yeah?
DerpyHooves`: Ja? what?
07,01yea.. we were talking about that
04Okay
04So
04I don't have to worry about Sunday
ponies art skyrim not picky XD
08,14.-.
07,01it was scheduled for Sunday
08,14I do give up
04o.O
herostar oh doing that artist training grounds thing?
07,01but we are re-scheduling
okay. It was Pinkie pie...
04Then what about next Sunday?
4 cases have been planned out. This is not a human in Equestria.
08,14AHA!
08,14I KNEW IT!
07,01Sunday is always problematic for Dari
taking classes for art, i might be able to help in the future
yeah...
07,01I was suggesting running 2 meetings on Saturday
07,01the meeting with Tobias is like I said short
They'd need to be show quality artwork.
and pc classes, so art+pc=NEW ARTIST
it should probably be a weekday but yeah
04So then the Tobias meeting and the tech meeting next Saturday?
07,01yes
BEHOLD! My bread: http://postimage.org/image/gbuff3u0v/ STAGE 1!
Youre gonna go far kid.
Internet is going so slow now....
04AHHHHHHHH okay

04I get it now
Stupid Storm!!!!
04Sure, sounds fine with me
07,01alright then
04That means *this* Sunday is free then
looks kinda undone.....
04So I don't have to worry
we made bread in school today xD
hababa?
I have a BRILLIANT musician. Not to say you aren't equally brilliant, Vi.
07,01eys

05,15So, just a warning...this is my best artistic skills at work...http://i1108.photobucket.com/albums/h402/mrbelmont/wtf.png

04Perhaps we really should start looking into giving the community back something
Then made a sandwich today
OK
08,14meh there ist no competition in musik, I do not mind <3
BEHOLD! My bread STAGE 2! http://postimage.org/image/qafe1l3gf/

it's blocked! :(
nice art fluttercry
13vivi ist sehr gut~
what do you have in mind?
04I keep hearing that we've become "serious," which is true, so then maybe like an anything goes board on the new forums
...by the KSA Govorment for me
my new wallpaper fluttercry
This is an example of her music: http://soundcloud.com/edge7/crossovers
advertisments...:|
That is about as good as i can draw though
07,01sure why not
DUDE I just had the best idea ever
RainbowDash: AdBlock~!

/me is wary, but listens
musiks gone
04...wut
/me tilts head
04........................wut
Honey_Whistle she have any more?

04Elaborate, if you would
08,14interessen Honey_Whistle (:
She's got plenty more.
i'm gonna try drawing some pony stuff but Pencil and Paper first
Bread STAGE 3! http://postimage.org/image/e9ty0uw1r/
Look up "My Dream Mare" on youtube.
That is her.
She's a good friend, as well.
Basically periods of time in which the rules are extremely lax on #pinkiepie, barring 34
...some day in the future , though
no wait, I'll go to her profile
that bread is how otakon
/me noms on uncooked bread
hot*
yeah
bearded bread
/me barfs
kind of like the mane channel back in our BRAVEER days
04Ehhhhhhh
I want the 10th Doctor's coat, but black instead
otakon : when i open those links , it shows me a blocked URL by the KSA Govorment
04And braveer was during a time when we had literally nobody in the channel
04Except for like two people
it's BREAD!
04That's why we allowed it
13i have idea... wrek should change the picture of me so i am looking left, und then put vivi in <3
goodlord thats horrible
ikr
13so that i am giving vivi mein rose~
04People want to know *why* we've become so super serious? When you have to cater to so many people, you learn to be cautious
Chat's derping let me restart it~
buffering this whole time? must refresh
08,14everyday im buffering
:$
07,01actually I like the idea.. of a free forum to roam...
/me 13dances
STAGE 4 the finished PRODUCT! http://postimage.org/image/3oa2oupq7/
There we go~
dat bread
:\
i'm back
:/
04Yeah, I think an anything goes board would be fine
04Just keep it all...in there
O_o
needs more pony otakon
welcome back SaLKiD99
00,06Well, not ANYTHING.
04All the NSFW stuff
04Wait
Right gonna go listen to some muzik....Ping me if you need me
it's BREAD
:P6_9:P6_9
00,06But yes.
not pony!
04Should we allow NSFW?
00,06No.
Anyways, 3 case designs had been made. 5 planned. 4 ideas. And a new "Sphere" mechanic that will have Twilight using a combination of Psyche Locks and logic, as I describe it, to find out when somepony is hiding something.
Live Stream ,
:P 6_9
00,06Borderline, yes.
00,06But not NSFW.
fail
Y U NO stop buffering?!
04DAT LINGERING TIE TO THE OLD BRONYSTATE
Everything needs more pony
Well how about
gonna refresh...again
1 had been RPed.
04Fine, then at least let them call each other faggots and niggers
And it was a pretty damn good RP, too.
/me goes to get snacks.... specifically TWIZZLERS!!
00,06-_-;
Honey_Whistle so is it game, video?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD2TbtxjTho&lc=rMuIn_QPkaICDbsD-bBJQk_p1lPqrhmsDd4v69v2ggM&context=G2da42adFAAAAAAAABAA&feature=g-all-c
time to activate second hdd until the stream is up again
00,06I hate those words.
00,06Soooooo much.
a silly filly room? A chat equivalent to Ghosties' proposed boards
0,5Gumri i was pinged from that "lc" in there
ha
00,06Ohgawdno.
still doesn't stops buffering...
Well, the mechanic would have been added to a game, but it's gonna be part of the series.
DARN IT
for all those lacking in Vitamin Br>>>> http://postimage.org/image/57954tnsv/
00,06I said I hate those words, I didn't say no.
04Oh, well
00,06But as for the chat room... gawd no.
04Don't go in there then
so video?
I'd explain it, but the Sphere mechanic is complicated.
00,06Everyone would flock to it, and it would be an arse to moderate.
So yes, it's a video.
ah ok then
00,06The anything goes forum would at least be easy to moderate because... it's a forum.
PonyKart looks sweet
going to close the site , open it up , and seee if it doesn't stops buffering
04Yeah, let's just have an anything goes board
04Easier to moderate, like Sprinks said
I will also need voice actors, and I'm just here to get as much help as I can.
It's far too early to get voice actors, though.
/me noms on twizzler
Awww...:'(
got home
gimme a sec
Anyways, thank you for listening to me on this.
Your call is very important to us.
04Okay
you're welcome, sounds interesting
it still doesn't stops buffering , so i will miss the drawing of Fancy Pony :'(
Yeah~ Stream doesn't work for me~
well , it's 3:34 AM in here , so i'm going to sleep
Confirmed cases: 1 - Vase Breaking Case. 2 - Spike Thievery Case. 3 - R
RD Impersonation Case.
bye , everypony!
4 - ??? 5 - Secret.
:D i just got a screencap of my character in skyrim riding a too scale pony...
this was , far by , the best chat room ever!
None of them will be murder cases.
/me perks head up at Honey_Whistle's comment
/me disconnects , then go to sleep
My RD case is probably my most well thought out yet.
Vase Case is decent, but very unsettling until the very end.
Now, I must read "The Natural".
Honey_Whistle! Haven't seen you in a while
http://i.imgur.com/cHJQu.jpg lol awesome
/me huggles
Midnight_Tempest: That is awesome.
you know you have to go to bed when you are the only on in facebook chat...gn8 everypony
IKR?
So the stream is currently down~
/me laughs at Midnight_Tempest's pic...
ekips: You know you should go to bed when you have a hard time focusing.
my pony is awesome and its so easy to make them that size
/me noms cherry fruitsnacks
ekips: And sweet dreams.
Anyways, anypony wishing to get a preview, but not 100% accurate view of case one, here you go: http://z13.invisionfree.com/Equestria_Daily_RP/index.php?showtopic=385

Honey_Whistle: That is hilarious and awesome.
Thankies.

And I can't find it on Google.

Magical white ponies are suited for leadership; black ponies are suited to be servants.Stop learning! You will overcome any obstacle by resorting to strength in numbers (of friends).Girls that wear rainbows are butch.You need the government (ideally a monarch invested with supreme ultimate power and a phallic symbol strapped to her forehead) to tell you what to do with your life.
Seems legit

emangamer: woah
holy shit dat temptation to put brony
otakon: that was a legit review of MLP

0,5Diary excerpt: “I love wearing heels, it makes me feel like a pony!
Dken2021: No but something brought it to my mind and I felt like I should share

Gumri: indeed she did. She put the SMACK DOWN on her
0,5She did?

hello again
Blah blah blah feminism blah blah blah.
Phase4: hello!
stupid flash crash
lali-ho Phase4, again
no stream?
RawketLawnchair: Faust is a self proclaimed feminist
Impossibu
what is a feminist exactly?
"I have been a lifelong feminist"
i don't really understand it
suprise you don't know
Gumri: a person who wants women to have equal rights to everyone else
Gumri: not only rights but be treated the same as men.
oh well that sounds reasonable then... Who doesnt want that
wow, flash has already died on me
didnt take long
Gumri: no one. thats why feminists are kinda out dated
"Feminism is a collection of movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights for women."
yep, they won
well everyone ridicules it because the loud obnoxious ones (like that woman who wrote the artice) are always heard
and the sane ones are never heard

And the happiness of ones heart.
Bronystate Oscars. We take all the movies in 2011 that we watched, and the mods make a list of their top 10 A and B Movies. and then Top 10 worst, and we vote on them.
Thats because its a sequel to perhaps one of the greatest movies of all time
I've never seen Ferris Bullers Day Off.
Ha ha.
Babes In Toyland wins
I didnt see alot of movies in 2011, and of those...I dont remember much
then, after the votes are in, they announce them.
That was terrible
I think it'd be a fun little event for everybody, plus we would make the mods remember all the worst films they've had to sit through.
0,14...Babes in Toyland...
0,14ugh...
/me shudders.
SaxyPretender: were you here for Spider's Web?
I think me and Saxy killed ourselves about 5 times
0,14eeenope
0,14I think Spider's Web was there the week before I joined
13i was not here for either WMC movie
I dont think Ive seen Babes in Toyland.
Heard of it
0,14Shizuka, LadyCanary, consider yourselves blessed
Where the streams at.
Shizuka: if you're here tomorrow, you'll be here for the 3rd.
13but the point of WMC is that it never ever ever gets shown again
0,5OMG
0,5Babes in Toyland
0,5-_-
0,14sadly, LunaTheBeloved and I don't share that fate

11,01The gaming industry has sequitis as well right now.
0,14and now I am listening to Kiss From a Rose
yeah
0,14because that song
Call of duty 8 ?
0,14is amazing
xD
0,14and one of the few high points of Batman Forever
11,01Most major games that have come out or are coming out end in numbers.
/me is trembling
yeah
Well Played! *applause*
11,14*coughSkyrimcough*
Thank you
LOL
One day
SaxyPretender: /)
cause It doesnt interest me?
11,01There will be a CoD x until CoD stops being profitable.
I WILL be as awesome as Armstrong!
0,14(\ Flaria
and that's part of the reason why we all love ponies so much
ORGINALITY
11,01Activision is all about profit and franchise milking.
^
you WILL
YOU CAN DO IT!
Same game, different skin
11,01They'll drop it once it's dry (Like with Guitar Hero).
hi meh!
hi otakon
but sadly
11,14only reason CoD hasn't been run into the ground is because you can't drag+drop songs like Guitar Hero
11,01CoD is fun, but you can't deny that they are low-effort.
I'm not seven feet tall
:/ say it like im a retard why dont you
yeah
once you played one, you've pretty much played them all
espically multiplayer
otakon: yet
eh whateverr you're at is close enough
besides, I look more like Sig than Alex
Armstrong is truely the only man who can sparkle and be manlier then ever.
11,01Well, CoD is just a jovial hardcore MP game now.
^
hell yeah!
11,01And I'm not an MP fan.
11,14^
11,01Especially of the theoretical anti-newbie imbalance of that game.
to each their own
lol
11,14well, I like multiplayer games that require a bit of skill and cooperation
What?
CIVILIZATION!
everyone has their own likes and dislikes
I know
wasnt trying to talk you down
The question mark you put on it made me feel stupid though
11,01I'd rather stick to killing programs then frustrate of getting killed repeatedly by humans.
that's it!

11,01I used to enjoy MP, then BF2 came along. BF is my least favorite MP series.
hi NullRadix
11,01Hard games centered on stats.
that MUSIC!
lol
Courage hundrefold, muscles THOUSAND FOLD!
I prefer games with a good story line
Best music?
11,01Most of my time playing BC2 consisted of complaining over stats.
they never make those anymore :(
11,01Yeah.
damn inspiring is all
Chrono Trigger :)
11,01I've jumped out of FPSs for the moment.
What kind of suspense do you like?
lol I jumped out of gaming in general, I don't really play that much
11,01Saints Row 3 was fun. I actually got every non-DLC trophy for i.t

/me just got done rereading the first part of Dragon ball
RAWRity: ah, good times
now to pony for a bit before moving onto the alerting code
/me really thinks it should have ended after Gokue beat Picollo Junior.
after a water break
/me wishes Dari would stream some Doctor Who
me too
I could go for some Who with the bronies atm
yes it should
Because after that, we got the Saiyans...and then Frieza and Namek..and then the Androids and Cell...and then fucking Majin Buu
RAWRity: but I like Z
but toriyama was asked to do more
and then GT.
no
GT had NOTHING to do with Toriyama
it is a bastard child of Z if you ask me
otakon: Toriyama actually did write some for GT, as well as acting as a consultant.
yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYxSyENA00&feature=channel_video_title best use of duke nukem theme
so he approved everything that ahppened there.
but he didn't do it like Z and the origanl
otakon: only because the last 350 Chapters of the manga had been nothing but editorial mandate.
what is this i don't even...
back from my water break. water is good
argh
so as much as people dislike it, GT IS canon.
Still, love me some Dragon Ball
I really did like dragon ball, at least half the supporting characters did something, in Z, their just there
sup everypony
well
Freiza ate a crab... wait that happened?
is the stream down?
Yes
MirrorImage: eeyup
somehow i would have thought i'd remember that
vfvccc: eeyup
http://i40.tinypic.com/ritd7m.jpg Pony? More like Coney. Ha ha.
DUDUDUDUDUUUBBSSTEEPPPP.
Z was essentially "Vegeta and Gohan try to fight off the big bad until Goku returns from whatever has killed/incapacitated him this time"
hi vfv... he left?
and then my chat died
huh
dat wood derpy
the thing I liked about Z was seeing gohan growing up between sagas
/me is so glad he wrote the 'Reload Chat' code but so annoyed he needed to
Dken2021: and STILL not doing crap.
that he'
/me never understood dragon ball
I do
well
he's done stuff, like defeated cell...... and.......
the original at least
Phase4: what's not to understand? People fight and yell and throw energy at eachother.
Z is a little too much GAAARRRRR!!!!!
RAWRity: i find that boring
I shall scream for five minutes!
Dken2021: and then let the power to protect the world die.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDGGU8scXRw&feature=related
otakon: have fun AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAing
Surprise
at least Dragonball had lovable characters and good story
Phase4: the first part (pre-saiyans) was a lighthearted romp for the most part, and was more focused on gags and stuff than fights, until the last couple arcs.
and one of the best fights

as far as I'm concerned, this should have been the last page of dragon ball: http://i22.mangareader.net/dragon-ball/194/dragon-ball-1949701.jpg
RAWRity: i tend to prefer storylines more than comedy, are we talking about the show or the manga?
the manga was great for Dragonball
Phase4: manga. Show was padded to all hell because they wanted as much money out of it as possible.
ah, well the show bored me silly
manga might be good
there hasent been a stream for 2 days, wonder why
there was stream earlier today
there has been
or am i getting time mixed up again
you are
ah, missed it
you just haven't been on at the right time

this has nothing to do with anything: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/featured_items/icons/carousel/000/000/540/mermaid-thornberry.gif

I don't either

Because stupidity.

the difference is that Baby was just a bland, poorly sung song.
sounds like if soulja boi was a woman instead
you closed it so hard chrome went with it
my god that Sweetie Deraille at 0:50

on the friday vid?
What?
"Stupid Hoe" is actively horrible in a way that can't be understood by most sentient life.
No.
It was that^
This song is actually worse than big sean's dance.
Dance was at least awful in a way that you could laugh at.
dafaq?
I don't see how people can listen to that stuff and actually enjoy it.
RAWRity: It's like I was watching a parody video made to be a parody video
... except they're actually trying to sell this
Stupid Hoe is just...you can't do anything but look exasperated at the screen as it keeps going...and going...and GOING....
Flaria: and that's why Nicki Minaj is awful.

Whoever o.o

0,14and later Dken2021!
and hopefully, I'll be awake during BMN
0,14also, I lasted 17 seconds of that song
What a trooper.
you guys wanna know what the worst song I've ever heard is?
because I'm sharing it either way.
enope
It'll probably be a purposefully bad song.
....You FOOL

/me sees video picture, closes window

/me closed the tab right when she saw the band
not watching it
Derpy_1337_2: that was an excelently made gif
0,14>Blood on The Dance Floor
0,14eeenope
just TRY to sit through it.
I've done it.
I've done it MULTIPLE TIMES as I've showed it to people.
0,14And you're a hero for that.
Which came first, this or Chingy's Holdiae Inn?
Afterwards, you feel...accomplished in having survived it.
0,14but I don't wanna dream tonight ;n;
i'm going to do what alot of viewers did (judging by the liked/disliked counts) and ignore that song
0,14and since nightmares are part of dreams
Dream a Little dream of meee~
SaxyPretender: trust me, you have to do it once. It's a right of passage.
0,14I had my rite of passage already
0,14when I became a MOD
I can actually ignore the voice and pay attention to the beat.
/me keeps listening to http://youtu.be/xDZUyE-Dty8
dat 00:00:00
[16:00:14] <Tovler> dat 00:00:00
one of our clocks is wrong
my ears
allso hello gmt-5
god
I can take this
Because this song, THIS SONG, is what I point to when anybody tries to complain about whatever overplayed popsong they think is the currectn worst song ever.
except
You do not get to talk about bad music until you've sat through an entire BOTDF song.
I suddenly feel like puking now
Hasbros R&D Department http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4MXa4L6-UpA
like that one who's name i cant remember, gimi a sec and i;l find it
half way through'
damn it
0,14You know what?
0,14Fine, I'll do it.
I never knew noise could make me physically ill
0,14If I don't make it
0,14I love you all
Is
otakon: that's how bad this song is.
yes
I knwo
You're my hero Saxy ;^;
ogsd
otakon: and i've sat through it OVER A DOZEN TIMES.
well... that wasn't so bad.
/me salutes.
yem typoing acan't conscetrarte
You can do this!
/me does not have a clue how to find it actualy
0,14...
Phase4: no comment?
how the HELL did you sit through this 12 times?
this is the equivalent to the brown noise!
Derpy_1337_2: comment on what?
0,14It's bad.
it's over
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4MXa4L6-UpA
oh thank god it's over
I wonder if I've now built up enough tolerance to sit through Whitney?
0,14but not in a way that makes me wanna destroy things
Derpy_1337_2: no, that seems about right
0,14more like
0,14this baffles me
okay, back to FMA: B
XD
Back to Dan Vs for me.
SaxyPretender: basically, that's how it is for me. It's the type of bad that inspires a world-weary "...what?" more than rage.
0,14ahhh
Dan Vs. FIM is now the best tumblr
RAWRity: you must have built up a tolerance, that made me physically ill more than anything actually disgusting
now, if I weren't convinced that this was meant to be a joke by some kid with garage band, THIS would be the worst song I've heard: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOrtleIg4Q
I can stand the smell of 10K rotting chickens in the summer heat
Fish bait dog vomit
but THAT almost made me puke
0,14I find it odd that I can stand this, but not Emperor
SaxyPretender: emperor?
0,14Death/black metal band
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOQ6EYS64JI&feature=related
yuck
0,14can't remember which genre it technically fell in
0,14but oh man
0,14did not like it
otakon: you listening to that other song I posted?
redstone computer with 150 BITS of ram http://youtu.be/lB684ym3QY4
I just don't like Death/Black Metal really
RAWRity: which one?
otakon: this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOrtleIg4Q
"Lincoln Log Holocaust" by Hello Kitty Suicide Club
0,14in any case, that BOTDF was terribad
it's all on the left channel
SaxyPretender: just try to listen to the first 30 secs of the first one.
and reminds me of a horror game from teh 8 bit era
Dude. Redstone is love.
Good night, everypony...
RAWRity: nope, cant listen to the helo kitty song
Night Honey.
night Honey_Whistle- sleep well
3night Honey_Whistle-!
ngight Honey_Whistle-
Night Honey_Whistle
0,14later Honey_Whistle-
xD "Night Honey"
Live long and prosphere, as they say it.
/me shifts eyes
Prosphere? o.o.
prosper*
actually this would be good in a horror movie tbh
or a horror game
/me is pro sphere
0,14MY EARS
Is that like, a sphere that's a pro at being a sphere?
otakon: no. no it would not.
squrs are so yesterday
but that screaming in the left channel is annoying
squares'
0,14but I lasted 14 seconds
/me lasted 25
eh
Triangles.
SaxyPretender: not long enough. to become a true man, you must go at LEAST 30 secs
I'm sitting through it all
StringTheory: wouldnt you be all for strings?
/me has sat through this one over a dozen times as well.
0,14oh come on man ;n;
SaxyPretender: DO IT FILLY.
Wellll.
0,14NO
RAWRity: HOW? you MUST have built a tolerance to it
/me lasted...5 seconds.
String theory refers to about three things.
otakon: because I have a motto. If I'm going to talk shit about a song, I'm going to listen to it through its entirety.
0,14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3lQPCm0DhU
String instuments, music theory, and string theory, the physics thing.
plus I've shated it with others in order to spread the pain.
hmm
*shared
0,14my link is what happens when you take good fighting game music
thanks RAWRity, the four horsemen would be PROUD
It works so perfectly, I had to use it.
StringTheory: allso refers to character sequences
Huh? O.o
computer science / programer lingo
Same thing with talking about movies or shows. If I haven't watched all of it, I won't talk about it outside of my first impressions of it, and even then will make it clear that I haven't seen it in its entirety.
0,14ahh, strings
That's why. I'm no programmer. Though I tried...
/me has to leave
Nuuuu. Ok. xD
brb, about 20/30 min
see ya Phase4
Bye Phase4!
Alright.
Baaaiii.
0,14later Phase4!
actually SaxyPretender this isn't that bad tbh
OH
String.
Character string.
I remember o=
0,14the song is kinda in the "So bad, it's good" territory
Ahh.
also, i don't know how Lana Del Rey has a music career.
eh
Who?
same way Jonah Hill got a nomination for a Oscar I guess
lana del rey is the woman who gave us THIS performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zrvD-o8cII
*pant*...im....back -_-; *colapses*
you okay?
Hello Darf14!
work.... to... hard....
Whatever you do, don't die.
I'll now watch RedLetterMedia's long review on Red Tails.
i hear Red Tails sucked
Hi LadyCanary
really?
I heard different from the usual source
otakon: 33
% on RT
well that's RT
otakon: generallys peaking, a score that low isn't a good sign.
hmmm
dang, should have put Red Tails for B movie
this girls not bad
it JUST came out
ok.... never mind
The podcast I like said it was horrendous. The editting and music were even bad.
eeyup
I concur
Then good news, RAWRity! He did.
before he ruins more movies
I think he was just an executive producer of something.
CriticKitten: not really. He's just said he isn't doing Star Wars anymore.
Good thing he retired before he made starwars V10.5 with more Jar Jar
Exactly, so he retired
gods more Jar jar? really?
CriticKitten: Star Wars wasn't the only movies he made.
Because Star Wars is pretty much all he's actually directly done in the last several years. >_>
and he's still working as a procuder.
Theres Indiana Jones
Producer, there, am pretty sure.
Procuder.
Yeesss.
and they ARE planning Indy 5 from what I hear.
He hasn't written films in a while.
....RAWRity.
At this moment if there is no ad for Indy 5 then its a rumor in my book
LadyCanary: yes?
The guy who directed The Wire directed Red Tails :(
I did NOT just hear that. NOPENOPENOPE
Mostly produced. Only stuff he's written "recently" was the Star Wars prequels. Him saying no more Star Wars is basically retirement.
>_>
There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies. THREE.
eeyup
four
0,144
I did not like the "fourth" film.
CriticKitten: depending on the person, the Producer can have a lot of say on what goes on with a movie.
No, there's three. There's also no Last Airbender movie. :D
you know? with the toasting the fridge?
Not this AGAIN Saxy >.<
Indy 4 is ok, its not bad but its ok
^^
Darf14: incorrect: CGI Groundhogs.
If explosion then refridgerator.
If potato then soup?
oh yeah, I forgot about the CGI Groundhogs
there's a reason "Nuking the Fridge" became a new phrase for Jumping The Shark
0,14If Jesus then Aliens
Yes.
XD I remember you saying that Saxy.
what?
no Frying the Coke?
0,14eeyup, LadyCanary
Cocaine?
lol, NC Reference
eeyup
good eye
o.O...
otakon: Frying the Coke is a forced meme if i ever saw one.
hmmm
maybe but I like it
yeah, even thoug his review was funny the meme was forced
granted it's not on the level of cancer as Arrow to the Knee, but still.
ah
Arrow>>>>>>Knee
Arroz.
I prefer Foh Shro Dah than arrow to knee
>>>>------(knee)------>
Ar Row Knee!
Fus roh yay?
hmm.....
Hmm.. I wonder how many pony words of power we can create.
no idea
also, can I just say? I really hope they don't make Ferris Beuller 2.
Why?
......I wonder if Derpy would be in the next episode.... just a thought...
RAWRity: funny you should mention that.....
Well, WHEN has making a followup to an older movie ever worked well.
otakon: I knw
that's why I mentioned it.
Huh? I dunno
Indy 4,
Tron Legacy
You never know RAWRity.
OOOh
0,14...all movies that I had no problem liking
we need Talladega Nights for B one day!
Hey, the soundtrack for tron was great
0,14^
which tron?
0,14Legacy
Damn right it was.
Legacy
ok
I have like, no clue what you all are talking about xD
/me enters the room
Besides the Tron music. That music was amazing.
I want a black overcoat
taking something that's been around that long, and trying to modernize it, or bring it back, doesn't work because the way cinema and storytelling works has evolved greatly since then.
so many mods, yet no stream :(
0,14I haven't earned the right to stream ;n;
So you end up with either a movie that feels like an anachronism that we can't take seriously, or a film that feels too distant from its predecessors to feel like a continuation.
wow, didnt know that
/me gives Saxy the left to stream
0,14woooooooo
Now you have the left to stream saxy!
Tron was still good though.
Childish example that goes along with Rawrity is charlie and the chocolate factory
speaking of movies, when is the lottery this week?
xD Lottery.
Friday methinks
I think its either tomorrow or Saturday
Darf...
:P
/me thwacks Darf14 with a rolled up newspaper
X_X\
If the mods would get the newsletter to the home page...
Saxy...
At the party for finishing of recording episode 307 Fluttershy just had seven tequila slammers and made out with a fish.
/me blames the mod that's awake
Uh.
What?
^
so much ^
trolestia tweeted that
Nice.
Jim the Fish?
and that's why I follow her on twitter.
0,14the left isn't working ;n;
aww
You have to use it the opposite way you'd use the right to sream Saxy
... I should make a twitter.
Try blowing on the cartridge Saxy
That might help
Did you try a hard reset?
/me blows on the stream cartridge.
0,14...is it workingnow?
Use the cotton swab, it works for me
Yawp! Loady circle the movie part 8 of 9 is playing now!
0,14yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
NO SPOILERS!!! I haven't seen this part yet!
Revenge of the Buffer!
The Buffering!
Don't ruin it for me guys!
sorry, I'm not on the stream atm
wow, the return of the Buffer is the best movie I ever seen!
watching FMA: B
/me sits in anticipation
Did you try a hard reset?
guys...
I heard deleting system32 helps with computer speed for windows

This is absolutely RIDICULOUS. But why am I giggling so much
0,14you know...
The first part, before the actual "poetry" starts
LadyCanary: because it's Paw Dugan saying "Ass" over and over.
This poetry is brilliant
that describes poetry
0,14I think I should make readings
0,14in this vein
What the hell am I listening to? xD
Lots and lots of ASS.
xDD
hmmm, a robot apears to be trying to advertize something to me on msn
This poetry needs more ass
That poetry was
well
crap
But the first verse was ok
The first verse reminded me of Bender
I would hope it's crap, it's "Dance (A$$)" by Big Sean
... Alright, I'm bored of it.
Yawp...
And now, he's something I hope you'll really like.
heres*
Speaking of Bender, we should stream Futurama

Pony_of_War: ofc! she's so sweet and talented we wouldn't we?
My little pony needs more female fans. if you had told me i would think that last year i would not have belived you

Somepony said "[Vivi's] not here" and then somepony else said "good" :(
I got a few of my female friends into the show.

otakon: y u say good after i say vivi isnt here :(
All females i tried to get into the show dont talk to me anymore xD

I said good after Shizuka said taking over the world, cue the music!
13dat ping
/me cues Pinky and the Brain music for Shizuka
0,14but that's not her theme
lol
This Guilty Gear music
dat pipe organ
0,14Kiss from a Rose is Shizuka's theme, right?
I like pipe organ music
otakon: thanks for that, its stuck in my head now
13is now
eeyup
I need a new text tone, any suggestions
0,14also, someone's listening to Holy Orders, I see
Pinky and the Brain!
and FML WHY aren't there "ringtones" for text messages???
One is a genius, the other's insane.
I want to be able to tell who texted me based on the tone!
I feel like taking over the world... *starts installing evil genious*
Hmm... They should do that.
awesome, all new youtube videos are being converted to webm
umm
yay?
What?
i get the html5 player on most youtube videos now
0,14oh sweet
it's a video format
but I'm not familiar why it's better than flash tbh
whats sweet? *gasp* Is it a cherrychanga?
Alright.
... ^ no.
why thank you RAWRity
0,14HTML5 is more lightweight than Flash, iirc
so here's some good music: "Che" by Break of Reality http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSxqadOz4r0
otakon: flash is crap and requires a large broken plugin, html5 video players run in the same javascript engine that the rest of the web works on
ah
0,14...
0,14oh shit, Sinfest
then why is it every time I sign up for the HTML5 beta
13uh oh
it SUCKS
13uh oh~
0,14ikr?
actualy runs faster than flash, doesnt have the same layering isues
what Shizuka?
uh oh what?
13i wonder...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQPF-wgBGis
13what if slick bumps into storytime zombie...
13or..
Phase4: tell that to my slower loading video
13FYOOSH
Dat Electric Guitar, dat pipe organ!
0,14oh man
... Chrome has been mean to me tonight.
0,14Sinfest has the potential to be very very epic
otakon: never had that problem, infact i have the exact oposit. loads faster in html5
13it already is
13deep character arcs everywhere
0,14well true
anyone here read the webcomic "Blip"?
Phase4: well, goodie for you. HTML5 hates me and so does Google Chrome
0,14but I'm very interested in seeing what happens with Slick
RAWRity: I have a bit
never heard of Blip
13and updates every day... unlike a certain other really good comic who will remain nameless but whose initials are megatokyo
ummm
Google Chrome usually loves meh.
mfw pony is in most viewed http://www.youtube.com/videos?feature=mh
no idea what you speak of Shizuka ....
otakon: not a clue
13it's code
0,14he's technically the main character, but has had no spotlight for a while
I recomend it to everybody. Great characters, great humor, and a very, very unique premise.
eeyup
I hate those damn
well
those damn bastards
so whats the basic setting and story of Blip?
66 degrees at night!
Darf14: you have to read it
13i wish it were that warm
no spoiling
13i have to settle for a high of 22
first page of Blip for those interested: http://blipcomic.com/1/
*sigh* Ok..... *goes to google*
why is this recomended for me? http://youtu.be/Awmu0-8aXSQ
oh.... that works too *abandons google*
I'd be more intersted in a TARDIS
Darf14: you have to give it a few strips, but it's good
Darf14: it's set in our world...kinda
Phase4 because ponies
Ok ill give it a shot, I will give it my 30 Pg rule
i must go, i leave you with this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zac3N7LHzK8
later
2 Pages in is where the weird starts, Pg 40 is where the premise is fleshed out, and you learn what the hell the weirdness was about to begin with.
Bye Phase4!
0,14later Phase4!
see ya Phase4
I was wrong, it's working now!

I like balddumborats voice better tbh
A who what now?
0,14I'm really used to balddumborat's voice
yeah, me too
0,14but I feel like what they went with in the show
0,14fits the character archetype well
0,14and as such, I'm ok with it
From Trolestia Twitter: Applejack recently realized that sales go up when your store motto is "Bucking for your pleasure"
0,14XD
indeed that XD

/me 13yawns
you gonna go to bed too Shizuka?
/me gives Shizuka a blanket and pillow
/me 13rubs her eyes
well
you can try and stay up
13my eyes are so heavy... i can still feel the strain of staring those tiny twisted pairs into position...
hmmm?
okay
one more ep of FMA: B
then I'm gonna go to bed myself
/me 13curls up next to the fireplace to sleep
13nacht ponies~
Goodnight Shizuka <3
sleep well dear and dream of ponies
Shizuschlafen: were you making computer cabling?
13had to replace two RJ-45s that had the tabs break off, und a flat cable... had to work extra hard to stop colors from mixing...
ouch
that's why don't don't do stuff like that when tired
mfw I actually understood that.
lol not me
13staring at impossibly tiny wires (ALL your data goes over those things!) less than a few inches from your eyes for about half an hour each... not good
College IS paying off!
13this was earlier today... just still feeling the strain...
yeah
sleep will help with that
13i think i may always remember TIA-EIA whatever the number is B... white-orange orange, white-green blue, white-blue green, white-brown brown
13so like i said earlier as advice... don't buy flat patch cable... you will have a headache if you have to re-jack it...
13nacht~
night!~
11,01I'm heading off as well.

To all of bronystate, good night and sleep well!
night otakon
soooo..... seems to be just you and me Fleur
/me stares at Phase4 blankly
what.....
it is
/me continues to stare with a blank expression
/me occasionally is stopping in to check on echos in chat
Phase4*\
http://derpy.me/z8yhW
helloes
ohai Mutterguy
so now its Mutterguy Fleur and i
/me just stares at a wall
hurray
Anyway, I won't really be talking much since I've got a ton of meaningless notes to take
what are the notes about?
hmmmm, my internet apears to be dying
just boring notes for spanish about a spanish person we have to do a spanish presentation about
/me turns her head and stares at Phase4 blankly
/me stares at the now recognizable female know to the bronystate community as Fleur
/me glomps fleur and flees before knifes are drawn
/me turns and stares at Mutterguy blankly as he runs
k, that's freaky. What broke her?
not sure
Fleur: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1892/
lets see if some pinkie fixes her
/me stares into nothingness
that might be as good as the intravenous antibiotics I'm on. oh wait. nope
/me looks at the wall, what's there?
/me stops blinking as she stares at nothing
Midnight_Tempest:, Fleur is brokened, what do we do??
http://xkcd.com/1008/ i love xkcd
i dont know, who was she borked?
how*
Yes, xkcd is great
/me 's ear moves slightly at the sound of her name
hmmmm
/me continues to stare
I particualarly like the math ones
Fleur
she just stares
/me pokes Fleur
good morning bronystate!
/me 's right eye looks at Midnight_Tempest
morning derpy_derpy
and Fleur, if you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you
o.o whoa... thats creepy... but so cool... *stares back at Fleur*
anybody here read dragonlance?
I have previously
just the main series though
I felt so nerdy, but so great when last saturday I was taking a computer science test, and one of the questions referenced LoTR, Merlin, and Raistlin and Fisban in the same question
/me recites, unblinkingly "If you are to hunt monsters, take care as you may become a monster yourself""
Someone should probably get some crucifixes and holy water for Fleur
/me 's left eye looks back
nah, we only need to worry if she draws a knife
/me 's right eye returns to staring at nothing
I have diagnosed the problem... its severe stream deficiency...
interesting fact about mew, the character data for mew is not stored with the rest of the pokemon but is actualy where the debugging code used to be before it was removed for shipping
/me 's left eye returns to staring at nothing
O.O that's cool
it was put in as an easter egg, nintendo wasnt aware of it when it was released
although pokemon has been run into the ground so much by now it's sad
/me 's eyes dialate and her muscles go limp
yeah, 5 generations is a little much
/me does worry about the consequences of sentient icecream
/me continues to stare at nothing
http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/ << is where i read about the mew info
I wonder if fleur is becoming skynet
/me hands Fleur some CHOCOLATE
and if I ever coded a game for nintendo I would definatly put in an easter egg like that
/me doesnt move a muscle, still staring
/me stands in front of Fleur, staring right back
/me stares past Midnight_Tempest at nothing
/me sits down in the corner and opens his laptop
she needs ponies... lots of ponies in the form of internet streamed media... also dont make her mad IF she is becoming skynet
yeah I dunno if using her belly button as a usb point would be pleasant. thanks for talking me down man
o.o
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/678/
/me dances around doing a jig then explodes
btw, be carefull when looking for pinkie images on mylittlefacewhen
/me 's eyes slowly move around slowly, independant from eachother
@____@
O_O she's gone derpy
there is a certin youtube video based of a fanfic, nither of wich will be named, thats poluted the pinkie tag
my god, Fleur is now canon
she's been canon for ages
like 4 months
maybe she needs a canon
you mean cannon
ya, that
neat, i got google talk working with pidgin. now if only i had a need for google talk
I know the feeling. I got my older sister to let me have her webcam, and got it set up with a second one working at the same time, and then I realized I had absolutley no reason for having them
/me blinks and her eyes lock on Midnight_Tempest
O_O uh oh...
you better be carefull
/me blinks again
well... she's blinking... thats good, right?
/me blinks twice quickly
i think so...
um... i'm not sure
once for yes... twice for no?
/me turns her torso quckly and pops her back
=____=
O_O
-_-
O_O
/me turns the other direction and pops her back again
ohay ninja Shy
/me starts to back away slowly
I feel like this is the Dr. Who episode midnight.
why am I awake...? =____=
/me waits in suspense
I feel its more like Blink...
Shy as you have issues sleeping
/me is now afraid to blink
well, just the silent person in a courner, then blinking, then learning
/me stops moving and thinks, then starts moving towards Fleur slowly
/me blinks a few more times
Ohai
O.o lolwut?
oh good, Fleur's better
I was meditating
should we try to learn what broke her, like a debugging team
/me just relised that his internet might be out tomorow
urghhh...
she's good
:'(
/me hugs Fleur
if its out i will miss the episode
:( you will be missed at the stream
I'm going to anyway
as long as everyone is ok and DerpNet didnt activate... we're all fine
you ok Shy ?
I wouldn't worry about derpnet anyway
/me hugs Midnight_Tempest with a confused look on her face
^_^ hai Fleur, welcome back to the chat
why was I woken up...?
Fleur, I was worried so I glomped you. hope you're ok with that?
ohaey...
I can still change my name... eheh...
hello Kimiko ^_^
I belive +d was removed as a cmode
Mutterguy: just you wait... when DerpNet turns on and the world is plunged into Muffinpocalypse and all the Derpinators come out to finish us off... then you'll be sorry you didnt worry
yep
might have been me that woke you
I'll be fine because I live in one of the remotest parts of the world
with alot of sheep
madagascar?
besides we'll have decades before derpnet can figure stairs
good night all
hello bluestrom_S , night bluestrom_S
but all the Derpinators can fly!
they dont need stairs!
then they'll just crash because they weren't provided with enough fuel
powered by muffins... infinite fuel source
http://derpy.me/z8yhW
yay... muffins
damn you all
now I want banana nut muffins
i didnt do it *cowers*
actually... i think i did... *cowers more*
damn you Fleur, now i want some too
"	powered by muffins... infinite fuel source" <--- suddenly I think we're heading into Maretrix territory
crap... i want muffins too...
muffins are not an infinite fuel source
think i have to leave soon
they are as finite as the wheat they are made from
that sucks Phase4
/me is proud of his muffin immunity thanks to an almost life long gluten free diet
/me thinks that Mutterguy was just waving his life long gluten free diet in our faces
that feel when your programing, you encounter a problem, then after a little thinking and ponies you find an simple, intuitive solution to the problem
but muffins SHOULD be infinite... like oatmeal
feels good man
/me probably is
8,1urgh
8,1my internet died
sucks dont it
NOOOOooooo
Phase4 I had no internet at my house all last week
8,1im on my phone at the moment, but rural scotland isnt exactly known for its wireless connectivity
I have no phone and am not allowed to visit friends
my TV was also down
Fleur: wondered why you wernt online... wait, what?
I could only get online from the college campus while waiting inbetween classes
8,1ive traced the fault to one of two places: the BRAS server, or its associated authentication database
lol... bras...
oh poo, the b movie didnt get changed
so?
Fleur: i've seen epic movie.
8,1in the former case, all of scotland's BTw based broadband (ie anything 8meg or under)is down
daaaaaaamn
BT = British telecom?
yup
8,1in the latter, all TalkTalk broadband throughout scotland and possibly the rest of the uk is down
whoooooooa dang
hmm, never looked to deep into broadband networks
aliens...
8,1BTw = BT Wholesale
8,1bt =british telecom
more likely to be talk talk
cos they are super relable
someone somewhere is loosing alot of money
8,1Phase4: scotland has only 1 BRAS. server
^
Scotland is not a huge country Phase4 :p
only one bra
Scotland needs some more infrastructure even then
sure, but only one? no fallback?
it's got more people than NZ though
...I think
quick question, is this IRC on canternet, or is ponychat separate?
i think ponychat is seperate
ponychat is its own
never heard of canternet
I belive so
oh, it's what EqD is on
8,1now, its not certain that the geographically closest BRAS is the one you use, but a BRAS being down still represents a huge problem
ok... a million more
ponychat is seperate
canternet?
8,1i believe there are only about 7in the whole uk
wasnt aware eqd had an irc server
or room, whatever the term is
8,1pony_9851: canternet
it has a channel some place I know that much
eqds irc is noto as goot as bronystates
just wanted to make sure. all i see is the channel (#bronystate) but nothing else so I couldn't see what network this was (IRC noob here)
/me 's mind was drifting and she almost found her way into brony again
8,1this is bronychat
8,1eqd is on canternet
this channel is hosted by ponychat.net
ponychat
wow, bronies have 2 irc networks
yeah, kinda sucks
this channel is best channel
8,1oh, i have is down wrong
now let's not start with the channel elitism
8,1its ponychat not bronychat
'i have is down' is my new slogan
/me is on fluttershy.ponychat.net
oh ok so it is the ponychat network at the bottom then, thanks
i'm on rainbowdash aparently
i'm on fluttershy too
/me is debating on switching to celestia.ponychat.net
or luna.ponychat.net
rainbowdash it seems but I'm using mibbit
you have the ip for celestia?
do they have those servers?
wait, can people in different mane6 chats read each other's messages then? i joined #rainbow_dash but then clicked #bronystate for the more general chat
i thought it was just like the mane six?
that was not a sentence i would have ever guessed me saying
8,1anyhoos, so the BRAS handles your authentication; this sucks for me as i know i am actually physically conected to the internet, but i cant have my packets routed because im not authenticated with the bras
what people say in one of the side rooms doesnt show up in this room
no those are different, #[pony] just refers to the stream chat channels while servers also have pony names
pony_8654_: you can join other rooms, i;m in #Twilight_Sparkle but i could join #Rainbow_Dash as well
so... can anyone tell me how the lottery works on BMN?
Midnight_Tempest have you signed up for the newsletter?
yes
well that explains derpy's voice
x3
then you will get an email that has a link to the form that you fill out
ah, i saw that post on facebook a few hours ago, i feel like such a hipster now
8,1grr
derpy was derped
inb4 Derpy is first canon transexual
/me 8,1shakes a hoof at TalkTalk
^
i see... i already have the newsletter in my email... but nothing else
sounds like someones just tripped over the cable connecting one to the other
8,1if it were up to me, id buy my own DSLAMs and put them in the exchange myself, then lease out a line to the nearest tier 1datacentre
8,1but that would be horrendously expensive
why does #brony exsist?
there are two newsletters sent out every week Midnight_Tempest
the first with the link
8,1BronyKing: it acts as a u-bend for sanity
If I could I'd get a unigrade conection for private use too
BronyKing it keeps the other channels more sane
>_< i so confoozed...
oh so the crazys go there
when did you sign up Midnight_Tempest?
incase a magic bot appears...
i got SB64 to sign me up on saturday i think
8,1phoneternets keep derpin derpin
/me has never liked wwan's
8,1its fine in the city
so you got your newsletter on the 23th right Midnight_Tempest?
no
8,1but out in the land of manure and sheep, its not so great
then you got it on the 26th?
even in the city, latencies exceed 200ms round trip to the tower and bandwith is low. then again this is australia.
^
reason 21 why I'm not an ex=pat
yeah, i got the one on the 26th
which one are you talking about Midnight_Tempest ?
that one does not have the link
sorry Midnight_Tempest
>_<
/me didnt get one on the 26th
next week you will get one near the start of the week and it will have a unique link in it
so, do most people just hang in this chat, or go to one of the man6 chats? i'm closest geographically to #applajack but chat was pretty much dead so i came here
pony_9851 it doesnt matter which of the rooms you use silly
8,1Phase4: funny that, when i actually have a signal here, i get 130ms roundtrip *to a host*
ok, thanks Fleur... do we get to suggest the movie and MLP episodes using the lottery?
no the channels don't relate to geography
te channels =|= the severs
well, i know, lol, i just looked at the map on the site
8,1the problem for me is the number of dropped packets
they just have the same names
/me struts in.
but EVERY brony network more or less haves the frist 6 severs after made 6
Midnight_Tempest you fill out your username, the A movie you want to see, the B movie you want to see, and the ep you want to see
then they will use a random # gen to pick out of the entries
cool
Hey everyone
turns out i DID get an email dated the 26th, but it was sent to the wrong address
8,1actually, and you'll like this, that's 2/3my average ping *on a wired connection*
8,1insanity
that /sucks/ bro
10,02Hai everypony ^_^
ohai SuperBrony64
10,02I managed to get that newsletter out @__@
/me throws SuperBrony64 to the ground and then hugs him while he is stunned
10,02O____O
Hi, SuperBrony64
10,02Hai Fleur :3
8,1Phase4: more
8,1usually over 200
10,02Do we not have a stream?
nope
10,02BLASPHEMY

SB!! SAVE US!
no allcaps
10,02Give me 5 min then ^_^
10,02NO ALLCAPS
SuperBrony64 Y U no have your PS3 with you?
lol ninja'd
So, I met a woman, and I got her to watch the first eight episodes of MLP :)
10,02Because I didn't want to fail school ;____;
^
8,1Phase4: its because of the funky way BTw does their contention multiplexing
the rules are no exessive all caps ot /me
thats a good reason SB
PS3 = failing school?
8,1the bottleneck is at the exchange
10,02But I would have loved to play games on it with you Fleur ;A;
i need a tv so i can play my PS3 again
only 1 tv?
8,1SuperBrony64: you should have looked down and whispered "no"
10,02lol why?
you know... i havent had a tv of my own for over a year... im good with my computer tbh
we have a tv in every room in my house lol
/me 8,1hugs the crap out of SuperBrony64
o.o omg its everywhere!
They will cry out for salvation, and I will look down and say "Tunnel Snakes rule!"
lol Fleur
10,02^__^
nice Fleur VGCats
nice Fleur VGCats? kinda borked the word order there, no?
10,02Fleur is a silly filly :3
10,02SILLY FILLY I SAY
8,1Phase4: contention overloading
maybe? i like borking things and YOUR A SILLY FILLY SB!
10,02:O

/me throws Midnight_Tempest at SuperBrony64 and hugs them while they are stunned

/me hears Lyra shouting 'And kiss'
unless your equating them
10,02Dat Lyra
come here big boy! *puckers up for SB* :D
8,1they load way too many connections onto a sin.gle backhaul
/me makes Midnight_Tempest kiss a large trout
O_O no... NO! MY WEAKNESS! *head expands from allergies*
Basicly the UK's base internet system is lacking

Last episode... I was not expecting Derpy to talk like that.
i hate the ping while playing TF2 on the PC , too (i used to play it , WAY long ago)
That kinda freaked me out.
I don't think anyone was NotYourAverageBrony
ok , be back soon! when my brother stops playing
the one sounded derpy thought she was a guy
it on equestria daily go see it
00,10inb4 SB plays the chat's reaction video
But her voice was spot on though. thats how I would of thought it would have sounded
derpy is now male :/
?
wait... wait.. hold up... stop... no....
00,10It's what I expected her to sound like, sadly I got used to the fan voice for her.
I didn't like the voice...she sounds mentally challenged
They made her male for the show??
00,10no
"I brought you a letter!"
I like the fan voice too
i think they might change her sound after what happened
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/tabitha-derped-thought-derpy-was-male.html
00,10well more of the derp roll and dr wooves radio drama

/me has bugger all internet :(
Tovler: 2006 bad pop culture: the movie
that's pretty much all the movie parodies
It'll be depressing to see how little we've evolved in 5+ years.
I haven't seen a good movie parody since Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
yfw it was made in 2007
Ratings: 2.2/10 from 59,469 users

Aang doesn't properly learn Firebending until Season 3.

Aang ate some good mushrooms I see.

00,10it will solve your ad problem
aerodynamics
NotYourAverageBrony it's normally bald
haha. for an air bender guess that makes since.
00,10He always had a shaved head.
true
00,10but inorder to stay hidden he let it grow out
I know. I've only seen him with a shaved head. thats why I thought it was of odd that he had hair
Have you seen all the epps?
me?
AZURA!!
yushums
5 ships against a nation...I guess I have bad news for them
I've never watched the show.

What show?
Mechanincs and Fire in the Water? Awkward

Oh, that one
and after about 5 minutes the wall of fire falla appart from the burning rope.. haha

Fuck logic, we're firebenders
who's the Streamer today?
00,10its chains not rope
ohh. ok makes more sense
mah boi
How do you burn chains, after they've been in water the entire time
this is where they all will die
00,10coat them in oil
The oil would wash off
they are all benders of logic in some form or another it seems. why not?
magnesium coating
00,10iroh you are not a jedi
he's tricking her!
They knew about it back then?
heat the atoms around the chains to ignite.
Magnesium coating that is
it's so obvious...
magix
Whale blubber, maybe?
AHHH MAGIX, that's it clearly
/me can't wait for Ron Paul to legalized whaling

kind unfair for fire... seeing as they have air,water, and earth against them..
sleep chating as usual?
10,02Tabitha is a SILLY FILLY :3
10,02Also
10,02Zzzz...
We got lucky. They could have used an actual male to voice Derpy.
these tanks are cool...I want one

TANKS?!
00,10goddzilla!
what the hell is the moss man?
I hope they make it sound more female next time
hippies
must be seaweed
or hemp
too late. I bet most of Season 3 has already been voiced.
00,10dad's a baws
really fire clan? wood?? are you kidding me? forge some steel with your "fire"
suddenly Cid, from FF
so they have a contract for the second half of season 3?
Nick Toons are probably like "Screw your Mechanics , History! Fire Nation can make Tanks!"
isnt it strange that no one ever dies in these battles?
Your idea was bombs?
It was implied at Bronycon that Season 3 would be full length
kid friendly kinda ruins wars
hm...
they people frozen like that will die of hypothermia..
so death is there
00,10pull pin then throw
dad died
First Death!
Nope

HE'S ALIVE!
"Dont be crazy saka, your a fucking failure
lol
can't find any concrete evidence for season 3...so the bronycon thing is all we have
some MLP : FiM Staff Confirmed it
hmhm
i've read teh interwebz
We'll have to wait for another Amy Keating Rogers email
there has to be a season 3, because how will season 4 exist with no 3?
WTF
Clearly there all in madagascar where the lethal deseases can't get them
lol NotYourAverageBrony
season 3 has 12 confirmend episodes so far
MLP: FiM is the most popular out of all the series and the fans keep it alive with their ideas, hasbro listens to their fans and incorperate their ideas into their show, I'm most positive there will be a season 3.
its true, isnt it?
00,10good thing the bomb trucks did't get shot at all
the rest is darkness
Yeah it's true, they've even had an unvieling of season 3
You mean the bomb trucks that would've gone up in a huge fireball at the lightest touch Sumica?
They still need to do the eat-healthy episode where Pinkie gains a ton of weight.
00,10exactly
That would be cool
hasbro sells to kids...the fandom wasn't planned and no marketing plan for it is implemented afaik
Fire Lord is Trolling Avatar!

If they can't firebend during the exclipse why can the firebend during the night?
Wibbly wobbly
the eclipse block the sun
the moon glows because sun rays bounce off of it
Yeah but so does the back of the fucking earth
Yeah, well your mother is fat
00,10fire benders are weaker at night
^
physics, what's that?
Best.t Timing. Ever.
because M. Night wrote the rules of this world.
Suddenly, Emperor Palpatine
00,10fall back
^
Fuck why can they firebend underground? Where is logic, did they eat it?
The moon is a singular spirit , not compatible with the sun , thus blockage , the earth on the other hoof acts as a conduit , thus firebending a t night
brb
00,10suddnly
Firebenders are goblins?
thats a show for kids wher human can controle the elements and you look for logic ? XD
TrixieMuffin knows her spiritual stuff well
JumpingJoysticks: the logic is elsewhere, in other television shows

Oh, hello Stream.
batman?
I got Minish cap for free
If only I knew enough Maori to make a relevant reply
who made this?
or haven't played any zelda, it's still good game
And Sumica, you should know by now that a mere streamer ANNOUNCING that the stream will be offline for a moment won't be listened to.
That'd be ridiculous.
00,10oh i know
00,10at least i have color when I say it now
...did Warner Bros. made this?
not that it's my native language but it's an official language

09,01I think
09,0164 has the Ninja perk
09,01so did I
09,01useful as fuck
09,01IIRC they're accusing Megaupload of money laundering
09,01as well as piracy
"There's no glamour in vengence, there's only this rule. That thee lives that you lost, can never come back, and the deed in return is worse than the act"
im back!

NewDCD: i heard that too, its on the takedown notice
not a clue how that works
09,01yeah, no clue what "evidence" they might have
when i finished Lunch , i realized that my Younger Brother was playing Happy Wheels
im prob going to explor some tumblr now :3
did i miss something?
is that a Mod...
i believe the money laundering stems from the multiple bank accounts in multiple countries under multiple names
the HUD looks weird
09,01except that's not money laundering
09,01and no SaL
dat revenge
and the Graphics
09,01that's Black Ops on the Wii
oh , ok
09,01I used to play it as well
you think they would accuse CNet for distributing pirating software like limewire and bit torrent, but nope
09,01or Kazaa
09,01but CNet belongs to CBS
09,01so no : 3
the Wii version of Black Ops...

unfortunatley, nintendo only used it for one game
09,01then I saw the price over here
09,01>60 bucks
09,01fuck no
oh god, 60?
09,01and there's also the clip headset you could buy
09,01but yeah

09,01also SaL: this must be a bonus stage
ok
09,01also my torrent is done, so let me set up
09,01I should try the Wii NiGHTs.....
I heard it wasn't that good
09,01I heard the same
/me loves his Wii very much
well , when i played Night , it used to have a Better Graphics , i remember
09,01I barely use my Wii
09,01a few good games, and the rest are shitty
i have brawl, twilight princess and wind waker
09,01that's about it
that applys nicely to any console
not the PS2
Phase4 : you reminded me of Super Smash Bros. Brawl...
loads of good games on there
09,01yeah but the Wii has exTREME levels of crap
I. WANNA. PLAY. BRAWL. ON. WII.
09,01and barely any good games that are not first party
SaLKiD99: its awesome, best with a gamecube controler though
what crap system are you playing this shit on]
^
nah , i love playing it with the Wii Classic Controller
I have a brawl disc from gamestop, but it doesn't work, and it was the only copy they had
09,01I enjoy Brawl with Classic Controller
Hi Everypony

That's silly
you play your current gen consoles on a old crt computer monitor?

Dken2021, because of fighting games
@magnetmeter Chat
Notice that PS2? Guilty Gear
MrPoniator : you reminded me that Image in Memebase...
GG doesn't like other than CRTs, pretty much
And in fact, it's not too bad screen, either
"My Face When : Friendship is MEMETIC"
ah, kay then, plus, think lcd have maybe a slight lag
Despite its age, I can play perfectly well with it. Only Star Ocean: The Last Hope had too much bloom that I couldn't read the texts
09,01yeah, GG is best on CRTs
09,01SHAKE SHAKE
09,01just like Mischief Makers
Yeah, if you get the right screen/tv, the input lag isn't that horrible. But I like playing old consoles (SNES is off-screen), and also that wii is pretty nice with that
/me hates crt's
09,01dat pretty much perfect victory
the horizontal coils start making noise as they age, and i can hear it
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/memes-my-little-memes.jpg

then type /ns ghost Simon <password>
what does ghost mean?
^
I'm curious now.

this shit ain't gonna fly
ghost is what you call an account that has dissconnected but is still sitting in the server
It's fine
Beat me to it Fleur :3
freaking moronic
wats your background imagbe?
what is going on MobileDCD ?
oh neat
I think he's having problem with procaster
I used to be abke to stream this game perfectly
back with older procasters
and then you took a ping to the knee?
no then they made their gaming mode consume CPU like a biiiiiitch
upgrade your hardware?
I JUST DID
oh
i have now lost my q,w,e,a,s,z and x keys... dear oh dear
then how did you type them?
they still finction
mfw Just like this
he lost the keys, not the space on the keyboard
the letter jut goes flying off
procaster is consuming 51% cpu
oh
holy shit
what are the movie for tonight?
/me shrugs
I have already forgotton :D
^
Alice 2007 and epic movie
mfw my selection got picked ;__;
I'd rather not think about the movies streaming tonight.
no wait, 2010 I think
/me realizes that she only got an hour of sleep
Take a nap Fleur :o
oh dear Fleur don't go and get insomnia like i did
/me nuzzles into Sumica again and tries to take a nap
Gumri I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember
How abaout for next week : A: 300 , B: Meet the Spartans
oh my
I prefer 300
So they moved BronyCon to New Spursey.
that is not how it works TrixieMuffin, you silly filly
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
don't like either of those films
Meet the spartans, oh god, it's bad enough that they air it on TV
another double B movie night
what are we watching?
But it is at the Meadowlands :D
Meet the spartans is the besst film ever
I got School ELA while the stream is on :[
well, that is arguable Gumri but I do like it ^_^
no, the best film is Monty Python and the holy grail.
Takes 4 hours to get to Medowlands from where I live, and lucky me I know how to get there :>
where?
Went to MLG medowlands for a tournment few years ago :>
where is medowlands?
New Jersey
sorry I asked
:p
XD
Mfw Jersey shore cast are bronies.
what now? :|
oh sorry im an idiot ignore me :D
PONYS FTW
oh my god I just imagined an MLG tourny populated with people that go by names like "The Situation"
/me just vomited a little
Eeeyup
ugh
LOL
What graphics card is SB using?
so is the next episode episode 15?
That would be the most annoying fucking place on earth. You are winning 1k-5 and one of them gets a point making it 1k-6. Suddenly the entire team of Situations jumps up and goes OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! WHAT NOW!?
that would be annoying
and then they make themselves look like complete ass'
Something tells me you have seen several episodes of that Fleur :P
^^^^
indeed Gumri. I always give every show a 4 episode minimum
before I will allow myself to hate it
even Whitney?
that way I can say I dont just blindly hate it
I havent seen Whitney so I dont have an oppinion about it
I do too, usually at least but not for that. I saw one and then i understood everything
WOW
/me is surprised she had the willpower to sit through 4 hour long eps of that crap
it's impressive to say the least.
Kim Schmitz, owner of megaupload got 50 years in prison for sharing digital archives.
holy shit!
really?
yeah I just read it.
hey guys
hey OneTrickPony
This government.. so silly.
wow. judge jury and executioner
/me holds up her shirt to show off her abs while grining and nodding her head like a retarded jackass
unce unce unce unce unce unce
whoa. you have abs?
Dashie_Dashie: i believe the company was from New Zeland but im not certain about that.
lol im on my ipod at school i cant believe this is working
lol
secret pony chat fun
somehow i can imagine someone doing that Fleur :D
they do
he goes by the name "The Situation"
I shit you not
I know that much
If I had abs... I dunno if I can blame them
Is this game black ops?
wear tighter shirts. Dont just walk around holding your shirt up like some sort of social failure
Looks liek it
who is playing COD? O_o

Bluh
What's going on here now?
they are social failures though
looks like mw3

/me now looking up hotels in Seacaucus.
well I'm the most imortant person here /sarcasm
lolwut
I told someone I never read FiM fanfics. He told me I wasn't a brony. Is that true?
^ Lol no
no
of course not radu
Of course not
laggie sonic
No, but i would reccomend My little dashie at least.
and then dari comes
lolnope Radu
Do you like brightly colored ponies?
i dont read many fanfics, i do read a few though
nah Radu, just watch the show and like it.
ohai dari ^_^
Hey
Thanks, screenied c:
Radu - all that means is you haven't faced the initiation tests - Cupcakes and My Little Dashie
Ignore that.
Everyone is a brony until proven otherwise to me.
main reason i dont read too many fanfics is the psychologically shattering grimdark or sad ones and all the shipping that goes on in between
we don't mention that first fic you mentioned here MirrorImage
don't read cupcakes.
Never gonna read the first one, but planning on reading the second
it was a watershed moment
MirrorImage: i refuse to read the unspeakable fan fic, i've seen and heard enough of it as is
dont even bring that fic up in here
My little dashie is so damn sad.
hey, at least i didn't mention the big mac version
reason for not reading fanfics: some fans seem to be ship crazy
my little dashie is rly good
people have gotten banned just for mentioning it
indeed Dken2021
urgh, I'm stuck at school for the next five hours :(
Read My Little Dashie for lulz
:P
C******s is horrific though
how are you online ScootaChicken
I've watched cupcakes. I no longer need to read it.
Gumri, school computers
although i have recently picked up a ship fic, the rason i am reading it is is more of a comedy/slice of life, and what shipping there is is done very tastefully
I have read it-that-shall-not-be-named, and i must just be really desenitized to violence, because it didn't bother me.
black ops
and back to CoD
Oh! We would have had this site filtered
and the internet filter hasn't banned BronyState for reasons I still don't understand
that only depends on how vivid your imagination is arrowtobroknee
very
Screw black ops and lets get back to pastel ponies!
/me reads my little dashie not thinking i'd shed one tear.
/me many many man tears were shed
My little dashie.
Lawl
Umbasa. . .
XD
My Little Dashie is a really manipulative fanfic
Wait a second... THIS ISN'T LIVE!
bugeyes8: its not the violence in it, its the psychology of it
Fanfics don't make me cry. :P
I know, it just didn't get to me anything like MLD
/me is a cryer
I guess I'm supposed to be offended and horrified by "baked goods" in order to be a brony.
wait are we talking about the fic that shall not be named?
because that gave me mental scaring .__.
No, we're not.
Anything makes me cry and i always make myself look like an idiot :D
my little dashie
I don't cry at anything, but i cried like a man at my little dashie
not that other horrible thing
Why, did all the wub get to your head? :P
Dad exits house, flash crashes. Seems legit.
