Of course! I'll casually admit that!
XD
00,10and yeah I have a "micro" trasyster radio

Wearing a mask over his mask.

The mask...but not his face.
Disolves the gas mask, leaves his normal mask.

PROBABLY A SONIC BOOM
Dester, no, a transistor is an elctronic component, it does nothing on its own

Any of you guys think Pinkie is best pony?
eyah
On my list, she's 3rd/
I need someone that is in sync with her
so whos streaming now?
Can.. Can we have some more Spidey?... That is, if its okay with you, of course
Pinkie is ALWAYS best pony
I'm trying to write her part in my story and Im stuck
Zeccora is best Zebra
Im just no Pinkie
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Legacy of Star Swirl / Exploration
Any ideas?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KC-x09bavo&feature=g-all-u
I don't listen to much pony music in actuallity. Just the FIW songs and of course, the ones from the show.
my dog is acting as my blanket now
hmm
I miss my doggy, they are best blankets
Not if theyre toy dogs
I got through half of 2001 a space odyssey this morning...
My dog crapped in my mud room this morning :P
>.>
Michael i was just wating that on DA :D
mud room?
good work cowvarkian!
2001 a space oddesy is sooo slooooowww
watching*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP_SQqWTFb4&feature=g-all-lik WTF!
cowvarkian: It's where people put their shoes and where the enter.
So no one here is in sync enough with Pinkie?
2001 Space Oddesey is the greatest Sci FI ever createdt
Can anyone ever be in sync with Pinkie?
Kawaii_icybeauti: ok then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H40wUz-Fd8
Michael: Da faq? O.O
[SWAG]Haku: it's pretty well made, yeah
Kawaii_icybeauti: IKR?
no... no its not... I mean its good onces or twice... but best? nah
2001 i mean
Dester: I saw that when it came out on the EQD
Yes, it is, but Im stating a fact. Almost all the top scifi directors agree that 2001 IS the greatest piece of sci fi ever made
sad
Mainly because of its influence
I hope they play this song at my cheer comps. I can imagine everyone dancing that :D
That's odd, because that sounds like an opinion, not a fact
Dester: because it is an opinion
It's influenced the genre just so much, and inspired many of the awesome directors we love today to become directors
its just so... long
Do you accept the challenge? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRQLVTKb9M0&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
I agree with it mostly, but I don't think that we could objectively choose "best scifi movie ever" even if we honestly tried
Yes, it is long and boring for us because we're young and we need some sort of action
http://derpy.me/Dk11d
[SWAG]Haku: I'll probably finish it tonight
Not necisarriyl (oh god i cant spell), did you see moon?
But 2001 is great because it shows how Man is nothing in the universe, and yet we have the power to change the universe
oh hey
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/
Yo Bronysith
/me gangnam styles on [SWAG]Haku
did awsome, little to no action
I'm sorry, I may be metalhead yada yada, but the gangham style kicks ass.
2001 is just overrated,
Think I've seen that Dester. I liked it.
I never seen 2001
Not all great things are meant to be very entertaining
Moon is a great film
/me dances
When I saw that part in the anthlogy 2, I just skipped it due to how boring it was. Bronysith Same.
that's what we need to watch
/me is bored
Dester: of course 2001 is overrated, doesn'y mean it isnt a good film
just to be clear...
Space movies are really popular here for some reasn. It'll get picked eventually.....
OVERRATED, does not mean BAD
Im putting 2001 as my a film choice this newslestter
Well I wan't saying it was bad
Dester: I know, I just wanted to say something
Bronysith: You have missed a magnificent film, then. Find it. Watch it. Be amazed.
Hi!~
Damn, the survey isn't open.
overrated means something gets waaaaaaay too much hype and is in no way as good as everyone makes it out to be
Overrated means not as good as people say, but you cant deny that it is an influencial film
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rCP4CRRO7E&feature=g-all-f
ohai Shadi
Hi.
Due to being a girl, I'm not really into the whole sci fi film thing. But I do loive a good superhero movie.
2001 may take more than one watching to really understand it. But once you do...
I am enjoying GaoGaiGar right now, pretty good anime
What does gender have to do with opinion on movie genre?
[SWAG]Haku: exactly
wow
that is one of the most retarded statements ever Kawaii_icybeauti
I'm doing Chemistry extra credit.....9 more until I can take a break and play Skyrim....
bummer
I don't know, they don't really appeal to me that much. Like when I was wacthing starship trooper movie here, I didn't like it too much, and my mom agreed that the movie wasn't good either. Ask my dad, he said it was awesome.
:'(
Kawaii_icybeauti: just because you are a girl doesnt mean shit when establishing opinions on something
Starship Troopers does not do the book justice
I agree
Starship Troopers was a TRAVESTY compared to the original novel. A travesty,I say!
I have to write one paragraph on 50 different elements!!! AAAAAAAGH!!!! >:(
I tried to get into NGE i just couldnt
too depressing
:[
:|
I gotta hunt down all these book turned movie books. I was thinking about reading the hunger games...Is it good?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWiT6VbVpjg&feature=g-u-u
I do like some cheesey cinema, but star ship troopers is artery clogging
Kawaii_icybeauti: better then the film
Kawaii_icybeauti: much better than the movie
Hunger Games is just a rip off of Battle ROyal
the movie always sucks compared to the book... except for maybe the LoTR extended cuts
^
I can see if it's hanging in my library. I remember when the film came out, the waiting list was long as hell.
[SWAG]Haku: everything is a ripoff of everything
I was lost during the entirety of Battle Royal.
No, really, Hunger Games is an actual rip off!
The arther of Hunger Games got the idea from the movie
Probably because it was on at 2 in the morning and I was on a sofa.
The reason that the movie's aren't amazing is because they cut out a lot of things that the book had.
[SWAG]Haku: listen to this retarded garbage, i was at school one day and this failed abortion said "hunger games is going to be a great film" i say "not as good as the book" "WELL WHO READS BOOKS!?"
...
what?
I read books
...
WHAT?!
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
Bronysith: I've heard that statement millions of times in my school...It's quiet depressing.
agreed
The books are waaaay better....THEY CUT OUT MADGE!!! :[
[SWAG]Haku: so i said "enough people to get hollywood to want a movie made based on the book...dumbfuck"
Good
whoo im back
:O
We could end up like farenheight 451 if this attitde doesn't change.
[SWAG]Haku: and the teacher in the class actually laughed
Let the dark side flow through you
Ha
Wb oni_link
and then the kid turned into a CoD kid [SWAG]Haku
Farenhiet451, where books died with a wimper, and without a bang
thanks Michael
Well, the reason most kids hate reading is because teacher make you dissect a book, and it takes the fun out of it..
I wish Francium was on the list of elements I have to work on.... :'(
I hate Francium.
???
CoD is over rated. You can say anything you want, but all I see is the exact same game being given a slightly different story
Bradbury wrote the book to show a world with too much tv, not a one with no books
The element or the song?
i like books better because there is no limit on imagination
You clearly missed what I did there so nevermind.
I actually like his writing, but dislike the technophobe of a man
Dester: Heck, society looks somethign like that now....But the burning books thing...It could happen.
:P
[SWAG]Haku: i was saying CoD kid because "GAY FAG, NEWB" he started screaming and looking like a total idiot
I disagree!
Okee,back to work...
This society is a great thing!
Libraries burn books with you knowing
The perfect society in my opinion is a hive
Socrates and Juvenal and many said in hsitory that the younger gen was the woerst and would destroy society!
i still need to finish the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy books and Game of Thrones
Perfect society...hmmmmm...
Perfect society? No society.
Libraries are digital these days
perfect society is where morons are ground up into food
The latest book I read was Night....You have to read that thing.
An anarchy would be awfule, wed all fight all the time
Kawaii_icybeauti: that book was wow
In a hive, everyone thinks the same and has no pride over lower beings because in a hive, there are no lower beings
Bronysith: soylent green is people?
[SWAG]Haku: thats horrible
Not really
Bronysith i cuncuur
Damn sims gettin stuck so much
Bronysith: I gave it to my mom to read, and she was crying at the intro. Hence why the guy won a noble prize.
cuncur
sorry
concur.
*author of night*
thank you!
[SWAG]Haku: i dont want to be the same as everyone else though
You're welcome.
why was that so hard to spell
A large group of people, all with the same opinion and thoughts, still with free will though, working together to better their hive
You wont be the same, youll still be you
the society sounds boring
AND
It's not free will if everyone has the same thoughts.
[SWAG]Haku: how does free will work into that situation
In a way, the Brony Fandom is a Hive
would not create much worth
It's just one entity with many parts.
THe great things come from diversity
You may think the same, but you can still make your own choices
That's not society.
6_9
Hey, we're sort of saying "Fuck you social standards"
[SWAG]Haku: noooo, the brony community is a cult
and adversity
[SWAG]Haku: if there was any free will, then there would be an immediate uprising
How so?
Why would there be an uprising?
We're not going to end up drinking kool aid, right?
cult following
Everything would be perfect
brb
No conflct, no war
If you can make your own choices but everyone has the same thoughts everyone would make the same choices.
Niggers are evil, but black people are nice
no middle class, no upper class, no poverty
EVeryone is on the same level
[SWAG]Haku: thats communism
No development.
Side Note Questoin: If Sumica left, why is his name still up?
WOrking to help eachother
No dialogue.
Dester: lurking
[SWAG]Haku: so, you want a utopian society, but with people having no differing thoughts, and no will to live?
There could be development, since there is on conflict to stop it
My friends and I are all referred to as a cloud. When we all walk down the hallway,if we get sepparated,we form back together again and continue drifting down the hallway. lol.
THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE CONFLICT
Dester: He's asleep but didn't log out
It'd be stagnant, if everyone is thinking the same thing why would anyone say anything, how would anyone learn.
ah
okay
Why? Why does there have to be conflict?
Where there is good, there must be evil and where there is evil there must be good
:D
You'd be entirely dependant on things outside the group
Conflic drives growth
BALANCE AND SYMMETRY
Conflict is made when people with seperate thoughts argue
[SWAG]Haku: if there is no conflict, there is no change
But if everything is already fine, what reason would there be to drive development?
Guthix
afk
:O
A stagnant society always dies
:O :P :) :D
Conflict becomes war, war becomes death, death becomes end of the world
Not if done right
end of the world is already happening
Dester, not true, look at Egypt
Bronysith: not really
bieber is covering stairway to heaven
Death does lead to the end of the world
it survived centuries of stagnation
Egypt has been going through upheavels for ages
They always had somebody to fight
there can never be world peace
EVER
It still had periods of time where it was stagnant and stable for closer to 1000 years
Ok, then tell me, what would make a perfect society?
Anarchy.
[SWAG]Haku: there is no perfect society
A world where evryone is intitled to their opinion?
and back
Force co-operation through neccessity.
The best thing we can get to world peace would be a bunch of city states with small populations
/me points to the original point of Marx´s thesis
Correct, there is no perfect society in existence today, so why cant we make one?
Dester: or nuking new jersey
I still think that a singular world government would be nice
lol, politics talk in Bronystate.
I don't like this extra credit,but I have to do it or my lowest test grade(an F) won't come up to over a 100.....
Because people are stupid.
You guys are so silly.
You have a society, its very being will cause an antithesis to be proposed
Well we need to nuke that place, but that's beside the point
Eeyup.
eventually the two will join together and the process repeats
jk
Again, the Brony CFandom can be compared to a hive. We all have the same opinion on something that unites us, and we all work to maintian our community
That opinion differs in the fine print.
We are all equal in our fandom
Watch.
he just sort of assumed that communism was perfect and there would be no dev from there
[SWAG]Haku: since when do we all have the same opinion on anything?
[SWAG]Haku: I agree.
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
So I woke up and to see that the video is not working?
Meanwhile: and pinkie pie said twilight was best pony
Ponies are awesome. We all know this, and it unites us
Meanwhile: She is funny!~
The Brony Fandom can be compared to a landfill site, it's full of shit with a couple of gems inside it, like a nice TV someone's thrown out for whatever reasons.
[SWAG]Haku: sure
No one is streaming right now Java
*reason
Oh
Ok then :/
ScootaChicken: :[ Disagree.
Can we get some more vid pwease? :(
/me points out the fact that there is a channel set aside to debate politics
You want to know what a society where everyone thinks the same and works towards the same end is?
The Borg.
I'm still waiting for my singular world government, of which would be run by a few mega corporations...
Diversity is good
...yeah, no. not taking part in government discussion when nothing can be done of it.
Now Wait a cotton pciking minute the borg aren;t that bad (aside from the whole genicide thing!)
...........
The Borg exist to convert everyone else into them.
cowvarkian: There is little point to a unified on world government until there is an external reason to see the Earth as a singal political entity
The borg is just one individual
They're intergalactic Jehova's Witnesses.
A perfect has no conflict, and everyone works to help eachother and thier nation without selfish thoughts. You can still have free will and still have everyone think the same, because as humans we always have free will.
such as extra-planetary colonies of note
spread across lioght nyears
I think I will try to avoid political debate, but borg?
Unnr: That's what I'm waiting for
now religion talk?
im bored again xD
Unnr: and it's bound to happen
/me nomssimilates Meanwhile
You guys love Borg because the queen is hot.
In a perfect society, you can do anything without people judging you
TheMonstaMuffin: me too
A perfect has no growth.
/me glomps kirzstryfe
Admit it.
Thats what a hive is
What is there to work for if it's perfect.
kirzstryfe: hey man how you been?
Michael :((
Does Pinkie talking about anything besides parties? Because thats my view of her
working mostly
Why, why cant it have growth?
[SWAG]Haku: we don't want a hive, we don't want perfect, and if there was no judgment then there would be no change
Because it's PERFECT.
Crhysalis = Borg queen
no no no
hey kirzstryfe
ugh, the sound on my computer is all poppy and clicky
Borg Queen=Borg spreads over lightywears
Not nesscerily
Years*
yes
I am super trekky
A perfect society can work to grow.
hmmmm lughtywears....
Michael, that zebedee
if something is perfect then there is no way to improve it whatsoever
lightywears
Perfect is the defining feature of not needing anymore growth.
what Unnr?
We can work together to great bthings
You can't become /more/ perfect.
WE ARE A HAPPY CLOUD!!!!!!!!
ello there kirz
Yes, my speed typing is poorly done
its official [SWAG]Haku is a cultist
We can work togeteher to create actual space travel
Having fun listing obscure religious figures
we are a happy cloud and rd is sleeping on our head
Bronysith If thats how you see me, im ok with that
The Borg may be one individual mind but it's formed from the domination of billions, by force.
[SWAG]Haku: what makes you think that we would need a seemingly perfect society for that?
Dester: EXACTLY!~
:D
This!
:)
Is! SPARTA!!
No need for hive mind for space explorations
We need a perfect society because there are people who will always exist, unless we create the perfect society, who will only take what nation creates for themselves
If there are people with free will then that will always be the case.
I mean, the fedearation like that.
STOP! STOP WITH THE STUPID SHIT
Bronysith: >.>
Is chat talking about religion?
No
THE BORG is the culmination of spieces to create one mind streatched through hyperspace that consumes civilizations so that it may grow and become the perfect being. THE BORG IS THE QUEEN BORG, its shownm when picard travels backj in time and in the voyager series!
space exploration
DerpyMuffins: no, politics sortof
We're talking about what makes a perfect society
no continue please *noms popcorn*
Im gonna stay out of this
Hm..........Maybe if we all purchase a large island,we could detach ourselves from whatever country it was purchased from,and call it Equestria! :)
Sorry
If everyone just love and tolerated, that would be a perfect society TBH.
We're talking about being ruled by a queen.
And we would all belive the same stuff, all be united under the same thoughts
It's been established that there are multiple Queens in the Borg structure and that they function more like commanders than the actual head of the snake.
So we want to be UK citizen :p
Equestria is a hive
That's not freedom then is it.
Space Exploration is how we will create a post need economy/scociety, we will have very little to bicker about,
...............................
we're discsussing our own contient now?
and hence little conflict
DERP! 6_9 :P
Apparently
There's no dialogue in a society comprised of people who all think the same.
Herp Gerp! :D
yerp-a-derp-derp-derp!~
yep
08,01hello
Halla!
08,01i hope the chat's not getting out of hand in here
If we had the same thoughts we wouldn't be having this conversation. In fact we wouldn't be having any conversation.
nah
Exactly
Because we'd be thinking the same bloody thing all the bloody time.
We're having fun as it is.
There would be no need
Hm....Hack into every satellite and broadcast nothing but MLP:FiM?........No,we'd just get arrested... O_O
....
[SWAG]Haku: is not a cultist
IT will make people hate us
Imagine that...A girl can dream.
[SWAG]Haku IS A FRIGGIN CYBERMAN
Don't force ponies to people who don't want to watch it.
ONE MOMENT PLEASE! Physics shows us that everything is based on probability, meaning that we can't be pre-determined, however we are reactionary to random occurences and this is not Free Will. HENCE HENCE, FREE WILL IS IMPOSSIBLE AND SO IS DETERMINISM
That's nice.
But also irrelevant.
Dester makes a good point
uhh thanks?
Dester: cool story bro
tl dr
That's sort of the sterotype that we bronies have...Like the way the jehovah's come to our doors and try to shove thoguht down our brains.
Maybe Equestria is a distant planet that actually exists in reality!
Free Will is non existent, and that only helps Haku
Everything is random, therefore no freewill or determinism
08,01Dester: quantum mechanics makes determinism implausible
any1 thinks about multiverse?
That is what I said
yes
Michael: who doesnt
Or meant to
Why need multiverse when we have billions or more galaxies?
Michael: I do! ALL THE TIME!!
We were discussing the perfect society.
Even though I love multiverse but it's harder to reach.
I always like to imagine a world where I am king of the world
Need a multiverse? nah, Does it exist, Almost certainly
Meanwhile: which is impossible
We have to create a portal
And it's hard to make a portal.
Java: not unless u do it right
Now your thinking with portals
you're*
Ha
space travel is easierl
right
Well, there are portals all over the place that send you to differenct dimensions here on earth.
You're
We can fold space
We can slow down light
We have the technology
But it's hard to rip on interdimensional barrier
not really
08,01[SWAG]Haku: this is true actually
well at least chat is having a somewhat intelligent argument instead of being called ignorant for disagreeing
We've made black holes in labvs before
Especially if it destroy our world in the process.
Hm. If we somehow create a special frequency,maybe it could tear a hole through the dimensional barrier,and we could break through the fifth wall and travel to different realities.....
I am a physics major at a university, STring Theory says little curled up dimensions are all over the universe, and that they are contected
Better than the conversation I get in school...
08,01Java: i hazard a guess that you have not a clue what you're talking about
Bronysith when have we ever called eachother ignorant?
Light´s easy to slow down, tis called shining it through a medium
(well m theroy of string theroy says this)_
so portals exist, but likely below the plank leangth
You realize we never know about what happen if we tamper with dark matter right?
Portals thhat take you places exist; theyre called cars
Dester, but what about LQG?
In social studies the other day, some kid asked me where spain was on a map......
[SWAG]Haku: when i said i didnt like skyrim and i gave this guy my reasons(gameplay, combat, easyness, bad story etc) and he said "not real reasons, you are just ignorant and obviously never played the game"
08,01Unnr: i read a paper a few years ago about slowing light down in a vacuum
Bronysith oh yeah
Soem theorist think that if we done just ripping it up it simply shut our dimension like a light switch.
WHITE HOLES!!! Where do they lead? brb...
another model
We don't even know when we kill all of the universe.
Well, there's nothing wrong with opinion. It's funny how defensive people get if you slightly disagree with them.
White Holes dont lead to where you found the whit hole
we have many models running around
Shadi: you mean black holes, right?
Stuff cant go in white hooes because white push things out
White Hos?
A white hole is a time reversed black hole
white holes
I've never heard of white holes before...
08,01Unnr: oh, you <3
ahhhh
It likely does not exist
AHAHAHAHAHA
Things go in Black Holes, and come out White Holes. That is Hakus theroy
^
But nothing forbades ones' existence
my theory is...muffins are friggin delicious
they are simply, portals
You mean a proposed theory as to what happens to things that enter black holes.
08,01Java: you're one of these people who thought the LHC was Satan's Stagate, aren't you
Bronysith cant be called a thoery if its fact
That could be true....We should send a willing somone into one with some kind of messaging machine....But could he die in one?
Nope, I love LHC!
Satan's Stargate
Love it
/me sets Dovah on fire
long hair community??
I have long hair?
But it's risky to fiddle with the unknown.
yes
No when things enter black holes time stops
/me is immune to fire
Sorry, that's a sitr I go on..It's a girl thing.
site*
No one knows what happens in black holes because no one's ever been in one.
Java thats how we learn
Please stop talking like you actually know what you're on about.
SafariiMonkey that is almost correct, time stops at the singularity
Now why would you do that Bronysith
08,01http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970618a.html
Meanwhile correct, and no one can. The gravitational pull would crusha person instanly
[SWAG]Haku: But there are no hard facts, there is only a theory that works best due to the current knowledge paradigm.
and slows to a being essentially stopped to an outside observer close to a blackhole
Our world is fragile enough, then we try to tear a little hole.....
08,01i love how so many people in here like to think they know about physics
We don't :p
Its not that we know physics, we just like to think about physics and logic
XD
Java , blackholes more powerful than the ones the LHC can make are made in the upper atpmosphere all the time
I know enough about physics to get through every day life
I want to go back to talking philosophy.
at the point of the event horizon, it is theorized to be on par with the density of water.
At least that was entertaining.
Talking philosophy will start another kind of debate...
08,01Unnr: aye
Meanwhile: According to modern understanding, the gravitational field would cause time to slow to a near-standstill
Unnr that is so so wrong
Dester: You mean awesome, right?
Controlled debate is good.
In fact debate is just controlled argument so debate is good.
Time freeze......That sounds bucking awesome.
Meanwhile: Agreed.
lol
Double the mass of a black hole, your 8tuple is vulume, hence blackholes can have densities approaching that of a vaccuum for very large ones
this debate is sooo amusing
Why not talk about chiptunes? Or our favorite foods?
/me sets Dovah on fire again
Java not to mention that black holes are just a theory that most people agree on
back
It's impossible to tell the location of a black hole until it is observed interacting with another celestial body.
nothing liek astronomy or physics
Meanwhile: not to mention debate is actual intelligent arguments
Because science is fun to talk about. Science is probably one of the most interestng things ever, it's just the teachers who make it boring.
/me throws Bronysith into the Abyss without artorias's ring
front
i still win
/me doesn't know anything about science
Blackholes? we throw in a can of bean! then we throw a car! then we throw hipster! then Roseanne Barr! oh no now it's clogged!
BLACK HOLES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THEY... calm down calm down... they are as much a theoryu as a sandwhich is
OOH. LET'S TALK ABOUT VOLCANOES!
You cant even see a black hole, so ymaybe we already found one with knowing it
they exist
Thing is this isn't that interesting to talk about because it's just people quoting what they once read in a textbook.
I don't either, but you can learn a lot from these little conversations.
Volcanoes are fun!
[SWAG]Haku: weeping angel?
Meanwhile: what about parallax of bent light?
Weeping angles are scary
Weather interest me the most, and climate too.
If the earth was to instantly turn into a black hole, it would have an event horizon at a distance that would be roughly the size of a peanut.
weeping angles
I live in a country full of volcanoes.
angels*
Isn´t astrophysics fun?
weeping angles sound fun
Weeping Angels are the least scary villan
08,01i like neutron stars
No, but in the volcano belt.
Weepings angels have to be the scariest things ever
i like muffins
bottom
Weeping Angels are pretty creepy.
Java: What country:
I still remember leaving in the middle of a fansinating conversation about stars.....
[SWAG]Haku: loneliest creatures in the universe
A hint: we have a mountain called... Krakatoa ;)
i liek higgs boson
You never know if its an angel until its too laye
Java Hawaii?
Java: Oh, that's why your name is that.
and we waited for sirens that never come. And we only write by the moon, every word hand written
Indonesia
How did I not figure that out?
Neutron stars, solar masses forced in nthe spheres of mewre miles in diameter! quarks forced into changing colour until BAM neuton, and tghen BAM strange matter
mere miles
Our islands are literally shaped by volcanoes.
someone from java nicknaming themselves java, how creative
Heheh
Java: Aaaah, you live in the Ring of Fire. What's that like?
Java aren;y all?
And no one notice.
't4
't
hi LadyCanary
Java most islands are shaped by volcanoes
It's alright, sometimes some mointain explode, but not that often.
I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE. WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN, AND THE FLAMES WENT HIGHER! AND IT BURNS BURNS BURNS!
>.>
ohai LadyCanary
......the ring of fire...
And now I don't care about chat at all.
Well, was nice while it lasted.
JONNY CASH BACK FROM THE DEAD LADIES AND GENTLCOLTS
Yeah chat went to hell
Even a local king appoint a mountain guardian.
needs more docs in BS, they are so fun
Ring of Fire is best geographic location
local king? whats that about>
?
We have a govt inside the govt.
I live in new york...absolutely nothing geographic here...Maybe the adorondiacks or the catskills....
Govern-ception?
Meanwhile: What's wrong with volcanoes?
Like UK monarchy
But without the power over the country
The splode and kill people.
only small egion.
Our monarchy doesn't do anything.
region
so is it like the chiefs in tribes in us then?
Yep
They just sit there and look posh.
cool
Kawaii_icybeauti: But....they make pretty glowy fire?
But their followers love them so much
You said local king, are you a native then?
Meanwhile: that's because they're figure heads
Mike's sim is gone
I like pi
Kawaii_icybeauti: maybe the sea is geographic? :D
anyone else like pi?
also bonjour errybody
Bonjour
Hey RAWRity
Meanwhile: but you know that already
ASoftFluffyThing: Well, those are the volcanoes in Hawaii that you're thinking about. The ones that actually explode can send ash and kill people.
I HATE PI, i LOVE TAU!
how are things RAWRity
suddenly RAWRity
Math....EWWWWWWW
tau=2pi
[SWAG]Haku: Tau ftw
phi is where its at
Tau can suck it
ohai RAWRity
^
Hai RAWRity
wait
no
Pi
Kawaii_icybeauti: see the St. Helen
Kawaii_icybeauti: All vocanoes explode and send ash and kill people.
/me glomps RAWRity into a tree
Tau makes so much more sence that pi, it makes trignometry elegant and simple
It's not the ash though, it's the hot air rolling from above.
/me would LOVE to visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
Tau only makes sense in things that Pi does not make sense in
It kill people, suffocatng and burning them instantly.
MadSurge: I heard of that one. My mom remembers when a volcano erupted in costa rica when she was a kid. They had to wear mask whenver they went outside due to the ash.
Dester: There are good arguments for and against both
guten abend :)
lol
Ash is annoying, but as long it's not too thick we can still live it.
Hey quick poll, Who hear is in western hemisphere and who hear is in the eastern?
I dunno what to dooooo
here*
But we have to use broom to clean the damn ash.
yeah
West, bitches!
ASoftFluffyThing: yeah but some regularly erupt and are much less dangerous because they regularly discharge any dangerous pressure they build inside
Switches from spanish is odd
Gary is here!
West side
Ash is a loser!
eastern means asia, Dester?
yeh,
ill be back later
But most Asia is in the west!
No, the eastern hemishpere starts at anything after greenwhich, england.
I know,
Its dumb
In a way, everyone is in both the west and east
MadSurge: Kilue'a for example. Most active volcano in the world. Erups so often that it's just another day at the office
Yep
less than 10% of the fandom are from there, Dester. maybe even less than 5%. don't expect to meet many asians
I think I spelld that right.
The earth is round, there is no east or west.
Dinner, brb
The ones that don't erupt often....that's when you're fucked.
yeah
The build up is intense.
Meanwhile was waitning for someone to say that
Allow me to rephrase, who here is european?
Krakatoa explotion is so massive it fecimate the whole mountain.
decimate
I'm English.
be back later
Java: But isn't it krakatoa jr?
Mount St. Helens, Vesuvius....
/me is German
At least now...Before the 1800's.
The old krakatoa.
[SWAG]Haku: ahh, so we are both from retardville
Krakatoa jr spurting lva everyday.
Meanwhile: England ftw
Or that one in iceland eljakakshdogjeuerjf
So it's not as dangerous
krakatoa is dangerous as hell
Bronysmith that is not cool!
not cool
i think
Dester: it isnt cool to misspell my name
^^^^
nd cause the schools suck.
The schools cuk because we let them suck
But Australia is better now.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Eyjafjallajökull. Is it bad that I know that by heart?
speed typing
causes errors
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/10/BZ5tOghDV0u9vTGxBEGgWw2.jpg
Eyja.... yeah.
/me has this great mental image of some divine forge where a large god is sitting over an anvil, admiring its new creation. ¨I SHALL CALL IT BRONY!¨
I knew that. SafariMonkey You remember the name of it? I knew it because with E, and them some messy letters.
>Implying Bronies could be created through divine means.
Hahahahahaha
Unnr, that made me laught so hard
And because teachers unions don't allow change in achools.
ASoftFluffyThing: :D
No change, just who dollars!
Meanwhile >implying Faust isnt a divine being
80% of the time bronies suck and I hate knowing them.
You meet the wrong crowd.
Meanwhile :'(
The only bronies that suck are the most noticiable one
Many bronies are gtreat
and the cloppers...
I have nothing agaisnt cloppers
Kawaii_icybeauti: My mom's faroese, so I can pronounce that kind of stuff. Hence, I remember it.
me either
Do you really see people from the worst few?
i mean its weird, but who are you hurting
I mostly meet the nice bronies.
It's like saying US is full of hicks and rednecks, that's insulting.
WHERE ARE THE HATERS? ILL TEAR THEM LIMB FROM LIMB!!!
SafariMonkey: Faroese has always been a mystery to me. Its readable but it sounds so weird
But to admit, there were some pedobears at bronycon :P
What ever hapened to love and tolerate?
Unnr: Where are you from?
Kawaii_icybeauti: lol
Kawaii_icybeauti: Oh god
[SWAG]Haku: sometimes works
Khorne: Probably somewhere around the spaghetti in your pockets.
And my reaction is a little less crazy...You should have seen my mom during the con :D
SafariMonkey: That would be telling... But I can read icelandic, swedish and old norse fairly well
In my Hiv, we shall all love and tolerate eachother
Now that's an interesting idea, portable spaghetti pack.
^
^^
ð and þ forever!~
[SWAG]Haku: i hope you fucking meant hive
portable spaghetti? DO WANT!
And then Meanwhile spurned an idea
Bronysith I did
=_(\
Food to go, the evolution.
Unnr: I can read icelandic, old norse, danish, french, saafi saafi and of course english.
Spaghetti is a term used to refer to the socially inept.
So yeah most of you could use it.
Meanwhile: How did someone manage to sneake a full plate of spaghetti into my pocket? It must gave taken some kind of tactical geniu-CREEEEEEEEED!!!!!
LOL, you use food to insult people?
Unnr: I think I forgot a few... nvmd.
Not me.
4chan.
Meanwhile: No, really? I kid but portable spaghetti aside from social awkwardness? Insta-foods
This pencil represents death
Eh, they are a strange group anyway.
the fandom shows you your own shame, Meanwhile?
Draweing helps me relax
Do you really want to use it as an insult in real world?
that's just silly.
The fandom shows me stupid people DaringDerpy. I hate stupid people.
later everypony, i'll be playing TF2
IM IN DISGUISE!!!
Stupid people only exist because we let them exist
Meanwhile don't worry, all fandoms have to deal wit hthat
You're weird Meanwhile.
Meanwhile: ever tried yoga?
Meanwhile, everything shows you stupid people. Not just the fandom.
Of course everything shows me stupid people, sadly stupid people exist.
GUESS WHO I AM!!!
But this was a conversation about the fandom.
Khorne
Khorne? who? Waldo?
I worked as a landlord, and I know real stupid people. You just love to point out something virtual.
/me Throws himself into the chat
hi Ponies47
Hello everypony :
:)
In a Hive, there are no stupid people
HI ponies47
hello mate.
Meanwhile but why just limit it to the fandom? The whole world is filld with idiots. Hell, there might be galaxies with idiots
hi Ponies47
[SWAG]Haku: IM A DISGUISED BLOOD GOD, SECRETLY IM ANOTHER PERSON! GUESS AGAIN!
Hai Ponies47
Hi Ponies47
Hi DerpyMuffins
Are you somehow implying that people being stupid on the internet is less stupid because it's on the internet?
In a hive you have no people
Khorne Cthullu?
Cthulu is best pony
idiots are a fact of life. hating them is like hating the weather. waste of time and energy
DOCTOR WHO!
DerpyMuffins: Same seond YEAH!
When you guys think of hives, youre jkust thinking of an insect hive but with people
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Derpy Hooves: Secret Origin / Have some Twixie / Party Crashers / Not This time
And yet most of the time I hate the weather too.
except you can't educate the weather.
I'm saying that sometimes because we only use text to judge people we ended up became too choosy
Meanwhile: Nope. Just saying that there's idiots everywhere, Internet and real life.
yeo
yep
Meanwhile: well of course, you're in Britain
Hey when are we gonna get some vids?
True.
Meanwhile: maybe you should work on your anger management skills
Ok who keeps pinging me
DerpyMuffins: not me
DaringDerpy: That's implying I'm angry. I'm not angry, I just hate stupid people.
DerpyMuffins not me
DerpyMuffins
Funny
Who doesn't hate stupid people?
is it me DerpyMuffins?
Actually I hate everyone, but stupid people give me more reason to do so.
I go here because I deal with a lot of people IRL as a landlord, in here I can be as silly as I can.
hate doesn't come from nowhere
/me trollface
Any stream now?
Nope
I Don't hate stupid people
Nope
I laugh at stupid people
Milk for the Khorne flakes?
I dont hate stupid people, i only wish for them all to become nonexistent
I just ignore people who are not interesting
Stupid doesn't mean they have bad morale.
I everyone
I don't dislike stupid people, I feel sorrow for them
Even smart people are corrupt too.
Meanwhile: so stupid people justify your hate.
On my end LimeV is doing maintenance :(
Lil_B your back
Im back bronies
good on ya mate
Politicians.....
what kind of "stupid" are we talking about here?
so somepeople are talkjing about stupid people eh? good to see people becomeing self aware

Khorne flakes are good :)

This Pecil represents death. Drawing helps me relax. I always try to draw Bronysith, but he always comes out with a lamb face. I wish i knew why.
Dovah: "Khorne left the room", "Dovah: Milk for the Khorne flakes?"
I don't know. This kind of chat is always a mess.
Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milk for the khorne flakes.
[SWAG]Haku: what my OC or actually me?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArC7XarwnWI Oh politics, I'm so glad I'll never vote.
I can say Meanwhile, but then everyone keep jumping in and out of the conversation.

It took me more than two hours thus my name in the list here turned gray:P
FAVORITE FRUITS OR VEGETABLES, GO!

Back to watching Darker than Black, ping me if you need me, or if a stream starts
How about spmeone stream anime!

Sword Art Online!
But then again, so is the entire Cagin language tree
Java: Genius! But which one?

The first episode?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Faithful and Strong Debut Live Now!
How do the mods become Mods anyhow? Or Stream for that matter
Kiwi!
ding fries are done ding fries are done ding fries are done
Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables
Dester, you sell your soul to the gods of bronystate
Dester: one, the moderation team opens up applications on occasion, and they apply.
Oppo Gangnum Styles
GabeMoist: :D
we will end this flamewar the same way gundam deals with war. kill everyone involved
there is no god. only derpy
FlameWar?
What about Lauren Faust?
Oh no not Zeta gundam again!
what flamewar?
Dester: two: they're given access to edit the BS site, and access to the BS stream client, be it MIPS, LimeV, or occasionally Livestream
She is the almight overlord.
the right hand of derpy
so, I have to change my artist name soon, maybe even my nick in the chat :(
Lil_B: :O why?!
Your name is good.
Lil_B: Why?
I have to go, bye
Copyright issues?
why? :(
Is any moderator here who can stream?
Just trademark it before someone copyright it.
Mods are asleep
cya
Sylandest because there is already a Rapper called Lil'B and People already confudsed me with him, not much here in the chat, but on Soundcloud
cya
Sad
Lil_B people are tracking you down and you need a new identity
?
oh, wow.
GabeMoist: post ponies?
I see.
Lil Bo?
STREAM IS ASLEEP, POST YOUTUBE!
Mods Asleep. Post ponies
Apparently one of the members in my MLP facebook group died last week.
Lil Bro!
Mods are asleep, post humans!
RAWRity: :'(
My condolence :(
Some good ol Count Chocula: http://dinosaurdracula.com/features/count-chocula-through-the-90s/
RAWRity: Oh nooo :(
Oh I know, how about Lil Brah?
Anyone here know the band Morphine or Mark Sandman?
According to the admins, it was a 16-year-old guy, and he was in an accident while camping with his eagle scout troop.
what? :(
know of them, I mean
ehmagawd......:(
ow
Being a boy scout is risky.
RAWRity: "Indeed, the very process of construction and creation foreshadow destruction and decay. The palace of today is tomorrow's ruin, the maiden of the morning is the crone of the night, and the hope of a moment is but the foundation stone of everlasting regret."
Scatman John
During WW2 Boyscout is also invoved in war.
RAWRity: sorry for your loss
They are brave kids.
My condolence.
/me hugs RAWRity
DoctoDoctorWho: not really "my" loss. I only new the guy as a pony icon and an occasional text message.
/me is hungry
oh dear RAWRity, my prayer goes out to you, his friends and family
here's the page if you want to see http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/6382/59219650.png (though the text is in norwegian)
RAWRity: not all that sad anyway,
huh
apparently he ended up falling off a mountainside.
Im not sad
D:
heck of a way to go out I guess
I want to die in my sleep
Mountaineering is always risku.
or be killed by ravenous scquirrels
The mangaka for Kobo-Chan also died like that.
/me fears death
Agh I mean Crayon shin chan
Maybe we should watch a video off site and talk through out nice chatbox here?
until a stream comes that is
[SWAG]Haku: not me, I wanna look that pussy death in the face as he tries to drag me to the other side>:0
we should watch kung fu hustle on youtube
ASoftFluffyThing: your name reminds me of A Song of Ice and Fire
a comment by a fellow classmate once disturbed me "Doesn't matter, we are Chemistry workes, we die early anyway" :(
RAWRity: How so?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdjFPPaisyQ
it just does
;ets start watching in at x:20?
I've never heard the song.
or :17
I remember that Nuclear scientiest have to get married first just in case of accident. So they will have children before theu died.

Dear Princess Celestia, today I had my judgement reafirmed that chat is a bunch of demanding 7-year-olds who want their bottle
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps1GMzNVagk Here awesome Rarity music :3
Not to overstep my lord, but I could easily see you doing that
cool :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFCj_Nud5fg
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: doing what?
my last link
Oh wait, is that that thing.
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: i don't see the relevance
Dear Sailor Pluto, you're no longer a planet but I still adore you, call me ;)
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: also, i don't get why you said "pedo reference" earlier
Sailor pluto died after freezing time to save the rest of the sailors.
Kawaii_icybeauti: um she didnt die
:'(
to the moon and back
Kawaii_icybeauti: she was banished for using the forbidden spell
you said "d'awwww, they're all so young", the first thing that came into my mind was pedobear
Bronysith: Man, I gotta watch the show again :P. So she's with luna now?
chrysalis is not best villain
Discord>NMM>chrysalis
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: you are wrong in the head.
DoctoDoctorWho, you have issues I think
Do not click this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x77sOUQhZU
have I sufficiently explained myself?
back, from TF2
Discord>Chrysalis>NMM
Bronysith: Everyone thinks different
RAWRity okay
/me clicks link
GabeMoist: YOU FOOL
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRAtKakob88
Ponies47: then dont say "best" cause that means it is a fact and "best" villains are a matter of opinoin
/me wakes up to tell chat to refresh
I made a Cover of a song in Majoras Mask, does anyone wants to hear it?
Im with Bronysith
Link: Don't touch me Zelda!
RAWRity, you said "do not click", so I must click
/me jumps in the air, landing on his horn in the ground
ohgodwhat
Lil_B all my want :3
GabeMoist: I told you.
I TOLD YOU
ATTNETION DUELISTS
ekips nice : D
Lil_B: link me up
still no stream :(
NMM had a better chance to take over the world than Chyrallis had of taking over Canterlot
Haku is eating raviollis
My hair would like to make an announcement
GabeMoist: you didn't listen to me, and now you have experienced Jedward
RAWRity, his hair is....
GabeMoist: THEIR hair
Handsome Squidward?
She just could keep it taken over
GabeMoist: that's 2 guys
I feel like you could hurt someone with their hair
Still NMM is just all out better than Chyrallis
DerpyMuffins: yup
"better" riiiiiight
Ooh musuc
Bronysith: True. You have a point. It's not a offical best like when it comes to favorite ponies. Like some love Rarity and others hate her.
Chrysalis' plan actually WORKED. NMM's plans failed 5 times in a row.
i like NMM better than Chrysallis,
and got progressively dumber.
Wait, we are in Rarity channel and people hate her?
The hell is this shit! Why wasn't I informed there was a stream! :[
RAWRity: that was all 1 attempt
Dovah: cause
ANGER!!
Ohai stream
Dovah: Because Sumica told everyone to refresh already
RAWRity: i just like the idea of a fallen hero as a villain really
ah that new album thingie
suddenly faithful and strong stream
Well atleast NMM still has a chance to take over the world if Luna ever turned evil again
Hey how long ago did this start?
zeg dat je het spijt
Dovah: also, Sumica said in chat to refresh
Ohai guys :)
Plan 1: Throw them off a cliff. Good, though it doesn't acount for 2 pegasi, but a good chance of killing somebody.
Hi MaxTheBrony
Hey Everyone! If you enjoy the F&S album, please be sure to donate to the Seeds of Kindness Fundraiser. All proceeds go to help an orphanage that we are trying to fully fund! http://broniesforgood.org/2012/09/seeds-of-kindness-2-launch/
lol
hi MaxTheBrony
how are things MaxTheBrony
We have stream!
Sup MaxTheBrony
hello
ohai MaxTheBrony
Plan 2: sic a Manticore on them. Again, good, and would have maimed somebody without Fluttershy there.
Hai MaxTheBrony
Heya ASoftFluffyThing The_Browncoat Ponies47 , Things are all good here , How are you alexxm ?
hi MaxTheBrony :)
Heya Michael Derpy_Hooves Lil_B :)
BfG]Rommel ohai
i'm good MaxTheBrony
Good to hear ! :)
good evening
Music stream, but oh well.
Hai there!
Plan 3: scare them with creepy faces. Don't get how that keeps them from just walking on, but whatever.
ASoftFluffyThing: i paraphrase something i said earlier: "I'm going back to watching Darker than Black, ping me when stream starts"
RAWRity: scaring them away from the elements
Are you guys enjoying the album?
thats a lot of tracks there
Dovah: I didn't see that. I was in the shower
I don't even know about steaming until you mention it
Dovah there is a stream.
36, to be exact.
Dovah: there is a stream...dumbass
It's his sled.
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo
hey
Plan 4: Keep them from crossing the river by making the sea serpent upset. Rainbow Dash could have flown them over one at a time with no trouble.
Hellooo Everyone! This is Scoot-Scootaloo streaming the album "Faithful and Strong"!
Bronysith: ..... I don't want to live on this planet anymore....
RAWRity: not really, she isnt THAT strong
Plan 5: Offer RD a spot on her fake sports team. Twilight could have fixed the bridge with her magic. Fluttershy could have flown across. They could have felled a tree to use as a birdge.
[BfG]Rommel how long was this Album in the works?
00,03whoops, let me try that again...
DoctoDoctorWho: she can lift them one at a time.
00,03 Hellooo Everyone! This is Scoot-Scootaloo streaming the album "Faithful and Strong"!
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
DoctoDoctorWho: she did it IN THE SAME EPISODE
hia Scoot-Scootaloo
plotholes!
00,03[BfG]Rommel is the head of everything that has to do with this album, correct me if i'm wrong...
Well, I'm a rep. of BfG
But I'll do my best to answer whatever questions you guys have.
this album is like 2.5 hours long
RAWRity: she would have tired out very quickly from lifting her own bodyweight over and over
00,03Either way, you are a major part in this!
well, Haku must take him leave for now.
Cya everypony
bye [SWAG]Haku
RAWRity, Rainbow Dash could lift them one at a time carrying three wonderbolts on her back
Over 2 hours of pony musi on one?
Lil_B: interestintg
think about that Hive idea
HOw dar are we into the album?
[BfG]Rommel: nop
Now, the Seeds of Kindness Faithful Strong album has been in the works since June and July.
[BfG]Rommel I'm on mylittleremix, I only joined 2 month ago, to bad I was too slow to contribute :(
No worries, it's not like it'll be the last one we do <3
Bronysith thanks, how did you like it? Or what did you thionk of it?
Hey I like this one.
GabeMoist: so yeah, that whole "mess up the river" thing is a completely worthless plan.
Lil_B: i said it was interesting,
[BfG]Rommel I'll gladly help top make the next one longer :)
GabeMoist: 16 weeks later, after countless training regiments, and ardrenal rush
:3
Bronysith sorry, but that is such a bad word top give someone, it's simply too vague
Lil_B: i liked it
heck, if need be RD and Fluttershy could have flown them over the river one at a time together to conserve energy. especially considering the river's maybe ten feet wide.
Bronysith ah, thanks
If you guys would like to procure a copy of the album and help fund the construction of an orphanage in Uganada, check out this pretty link here: http://broniesforgood.org/seeds-of-kindness-2/instructions/
RAWRity: one thing you need to understand is that this show lacks consistency
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Season 3 Hype - Will Anderson's Excusitve Producer Notw
Anyway, in conclusion: After Plan B failed, NMM started to suck at her job.
RAWRity: and also applejack is twilights best friend
I already that Will Anderson thing
Bronysith: not this horse shit again.
A news containing Will Anderson?! I will read that!!!
RAWRity: you mad cuz it true
l
Hello everyone :)
ohai MLP_Brovakiin
hey everypony
read that too in the afternoon
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not saying the idea of distracting them isn't a good idea. I'm saying she went about it horribly.
hey
ohai DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel
Yay, back to Mips! Who be streamin'?
Again, spooky tree jack-o-lanterns? What's to stop them from just walking through the area without looking at the trees? We're given no hint that they're trapped there.
Heya DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel
what are we watching DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel my little dashie had a sequel
alexxm: ya the author of the first approved this one
if Twilight could teleport all 6 across the stream at that time
RAWRity: giving the average intelligence of say, a mook or civilian, who were traumatised by a bunny stampede, she prolly thought she need'nt do more to deter them
or used her bubble
DJ_PON-3|MLD|Sequel which sequel is this
RAWRity: the way chrysalis lost is retarded. "your love has made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "you trying to gain power through love? yea thats not going to work"
Hahaha Notch just tweeted this "Time for this again: herobrine isn't real, no idea when the update is, we can't change usernames, and my favorite pony is rainbow dash. :D
For realsies
Herobrine isn't real D:
Keep trolling the minecrafter!
Meanwhile I need to finish my tree house.
more powerful than Celestia blasted away few minutes later ;)
Look at the end bit!
FINALLY GOT MIKE BACK
Bronysith: they werent changlings, how would you feel if somebody charged you intent on repelling your entire army with a ham sandwitch?
I know :)
alexxm: my little dashie sequel part 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NlxtHFxFng&feature=relmfu
DoctoDoctorWho: ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?!
<.<
Only 1 sandwich?
00,03No links while streams are on please~
00,03video links*
I liek sammich :3
You can bribe the whole army with snadwiches
Java: seems legit
Bronysith: why yes, quite fluently infact, thank you.
1 Sandvich is sometimes all it taskes too kille docents of people... especially if you steal the heavys sandvich
I like trains
FFOOOOOOOOMMMM!!
/me train hits Applejack2011
DoctoDoctorWho: chrysalis logic is "i kill you with this gun" person takes gun "yea that gun wont work on me" gets shot
applebucks doctorwho
Woo! How did you do it?
http://i.imgur.com/QiFjB.jpg hnnngggg
/me is slightly losing he mind
I think it bring message: Don't mess with ponies, even nornal ponies can deal with invaders.
Bronysith: more like "I beat you with the energy that only my race has offensivly used in the past, if you think it will work for you then your silly"
It will be ridiculous if they start to rely on Celestia and EoH only.
HEYA VERYPONY :D:D
HAY!
hi
hey Sonny
:3
Shift+click mailbox, teleport here, Mike shows up, stuck in driving position, shift+click Mike, force error, reset
Hey Sonny
hi Sonny
hey sonny
hey Sonny
DoctoDoctorWho: *you're and still doesnt stop with the ffact that her logic is fucking stupid
AJIsAwesome|AFK: I forgot to take my drawing with me when I moved to this house D:
she is worst villain in my books
@ScottaDJ: ya cant make an exception since its just music playing
hey everypony ^^
*villain
Heya Sonny
Yeah, I was working on somthing but I forgot to take it with me D:
how are things Sonny
good alexxm :)
so what are we watching
sonny: how ya f=doing
alexxm: an album of 2.5 hours leng
good DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel :3
Sonny: i cant type to save my life\
Bronysith: how does falling to a strategy that has never been used before count as logic faliure? She never could have seen it coming
*life
Faithful and Strong over 2 hours of Pony fan music
http://derpy.me/5qQXZ lawl
DoctoDoctorWho: she just admitted that love gave her power and when others tried to harness it she is all "ridiculous
"
This song is really nice, although I heard some noises in the background that sounded kinda strange XD
Michael: :D
lawl
Who's streaming?
MadSurge: poor sokka :(
Bronysith: Like I said, Love energy has only been used as offensive power by changlings, ponies were not thought capable of harnessing it
Sokka, always suffering?
Michael: well he sorted it out at least
so it was a surprise to everyone
DoctoDoctorWho: they never used it offensively. only for food
Sonny: i heard you talking about a drawing you forgot
yeah MadSurge
ye DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel my parents are devorced and I forgot to take my drawings with me on USB-stick D:
Bronysith: giving themselves more power, thus, stronger attackes. As proved with chrysalis's battle with celestia
Sonny: oh my Celestia unacceptable i would be bawling my eyes out if i forgot all of mine
I know right D:
/me yawns
but I was working on one tough D/
Celestia should have beamed Chrysalis without announcing that she was going to fight her
DoctoDoctorWho: and she admits she gained power through shinings love. so much love that when he combined with Cadance it was overwhelming. it still comes down to chrysallis is fucking retarded by saying "trying to gain power through love is a stupid sentiment." shen she said she gained power through love, doesnt matter how she gained it. LOVE IS POWER
Hat: good guys dont do cheap shots
Hat: sneak attacks are for the weak
Even when she needs to protect her land?
I understand it storytelling wise though
I didn't know the sims was that glitchy:P (I never played very much, though)
Hat: in my country we face our opponents before fighting them. and if they are unarmed. we offer them a sword
or the smart
Bronysith: a power she thought only she could harness
What country?
klingon
...........
Besides, Celestia was weak compared to Chrysalis in her state, so sneak attack was in order
:P
;)
HELLO
I heard a news that Michael Dorn is going to make Star Trek: Captain Worf TV series.
so what albulm
Hat: only scum use sneak attacks, there is no honor in cheap shots
google it, it's everywhere.
Hat: is that what you want to teach kids? cheap shots ftw?
ohai sonicandmario85
hi
alexxm faithful and strong
HAPPY BIRTH DAY TOO YOU KILLERPONY
alexxm 2
hia sonicandmario85
Who sing this song? nice vocal.
i heard birhtday?!
No, I understand they couldn't do that for the story Bronysith. But do you think it would be better for Celestia to do it so her land wasn't overthrown?
Hat: she would have lost moral points for that, and baseline, chrysalis was weaker than celestia. even with the power boost chryssy had to struggle
*birthday
its in his name
it's not, shibaru just likes breaking things :P
oh
bday_killerpony7733
Sonny: i feel ya everytime something happens to a drawing i've been working on (btw i use paper and pencil since i dont have a drawing tablet) i make sure nothing happens to them
I'm not trying to break anything xD
happy birthday bday_killerpony7733 :O
Hat: basicly, celestie thought she could take her
haha
Celestia*
DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: I know that feeling when you forget your drawing D:
I wouldn't take any risks if I was in her position
Just at the moment you've at your inspiration peak >.>
congrats herres Pinkie Pie party
Happy Birthday bday_killerpony7733 :)
I'm still not back to normal yet. I can't save, go to neighborhood, or quit
DoctoDoctorWho:can i go to when the dinosours existed? :D
Sonny: because when something happens to them i get really steamed at the person or thing held accountable
Why can't you save?
DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: I know that feel bro :[
Hat: cheap shots dont look good
they wouldnt like their leader as much
thinking her to be a coward
i kicked ass with the portal gun
Hey guys, who here likes Celestia?
Badass dog is badass http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im1wweOz4qY
Java: no links during stream
[BfG]Rommel: i liek everypony :)
Sorry.
everypony best pony
Because the next song is Raise the Sun by Forest Rain.
It's just it's too funny not to share.
And it is EPIC.
Java:only images are allowed
Okay
you gotta share
I am a Luna fan personally though :3
Java:during a stream
Okay.
Celestia is closest to my personality, said a chart
I love both Luna and Celestia
Sonny: and as since i use paper and pencil theres no recovering it (for example: i was at school finishing a spitfire drawing and somepony was throwing water around in art class *being a complete moron* hit my paper ruined it so i had to leave the class to calm down or else i would have been like fluttershy in the bear neck snapping episode
I think cuz it glitched Mike when I was trying to go out
D:
Applejack2011:same
I hate when peopel are unrespectfull against some artists work
every alicorn best alicorn
^
Indeed.
They wouldn't revolt just because she took on an enemy in a less-than-honorable fashion
lol fail
Applejack2011: agreed :D
I respect all ponies, But if war broke out, I'd side with Celestia
DoctoDoctorWho: I'd side with the winner
for example DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel Somepony goes as far as to compose a song for a certain somthign from for example mlp fim and posts it on youtube but the poeple there don't like it, and because it's not as perfect as it should be they start hating it because everypony else does
For LUNA!
/me noms on DoctoDoctorWho
http://i.imgur.com/M8JU2.jpg
Hat: But she would lose respect
DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: At least we try to entertain the fans of mlp fim, D:
Sonny, I like it when the commenters get angry when the musician asks for donations. Amaazing
DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: you can't win without trying :3
kirzstryfe: GET OFF ME LUNARIAN SCUM!
Hat: haha xD
yeah ikr :p
that was one of the first fanart of FiM I saw
Sonny: true
/me puts on grey knight armor
FOR THE SOLAR EMPIRE!!
I mean if you go as far as to express the feelings of someone in a song, at least try to apreciate their attempt
DoctoDoctorWho: for peace in equestria
/me pauses
Have you seen that ricksatin guy, he posts on the videos within a minute of EqD posting them. He obviously browses the site
Michael: better Idea
peace is overrated

8,05Michael: I'm not a mod, just consider me a network service type thing ;)
DoctoDoctorWho: lies, you'd be hiding in a bunker tellin people what to do

DoctoDoctorWho: well, I don't really take sides that easily, and they both appeal to me, honestly I would probably just be a bandit, or a raider or something

/me is listening to strauss
Heya Shizuka
7even though it's late
7and half the size
hi
and hai Shizuka
hi Shizuka
Shizuka: you might not want to sit there...
AJIsAwesome: we were discussing NLR vs Solar Empire and who is best villan
7and they changed Derpy.
7but still!
darn, tomorrow festive day :|
They made an announcement about making an announcement.
Helloooooo everypony! :)
hia Shizuka
7ah, Hasbro
and hi TheMonstaMuffin :)
AJIsAwesome: what are your thoughts?
ohai TheMonstaMuffin
Thanks Michael Applejack2011 MLP_Brovakiin alexxm DoctoDoctorWho :)
and how the man 6 could had crossed the stream
Hi Shizuka
how are things TheMonstaMuffin
Hi TheMonstaMuffin :)
mane
Hat: actually, not even sith do sneak attacks
hi TheMonstaMuffin
Hi Lil_B, AJIsAwesome and alexxm things are good :)
hi
Hi thelonepony!
DoctoDoctorWho: Best Villain: Discord. NLR Vs. Solar Empire: Neutral.
What about Anakin and Mace
Hi Applejack2011
Hat: those guys arent sith dumbshit
Bronysith: what are you on, sith do sneak attacks
Hat: when did they sneak attack anyway?
In that scene where Mace gets thrown out the window, I think
Bronysith: does the great jedi purge remind you of anything?
order 66?
later, gtg dinner
cowvarkian: thats not canon star wars dumbfuck
-_-
Whats diz?
orly
Hat: he was expecting him to fight, windu's gaurd was lowered
Bronysith: since when wasnt that canon?
or did i just miss a meeting
cowvarkian: and that wasnt sith doing sneak attacks, those were republic commandos
dumbfuck...
A sensitive issue for Bronysith
Bronysith: ok, so you're telling me that palpatine isnt a sith lord then?
cowvarkian: hes not a sith lord
cowvarkian: hes THE sith lord
Bronysith: there are easier ways to voice your opinion than calling everypony dumbfuck
he keeps himself alive by draining the force life from planets
Bronysith: mmk... so, since THE sith lord ordered the great jedi purge, wouldn't that have been a sith sneak attack?
no wait
thats the emperor
cowvarkian: no, cuz he didnt kill them, the clones did
...
Haha
the clones were under his command
but
he
DIDNT KILL THEM
Dovah did you find it?
Get in car, get out of car, car drives off on it's own, car appears back in driveway
the clones did
WHAT
DerpyMuffins: no....
Bronysith: yeah, and the clones were under his orders
cowvarkian: but he didnt kill them, his clones did
I think Bronysith is missguided.
Dovah: norly
Actually the jedi put up 66 incase they all turned evil simultaniously, they werent traitors, they're just really good at following orders
Bronysith: so, you're saying that the hands of the sith are not of the sith?
>.>
Do clones even have free will, I can't remember
Hat: technically yes
but they follow orders really well
i do not even know why im arguing over non canon bull shit
Bronysith: give me a source over where it's non canon
7Having seen you is not the same as knowing you.
and palpatines master stroke WAS a sneak attack tho, but we're talking about 1v1 cheap shot sneak attacks
cowvarkian: cause the prequels are not part of the original trilogy
7I know you currently run the chat
7I know your name.
7This is all.
It is the rule in war, if ten times the enemy's strength, surround them; if five times, attack them; if double, be able to divide them; if equal,engage them; if fewer, be able to evade them; if weaker, be able to avoid them
I want this: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/298694_10151071223307157_1339725931_n.jpg
Bronysith: so, are you saying that anything not part of the original trilogy isnt canon?
Umm we could always go further than that :)
Bronysith: YES! YES THEY F***ING ARE!
RAWRity: :O WANT
DoctoDoctorWho: the prequels are not part of the original trilogy
7(Psst. Dari. You're far more versed in homo-eroticism. Am I being hit on?)
THE OT IS 4 5 6
the prequels are 123
RAWRity: :O
is the music off?
Bronysith: and how exactly does that make it non canon
RAWRity: ooooooooooh fuck
Bronysith: they are still canon
ok it's not
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting
DoctoDoctorWho: they are not part of the OT cause trilogy is 3
Lawl
Bronysith: where does it state that anything not in the original trilogy is non canon?
if you think trilogy means 6 then you are fucking stupid
ph XD the middle of the stream is too bright for me to see the buffer ring XD
OT, no. Canon? Yes
Bronysith: where are you getting your information
7You I have exchanged pleasantries with. I shan't say I /know/ anyone lest I actually mean it.
the prequels dont even work as a star wars movie. but as an action movie they do
...
Bronysith: are you going to actually answer us, or just rant on about nothing in star wars except the original movies are canon
Alright! We really ARE doing this!
OK did anyone here PM me in the past few days? I got a PM on my phone but it disappeared because I didn't have internet on.
the original trilogy and KoToR are best things star wars can ever make
Bronysith: so, still not answering questions
donno what happend there D:
anyway gonna draw now
Bronysith: please enlighten me as to how 3 movies specificly marked "star wars" isnt a star wars movie?
:/ It was just a friendly response
Bronysith: and animated series, books, and so on
that are in the star wars canon
Mwaha. I came here to show you this: http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/JessicoChan/Letsscratch_zps7ebabe6f.png
X)
cowvarkian: no, KoToR and the OT are the best stuff of star wars
...
wait theres a charity event?
Bronysith: we aren't arguin on that point, but on what is canon
Bronysith: OT?
JunkerKun neat
JunkerKun: original trilogy
cowvarkian: preferably none of the games.
8,05Over 1k donated, you bronies are awesome XD
bye MakerDusk
Bronysith: Oh. What about Jedi Knight?
Burning Starrrr
JunkerKun: i still think KoToR is better, but that was good
ohai MakerDusk,
what's the "bye" for, Bronysith?
Dken2021: I think I'll make it my new avatar =)
Lasharus: I just want to know Bronysith 's opinion of it, but he doesn't seem to be responding
MakerDusk: you highlighted ur text
hi MakerDusk I have not seen you in like ever since I'm on Bronystate :/
JunkerKun cool
MakerDusk woot?
Burning star!
He was joking. :P
SSSSSUUUUPPPP GUYS
yea?
hai Bunny_Striker
Hi, Bunny_Striker
TheMonstaMuffin: W00T!
Bronysith: Mhm. I like both of them but KOTOR is better
cowvarkian: the prequels seem to not even have anything to do with the OT
Heya Bunny_Striker
lets all ignore Bronysith, he's gone broken record on us
MakerDusk: Over 1,000 already? Well considering how much we quickly throw stuff to charity like Tara or the documentary that's not suprising
Hey Bunny_Striker!
Bronysith: I'm unkickable and unbanable...
what we doin?
MakerDusk: Seriously WOOOOOT
Bronysith: how exactly does that make them non canon?
Bronysith, live long and prosper
DoctoDoctorWho: it happens sometimes
Whats this song? :D
DoctoDoctorWho: Bronysith never has been able to put up a good arguement
cowvarkian: it seems that they dont even follow through with the OT with things like "midochlorians" and all that bullshit
Hey Everyone. Have a tracklist: http://broniesforgood.org/seeds-of-kindness-2/album/
Lil_B: I usually lurk
Dovah: my skyrim argument was valid, i said i didnt like the gameplay, glitches, bad story, combat wasnt my thing, etc and you just called me ignorant
I generally have too many pms to be able to talk much in channels
Bronysith: along with the fact that the prequals completely explain how the sith got to be the empire, nothing to do with the OT at all.
the bain of being a network admin ;)
MakerDusk ah, ok, so is it ok, to ping yyou if I have an importend question for a mod ?
http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/631719-poultry-farmers-cry-foul-over-market.html the ugandan chicken market seems to be oversatiated. hope they know what they are doing
Lil_B: I'm not a mod, I'm a step above
MakerDusk is an irc admin, not a #bronystate mod
So this on the stream is a special event? :O
Guys what is this song
MadSurge: it is
pardon me, how did i get here?
MakerDusk more like three steps above
Bronysith: you are ignorant, you refuse to see our deliscious logic
Bronysith: wasnt talking about that and dont bring it up again i am far too busy to be bothered with it.
it's a charity event
MakerDusk: I see!
IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer: I blink packed you in, simple enough
Dovah: STFU you called me ignorant and that is why i raged over skyrim, you are just like a stupid politician, "dont agree with me and you are ignorant"
J_E_Smith71: that doesn't make it any less amazing
DoctoDoctorWho: he could at least acknowledge things in the star wars universe, other then the things he likes, as canon...
Dovah: you called my reasons. not real reasons, so stfu
I wanna know what this is!
Oh alright
TheMonstaMuffin: it's one of the charity songs
Bronysith: I call you ingoratn because you ARE. Learn to deal with that fact and your life will be better.
ignoRant8
TheMonstaMuffin: It's on the link [BfG]Rommel provided.
IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer: I don't know, maybe you clicked a link somewhere? And it seems you must have turned into a female since you're name is IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAm*HER*
MakerDusk: But i really liked the one before!
Dovah: how am i ignorant on skyrim? i didnt like it and i gave valid reasons
*facehoove* damn lag.
AJIsAwesome but i liked the one before this!
Dovah: and you disagreed and called me ignorant like a dumb politician
MakerDusk thats even better, I ment things like announcing something via Bronystate (I'm helping someone with a project and he needs some people from other countries, so I thought it would be a nice Idea to make an announcement on Bronystate, but I need to get in touch with an Admin of bronystate before that)
8,05TheMonstaMuffin: if you donate, I do believe you get a download of the album: http://www.betterplace.org/en/groups/seeds-of-kindness-2
... well at least i didn' spent tons of dollars to change my sex
MakerDusk: What/which Charity/ies?
Bronysith: not skyrim everything you are incompiten
Dovah: no, you called me ignorant specifically over why i didnt like skyrim and accused me of not even playing it,
IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer, you name indicates otherwise
boy let me tell yalove i sure love apples
SafariMonkey: all the information about the charity is available at http://broniesforgood.org/
SafariMonkey: bronies for good in collaboration with My Little Remix and a bunch of partners including bronystate, and of course PonyChat has tossed in our support
Bronysith: your arguments crumbling, your pride, shot. just pick up that rotten bag of shit that you used to be able to call your dignity before you make an even bigger fool of yourself.
DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: ikr
ok, listening to the stream at the moment, is bad, my connection is going down again >.< why now while good music plays :(
grr, made a fullscreen application with no way of exiting, lol
Bronysith: Yeah, and noW im calling you completly and utterly imbocilic.
cowvarkian: its from Apples.MOV
Thanks MakerDusk and RAWRity
MORE APPLES
DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: yeah, I know
Dovah: tell me exactly why i am ignorant over skyrim. right now. I didnt like the gameplay, how easy it was, the bad combat, wretched story, easy short guild quests, glitches and overall gameplay
MakerDusk ok, thanks I'll do that
I'm stuck on the first track by Warbalist, it is too good
Ok
Derpy_Hooves: you're missing the charity event! :O
Ok guys
I haven't played Skyrim, but I can definitly say that the Soundtrack is overhypüed >.<
AFK*
yay
Hi Derpy_Hooves! How ya doin'?
Dovah: that was a well put argument
Dovah: NO, you called me ignorant over skyrim, tell me why NOW
Bronysith: thats all in your opinion, If I remember correctly, you started hating on it first and Dovah came to defend it.
Dovah: tell me how why i am ignorant for not liking what everyone else likes
Bronysith: why don't you calm down

Bronysith: you refuse to try to understand others arguements, instead of countering with useful logic. that is ignorance.
DoctoDoctorWho: i was saying relative to skyrim
Ohai GigabitHarmonie :)
Dovah: i beat the stupid PoS of a game,
Dovah and Bronysith get a room
hey all!
Bronysith and DoctoDoctorWho, how about you both go your own separate ways and drop the conversation altogether
hi Turgle
Bronysith :| Please, it's not like I'm having whole conversations in other languages, plus greeting people in different languages is totally normal for a lost of people here
hi Turgle
Hi Turgle :)
Bronysith: Prove it.
Heya Turgle

this place is always FULL of people :D
DaringDerpy: nope, just changing mods
MadSurge: real life kicked in since feb
oh, ok
:|
Dovah: i beat it, because you have to learn the dragonrend shout to stop alduin and when you go to the afterlife you get with diseased dragonborne and defeat alduin there
Bronysith: so, by beat, you mean the main quest?
Turgle: Awww, I came in in february, so most likely we never met before!
hey guys. what's this?

Dj_Cyber-4G, so what?
I feel contempt between you two

/me cries under a pillow
Dj_Cyber-4G: im always watching you, remember that....
/me creates a defencive bood fort
/me BOOK fort
dear gosh what have you done to him princess_sprinkle
CrimsonPhoenix: nuthin.... <:
Dj_Cyber-4G: did you know bookforts have a lot of shadows?
not if they have torch crystals in them
Dj_Cyber-4G: well okay then, i know where to start
if you could turn into a pony what type would you be
becareful don't touch them or you will freeze your hand off
unicorn
i would definitley be a pegasus
Dj_Cyber-4G: okay, thanks for the advice, thisl make everything easier <:
Earth pony, IMO.
im a unicorn T3T
I'd rather stay on the ground.
Pegasus
I would def go Unicorn, why? becuase with a spell you can walk on clouds and fly! with the benifits of using eveyday magic!
not me i would love the freedom of flying...and to visit cloudsdale
i want to be a unicorn for two reasons, one is the more obvious, the other being that i want to study how magic workds
I'm earth Pony, who knows Science!
fukken magic, how does it work
i love flying but the pegasus body is smaller and more areodynamic saying o would break a lot of bones
Piano <3
/me kidnaps princess_sprinkle
i want to watch Animaniacs again
/me leaaps for joy
what shirt are you ta lking about?
alexxm: yay, where are we going today? can we go play with Dj_Cyber-4G ?

<:
/me locks himself in the book fort
I hope I'll make a Piano song to in the future, but I have to start prakticing again + go through teh theory again (what accord goes well with what when you ise which key etc...
Now that I think about it, I've always wanted to fly. I considered making my OC a pegasus, but I feel that the pegasus OC idea has been overdone.
i have to get to chapter 12
[floor 12]
time to sleep. good night, afternoon, whatever! :)
bye DaringDerpy
Night night

GigabitHarmonie: yes, that one. where's it from?

I use my stick
Bronysith did you forget that you were a unicorn again?
I use my fingers.
im a pegasus (but i cant fly)
Dj_Cyber-4G: twilight forgets shes a unicorn all the time
i have a specail computer that transfers my thoughts to the screen
trixie keeps blocking my chat
Dark_Horst: also, yes, it is 36 tracks, just checked the download. Bad, GigabitHarmonie, you're selling the album short with 34 XD
yeah it was a birth defect, right flutterchu?
flutterchu why cant you fly
im a pegasus im faster then rainbow dash
thatsnot possiblr something
in exchange for the controll of electricity
dynamo2814: look at the chat above yours
something: hello mr uncreative
MakerDusk: still cant find it one the tracklist. i feel like im missing something
i did it dynamo2814 i beat her
dynamo2814: Look at Scootaloo.
i want to be like twilight someday but im not a magic studyer 24/7 i DJ
http://i.imgur.com/PShxF.jpg IT ALL MAKE SENSE NOW
something: I hope you get kicked in the teeth.
something: nopony is faster than rainbow dash
CrimsonPhoenix: That's the ONLY YOLO I accept.
Meanwhile: that's a strange reaction
GigabitHarmonie: the songs you're playing now, are they on the faithful and strong album?
im going to set something on fire
Dark_Horst: it isn't on the album, it's one that was released free
Dark_Horst: No, that was what the last two hours were.
your not in ponyvile
oh, okay

ARGH!

Bronysith: Another Hope.

AJIsAwesome: normally id be pissed that someone answered instead of my target, but thats okay, he isnt going to answer me anyway
AJIsAwesome: thank you
Michael: just a random orphanage, or do we ahve some sort of investment in it?
Bronysith: Sorry.
AJIsAwesome: no no no, thank you
Bronysith: oh i didnt know its That easy to piss you off :P
btw, the orphanage itself was already funded right?
Um.....you're welcome?
cowvarkian: i know the donations go to uganda, investment: i dunno
AJIsAwesome: yummy
IM BACH
yeah well im mozart
or was it a clinic that was funded?
that akward moment when you try to talk your classmate brony but you are to shy
Bronies help fund an orphanage in uganda....chickfila funds one that murders homosexuals
so ive heard
orphanage and chicken farm
expanding an orphanage
what/who the hell is chickfila?
scooltaloo is at the chicken farm!
why feed scootaloo to orphans?
isnt scootaloo an orphan?
dynamo2814: just start with something pony-related. maybe ask him "so youre a brony?"
Bronysith: because they create sustainable food?
those old Scoots jokes
eat more chicken!
yeah but the is also a chicken

hungery
Dovah: if you like photographs watch http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/ . they always have some awesome photo albums.
kirzstryfe: Find what?
Again I bet the delay in the season is probably due to shorter episode count. Hopefully S4 will have a full 26 and we get it sooner
that image
AJIsAwesome: in one abandoned house
Michael: Okay
Violet gave it to me to put up for streams. :)
Shizuka: is that oreo ice cream in an oreo?
mmk, was just wondering, because I've only posted that in one spot
*sigh* *spreads arms*
Man, what happened to me, I been up since 8am and spent most of my time looking at ponies and chatten here

Pyro here, agrees with fire

Bronysith: Iseewhatyoudidthere.jpg
Is this song part of the Faithful and Strong album?
No
I have been out of the loop for like a month. What has happened recently other than this album project?
brb
Kandarihu: You missed the Faithful and Strong portion of the stream, right now is Gigabit's Harmonies radio show.
GigabitHarmonie: DAncing mad please?

Oh, so it's already over?

Well, I'm enjoying this anyway.
flutterchu: Not really. Appreciate what's given to you.

Michael: seems legit
Michael: not as awesome as she thinks though :P
???
Michael: i actually know the site where you can do pics like that
yeah :)
but rainbow dash is the second worse one
not awsesome
Once I get my GTX 550Ti I'll be doing more stuff hopefully on top of the radio show. For now, enjoy the tunes!
:D
Sweet!
applejack is more loyal to her friends than rainbow dash really

DerpyMuffins: Sheesh.

Chrysalis: i said otakon x everything
Chrysalis must you distract me from TF2 just for that?
FlutershyxBig Mac,or CheerilyxBig Mac?

*Cheerilee
Chrysalis: thats the reason of bronyism
its Vivi x Shizu. Rain x Ghost :3
13our shipping und receiving department is huge~
Shadi: Neither. I don't ship.
Talk about money well spent
Chrysalis, were you here on the Otakon x anything period?
otakon ships with all packages that cost more then 3 cents, and weigh over an ounce
Waiting on a Gigabit ship, but I fear the day it happens.
I mean had I been distracted for something worthwhile or amusing I'd have been fine
But noooooooooo
CheerileexBigMac
it's four million year old shipping jokes.
CrimsonPhoenix yes
CrimsonPhoenix: I wasn't WHat happened?

CrimsonPhoenix: but you are right
Shizuka: quit your drinking <_< >_>

Chrysalis: That's terrible. :D
which is far better
/me Goes back to lurking in the shadows
What now Chrysalis what is it now.
And it had better be worth it this time.

Didn't they publish Cyberia?
13cyberia

oni_link: At this rate it might be a while. We we're almost ready to go. We just needed Nittany but with how Toy is right now. :S
Does everymerc need to have their own ticket to get into a particular Mann Up mode game or is it possible for one ticket-holder to invite friends?
13BG i almost always go rogue, abuse imoen's trap finding while i max out lockpicking
/me calls cops on alexxm
13khalid and jaheira are well worth keeping until the end

13and as soon as you're able, get minsc
And I'm back
Shizuka: minsc?
Kandarihu: You can all play MvM but Mann Up requires a ticket for each person

alexxm:always has been in real life XD
13quite a lot of amazing VAs are in the BG series

Shizuka: Mark meer is

Bronysith, the mann up game me and Chrysalis played
*is wondering what glomps means*?
13mann up wasn't much fun
Phase4: ahh
teardrop its an aggressive hug
Bronysith, two engies, two heavys, scout and soldier
13not worth $6 to get a stock flamethrower with a giant ugly heavybot head on it
Bronysith and everyone knew what they hell they were doing
I'm back, and I bring some awesome music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxhgahONgZc

Reikim, windows decided that functioning is for squares
Booooooo
so i had to reinstall
Clearly Windows cannot handle you.
fortunately i had done some ahead of time planing for that
Reikim, it really cant
I'm honestly surprised that KSP has yet to die on you, given the tortures you've put the poor thing through.
Reikim, i've killed it several times

Oh no. Not that.

Welcome back, NocturnalBlade :)
Ergh
A fanfiction help thingie
Hi NocturnalBlade :)
I DONT TRUST YOU : i know how it goes alRIGHT
Long story short, it's really, really bad.
Bad?
flutterchu is the worlds biggest distributor of acid
It's like someone threw afterbirth on a keyboard.
I understate just slightly.
...
Okay that made me laugh.
:'(
I am constantly at a loss as to how I am supposed to help it.
princess_sprinkle: which acid...the drug acid or the burn your face acid?
princess_sprinkle: pretty offending dont you think
13eep mouse battery dying
NocturnalBlade: the drug
Nuuuuuuu not the mouse battery
dat pimp mouse
13and of course it would be AAAs not AA
flutterchu: why, y u no like acid?
Shizuka, but of course
Acid lowers defense! :P
Shizuka: that sucks
Triple As
Really?
well i think ill hit the hay
13hm
no pun intended
Bye GentleHeaven :)

Bye Gent - oh well too late
XAX, as fast as it will ever be, so ~80% of linux and its all downhill from here
I c.
Okay
Last ditch effort
This is the VERY LAST THING I am going to do for him.
Tell him to delete it.
I am going to rewrite that entire atrocious first chapter and shove it at him.
If he fails to get the point then he is on his own after that.
Here lies Wilfred Windows, Phase4 replaced you with a virtual copy of you so you are not missed.
And chat is ded
Having read the first chapter I guess I'll go measure out a coffin.
Winamp, pretty in any decade.
<3
/me loves Winamp.
it sure has changed.
wish i could virtualize windows, but i need it for games and vm's dont like games
If I survive this I'll be stronger for it. If I can pull through then- oh who am I kidding this is going to give me soooooo much depression.
and ohai Kurra :P
Stream is very...epileptic atm.
hihi
I......can't......look..........away.....
the visuals are nice
That's what happens when flutterchu distributes the secret stash of acid, Meanwhile.
AdamTheDuck: :D
I never really understood the whole "all the colours all the time everywhere" thing while playing music.
rawer?
Anyone seen Ghost_Nappa around here lately?
"So there are things wrong with my stuff besides technical stuff?"
asdfghjkl
Meanwhile, I like to think it's a "What your white wall would look like after taking industrial grade acid" simulator
i think Ghost_Nappa appears at night
AdamTheDuck: 10/10
Nice knowing you.
Reikim, it might be time to be completely blunt
or are you and he's not getting it
08,01okay, so i've had the best idea ever
Ooh I like ideas
WHat is it?
Windows Media Player should have automatic PMV option in the visualisations
08,01for BUCK next year, i'm cosplaying as a fetish pinkie pie

That is the worst idea you have ever have.
The thing is
.............
o.o
I can't just say "you are wrong".
08,01they match with her gala dress!
I have to explain where he is wrong, why he is wrong, and how to not be wrong.
^:D
Meanwhile: Ever had* :>
Don't get me wrong you've managed some spectacularly bad ideas but that tops it.
08,01Meanwhile: thank you <3
You're welcome.
But really, don't do that.
Meanwhile: i think he just targeted you
The......hell? O___o
Okay, I need examples of two authors with very different writing styles.

NOPE.AVI
/me glomps Shizuka
I've been wondering, why is the background rocks?
Industrial grade acid simulator is best mix
Meanwhile: why wouldnt it be?
cause its Shizuka destiny
ROCKS ARE COOL.
That's not an answer.
Shizuka, I don't mind this music
Meanwhile: okay then , hang on
Meanwhile: because they are filled with gems
A ROCK? THAT'S MY DESTINY?
Aaaand now it's trees.
Now they're trees :3
fluttershy's everywhere
Meanwhile: The answer is CHEESE
...Oh sorry, I seem to have gone into shock for a second there.
And then what looks like wheat.
/me CHEESE. It's good as any answer
13ponies probably do not even notice the vis is changing in time with the music
/me (cue yodeling)
vis?
Well, it's a visualizer
Meanwhile: Visuals
/me gives Shizuka booze
Oh.
Oh I don't think anyone's ignorant of that.

Logic does not apply to this guy.

Funny. I'm more experienced at writing than art, yet I can better explain style in terms of art than writing.

Spaghetti and turkey meatballs
Chat rolls it's eyes when you talk.
13but that's my job
Chat is chat
Shizuka: hey whatcu think of NGE? i never got an answer
You should know this by now.
It can always get worse.
Just popped in to ask if you guys are going to stream the uh.. Oscars
Aww did chat die when I was away? :<
Reikim|Crowbar: well what do you think of it?
i thought i'd try mech jeb in ksp
it got terribly confused when staging
NGE? Pretty damn good stuff.
flutter_spin, isn't that in the Spring?
13ditto rei
Ending was unfortunate, but they fixed that.
Did it blow up?
Rebuild is kickass.
aparently it doesnt like my rockets
Whatever it is tonight
Reikim|Crowbar: i couldnt get into it, too depressing
Go watch Rebuild.
^
Rei is best emotionless person
Meanwhile, staged at an odd time while spinning, took out one of the engines on the next stage
I LOVE NGE.
I was practically crying manly tears at the end of 2.02.
Hello :P
...
i stopped at NGE and started watching GaoGaiGar
I have to see this.
did i miss the album stream?
xD
Hello there Resonantwaves
howdy :3
It was my first ever anime to watch in years. :$
Hi Resonantwaves :)
:3 herro
My mom is watching the awards thing in 15min. I wonder whats on tv nowadays
I thought NGE was kinda uninteresting, it was redeemed by having Asuka torn apart by giant birds. That was kinda funny.
ohai Resonantwaves , how are your phases matching up today
i'ma try it on one of my other insane huge craft
NGE...I liked it. Hm
Meanwhile, funny? :<
What else to say?
AdamTheDuck: Absolutely, the character's a twonk.
Reikim|Crowbar: i just started GaoGaiGar, and i love it
But yeah, Sith, go watch Rebuild of Evangelion instead.
^
huh wha?
lol
Been going through the Doctor Who series
Meanwhile, there was a reason for her being mentally unstable...
Hey Shizuka. "GIVE AYANAMI BACK!" Best moment in Rebuild.
Is MLP nominated for anything?
AdamTheDuck: And yet the best thing she ever contributed was being ripped to bits.
Non?
seems to be doing better with dense mk 5
Kandarihu: What do you mean?
13so... after probably 10 years of using winamp... i just now learned the default skin has a higher resolution spec analyzer
Kandarihu: Won the Tubey awards
Does that even mean anything?
then again that thing is incredibly controllable, everything has thrust vectoring and there are a lot of engines
ASoftFluffyThing: It won best animated TV show of 2012.
*2011/2012
AJIsAwesome: Yep
13you mean that rei
?
o.o Dat badass
13or are you not watching

Oh Shinji, why you so badass
yeah, stuff exploded again

Sorry, not watching
He's crowbar, presumably he's playing Mesa.
Hell yes.
13badass shinji?
13like this?
dat Cathedral mix
Badass Shinji was the best part of Rebuild.
wait just a minute...fall is here... EAT ALL THE CANDY CORN
Everything he ever did was instantly redeemed by Rebuild.
^
^^ lol
Reikim|Crowbar: shinji+badass do not go together...
wait... what's rebuild?
Sith, go watch Rebuild. WATCH IT.
Why did he have boobs in that pic?
Hehe, I remember that episode :D
Bronysith: AND EAT ALL THE CANDY CORN CREME OREOS
Meanwhile: It's the suit.
Rebuild took Shinji and gave him almost Simon levels of badass. I am not even lying here.
it doesnt know how to stage my rockets
Meanwhile, the episode where he had to pilot EVA 2 with Asuka
AJIsAwesome: They're like B cups.
It's the way it's designed.
Reikim|Crowbar: shinji...simon levels of badass you say?
iiiiiiiinteresting
Shinji's got boobs, canon.

Damnit kirz, why do you still have that.
Meanwhile: when u getting a tophat?

Uh no Kitty, not everyone should die, like Lauren, Tara, de Lancie, etc
ASoftFluffyThing: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
You can make it, Fluffy.
AJIsAwesome: I KNOW, RIIIIIGHT! The person also has one for a Creeper
Reikim|Crowbar: I could but knowing me, I'd throw away the beads by accident
Okay, so I learned something today.
Or rather
Did you write a letter to Celestia?
^
I got something knew to put on my list of THINGS I HATE IN BLACK MESA
new
Like what?
...
Which is?
Did I just do that
Anyway
Random women in black latex with glowing red eyes and dual pistols (and cloaking) are going right up there under HEADCRABS.
13not cloaking just stupid jumping
That's a thing in Half Life?
Do they cloak?
It's a thing, yes.
No cloaking though, as Shizu said.
Just annoying agility.
13meanwhile hated my black mesa stream so he would not know
Aye I did.
Luckily, a couple SMG grenades and explosive barrels solved THAT problem.
13i just one-shot with magnum
I just used magnum
13they hold still just long enough if you get them in a hallway
13or when i streamed and had like five of them in a stairwell, and they all sat on top of the one grenade i tossed
13like noobs
But out of what little I do know of Half Life black latex jumpy women with pistols don't register.
for some reason I keep seeing you all talk about women in black latex, but I get distracted and can't finish the rest of the sentence :3
DAT GIF :F
*:D
Yeah, they're there.
They are a pain in the ass.
Dat timing.

I'm sure they are.
Kandarihu: ......
i'ma charging my winamps
And I think I burned the last turkey meatball but oh well.
silly Shizuka
That's what I thought for ages in school.
That's...weird.
what?
Hehe, what anime was that from again?
Sorry, no stream, what just happened?
Something about school?
I remember there was this one anime with a girl hugging some weird pillow like that :D
ah gawd
Brb.
hes still playing music isnt he
*she
13he?
You're a dude now Shizu.
It?
flutterchu, eeyup
http://derpy.me/XLaXR
Shizuka: is this def leppard?
*head falls on desk*
o.o Shinji...
He's still badass
Not sure if I want to go to bed or get a sandwich.
What's Shizu streaming, anyway?
Music.
Meanwhile: Why not both?
Well, I have things to do anyway
Music will make them easier.
I can't eat and go to sleep.
13sure you can
Sandwich.
13IV drip
But it's possible to eat in your sleep
Oh you.
Sandwich wins here.
13yeah
I ate a raisin bagel while I was sleeping once. It was delicious
http://imgur.com/r/funny/u3AGr
i can just imagine Meanwhile IV dripping tea
Fine, sandwich get.
ASoftFluffyThing: how does that work?
>.>
http://imgur.com/r/funny/Caadc how the fuck is this news?
NocturnalBlade|Read: First, you go to sleep. Then you bring the bagel up to your mouth. You open your mouth and bite the bagel. After chewing, swallow the bagel
http://imgur.com/r/funny/uzIPW
NocturnalBlade|Read: and that's how you eat a bagel in your sleep
Bronysith, I'm thinking it's a man-bites-dog story.
but...you are asleep...so you are sleep eating?
It's iPhone, it's hilarious news.

NocturnalBlade|Read: No, I'm absorbing it through my mouth while it's closed
I mean, rather than lining up like that it's better to order it online.
*sahoofs/paw* (salutes)
WAT WHO STREAM?
ASoftFluffyThing: -_- smartass
NocturnalBlade|Read: Yep
Dark Signs Theme?
13was a hacking game years and years ago
Why no one streaming Dark Souls PC gameplay?
13dunno what ever came of it, but the two tracks it used for background were quite good
guys, i've been on the internet alot lately, so for the next hour or so, im just going to sit with my little brother, and watch some my little ponies with him. Later!
Ponies are fun.
music is boring
indeed
I LIEK PONIEZ :3
Ponies and Gravity Falls are fun!
13your face is boring
this one math problem is causing me rage.
Shizuka: well i stole yours
13well i burned yours
I have gone at it in five different ways and failed to find an answer.
your face when i have no face
13yes
13because i burned it
hence why i stole yours
i needed a new one
well I DONT CAAAAAAARE (pewdiepie)
13i see.. it all makes sense now
my face when your face has no face because Shizuka burned it
13i burned bronysith's face... so he stole mine...
hah
HA

"After how many years was the withdrawal made from the box?"
i've got spares here, cant possibly cost that much to ship
D: her Drive is dead.
her hard drive is
bble
Shizuka, is that why it's been so wrong since we last had her do an event on Sunday afternoons?
It's actually simple interest, but the withdrawal partway through makes it headache-inducing.
13jaja
Even if it was compound interest, I'd be able to solve it easy. But that withdrawal is causing me rage.
:<
Did she lose all of that music she had?
I guess that explains why I haven't really ever seen Vivi.
ughhhhhhhhhh
baaaahhh
why is this stupid "restoration" of jesus a meme?

Bronysith is chrono trigger fanboy?
Back with a sandwich.
And tea.
Bronysith, if someone comes to my door trick 'o treating in anything like these costumes you linked to, I'm giving liberal amounts of candy.
Kandarihu: yea that would be awesome
oh yeah, haloween is happening soon
Meanwhile: be a gent and give your face to shizuka
Phase4: <Bronysith> WRONG FUCKING LINK
Oh shit, Halloween. I need to save up for my costume.
...
Phase4: and yes, i do love chrono trigger though
Last year, I dressed up as Luffy. I think I'll try to do Zoro this time.
http://imgur.com/r/funny/RBsKo
My face comes with a moustache and fairly heavy eyebrows, she won't want that.
Kandarihu: 3 swords
Oh god lawl
Meanwhile: well she burned mine off so i had to take hers
The Party City close to me has costumes, I wonder if they have any MLP for adults
Three replica swords. Decorative or theatrical, NOT functional
Meanwhile: so the gent thing to do would be to give your face to her
You'll want a particularly light one if you intend to carry it in your teeth Kandarihu.
Meanwhile: most katanas are light
Why can't someone else do it? Surely there are more gentlemanly folk in chat.
Meanwhile, only the replica Wadou Ichimonji has to be light. But they all have to be equal weight
I own a katana, I'm well aware of the weight. Good luck holding that with jaw muscles.

i typically use a Korean gum
love it
Some of them are short and thick for horse cavalry.
This is the overdone remix.
light and balanced, perfect for swordplay
Bronysith: Dat pic
Some are long and light for foot solider.
As opposed to ostrich cavalry.
Bronysith, LAWL
boring
Some are thick and long to cut horses legs
Party City has MLP costumes, a Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash
this is the most Evil OP ever http://imgur.com/r/funny/gkWRy
Problem is....they don't come in adult sizes
ASoftFluffyThing, another case in which I'll give plenty of candy
Talking about sword anyone hyped for Metal Gear Revengeance?
nope
Kandarihu: I'd have to make my own....
No.
Awwwww.

SEPTEMBER AND ALREADY YOU BITCH
Sweets, horror films, smoke bombs everywhere.
its just not a thing here
no vid links please

I went trick or treating for the first time last year when I was 19
This year I'm going to cut little eyeholes in toilet rolls, put glowsticks in them and hide them in bushes.

it's still a stream
It's no vid links during any stream period

Seriously though, Halloween is wonderful.
yes
So...nothing.
Hey Meanwhile, have you ever been out late at night and just walked slowly through an intersection crosswalk and piss people who have to wait for you off?
If you can still find a neighborhood where the kids go door-to-door instead of that trunk or treat stuff
and be called normal behavior Meanwhile
It's pretty fun.
Or dress like a prostitue and get away with it....somewhat
At least I grew up in a time before that started

Hmm?
Oh you wrote things.
I'm going to just have to draw out tables on this one, aren't I...
In my neighborhood, the kids travel by car.

Mmmm I want that costume from Yandy.....but I don't have the money
i want a twilight fursuit

Shizuka looked like she had an answer but reconsidered.

Even if Tesco is jumping the already jumped gun.
ew, otanet, that is bad
the only thing to do there Rei is put it out of it's misery.
Reikim, you're suddenly leeching your neighbor's wifi?
We can put it on life support but that's only going to prolong the inevitable.
What's otanet?
otakon-internet
please stop linking
My neighbours don't HAVE WiFi that I can leech.
Scientists are still working on a cure.
Damn. otakon has EVERYTHING, doesn't he?
Meanwhile: there will be a cure for AIDS before a cure for that
ASoftFluffyThing, one of our regulars, otakon, leeches his neighbor's Wifi. And he has legendary amounts of lag.
a cure for shipping?
The charity is doing quite well.
Kandarihu: Aaaah
He also tends to get spammy and he gets spamkicked a lot
http://imgur.com/r/funny/fKo0m
Kandarihu O_o who gets spanked?
inb4 otakon gets something else named for or after him
Though most people who don't read it think it's an otter protection program.
otanet is a very serious condition and is not to be laughed at. Symptoms include: rage, excessive whining about lag, rage, shortness, rage, tendency to bushy eyebrows, rage, and rage.
STOP LINKING
otakon is best shipper as well
spam-kicked
im new, whats this?
otakon x lag.
DJ this is the internet.
otakon x lag fic won't work. It'll just lag IN the fic
otakon x everything is still bannable, isn't it?
sorry Reikim, I haven't touched any higher level math in 4+ years :(
Oooh, fluffy. Wonderful idea.
DJ, welcome to Bronystate. Be sure to read the rules.
For a while it was, then the joke sort of died.
I'll write the first chapter, wait a year, and THEN post the second.
And the rule sort of died with it.
flutterchu: stop linking what
but I did write an otakon x lag fic
The perfect meta shipfic.

Oh god, what have I done? I want a chapter by next week
This shouldn't even be that high of a level!
Kidna bites that MLP didn't get nominated
EVERYONE STOP LINKING!!!!!
Reikim, sounds like Foe-yay
I believe it is Reikim
Reikim, what you need?
i read the rules
I was told that I could solve it by tinkering with kinematic equations but LIES.
And FimFiction has already stated their stand against metafics too
so what do i do?
flutterchu, quit your fucking bitching and attention-whoring
It's this math problem.
by happy coincidence i am also doing physics at this moment in time
Lovely, because I got this in a physics course.

This is such a beautiful song
i can scroll up :P
It's from Darwinia
Oh okay then
DJ: What do you do? You watch, you listen, you talk. That about sum it up?
I was going to rephrase it better but okay.
metafic is an inside-joke, usually containing something from various sites. Example: Someone talking about Equestria Daily
should we tell dj of the "rule?"
Aaah.
13The Rule
13capital T, capital R
It's kind of a big deal.
first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club
all i see is this screen that says mips tv, is this normal?
waitaminute, fresh meat? VICTORY SCREECH
DJ: Try the blue refresh button.
...What is The Rule?
The line tends to get blurred, because something like "Twilight writing a fanfic for the site" has squeeked by
http://imgur.com/r/funny/skKwm
Reikim: I have no idea.
The Rule? That sounds more official than the official rules
I mean The Penguins of Madagasca gets nominated and MLP doesn't?
You broke the number one rule, don't squeal.
J_E_Smith71: who gives a fuck?
J_E_Smith71: MLP won the last nomination for the Tobey
What the hell is Kite Flubbs?????
DAMNIT MATH
The second rule of blight smub is you DO NOT TALK ABOUT Dwight bub.
If all else fails, I will probably be reduced to tables, but I'm too lazy for that - paradoxically, that means I'm actually doing more work trying to find the mathematical solution.
now i see integrals everywhere

Reikim, if the box is emptied to half mid way, then it takes 10 years to fill and another 10 to refill
NewGuy is not a new guy?
soo...what, are you...listening
...Not the way I calculated it.
13vice president chick daney
I'm sort of listening. I had to see Guild Wars 2 released trailers. Bad they are.
box B with filled with X gains 12% every year, at year Y box is full, but at Y/2 box is emptied to 50%. Find Z
12% of 50% is 6%.
i came here once but left because i was lagging
wait
hello
12% of its contents when it was closed.
then hes an old guy
hi NewGuy
yeah, nvm, its removed to half
heya CCCP
hi CCCP
woot CCCP. Just in time to see me leave.
Hi CCCP
Reikim, oh, so same curve the entire time
hi thelonepony and flutter_spin (bye)

Why're you trying to figure this out anyway?

its not..that sleepy music
I had tea and a sandwich like fifteen minutes ago.
Reikim, its the integral of initial + * (initial * 0.12)

Consider earlier comment about not having formal calc training.
I missed lunch.
Meanwhile geez its late there.
i feel sick :(
whoops, its (x * initial * 0.12)
close enough
how do you feel CCCP
CCCP: THen go to bed
>missed lunch
CCCP, why?:(
>eating at 2am
I've got that
It might be because i went outside today, i think ive done nothing for so long doing sonthing makes me feel bad
What's wrong CCCP?
I think you missed 2 meals there, Meanwhile :P
But then it gets changed.
Oh I had dinner.
I might be going up to Wyoming sometime soon - if I decide to go, I'll have to stay there for at least 60 days
Obsidian but i cant sleep
I also do not know anything about integrals.
COOL MUSIC
Reikim, just do the compound interest
...But it's not compound interest.
then take the difference at the end from full
and find where the curve equals twice that value
bam
Why couldn't you just leave the answer at "magic"
...
CCCP: why do you feel bad?
Reikim, the trick is the delta never changes
im trying to sleep while im listening to this...
Except it does.
no it doesnt
6_9
When the box is opened, the amount int he box changes.
its 12% from then the box was closed
i would listen to the music but im too lazy
what?
Then, when it is closed again, the delta changes based on how much was in the box after the removal.
WHAT?!
>Too lazy to do something that requires literally no effort.
WHAT THE FUCK!?
Sounds legit.
ok.... then what i said initialy is correct, it must be 10 years
what Bronysith? >_><_<
it has to fill, half empty, then fill
I'd get some hardcore overtime - 10-12 hour days, ski on weekends when it starts to snow, and the lodge the company has set up is awesome - 5 hot tubs, indoor & outdoor pools, free breakfast, 2 blocks from the jobsite, large rooms -sounds great....
NewGuy: just some one being incredibly stupid
So it's 12% of a certain percentage of the box's maximum volume.
NewGuy: and attention whoring
I'd type in chat, but I'm too lazy to use the keyboard
-_- wat
But it only takes 8.333... years to fill.
Misery <3 http://derpy.me/aab34 <3
CCCP: what you are doing requires more effort than listening to music
I need to find out when to halve its current volume so that it eventually takes 20 years to fill.
but I don't want to go at least not until after Oni-Con
NewGuy: [21:03:57] <CCCP> i would listen to the music but im too lazy
o i c
half the current value, that makes a lot more sense
Now, if it had a rate of increase of 10% of its contents at time of closing...then it would make a lot more sense.
yeah, my brain is insane derp
Nice numbers. Unfortunately I don't have them.

Reikim, t = i / (i * 0.12)
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a pyro maid corset and pulls the strings
Nitt, where'd the colours go?
Nittany_Discord: We have been waiting for you all day to play Mann Up Mode ;_;
now i'm still thinking this through
Nittany_Discord: so were you here yesterday from the whole princess invasion?
WHO WANTED PITSA
no...no, no GOD NO DONT MAKE ME CHOOSE http://imgur.com/r/funny/0qzr5
I've been busy Ponies47.
Nutella. Because bacon is incredibly overrated.
no, thats not right
Nittany_Discord: Ah. I understand. But now we gotta wait on YOU
That would give time to double its current contents, I think.
i like bacon
*TOY
t = a / (i * 0.12)
superretroworld: Yeah. Wasn't it when Val showed G3 and I said that "Rainbow Dash said that everyone's a princess?"
Nittany_Discord, did you see Meanwhile's school photo? http://imgur.com/0C2rJ
What does Nutella taste like?
Reikim, yeah
I LIKE TRAINZ
What is a?
t is time, a is desired fill, i is initial
lol kirz|art.
Bronysith: tough choice bro
13this vis is so perfect for this track

Okay, that makes sense.
Damnit kirz.
I think I already got some variation on that.
heheheheheheheheheheheheheh
hi Ponies47
Nittany_Discord: not sure
so what you want is the sum of two of those
Now how do I deal with the change in delta?
music....
It was one of the G3 ponies.
/me Hugs CCCP "Hi you! How ahve you been?"
The thing is, half of its contents at a certain time are removed.
t = (a / (i * 0.12)) + (100 / (a * 0.06))
lol

thats your solution

Where a is desired fill?

a is the level at which you empty
I see.
Nittany_Discord: We want Toy to play with us. :/
and 0.06 is half 0.12 because easier than a/2 to write

did it work?
I think I'm solving this wrong.
Well, maybe not all, but in the general swing of things.
So I stuck in 20 for t
Then I started simplifying.
Meanwhile: then im guessing the cider episode is banned in the uk
Ended up in a quadratic, which was probably the wrong way to go about this.
Chat derped

/me Slaps LightIRC
Quadratic had no solution, so I'm guessing yes.
Hey everyone here should read the fan fic "Root Her" Its not an MLP fic but its really horrible
I don't know, I watch all the episodes via the internet. Couldn't tell you if it's been on here.
who has read or heard of the story...the first blush?
NewGuy whats it about?
The equation LOOKS right to me, when I think about it, but when I actually try to solve I fuck up.
gregson kermin will not be escaping solar orbit

I remember seeing this yesterday :)
Shizu: Try and make it something without either the Pyro or NGE.
I like this PMV
:P
I like it alot
Me too

00,10vegas is hotter Caramel
i need to grant you permissons if you want them
13try and make yourself something interesting without either bitching about everything or hating everything
name?
13k?
Poked a nerve there apparently.
XD
:say I now have power over you
I now have power over you
13because seriously, it's getting old
crazy twi lol
she scares me . . .
As is the pyro, if you're going to play it like that.
00,10awww did i miss drama when teasing Caramel
00,10why you make me miss drama
and suddenly Shizuka is going to murder Meanwhi1e
theres no ponifed version of misery :'(
Nope, drama's still in chat.
Bronysith I do NOT want to miss that!
KABOOOOOOOOOM
CCCP: SHUT UP, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SHUT UP
I dont' even
btw, i've gone over the edge, as i'm getting a Fluttershy plush soon
FlutterMEDIC: Good for you
yeah
Sounds legit.
FlutterMEDIC: Yay
stop being mean to CCCP:[
FlutterMEDIC: i have someone who can make homemade plushies
things are damn expensive
sooo what did i miss in 5 days ?

no one is meant to be alone...SO TRUE
hi Scoot-Scootaloo. Yes. Yes I am'
i saw space jam in normal tv actually the same friday
FlutterMEDIC: Hopefully that means that alot of effort was put in to make it
hey Scoot-Scootaloo
Hi Scoot-Scootaloo

Dat face again
The chin that killed a hundred men.
That face....
00,10her chin looks like a cow catcher

Caramel: Should have saved that face for DA 2
One of the last great games of Bioware
Oh! Cool.
Dear god, THAT FACE
cool
Technically you wouldn't.
pony...
13one of these days i'll get my hands on the giant sound effects library everyone uses... cause the wind on the bridge is the same as like five other games i can think of...
00,10dat Caramel OC
But there's no autojoin delay on this channel.
At least not since I last looked anyway.
> Caramel OC
Shizuka, yeah, i've allways wondered where they get those
cheapest Fluttershy plush i've found is around 44 bucks, with shipping and handling!
Caramel is alreayd a background pony

is it lagging for anyone else?
13well ja
Awwwww

NewGuy btw whos being mean to me?
13left 4 dead 2 used a bunch of effects i heard in uru
13should pull those out next stream
CCCP...i dont know, i just saw some one said STFU to you
Anyway, SKYPE GET
I feel horrible for breaking down like this but hey
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Two New Crystal Empire Toy Sets Popping Up

NO
thats a big dog
NewGuy :I
don't kill the doggy
KILL IT
What's wrong with Skype?
Gotta put Lassie down
NOOO
KILL THE DOG
DON'T KILL
NOOOOO
MURDER
MURDER IS GOOD
Muzzle it
NOOOO
00,10that's a dog?
oh, a dog?
kill it
I was just being stubborn about it for a while for the sake of being stubborn.
o.o
NOOO
kill it and then cook it for a mighty feast
it looks like a turkey
Why is chat so violent?
NOOOOO
Woof.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
MURDER THE DOG
I think you might get it later if you muzzle it.
Not sure, though
Yeah kill it.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
00,10if you look at it long enough it will wish it was dead
gud
That was close
Today I decided to get it.
gnight you crazy fuckers
whew
Night Bronysith

Night Bronysith
At least, I assume that Phase's link earlier was a nudge to get it, but I'm not entirely sure realy.
*really
night Bronysith
00,10is she covered in flees?
The mabari can find hidden items in landmarks later on so it's better to keep him
Sumica: Rock armour. Personally I think it's dandruff.
00,10what's all the things falling from her
Goodnight Bronysith
BRB shower
magical dandruff
Magic!~
*snort snort*
Sumica: Fashion and magic don't go together in Denerim
Rocky skin flakes
Maybe she is perpetually decaying
So that's done.
Are those...fleas
Great, you can join regulars skype chat.
Yippee
...How do I do that?
What's your name?
00,10Sounds like a theme beckfast ceriel Obsidian
Should be Reikim22
i was trying to download skype but the site was broken
its 3 am here O_O
BerryPunch fetches the page to get the title so i was bouncing the link off her to see if its online in th eus
NewGuy: i kno dat feel
the us'
Rocky Skin Flakes, chocolate flakes with a delightful wheaty crunch.
It's online, trust me.
Sumica: They are rich full of minerals :)
it wasnt here for a moment
So I should add people to Skype now and expand my Internet social network.
http://www.skype.com/ and BerryPunch was failing to title
Obsidian: and full of skin flakes
might be the utf bug
utf?
Berry Punch needs more cider.
Sumica: But can it see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch?
FlutterMEDIC: Seeing as whats already in cereal knowadays thats a plus
some site incorrectly report what encoding they use
Contact get from Mr. Moustache.
browsers are built to handle it because if the site doesnt work people blame the browsers
not the incompitent webmasters
even the cereal when it was invented by Kellog was better than the stuff today
BerryPunch isnt
A great achievement, for one so hideous.

again...pony
dammit
00,10I prefer, powdered toast man my self ASoftFluffyThing
introducing pony o's, there ponylicious
Aaaah
Sumica: god i miss Ren & Stimpy
That pretty face?!
Pretty face?
IT comes along with Profion
Oh he wasn't talking to her.
i'm back btw
That explains it.
wtf
wb Dark92Enigma
00,10he thought you would be less train wreck
now i need my ssh keys, i keep them on dropbox encrypted but i have to wait for dropbox to sync

i should sleep but im too addicted :(
He thought you'd be less cow carcass.

undead ponies
thats scary
lets see how many puns we can make out of the Character's face
cuz im ugly
00,10and what is that thing hanging from your face
OH...oh...that's your nose.
We're watching Dragon Age: Orichins
Hahaha
need moar face puns
THAT'S a nose?
Engineer: "Ugleh."
ew
Her father was a plane.
I thought it was a chin
00,10I kid you not her face looks like the front end of a old steam train
an
Be absolutely sure to buy the backpacks.
Sumica: Dayum, that's ugly
Sumica: steam probably comes out of the ears then
http://farm1.static.flickr.com/41/87570533_4677acc849.jpg You know it kinda does.
13speaking of... cygwin somehow broke its own sshd here...
Sumica: Luckily these guys dont know what that is yet so the insult is avoided
So yey, Skype get.
/me Profion: it helps you with asthma attacks.......side effects include: Overacting, Voice-gasm and inablility to pick good movies YATATATATATATA
Sumica: the nose is a cowcatcher!
cygwin?
13unix utilities on windows
00,10nah the chin is
Yeah skype chat will be more lively when people aren't asleep.
Lovely, my penchant for getting lost seems to be gradually extending into conversation...
By the way, you have something on your l----
That chin wouldn't catch cows it'd obliterate them.
yawn
inb4 face puns
Meanwhile: it's a drill?
At least you're not in the wrong desert.
wait, theyve already started
y u no accept my private key mingw
ANd the noses would inpale them
DRUGZ
Nose*
Private key what?
gah
00,10I was thinking more like this http://tinyurl.com/dy2kmkn
EEEWWWWWW
Shizuka, i tend to prefer mingw over cygwin, little faster
dem lips are HUGE
Stop making us look at it.
2,14 still waiting on those meme images :P
I'm sure there's an innuendo to be made there.
13anyway for some reason my cygwin sshd suddenly stopped accepting logins with keys
Oh God Sumica :D
oh gawd its looking at us
You got something on your....L-----
GEEZ
Yeah well keep waiting, I refuse to open that in any of my windows agian.
dat is a huge nose
again*
EW NO
13i can still connect out from cygwin to haruko, and laptop to haruko works fine, but neither can ssh into my desktop anymore even though their keys are authorized
o_O
Meanwhile, public key crypto, you can encrypt with one key and decrypt with the other, the public key is derived from the private key but you cant derive the private key from the public key
its Shovelchin!
How little I know about computers.
00,10you know the hood just adds to the train face look
good its over
How little I know.
Gotta go, i got curfew at 10th o' clock............BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR LIP!
13used to be able to.. even mounted the cygdrive on my laptop a couple times because that's awesome (ly slow over ssh)
Yeah for a moment I had a horrible thought that you spelt mingw wrong.
public key crypto > passwords
00,10is he.....

Caramel, before you do anything else, PLEASE check to make sure you have that key from the prisoner.
Oh crud. Two autosaves
back to face puns: his face looks like it was pressed by a paper press
is every one british...
in the game
In other news
He hates mages :<
I swear, I messed up on that part too many times to be able to bear the sight of this.
Damn shatterproof glass.
Reikim|Crowbar i have good anti spam but i still check my spam bin in case something got mix

Why does Black Mesa place safety features ONLY in places where it will impede my progress?

2,14 Kandarihu: ENOUGH! I have played this game more than you think. Stop harassing me over simple unimportant game choices and just enjoy the damn stream
Reikim cause fate hates you
Because the lab was designed by someone who had his brain replaced with a haddock?
Caramel, okay. Sorry
pick 4
I'd say 2
I'd pick 3

inb4 they fall in love
thats a woman!?!?!?
wtf...
I wonder what their kids would look like
FlutterMEDIC, yes
sir
13Reikim|Crowbar: hey at least there's plenty of shatterable glass too
he called her a man
dats one ugleh woman
13unlike the original where everything was bulletproof
Er, TWOILOIGHT is a woman, not Alistair
Sigh... its offical... the internet is full of retarded people
Duncan Donuts.
maybe hes a heshe
People are bitching about the new sounds Minecraft is getting
13SpadeMagnes[R]: that was official ages ago when there were only two people on it
damn this is weird, since my name is Duncan
MAGEHUNTER = HATER
Shizu kids now get it easy with non bulletproof glass everywhere
Also one comment was bitching about the new gravel block texture...its just...why...
Back in your day you had solid glass and you were happy?
13re minecraft? yeah the new gravel is a bit out of place as a common material
I wonder if everything was bulletproof because they couldn't code and model breaking glass in the 90's.
^
^^
13it doesn't tile as well anymore, the old texture may not have looked much like gravel but it was moreso than the new one anyway
13course that's why you get a texture pack :3
I remember getting excited when a game had properly-modeled glass.
irrc there is a window to a flodded room with broken glass and you can brake the rest
Or overlook it.
13in office complex ja
Its a fucking block, I dont see the big deal
Because the texture of gravel really isn't that big a dealbreaker.
13as i recall it breaks into a few pieces which get out of the physics domain quickly
considering that gravel is useless in the first place
I can never seem to find a texture pack I like using for regular gameplay. Vanilla or bust for me
Unless you're massively ocd about things looking right, in which case you're probably petrified of Minecraft.
minecraft talk
And besides... how ogten are you going to fucking use gravel blocks?
*often
13further back to something like doom and it doesn't animate at all, just swaps textures and properties
Black Mesa was still designed by complete incompetents.
oh damn
The facility, of course.

this doesnt suport ecdsa
?
ah
random talky intended for different channe;

Does it at least look nice
oh damn, the mingw copy of ssh doesnt suport ecdsa
?
o/////o
SpadeMagnes[R] you have to dig it often, and it can be useful for putting out fires and setting traps because it obeys gravity
was that a coherent thought?
13hash dat file oh yeah~

00,10infact I think that's how she got that face
dammit
Reikim|Crowbar, quantum computers arent a 'more powerfull computer', its a fundamentally different method of computing
just dont face one
I know I'm just teasing.
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDl
Sumica, you mean it?
I've had most of the spiel thrown at me more than once.
Hopefully, teleportation will involve just shifting waveforms about instead of trying to copy the state of one object and destroying the other.
Sumica: a truck...in a land without gas...dafuq
ah, well in that case you'll be waiting a while
00,10wizard did it
the record is like 128 qbits, which makes a wristwatch look like a supercomputer
YOU'RE A WIZARD NOW, CHEVY
we're back to the days of room filling computers
I leave the chat for 30 seconds. Come back to a conversation about faces, trucks, and wizards
Hey, if we could go from there to here, then we can go from here to there
Or...
Okay, what I'm trying to say is
Carries the scar that looks like a timing belt on his forehead....
why why why
SOMEHOW we'll find a way to make it work.
so Reikim|Crowbar, what you're saying, is that we can go there...
and back again?
YES!
so what is this game?
kirz understands.
ONWARD
What's the advantage of quantum state computers then? Just less power consumption?
OVER THERE
dragon age
i think
to the Lonely Mountain!
Nittany_Discord, theres some math they can do that conventional computers cant
I should look into going into quantum computing.
hm, heard of it, imagined it a bit different from this..
I can bamboozle people with technobabble on two fronts!
Nittany_Discord, for one they can factor integers, which breaks rsa
a feat that todays supercomputers would take many centurys to complete
its like world of wrcraft O_O
So digital security is in for one hell of an upheaval in the next couple decades.
assuming reasonably key size anyway, if it was like 2 bits you could break it with a calculator
Reikim|Crowbar, eyup
Sounds like fun times ahead.
most of the worlds crypto is built around rsa
wow all miss
Because RSA takes too long to break at the moment.
so one scammer with a quantum computer would wreak havock on the internets
To find the keys of an RSA encryption takes forever IIRC.
Via guessing.
i think the best case computation is 2^(key size/4)
for ecdsa its 2^(key size/2)
00,10so when dose she get her thoom?
woah, i just saw a pic for a s3 villain, it is epiiiiic
See, this is why I should go into computers.
Is that encrpytion/decryption speed?
twilight_sprinkle: give link
2,14 not in this chat
i know
Nittany_Discord, number of loops, speed depends on the actual machine
Although honestly if I hang around here long enough I'll probably absorb enough anyway.
2,14 no s3 spoilers
i know
for a 4096 bit key you'd in theory need 2^1024 computations to break it
which is big number
hence the security
hi everyone
so Shizuka did you play Torchlight II already ?
hai Athiest
13eeyup
when does season 3 come out
hi Athiest
13is awsm
Heya Athiest
hi
Athiest: theyll announce they date in about 27 days
i'll be playing soon then
when did it come out last year?
Brb, going to Dunkin Donughts for some coffee and muffins :3
what game is this?
mhhh muffins
Trix
What happened to GW2?
RDash5000, i think itsdragon age
cause im really impatient for the 3rd season
probably the $40 price difference
blood everywhere
:)
ew
i recomend cleaning that off, its gona start stinking real soon
Reikim|Crowbar what happend is that i just came back 2 hours ago from a 5 days vacation soo must buy in a 2 days probably
Okay then
also i was not succesful i finding a retail copy
in*
i like how we can't link anything sexual in the chat, but the moment i got in here an asian porn advert popped up
00,10Athiest, it was already out by this time last year
How?
so digital it's
Last I checked, GameStop and EBGames were packing them all over the place.
2,14 RDash5000: 1- We don't control the adds
DERP
that just makes me more impateint
00,10we dont controll the advertisments RDash5000
well i gtg...bye guyz
2,14 2-the ads are based on your browser history
Reikim|Crowbar living in mexico cuts a lot of those options
Reikim|Crowbar, that equation i showed you to solve your problem?
00,10so I recomend you get Adblock+
RDash5000: i think the ads depend on your brose-
2,14 so thanks for sharing that with us
bye NewGuy
need to turn into simultanious linear
It was wrong, wasn't it?
lol
I thought as much.
right equation, wrong form
00,10wait it dose?!
Considering I wasn't able to solve it...yeah.
twilight_sprinkle: that's not it, cuz i don't look that stuff up :/
RDash5000: suuuure =p
some people say that pateince is a virtue i say to them, why the hell would sitting around doing nothing be a virutue
still, plug it into wolfram and it will solve and show working
bye NewGuy
Athiest: spoken like a true man
Does someone in your house use your computer RDash5000 ?

EQD made a poll to name an OC pony that represent an Airline?
Reikim|Crowbar, http://www.wolframalpha.com arguably cheating but its a good learning tool
CrimsonPhoenix: the most popular so far is Jet Stream
hey awesome bronies
hi shuddup
funny story, my mother thought (before I moved out) that I was the one getting viruses of such questionable nature on her home computer, now that I'm gone, she sees its my dad, awkward
hi shuddup
hey shuddup
Loading...loading...
CrimsonPhoenix: i think the airliner asked for it
soooo whats the game?
ok...
shuddup: Dragon Age
I don't really see the point of this,
dat sprinkle
ohh allrighty and who is the streamer?
shuddup: caramel
shuddup: Caramel
ohhh okay
I do agree Jet Stream sounds very good though
huh, it cant solve either
pony
but still....what's the point..
pony...
who?
CrimsonPhoenix: the airline probably wants publicity
00,10good thing I checked context on that FlutterMEDIC
not sure whats going on here
ah now I know what that was
Sumica: vat?
what happend
twilight_sprinkle...thank you, how come I didn't think of that
cattering to bronies
smart move
00,10for a moment I thought you were telling a mod to shuttup.
I know, right?
CrimsonPhoenix: everyone is going to be doing it now
The entire question is screwball.
Sumica: it looked like it
:D
of course
it gives me a complex answer
not sure why
use my name sumia XD if you want someone to shuddup
lol
most Bronies are generally quite blind, they would follow anything with ponies in it
I am almsot certain that in order to solve it elegantly I will need calculus.
Otherwise, it's back to the bloody tables.
I honesty don't have anything to say for or against that.
Reikim|Crowbar, someone else is searching for the same thing, it sugested '20-(a/(50 0.12)+100/((a 0.12)/2)) = 0'
And I hate tables.
ownage
eh, bronies arent that blind tbh, a lot of them seem to try to maintain objectiveness
I did the same thing only backwards - swapped 20 over to the right side.
I'd imagine most bronies would just be like "oh, they plugged ponies. cool" but then what do I know
2,14 twilight_sprinkle: I miss having that same innocent ignorance
its a hyperbola
and never equals zero
conversation of blind bronies...
what is this nonsence
00,10dont make me link the eqd post again
So I guess you didn't believe me when I told you that earlier.
which one?
what EQD post

Of to bed for me.
hi Rommulus

It should be solvable at some point. There's no reason for it to not be so.
What are we watching?
...Unless.

yay azurites streaming again
00,10not realy twilight_sprinkle, the retracted the post like almost imeadatly when they relised they fubared
i meant Hi Tiberium :P
YOU'RE A POOPY FACE :[
You'll get better.
or your prof is a dick
his face is fine guys
Which is true, but he's a fair dick.
Am I the only one getting annoyed of the Cadence toy commercial on TV lately?
what game is this?
g'night Nitt-
dragon age
aww, dammit
ohh, keep it dark
Oh right, Morrigan, aka best pony. :|
oni_link i have
i'ma go thing about this while having an overdue shower
00,10have not seen the toy ad yet
brb gotta restart
soooo standar or deluxe ?
im back hate when ma mom takes the computer
For what? GW2?
I don't get Hub up here
Sumica: exactly, they removed it immediately, posting it doesnt change anything, i mean why would they figure it out immediately after posting. i think they were just trolling, or someone got ahold of a admins acc
oni_link, ive seen that cadance and shining armor wedding set...
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, getting digital copy?
wb scout19_tf2
shuddup: good to know i aint alone :P
:P
get standard, you can trade in game gold for gems later on for the digital deluxe version
anybody noticed how different the pony toys are compared to the g4 ponies, i know the g1 started first but cant they try to make it look like the new show?
00,10posable twilight_sprinkle, but morelikly they fell for troll post
cool
i feel that pain scout19_tf2
Canadian_Brony, I dont get Hub in the land down under
Sumica: Im not annoyed at the commercial itself, more like im annoyed of how frequently its played
dat chin
takes 2k gems, and they've been trading 1g>300gems on average
it suks
haha
GINGER POWDER
Sumica: tbh i think it was more likely it was a troll. cuz if they posted it, then it was up for at least 20 mins then taken down, i would think someone told them it was fake. i dont see how posting it would suddenly give them an epiphany
so you won't be able to get it until late game, but it'll be there
dat laugh...
Tiberium I just watch the series on Youtube anyway
nahahaha
what was the post even about?
Hai everypony! And dat Dragon Age o3o
2,14 twilight_sprinkle...that's not how it works
his face is funny XD
hi Biglaw
2,14 they post something, the comments expose how retarded it is, then they retract
Canadian_Brony, indeed. its the only way.
2,14 that example was hardly an isolated case
or Bronystate of course
ah thanks for that Caramel
lol his c drive is trying to back itself up :P
Caramel: there were no comments about it, it was taken down immediately. like i said, if it were up for at least 20 minutes, then i would think so
Good to know I won't really have to pay for anything.
and thus continues the cycle of life
2,14 taken down immediately?
2,14 are you kidding?
2,14 it was up for plenty of time
Caramel: in the 30 seconds it was up all i saw was comments like "omaigashomaigashomaigahs"
00,10it was up for around 5 min
wtf short laugh 6_9
what post was it?
is caramel streaming?
eeyup
figured, with caramel in the bottom left corner
wait, is this the post saying S3`s release date will be revealed in days, or am I thinking of something else
*30 days
come watch it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8h_wEWSvA&feature=g-u-lsb
00,10this post http://screensnapr.com/v/T3ALwj.jpg
even so, i still cant imagine them not understanding the credibility of such a post. and if they trusted that post, why would they trust random comments any more. plus i mostly remember seeing comments like "i cant wait"
oh
2,14 oh I'm going to enjoy this
aw man cereal :c
2,14 twilight_sprinkle:
web keeps crashing will try later
2,14 this is the site that has believed a poster on 4chan was a worker on the show
2,14 and posted an "interview" with them
2,14 but nice try though
OH THOSE actuall ponies being late to air season 3
yeah, mfw that didn`t explode into a bonfire of excietement on Bronystate
or any other brony site on that note
im not aware of that story. but still, it seems more plausible it was a joke. id always prefer to give benefit of the doubt over calling someone stupid
such innocence
i hear an arguement...
are you daft?
2,14 more plausible because you haven't had to deal with it for more than a year
meee
fine, seth sucks dragonballs, are you happy chat?
2,14 but this is the ignorance we're talking about
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Trailers and Intros: Hastily Made Ponyville Tourism Video / MLP:FIM / My Little Mythbusters
2,14 bronies "choose" to believe in what is easier to believe
im actually glad there releasing it later because there are only 13 eps
00,10my thoughts went from sweet when dari bot posted. To wait that date is far too clsoe for there to have been no advertisments on hub. to wait that's a VV not W
Sir Dragonjerker's Site of Pony Debauchary has some of the worse verification skills ever
wth
00,10finaly ending in oh look the thread has been removed
i hear a big arguement
wut game is dis
dragon age
13oo is it the two minutes EQD hate?
13i wanna play i wanna play
play wut
Caramel: i have my views on life, they are not dependant on being a brony. id always consider someone joking other than considering him dumb. the less scenarios you can think of, the more clear something seems. someone may look like an idiot, but maybe he actually is feeling terrible or something, or maybe hes joking
go ahead Shizuka
hell, if i were to pose as a HUB official and say that there'd be a season four and bullshit well enough, they'd probably post it
ARGUEMENT INBOUND
o____________________o
ok ill shuddup
i mean even I know you cant trust a random post on twitter
2,14 twilight_sprinkle: you're taking this way too personally. This started about how the community en masse thinks in counter intuitive ways
shit just got real
whos this guy again?
HOLY SHIT THISIS AN ARGUEMENT OF EQD
i just think its something so obvious, it makes more sense he was joking, even if he made similar screwups in the past, altho i wasnt around for that
I left for 30 seconds
already lost
ill shuddup sry

Hm? What's going on this time? :S

hey AJIsAwesome
SHUDDUP ME
Night kirz
we`ve become self-aware!
it would make more sense
Hi, superretroworld.
but he wasn't joking
anyone remember the hd laptop thing
00,10Sorry I work with tourist I tend to lean tords people in large numbers are stupid
your arguement is invalid
Back
just seems more plausible to me that he was joking, even if the opposite is obviously possible
"My Little MythBusters" LOL
IKRÉ
damn keyboard
stuck on bilingual
"My way is the correct way! Obviously whatever I beleive is the absolute truth!"
twilight_sprinkle, you just want it to be a joke cause you like EQD
haha
Keep thinking that sonny boy
so why all the hate with eqd?
DAN DAN DAAAAAAAAAAN
People ranting about EQD again? :S
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah no, not really. yeah i like the site, but that doesnt change anything. nice attempt at a personal jab though
Buytoast, sonny boy?
2,14 buytoast: this may be a "conversation" on stupidity in the fandom, that doesn't mean you should be antagonistic
ohh Dragon age
CrimsonPhoenix: id actually say the opposite
CrimsonPhoenix: this place clearly has tone of hate towards EQD
heya G.A.P.T.
Caramel Good run, Bad run or mixed ?
...okay, what'd I miss? O_o
mfw this is still going.
hmm.............
n0t much Kurra
just trying to point out what his argument is boiling down to
why hasnt my little mythbusters been made a thing yet? :)
CriticKitten: ^
2,14 Trixie: TWOILOIGHT run
but alright, alright
now lets talk about the luna game :D
dis game reminds me of skyrim
k
skyrim is a lot less linear imo
whats the luna game
hai shuddup
Buytoast: obvious troll is obvious, what can i say
scout19_tf2, although a very different game stilll.
superretroworld, OH YES AND HOW SCREAMERS ARE THE BEST WAY TO SCARE PEOPLE
Peter Reanday's back yay
im finally sighned up for the reality show
yeah, anybody who points out flaws in your logic is a troll
yea
alright
RANDOM WORD INCOMING
CrimsonPhoenix: Hm, Luna game? :S
i cant look
scout19_tf2, that's because both are in the medieval settings
man, it's like trying to talk to a parrot
vat?
SUPeRCALIFRAGALISTICEXPIALADOCIOUS
Buytoast: youre just saying im wrong, not really pointing out any flaws. like i said, obvious troll
RTS FTW
always the same response
CrimsonPhoenix: well idk bout that, i just know about the creepy applebloom picture
eeeyup dats it
lol ok Buytoast
AJIsAwesome, is a simple shitty game that pops up a creepy picture with a creepy hush now quiet now song
Buytoast but I like to point out flaws in logic . . . and I'm not a troll . . .
also you can't quit
tell that to twilight_sprinkle there
:O HE SAID DAMM
ahahaha
seen that one :)
shuddup gah, I'm trying to remember where i heard that

Gunbuster it is!

Well obviously it doesn't end here, or this would be a damn short game

Ironically I stopped playing this game after his part
So something is gonna have to go totally wrong....
Hm.
I could not get into Dragon Age

I mean.. I saw it before but I forgot
Night CrimsonPhoenix :)
AdamTheDuck: Well I mean, the game obviously can't end here, so something's gotta go wrong. The king dude dying seems like the best bet since he's somewhat likeable
I want to go to sleep, but when I close my eyes.. I see that face..
wut is this?
wuuht iez dish ^
by i hate this game by eveypony
This is How to Train a Dragon Age.
And Duncan dying too would kinda make it more of a slap in the face, so....yeah, I kinda feel like it is really that obvious. Course I could be wrong, but it would surprise me. :P
Or was it Lilo and Butt Face?

i was making a good target for any hammers
gods, her face again...I thought I would sleep peacefully tonight
flutterchu, foor?
Eulshy: i physicly insulted you expecting that your sex was male
This still Bob Page's Adventures in Genderbender Land?
you can get banned for that?
flutterchu, i dont get it?
So this battle isn't nearly evil enough. I think we need Nobunaga Oda to just pop out of nowhere and start blasting dudes with his shotgun.
Mr_Anybody: you cant
the rules say no insulting anyone
eeeeeyup obey the rules
2,14 here's a thought flutterchu
2,14 rather than trying to get yourself banned
2,14 why don't you just go away?
Caramel: i wasnt i was jus-........aiight
>implying the fact he was trying to get banned
that's like telling a puppy to not piss on the couch
what... why was flutterchu trying to get banned?
i feel like im in the middle of somthing here
Caramel: hes not trying to get banned, hes just really really weird, like i dont think anyone understands the guys logic
don't confuse logic for foolishness
I'm having trouble believing you're having this discution
i am confused
pinkie pie logic... gotta love it sometimes, gotta hate it sometimes
i just dont want him to get banned, but boy does he ask for it sometimes
so how old is this game?
what is this logic you speak of twilight_sprinkle and when does the internet use it?
and he doesnt even realize it
2,14 fyi, if this battle doesn't go exactly how I want it, I'm restarting it

i am of the firm belief that the world needs abnormal people
Caramel: well ive tried before, i guess i can try it once more
for without them, how can you judge normal people
abnormal is relative anyway
like bronystate is normal anyway :)
oh shit it's the balrog
like bronies are normal :P
what is this "normal" you speak of?
when are humans ever normal?
"what are cows?" :p
^
what is milk?
what is love
normal are what you
baby dont hurt me
is it similar to a mythical state of mind known as "sane:?
what is gaben
I'm surprised her face isn't scaring that thing of.
off*
her face is doing gradual damage
thats kinda small for a balrog
It's just a baby demon.
So, no stripping temporary partymates prior to them leaving the party?

if only it was that easy to kill a deamon :)
you know it occurs that i never answered flutterchu's question
i fear no man but that thing.... it scares me

Now I just have to wait for the inevitable death(s).
Here we go!
Is that another way of saying it?

this is why one does not simply walk into mordor.. I mean just beat a deamon with a sword :)
yyyeeaaaaaa like a boss

And with that I must go to bed.

Mmm, this warm lemonade is good.
Magic requirement and all
2,14 l2p before accusing me
I taste mainly lemon juice but damn it's good
lemonade?

Caramel: I've beaten the game several times
inb4 chat explosion
Caramel: Besides at that level your better off playing as a basic mage until you get more skills I would think
I know I said I was going to bed but I ahve to share this before I do. http://derpy.me/UGjRF

lol what happened?
Butt-Stallion: bl2?
twilight_sprinkle: You nommed Butt-Stallion
no idea
twilight_sprinkle borderlands
Mr_Anybody for real though, a nap, or resting your eyes, eye drops if you got them
just me and dari stayed here
/me hugs otakon17, "you hate this name?"
otakon17: yeah, but i didnt nom his butt, so its cool
Butt-Stallion: ah, that seemed like a cool game when on-stream

No I do not hate the name
Mr_Anybody: has sleep helped?
twilight_sprinkle: Its fun
sleep?
What is sleep?
Mr_Anybody: i actually had something similar, its basically a twitch
BTW, this is where Butt Stallion originated http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SfDiD8tUT8
directly from the game
Awwww
i don't sleep i close my eyes for 5 hours but don't sleep
otakon17: baby dont hurt me
Butt Stallion says hello
Canadian_Brony ^^
Mr_Anybody: Are you stressed?
hey
Mr_Anybody: try sleeping.also when i had an eye-twitch, i found that cold water helps
/me I spawned some cheese on a well, got some armour to sell, gotta go find maramel, and Lydia's in my way...
Mr_Anybody: obviously not on the eyes, jsut on the eyelids
probabbly
/me I trade soul gems for a fish...
stupid eyeballs
Butt-Stallion, I see.
hay
Mr_Anybody: so yeah, try to relax, get some sleep, maybe occasionally put some cold water around your eyes
/me hugs Kandarihu

I saw an "Arrow to the Knee" joke in Borderlands 2
/me our entire relationship, is based on a menial task you did for me, but amulet of mara, so marriage maybe
Mr_Anybody: might need more than a nap. also walking out during fresh air helps, especially if its not hot out
was just playing some two player snes games with my brother :)
otakon17 is it when you meet Marcus in Sanctuary and he shoots the guy trying to return the gun?
noice
*in fresh air
The line is "Damn war injury, Knee's acting up"
Whenever I hear people spamming "Call Me Maybe": http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2011/11/3/ab80bcbd-ba1b-40b0-aa76-f10f999fcac6.gif
in the knee?
Get girl mammoth tooth -> sxeteims

Hallo, AJIsAwesome :) Wie get es dir?
Just got back into my dorm. Tired as all heck and I have a math exam to study for. :D
geht*
AJIsAwesome: what math?
AJIsAwesome: when is the exam?
twilight_sprinkle: During the summer, especially right when I started coming on Bronystate in mid-August, I'd regularly go to bed on Tues, Thurs, and weekend when I didn't have work at dawn and wake up in the afternoon.
AJIsAwesome: What mind of maths?
flutterchu: what?
flutterchu: also a word of advice, dont ping half the mods without good reason like you just did
00,10making a check list of people you pissed off?
they all want me......dead
oh...sheeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiit
That was still wierd..
wonder who else got disconnected
Sumica: yeah. caramel told me to watch after him..
XD
dat sweetie :<
fitting splash pic sumi
/me shivers in fear at the looming shadow of the +b hammer
ill be leaving now (im sure later everyone wants me dead)
suddenly sweetie belle
why do they want you dead flutterchu
flutterchu: Come back though, k? :)
why would you say that flutterchu
flutterchu: just lay off the weird behavior. and the constant twi insulting
and suddenly stream
gundam style!
flutterchu: Yeah, don't hate on the ponies, especially mine :P
So you said me and shibaru got disconnected?
/me slaps pony_4322
oh dang how much have i missed?
Gundam 00!
:O
back to work!
Did somepony say coup d'état?
Azadistan? Dat blatant reference to existing countries....oh right, this IS Earth.
Sumica: will you be finishing gits today?
doctor_whooves127: It's official: I've seen all of the new series Doctor Who episodes now, including the Children in Need specials, but not the River Song mini-episodes
thats cool
War: Gundam style
Y'know, the 2005-2012 series, not like series 7 (curses British)
weird
00,10I think that might be too many eps to finish but we will see
I guess when shibaru comes back she will find out what happened
Guten Tag, Canadian_Brony :)
Sumica: id actually prefer if you didnt, personally, i cant stay up that late tonight..
00,10I try to only stick to two eps per show
tSparx why did you ping me? I'm ghosting atm, and this is one of my alieases
ok
But it never looked like it disconnected me. I was in the chat the whole time :P
hope i dont iss much from not seeing those 2 eps tonight
*aliases
*miss
http://derpy.me/tOWO9 poor dog
lol^\
00,10leaving so soon twilight_sprinkle?
00,10cause yeah you would miss alot it's the end of the launing man arc
-->|	Canadian_Brony (crjwdllhqa@u5315578803882h7n.ca.shawcable.net) has joined #BronyState
00,10er laughing
Sumica: yeah, i gotta try and get at least some sleep tonight, i have a physics quiz at 8 am, and its already 12:30 am
00,10ouch
yeah. i hate morning physics class, but every year i get them
Oh,what're we watching?
tSparx gundam 00
Ah! I wish I could stay!
My classes are from 8AM to 12PM, so I have to get up prety early. :D
My fav is Wing, but 00 is probably my second fave
Gundam double aught
Sounds like Light
But I am off, night!
OK. That dog-- cosplay taken TOO FAR.
tSparx I've been in the chat for a few hours and haven't refreshed. Mind you, I was in other tabs to do homework, so anything could've happened. Either way, I can't get in as Canadian_Brony.
AJIsAwesome: i have a dumb schedule, first class 8 am, then 2 hour break, then a class, then another 2 hour break
twilight_sprinkle: At least you get a break. :D
be back later everyone
AJIsAwesome: yeah but i dont live on campus so i have to go home every time
Oh.
seeya oni-
That sucks. :S
gah
You wouldive seen a disconnection message after a little while
AJIsAwesome: i guess, but it still beats living in a dorm with morons like last terms <.<
AJIsAwesome: they set the AC to...wait for it....40 degrees farenheit
twilight_sprinkle: Wut? :D
AJIsAwesome: yeah, i kept waking up in siberia. and the guy who was doing it told me he wasnt
I like this show what is it
trollhunter: gundam 00
twilight_sprinkle I was about to say that plan is alot better than staying on-campus. Up north, living on-campus in either college or university is completely optional for all years
twilight_sprinkle which is great because I could never live on a college campus. I value personal space too much
gundam.........really
00,10yeah this is gundam
Lunar_Brony: its mandatory first year to live on campus in most universities tho. but yeah it sucks to live in a dorm, especially when your roommates are lazy pricks who yell all night while playing HoN or LoL
Lunar_Brony: and one of them kept taking my food
if you're gonna assassinate someone dont fuckin say anything just do it
like gundam style :S
azadastan, the country that stole all of kyrgzystans vowels :p
/me slaps trollhunter "No. No gangnam."
00,10it's just south of madeupisstan
^
"selfdestruct, oh wait, no, NO!!!"
oppan gundam style? :p
Ryunosuke: :|
Sumica: which is weast of watisstan
is that the same voice actor that did light in death note?
Lunar_Brony: dont think its that bad for everyone tho, just think i was unlucky, as always..
00,10good thing lady_canary is't around
00,10she would be rageing so hard
twilight_sprinkle yeah, I guess it all depends on who you get stuck with.
"where is your god now" came from this anime?
and also that twilight_sprinkle that slap was unnecessary
trollhunter: it is. no gangnam :|
00,10that ninja's a gundam
cause of the dub VAs? Sumica
boom headshot
00,10no she hates the charicter
/me yay
maybe just a little gangnam:(
ah ok
what anime is it now?
gundum?
gundam
gundam 00
trollhunter: :| Trixie doesnt approve
?
oh fine:|
trollhunter: eh, gangnam if you want, in the long run thatll actually probably be better..
Is anyone here having problems getting on the Ponycraft Minecraft server? I haven't been able to connect since noon.
overprotective much?
Ryunosuke: her mom has been hitting on him :D
ah :p
they like to say gundam in this show
its just in case you forgot what anime youre watching
dumbasses
dont they know he could you know... step on them? :p

Time for bread? What kind? Rye? I love rye bread! Or French bread, or Hallah, or Italian loaves! But not whole wheat so much,. It tastes heavy.
gits is probably my second favorite anime at this point
wow I havent been here in a while... dont have a laptop yet and I need a poll/vote
is this a new intro?
cuz I like
Lunar_Brony: same
same intro i mean
oh
k thx
the thing that's so beautiful about this anime, is that it's both entertaining as FLUFF, and educational, as it makes us consider seriously many socio-technologic issues that humanity has yet to face (and some that we're juggling now) :)
FLUFF?
i think anime is FLUFFY :3
uh, it's REALLY entertaining :D
How?
00,10the world is intersting too
it tells great stories, is a great crime drama, isn't all stuck up in itself....
Hmm. Seems interesting.
the world confuses me so
00,10wait till you see the intro to second gig Lunar_Brony
can't sleep, come join with ponies!
Wait, is FLUFF an acronym?
GITS is talking 4 years ago, about cybernetics issues that we will face 15 years from now. It's educating anyone who will watch, much more than any government official in any capacity will ever understand about emerging cybernetics issues.
Dken2021: i know that feeling bro
Also, welcome back DaringDerpy! :)
hm?
thx :)
FLUFF is just the word fluff in all caps, guys...
wb Dken2021
Whops
Sumica and you will be streaming that when approximately? -_^
:$
:(
I meant Dken2021 :$
:(
/me hugs DaringDerpy <3
yay
:P
00,102-3 days from now
k thx
00,10depending on if I can
/me also hugs DaringDerpy
/me runs away
Tuesday-Wednesday-ish
got it
Strange. Searched FLUFF and couldn't find the anime. :S
awww
hey are the BS MvM servers still down atm?
00,10must be nice to have full body optic camo
^
cloaking technology eh?
AJIsAwesome, fluff is just the word, fluff. Instad of epithets.
Mr_Anybody Found A Rainblower
I would steal everything. Worse than in Skyrim.
Mr_Anybody: you or anyone one else up for MvM?
00,10you would have to ask Phase4
Ping
id run around the town
i am half asleep oni_link so no :/
naked
Wooooah GitS? <3
oni_link, is it that mvm that costs tickets?
I'm pretty sure I know what every teenage boy in high school would do with cloaking technology
Kurra: nope
Enix, YES GITS :D
just the normal one
00,10mann up mode cost
00,10mvm dont
For some reason, I just can't find it. :S
hmmm.
I'm to tired to play MvM
Phase4: so um are the MvM servers still down?
Build a cloak detection business -> infinite money
oni_link, i've not started them again due to derps
oh alright
DaringDerpy: it just takes a thermal-scanner
thats kinda creepy
00,10it's called therm optic camo
also, GITS' artists draw faces, like... human FACES, which is relaxing compared to a lot of series. *shrug*
just fan service, keep the nosebleeds to a minimum XD
Active Camoflauge is still in the research stage and may one day help soldiers in the battlefield.
00,10only presure systems can pick them up
even better. there is almost no mass market for ir scanners now, twilight_sprinkle. you could flood the market
wow, so much physics breaking there :P
00,10they dont leave shadows heat and little vision
technically even simple invisibility is impossiblewithout being completely blind
Lunar_Brony, I'm seeing great things coming from metameterials.... cx
mmm dat ambience
00,10but they cant hide their weight
bouncy bouncy bouncy
Lunar_Brony: maybe against illiterate farmer boys with aks on toyota pickup trucks...
im sana, i'll be working on your boobs
Lies
lol
Pointless fanservice is pointless? :S
otherwise the cloaking is far more expensive than the countermeasures
/me Unboxes Unusual Soldier's Stash
cloaking is impossible without being blind
:) yay
AJIsAwesome "fanservice" . . . "pointless" . . . does not compute
Lunar_Brony: No, I meant just that one scene.
twilight_sprinkle: external sensors
oh
Has anyone else gotten the feeling that exposing one's cyberbrain ports is akin to getting nude? o.o
I'm not one who's into fanservice that much.
now as you say it, Kurra
DaringDerpy: still impossible, some light has to be absorbed to be analyzed
00,10Fanservice is fine so long as it's not the only thing a show has going for it
Haha, Autistic mode, that's what I call my Mac's setting for all networking ports off X3
DaringDerpy: most you could achieve is partial invisibility with partial blindness
Sumica: Agreed.
Kurra: thats what I call my Macbook when its in OSX
>.>
the sensorics don't have to be inside the cloak. one com channel is enough. on a very limited wave spectrum
I will only tolerate fanservice if the show isn't centered around it.
^
DaringDerpy: there would be a floating black dot of absorption
apple logic: let's make the previous iphone bigger and call it an iphone5!
and boy how lazy that was
00,10oh look
pink
00,10the images
twilight_sprinkle: good enough for night operations
DUN DUN
DUUUUUUUUUUUN
sure let's pay 500$ for the same thing only it's bigger!
DaringDerpy: also it would get insanely hot if there was no heat emission
^
00,10and the third picture
a light manipulation field strong enough to redirect all the rays would probably give the wearer at least cancer
so everyone is connected to some sort of technology network?
or overheating, yes ^^
more or less
DaringDerpy: redirection isnt enough, its much more than that
you need redirection, otherwise you have this black hole
visible
Fun Facts!
hehehe
its not redirection, its reprojection
00,10oh hi lauhing man
anyway regarding my rant about the iphone5 i just got my new iphone 5 :D
colors are overrated
IT'S A TRAP!
Motoko uses glare
DaringDerpy, you could just be a blackbody, and only emit heat... if you could emit it low enough, that'd be good enough sometimes.
geez, it's like Poo's meditation
^:D
I remember that meditation......:S
Chat is silent today.......
up down up i am up down touch the ground puts me in the mood
well it is a school night.....

Phase4 that is badass
AJIsAwesome: i c wut u did thar
you have a lot of mouths Kurra
Phase4: LIKE A FOUNDING FATHER
I have the dub of this episode.
Spectrum_Rush, : D
Is this the 1st run of the GITS series? Because I don't remember the previous episode.
00,10funny Kurra, so do I
00,10this is the last few eps of first gig
the previous one too? o.o;
00,10yeah
i don't keep up with anime so i have no idea wut you are talking about :)
@_@... I don't have the previous episode.
13ohai kenny
i thought I had all of 1st Gig.
I forget what a Stand Alone Complex is, what episode do they explain it?
i know what a dub is
00,10they talk about it when the laughing man first comes up
13Enix: a standalone complex is a case of a bunch of people copying some event, without there actually being an event to copy
what, does no one have biological eyes?
i meen seriousl
like love and tolerance? Stand alone complex?
seriously'
Well that makes SO much more sense.
13in this case, you have a lot of hackers call themselves the laughing man, even though there is no original laughing man (our guy here didn't do much)
Phase4, the cop with a mullet has no mods other than a cyberbrain.
13not just biological eyes, cyberbrains
00,10it's not a matter of the eyes Phase4
13you overwrite the memory of sight, not the actual input
ah
00,10it's the data the eyes are sending
Phase4 what Shizu said
and Sumi
I need to type faster . . . .
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
you can buy eyes, brains, nerves, muscle and whole bodies, and even switch brains with others.
GAH
00,10batou is pissed
13anyone else notice the car shifted
00,10wait hold on.
00,10yeah was just gonna say that Shizuka
next question: why dont people turn their wirelss whatnots on
Shizuka, i was looking for a detail like that but missed it
which whatnot?
00,10see it?
there it is
13very very slight
HORY SHEETROCK INTERCEPTOR
the shadow?
"YOU NOW PROSSESS THE GOLDEN KNIFE."
13easier if you go fullscreen
whoa colorful chat
cameraception
it moved!
00,10the intercepters caught it
Interseting never noticed this.
00,10cause he was not expecting them
13which ties the original complex ep back in :3
00,10or is it the intercepteres are isolated
See? this series is so kirkin' excellent /)>3<(\
00,10they dont recive data they only send it
Brain can't compute must force shutdown
13since the interceptors are transmitting, laughing man was only overwriting the guys' brains, didn't catch the signal going out with the real video
thought.exe has stopped responding. Please reboot your system or wait for the program to respond
00,10Mr_Anybody, basicly just about every one in the world has a computer brain
how did you know Sumica ?
they probably tell you
00,10they say it in the show
Lookit the coffe cups :D....
it's gonna be great
6_9
makes sense
mfw someone explains something i have no idea about
I think I got it
00,10the guy in the blue coat is a high grade hacker
And a major....
00,10but he's idealistic
having a cyberbrain must be like having internet access. If you don't have it, you must be a person committed to a very VERY certain lifestyle.
00,10he wanted the truth to come out
internet in front of your eyes ALL OF MY YES!
Mr_Anybody, your brain can be hacked so that you shoot your own arm, thinking you're shooting your target. For me, cyberbrains= no :s
aww
00,10the guy he kidnaped was holding back a cure for somthing that they were seling a compeating product
though it can be cool, you don't forget anything.
i was going to pay you
13suddenly outside voice
whoops did he just say that outloud
00,10btw this is a flashback
13Kurra: it's also noted you can switch your brain into "autistic mode", which basically rejects all inbound or outbound connection
Laughing woman..
indeed Shizuka, but with the abndance of wifi and other wireless things in this anime, I... still would really be not very ....confident. If I can be transmitted to, and if I can be backdoored, well.... :s
13then he hacks the camera
13and everyone in the vicinity
Yay! :D
i still want to have internet wherever i go
me too
ponies 24/7
my thoughts exactly
wait.... oooh maybad thoguht this was a diffrent scene....
00,10so all laughing man did was try to expose the truth
Okay, if I could have Paint Tool Sai in my head, THEN YES /)
00,10otheres saw it as an oputurinty
00,10and tryed to turn a profet from it
No wait it is but a flashback omg...
just think the picture and viola it's there!
00,10the hair color was the give away for it being a flashback
00,10and i love this song
Yeah I saw it ans was gettign confused
needs more cats
ffffff they keep hiding the coffee cups.
00,10you want to see it
00,10there it is
YAY! :D
/me 13wants to make a funny quip but it spoils
yay
Starbucks
of the FUTURE!!!
Now we need to see the old laughing man and it will be complete
:O
it can't be!
00,10I cant let you brew that starfox
win ^
-_(\
And the laughing man is now born.
/me hands Sumica an internet
i have to make a lolz about that noaw
/)_(\
00,10oh shit it's the combine
13hey laughing man, those are some awful girly eyelashes you have there
wait
NICE. |3
what?
You all got HACKT :D :D :D
13if you missed the previous ep, you're very lost now
WHoa.
Shizuka, i am lost
just sitting theree sipping his cup when suddenlly a wild swat team appears... everyday at starbucks
yes, yes I am
Good thing I did. :D
13we pretty much have the story from top to bottom so
the laughing man uploaded some stuff into her
hooray for homework keeping me up for hours at a time
00,10so what do you say twilight_sprinkle, got time for one more?
Lunar_Brony: Homework brohoof? :D /)
Sumica: no, sorry, im completely exhausted and i have to get up in 5 hours..
00,10oki
homework oh shit
this outro song
it makes me think
im out now, bye yall
AJIsAwesome what the buck, why not? /)
The artists can hack you. ;)
Bye, twilight_sprinkle! :)
Get some rest! :)
later twilight_sprinkle
seeya twilight_sprinkle
awww bye twilight_sprinkle
Odd seems someone took my nick name while i was using it?
ninight twilight_sprinkle
13IN THE BEGINNING, you have the problem of cyberbrain sclerosis, whereby the brain starts rejecting implants and shuts itself down; two treatments, a vaccine and micromachines, are developed independently
What was your nickname?
And since she's made of metal, why WOULD she surf? There's a sinking thing there.
hmm, I guess I'll go now, see y
'all
bleh
BYe, Dken2021 :)
y is everyone leaving :<
bye Dken2021
seeya Dken2021
13an up and coming politician sees an opportunity to make stupid amounts of money on the machines, so he rigs the drug approval committee to reject the vaccine, even though it works better
00,10Enixx, you pin timed out
/me shakes everyone's hooves, and is off
00,10er ping
you should write a book Shizuka
00,10wait a few min and the server will remove it
13some time later the laughing man learns about this and kidnaps the CEO of Serano Genomics to figure out what happened
Ah, ok Thank you.
13at the same time, yakushima's goons send a blackmail to serano, and use the laughing man's stunt on TV as a cover
so much purple
13laughing man disappears, but the conspiracy goes on to put yakushima in office and make piles of money
meh, I see her text as a megenta
00,10in the words of Mr Krabs
meh
00,10MONIE MONIE MONIE MONIE
13police can't find any leads, and eventually are at such a loss that they start planting interceptors, cameras, in their own investigators
13six years later, a random cop still working the case discovers he and the rest of the investigators are bugged, and is killed by the department chief to keep it covered, but section 9 is tipped off and gets involved
The photos of that are awesome.
13that kicks off another round of laughing man copycats to throw people off the trail
00,10you dont have to quit to nick change Enix
you know there is one thing that bugs me about winter rap up and thats that they wait til the last day.
00,10uyse use /nick "newnamegoeshere"
Huh I just refreashed no big deal.
I want to watch more silly.
13then a random internet chatroom, like us!, starts finding clues in the stock prices of various micromachine companies at the time of the original incident, the major listens in
but thanks for the tip
That works.
i'm up for more GITS, bytheway c.c
Ditto
^
Sumica: as I recall you mentioned you grew up with G1 right?
13when the original laughing man, or someone anyway, causes a list of vaccine users to be leaked from records, the ministry of health, labor, and welfare cracks down on the org that got the info, and of course section 9 is still sniffing around
who wants to see a cat?
is this the opening that totally puts all others from any country to shame?
00,10yup
Italy, right?
Yup
is this a legitimate intro?
Yes
ITALY
Y U SO AWESOME
Short version.
lucky italy
DAT DIGIMON
Oh, WOW.\
13the narcotics squad tries to eliminate the major but the original laughing man intervenes and essentially downloads his memories into the major
whoa, dat digimon!
maybe their prime minister is a brony and paid extra for this intro ;)
need to sleep but that socio-psycho-techno-conundrum |F
13major goes out and does the episode we just saw
13and now you're caught up :3
cat?
Digimon in Japanese? Im intrigued
Shizuka, thanks, that helped a lot and I've seen GITS like 4 times alread yXDD
I hate to admit it-- but I like the US version better.
guejomon picture Noaw
nostalgic this is.
13when i watch i end up spending way too much time unraveling it, but it's so awesome
oni_link: It's a new part of Sumi's line up. We're on Episode 5 I believe
00,10now explane NGE Shizuka =p
Great! Shizuka what do you consider the colour of your text? I say it's magenta. I would've asked earlier, but I didn't want to interrupt the wall of useful knowledge
13adam and lilith crash into earth, this is bad for some reason, so adam sends giant angel monsters to reunite the two
13kid with daddy issues keeps getting in the way
13adam decides screw it, end the world, world promptly ends
13asuka says she feels ill
13the end :3
seems legit
00,10hehe
Lol
ok take the first 3 letters of your last names and combine that with the first two letters of your first name then put mon at the end
XDDDDDDDDDDDD
:D
00,10I think the best way to explain it is "they ran out of money"
the electric tail of pikachu
How does he charge that thing??
SmiJumon
13i unraveled the eva story after watching the original too but it isn't very consistent
same way an electric eel does.
Sumica: now if I were to say "Crabnastys roll out" would that ring any bells to you?
13it's more about solving the kids' problems than about building the world
"I musten't run away"
Finally...sleepy... I['m off. Laters.

Rommimon - Mitt Romney
where are you all getting this from?
Petkymon... wut?
13the world is powered by AAs!
Shizuka there may be a smaller framework of circuits inside the digital world. OR they use it to access the rest of the digital world. Think of it like accessing the internet, except from inside the internet itself. It makes sense in my mind
RoboCopMon
00,10robocopmon
Kenjomon - John Fitzgerald Kennedy
oh shit robocop is here
andromon lol, one of my favs

that looked like lua
Pearly I am tired and bored from homework, but I'm almost done, then I can crash.

dat screencap
oh hey, thanks Shizuka
huh
that is good, I hope you don't crash too soon
and a late hello to you Scottish-geeky :P

Phase4 - it almost looks like it was trying to draw something
noodle arms?
ho hia somepony_else
this show taught me to always hit people in the left leg for an insta kill
hello Scottish-geeky
though based on the fact that it's starting at 100, it means we're missing 10 lines of code
we're watching digimon again? great! what episode is this?
13there was more of the fractal function that time
13func/endfunc
And then he sent them in a dead end filled with monsters. The end
Mr_Anybody, MechWarrior taught me that too
hope he saved all that code
it says 'dunc fractal', looking at the code it might very well be the mandelbrot
Phase4 - that's 'func fractal' - he was defining it
func'
XD
well time for me to hi the bread, night everyone and thanks for the stream Sumica :)
BYe, thelonepony! :)

with a little bit of pascal
night Thelo blasted
13vaguely reminded me of autoit, which is based on vis basic
