no... no its not... I mean its good onces or twice... but best? nah
2001 i mean
sad
Mainly because of its influence
I hope they play this song at my cheer comps. I can imagine everyone dancing that :D
George Lucas and Spielberg are 2 examples
Do you accept the challenge? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRQLVTKb9M0&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
I agree with it mostly, but I don't think that we could objectively choose "best scifi movie ever" even if we honestly tried
Yes, it is long and boring for us because we're young and we need some sort of action
http://derpy.me/Dk11d
But 2001 is great because it shows how Man is nothing in the universe, and yet we have the power to change the universe
oh hey
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/
2001 is just overrated,
I never seen 2001
Not all great things are meant to be very entertaining
Moon is a great film
/me dances
just to be clear...
OVERRATED, does not mean BAD
Well I wan't saying it was bad
Hi!~
Damn, the survey isn't open.
Overrated means not as good as people say, but you cant deny that it is an influencial film
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rCP4CRRO7E&feature=g-all-f
Hi.
Due to being a girl, I'm not really into the whole sci fi film thing. But I do loive a good superhero movie.
2001 may take more than one watching to really understand it. But once you do...
wow
I'm doing Chemistry extra credit.....9 more until I can take a break and play Skyrim....
bummer
:'(
Starship Troopers does not do the book justice
I agree
I tried to get into NGE i just couldnt
too depressing
I gotta hunt down all these book turned movie books. I was thinking about reading the hunger games...Is it good?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWiT6VbVpjg&feature=g-u-u
I do like some cheesey cinema, but star ship troopers is artery clogging
the movie always sucks compared to the book... except for maybe the LoTR extended cuts
^
No, really, Hunger Games is an actual rip off!
The arther of Hunger Games got the idea from the movie
The reason that the movie's aren't amazing is because they cut out a lot of things that the book had.
...
I read books
...
agreed
Good
:O
We could end up like farenheight 451 if this attitde doesn't change.
Ha
Farenhiet451, where books died with a wimper, and without a bang
Well, the reason most kids hate reading is because teacher make you dissect a book, and it takes the fun out of it..
I hate Francium.
???
Bradbury wrote the book to show a world with too much tv, not a one with no books
The element or the song?
I actually like his writing, but dislike the technophobe of a man
:P
I disagree!
Okee,back to work...
This society is a great thing!
Libraries burn books with you knowing
The latest book I read was Night....You have to read that thing.
An anarchy would be awfule, wed all fight all the time
In a hive, everyone thinks the same and has no pride over lower beings because in a hive, there are no lower beings
Not really
cuncur
sorry
concur.
*author of night*
thank you!
You're welcome.
You wont be the same, youll still be you
AND
would not create much worth
It's just one entity with many parts.
THe great things come from diversity
That's not society.

Hey, we're sort of saying "Fuck you social standards"

Why would there be an uprising?
We're not going to end up drinking kool aid, right?
cult following
brb
No conflct, no war
EVeryone is on the same level
No development.
WOrking to help eachother
No dialogue.
There could be development, since there is on conflict to stop it
THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE CONFLICT
It'd be stagnant, if everyone is thinking the same thing why would anyone say anything, how would anyone learn.
okay
Why? Why does there have to be conflict?
Where there is good, there must be evil and where there is evil there must be good
:D
You'd be entirely dependant on things outside the group
Conflic drives growth
BALANCE AND SYMMETRY
Conflict is made when people with seperate thoughts argue
Guthix
afk
:O
A stagnant society always dies
:O :P :) :D
Not if done right
end of the world is already happening
bieber is covering stairway to heaven
it survived centuries of stagnation
Egypt has been going through upheavels for ages
They always had somebody to fight
there can never be world peace
EVER
It still had periods of time where it was stagnant and stable for closer to 1000 years
Anarchy.
A world where evryone is intitled to their opinion?
and back
Force co-operation through neccessity.
I still think that a singular world government would be nice
Because people are stupid.
Well we need to nuke that place, but that's beside the point
jk
That opinion differs in the fine print.
We are all equal in our fandom
Watch.
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
No, that's called a subculture
Ponies are awesome. We all know this, and it unites us
No one is streaming right now Java
*reason
Oh
Ok then :/
Can we get some more vid pwease? :(
/me points out the fact that there is a channel set aside to debate politics
Diversity is good
...yeah, no. not taking part in government discussion when nothing can be done of it.

They're intergalactic Jehova's Witnesses.
such as extra-planetary colonies of note
spread across lioght nyears
now religion talk?
Admit it.
Does Pinkie talking about anything besides parties? Because thats my view of her

Why, why cant it have growth?
no no no
ugh, the sound on my computer is all poppy and clicky
Not nesscerily

hmmmm lughtywears....
lightywears
We can work together to great bthings
Yes, my speed typing is poorly done
Having fun listing obscure religious figures

This!

I mean, the fedearation like that.
STOP! STOP WITH THE STUPID SHIT
No
no continue please *noms popcorn*
Hm..........Maybe if we all purchase a large island,we could detach ourselves from whatever country it was purchased from,and call it Equestria! :)
Sorry
We're talking about being ruled by a queen.
Equestria is a hive
That's not freedom then is it.
...............................
we're discsussing our own contient now?
and hence little conflict

Halla!
Hey Saturn
hi Saturn
/me licks Saturn
08,01i hope the chat's not getting out of hand in here
If we had the same thoughts we wouldn't be having this conversation. In fact we wouldn't be having any conversation.
nah
Yeah saturn, woohoo!
Exactly
We're having fun as it is.
There would be no need
Hm....Hack into every satellite and broadcast nothing but MLP:FiM?........No,we'd just get arrested... O_O
....
Hey Saturn
Imagine that...A girl can dream.
That's nice.
uhh thanks?

You're
We can slow down light
We have the technology
But it's hard to rip on interdimensional barrier
not really
Hm. If we somehow create a special frequency,maybe it could tear a hole through the dimensional barrier,and we could break through the fifth wall and travel to different realities.....
You think Saturn?
Hai Saturn
Portals thhat take you places exist; theyre called cars
In social studies the other day, some kid asked me where spain was on a map......
08,01Unnr: i read a paper a few years ago about slowing light down in a vacuum
Saturn: Well yes, but I like the smart-alecky answer. :P
another model
We don't even know when we kill all of the universe.
we have many models running around
08,01Unnr: oh, you <3
ahhhh
It likely does not exist
AHAHAHAHAHA

But nothing forbades ones' existence
my theory is...muffins are friggin delicious
they are simply, portals
That could be true....We should send a willing somone into one with some kind of messaging machine....But could he die in one?

Java thats how we learn
08,01http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970618a.html
Our world is fragile enough, then we try to tear a little hole.....
We don't :p
Its not that we know physics, we just like to think about physics and logic
XD
Saturn: My fav thing about blackholes is the theoretical density around a SUMABLAHO
I want to go back to talking philosophy.
At least that was entertaining.
Saturn: at least i try to learn from docs
08,01Unnr: aye
Controlled debate is good.
lol
this debate is sooo amusing
Why not talk about chiptunes? Or our favorite foods?
back
nothing liek astronomy or physics

i still win
OOH. LET'S TALK ABOUT VOLCANOES!
they exist
I don't either, but you can learn a lot from these little conversations.
Volcanoes are fun!
Weather interest me the most, and climate too.
I live in a country full of volcanoes.
angels*
Isn´t astrophysics fun?
Java: Central/south america?
08,01i like neutron stars
No, but in the volcano belt.
Weepings angels have to be the scariest things ever
bottom
I still remember leaving in the middle of a fansinating conversation about stars.....
A hint: we have a mountain called... Krakatoa ;)
i liek higgs boson
You never know if its an angel until its too laye
Saturn: I always was fascinated by pulsars
Java Hawaii?
and we waited for sirens that never come. And we only write by the moon, every word hand written
Indonesia
How did I not figure that out?
Our islands are literally shaped by volcanoes.
someone from java nicknaming themselves java, how creative
Heheh
Java aren;y all?

It's alright, sometimes some mointain explode, but not that often.

Stupid people only exist because we let them exist
Of course everything shows me stupid people, sadly stupid people exist.
But this was a conversation about the fandom.
Hello everypony :

In a Hive, there are no stupid people
hello mate.
In a hive you have no people
Cthulu is best pony
When you guys think of hives, youre jkust thinking of an insect hive but with people
And yet most of the time I hate the weather too.
except you can't educate the weather.

Hey when are we gonna get some vids?
I go here because I deal with a lot of people IRL as a landlord, in here I can be as silly as I can.

Any stream now?
I Don't hate stupid people

Hey Everyone! If you enjoy the F&S album, please be sure to donate to the Seeds of Kindness Fundraiser. All proceeds go to help an orphanage that we are trying to fully fund! http://broniesforgood.org/2012/09/seeds-of-kindness-2-launch/

Good to hear ! :)
good evening
Music stream, but oh well.

No worries, it's not like it'll be the last one we do <3
Hey I like this one.

its more secure and you dont need to enter a password

And that sounded like something from Star Trek.

Seriously if you ended that with "Captain" that could have been Voyager dialogue.
dam dat face
eeewwww
its an alternative to rsa, both public key algos
ecdsa is in theory more secure

I know I'm just teasing.
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDl
I've had most of the spiel thrown at me more than once.
00,10wizard did it
the record is like 128 qbits, which makes a wristwatch look like a supercomputer
Hey, if we could go from there to here, then we can go from here to there
Or...
why why why
SOMEHOW we'll find a way to make it work.
and back again?
YES!
ONWARD
What's the advantage of quantum state computers then? Just less power consumption?
OVER THERE
i think
I should look into going into quantum computing.
hm, heard of it, imagined it a bit different from this..
a feat that todays supercomputers would take many centurys to complete
its like world of wrcraft O_O
assuming reasonably key size anyway, if it was like 2 bits you could break it with a calculator
most of the worlds crypto is built around rsa
Because RSA takes too long to break at the moment.
Via guessing.
i think the best case computation is 2^(key size/4)
for ecdsa its 2^(key size/2)
00,10so when dose she get her thoom?
woah, i just saw a pic for a s3 villain, it is epiiiiic
See, this is why I should go into computers.
Is that encrpytion/decryption speed?
i know
Although honestly if I hang around here long enough I'll probably absorb enough anyway.
2,14 no s3 spoilers
i know
for a 4096 bit key you'd in theory need 2^1024 computations to break it
hence the security

13Enix: a standalone complex is a case of a bunch of people copying some event, without there actually being an event to copy
i meen seriousl
seriously'
13not just biological eyes, cyberbrains
13you overwrite the memory of sight, not the actual input
00,10it's the data the eyes are sending

00,10the intercepters caught it
Interseting never noticed this.
00,10cause he was not expecting them
00,10or is it the intercepteres are isolated
00,10they dont recive data they only send it
Brain can't compute must force shutdown
00,10Mr_Anybody, basicly just about every one in the world has a computer brain

makes sense
mfw someone explains something i have no idea about
I think I got it
00,10but he's idealistic

00,10and tryed to turn a profet from it
