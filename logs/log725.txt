05,15and Ohio and Virginia haven't come in yet

But it's fun!
So who's as nervous about this election as I am?
If Ohio goes blue, it's likely over.
sorry, not a party person Kurra
VA is looking really red :(
well if romney wins we're doomed
Romney really needs Ohio.
Dammit I have a nosebleed. That can't be a good thing.
NC became dumb again
If Obama wins we're doomed
Buytoast: Should we build bunkers now?
I was nervous until I saw the Epic rap battles of history, Obama vs. Romney, and from then on it's just been a party XD
... Know what? Ol' Vinyl is just going to lay down on the floor here for a bit.
13i bet ohio won't come in for like a week
lol kinda funny that obama won the state that romney used to govern.
you should've built your bunkers years ago
Shizuka: don't jinx it

Idk
Why does this website keep pinging.
like an audible ping.

Kurra: like i said, not a party person :I
fluttercry, hopefully though there won't be scandal if it's like 2000
OH GOD IT'S BARNEY
Barney: sing the song
KILL HIM
so when Romney wins, who here is old enough to be drafted to fight the russians in World War 3?
Barney!
/me hugs Barney
13apparently at this point romney either has to take florida, north carolina, virginia, and ohio, or either colorado or iowa who are just coming in

AJIsAwesome, no I was in the line to vote this morning
HI, RDash5000. :)
Hey RDash5000
/me helps Ponies47 hide
Shizu: It's gonna boil down to Ohio. Republicans haven't won without Ohio, and that one is absolutely key to a Romney win. His odds decrease dramatically without it.
RDash5000: Holla
Why? LOL 'cuz
13true dat
Hmm. Don't ask don't tell will be back one Romney gets elected… LIGHTBULB
toHi RDash5000 :)
whats this?
/me Cries and hugs thelonepony
oh look, Obama won in my state by a landslide. Didn't see that coming
And right now, while the gap has closed....Ohio is blue-leaning.
Hi*
RDash5000: Cosmos, a space mini series
51-47 Obama.
AJIsAwesome, what happened$?
AttackWithHugs: Ah. Baconmane decicded to become Barney and it just escalated from there. :D

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

CriticKitten: (and anyone else who want to make generalizations about elections) http://www.xkcd.com/1122/
otakon: Only reason they need
otakon: because thats the reason!
13oh is that the presidents one?
Barney: Oh Barney is a dinosaur, looks like a grape on steroids...
lovely
0,5Because if I don't input a message that's what it puts. the person's name.
yay
13oh no the precedent one that was fun
well at least the colors are gone

Hi, AVS619. :)
Hi AVS619 :)
AVS619: Sup sucka?
NullRadix: It's true until it's broken. And the odds of a Romney win are VERY small without Ohio.
comet parties
9,6I love you AVS619
peels here
Go bug you dad, go bug to you mom, to buy you a Barney CD-ROM
GIANT CHARTS ABOUT US POLITICS. Tiny comic for the "universal label"
oh god no
So that comic, while cute, is still wrong. :p
Hi AVS619
Is anypony watching Comedy Central instead of the news networks :p?
if you have to vomit
Deadlypon3: I would be if I still watched TV
we need a barney bot
05,15Deadlypon3 I will when John Stewart comes on
twoiloight_spurnkle: to scare away the trolls? :P
Nullradix I need some cheering up, so I am watching the electioonthingie
and even further... we see the wonderful land of equestria. 5000 lightyears away :)
It's Colbert right now :p
thelonepony: i didnt know trolls were afraid of barney
Billions and BILLIOns of Puma Man
neither do i >:3
Deadlypon3: wait... wait... you're watching the election... to cheer up?
what?
NullRadix: So, yes, it can happen. But it hasn't. And it very likely won't this time. Romney needs Ohio.
NullRadix The comedy Central thing :P
oh
kay
at least its in the universe
Anyone having any advice how to bypass the country restriction of comedy centraly election night stream?
I dunoo...I don't play Nethack :p
diddutz: well one way would be to use a proxy, but idk an easy way to get a proxy fast enough for a stream. plus it depends on who restricted it, your country or whoevers streaming
and then the earth exploded twice. THE END
Sweet
Twice?
tor if it isn't blocked like it is for this chat
Still a better ending than (gets shot
twoiloight_spurnkle: nope, flash player is not affected by the proxy, already tried that ^^

05,15162/163
Ooo, Ohio's down to 51-48.
I love how cliffhanger this is, it's so epic :D
05,15It's stressful
13ha, johnson has 1% of the vote in minnesota so far, 3% reporting in
05,15Funny at onl 3% they're already calling Obama
the way he pronounces things is awesome :D
bullshaped
13inb4 minnesota is blue again only because johnson split the republican vote here
-_- oh god it's gunna be Obama again
Go Gary!
bull crap
I'm scared for real about this election
So apparently, there's also the Consitution party, the Green party, and the Libertarian party running for the presidency. :)
13google's a teeny bit behind, still 159/148 romney
fluttercry: Based on early results and exit polling they can call some states pretty early

I plan on going back to school in tbe future
50/48% Obama in Ohio :O
brb. pony physics panel.

And the NLR, and the... whatever Celestia's thing is called....
i didn't vote because it wouldn't have made an effect
wait Obama got ohio?
Yep, AR is red
Yodolaaaaeeeeeeehooo.
Saw that coming
Obama doesn't have Ohio yet.
It's blue leaning though.
13SpeccyRush: not yet, it's split hard and a little under half the votes are in
I almost wrote in Celestia...
About 3% lead for Obama right now.
msnbc is reporting 163/162 romney
You guys remember the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear? :D
13oh wow, look at my link, look at florida
kurra I do
NBC is jumping too far ahead.
Kurra, somewhat a little, yeah
/me looks at Ohio's counties.
I love you pony_6274
picasso, darn, but your vote does have an effect :)
05,15ABC is 162/163 Romney as well
1384% in and they're 49/49
oh god, Barney is naked!!
My biggest hope is that whoever wins does so by over 29 electoral votes so we don't have another giant battle over Florida
Shizu: Florida's been a razorthin margin, as close as 21k votes at some times
AttackWithHugs: I went to that, there were fursuiters and zentai guys and it was SO FUN! </sweetiebelle>
9,6I love politics
ah Florida
Kurra, I am soooo jealous.
how could we have an interesting election without Florida...
good ol' Illinois
bluer than the first smurf
13and yet you get out of chicago illinois is pretty solid red
i am not a huge fan of far right, I am more of .. middle right?
13but they must be not voting
goddamn florida, cut any closer and you'll need a ceramic knife
13oh hey mclean isn't in yet
13come on normal!
Shizuka, its like that in indiana
AttackWithHugs: Well let's see if Jon Stewart and Colbert get together again, it was silly and hilarious, and people really learned to get along and see beyond people's party and faith and divisive stuff
evening, all.
13HOLY
Shizuka: Same way with Nevada once you leave Vegas
Shizuka, what is McLean?
Kurra, i want to go to that one day. Where's it located?
Evening.
the larger metro areas lean democrat, the rest of the state leans republican
13hennipin county 9% in, leaning ROMNEY
so when can we expect final results?
13that's minneapolis
did any one hear celestial
Hi, WallDives and donutpop365. :)

My county apparently is SUPA-IMPO'TANT in my state :O and I voted SO HARD :D
hmm
the thing is
Kurra: You from California?
fluttercry: It'll be AN historic election night.
Fun fact: Yesterday I was called a traitor, likened to a Holocaust deniar, and told to go shoot myself just for predicting that Obama would win
Nope!
so when can we expect final results?
Kurra: Florida?
Midnight_Fyre: :S
this election will be the one to shatter the sanctity of the world and rock it to its very core
the end comes
so I'm so amped, I bet my vote will be one of the ones that might make the tiny margin. :D
05,15CriticKitten A Nation Votes, but Ohio Decides!
Midnight_Fyre: Fun times
/me loved how they kept emphasizing "AN" during the 2008 election one. XD
Midnight_Fyre: yay politics!

Uh.... oops, maybe I shouldna blabbed my location or... o//o
ABC news says 172/163
mkay thanks WallDives
Kurra, dont feel bad, my state is the only one that matters, apparently.

who wants to bet?
place your bets !
WallDives: the Old Dominon
WallDives: Where you at?
Kurra: Now i can stalk you with ease, MWUHAHAHAHA

Now just watch. Florida will end up pulling a 2000, and we'll all be trolled for a good week.
aren't physics just dandy?
with Luger out of the senate race, they most likely lost indiana senate seat
Florida you dick
sigh... looks like Obama's winning
nah, Romney needs more than just Florida to troll the nation anyway
he would have won with 70-80% of the vote
RDash5000: you say that now. Then someone pushes you out a window
You know, there ARE other states besides Florida...
I'm a democrat, but I think Romney has this election. It would be monumental for Obama to win given the economy
heresy
And most of them are called for. :P
god damn this shit is close
but then again, kinda hard to vote against someone who's been in the senate for a good part of 30 years :)
Sarah_B: Obama's got this in the bag.
NullRadix: and as i'm falling, i yell "PHYSICS!!!!! FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!! *splat*
I hope so, but still kinda doubtful
05,15Sarah_B it's pretty close
The big ones that Romney needs are Ohio and Florida, Virginia would help a lot too. I think if Romney loses Ohio, though, it'll all fall apart for him.
05,15Obama is leading in Electoral Votes right now
RDash5000: Its a first-floor window
is he?
Romney has to pretty much win every single state that hasn't been called.
oh shit. checking!!
HoodyNinja: physics
13google's holding at 159/148 romney
win
except the west coast (which are Obamas anyway)
Sarah_B: The numbers so far say otherwise. Given the economy a strong Republican candidate should be able to win easily, but the GOP has spent the last four years becoming more radical and shooting itself in the foot
no winner in flordia...
05,15VA is 49/50 for Romney right now, but more northern counties are still returning results
oh god the numbers
Ohio is within 2, Florida's within 1
NoVa is where 99% of Obama's voters live in Virginia.
I bet it will be a tie
fluttercry thanks for the update! woo
Virginia's only 40k votes apart. ._.
wouldn't be fricking awesome?
two presidents
lol
jezzybelly, not quite.
tie isn't happening.
/me goes into a pity party chatroom
Wat.
means senate picks vp, house picks pres.
The tiebreaker is the House votes
Florida just went brown on my map. The fuck does that mean.
:|
It just went for... Roseanne
CriticKitten: Shit hit the fan?
well, numbers are flying all over the place
Its mean no selted winner
lol HoodyNinja thats what i was thinking
/me locates the map key
05,15CriticKitten they just gave up
05,15Opted out of the race
HoodyNinja: lol
"No Declared Winner". So yes, they just gave up.
umm
Shizuka: Can I get a link to google's map please, lost my tab
They're within 21k votes.
HoodyNinja: y u no google
Florida, just fricking PICK.
haven't put this here in a while :) http://inception.davepedu.com/
Flip a damn coin.
Obama leads ohio by 2% still, 100k voters difference.
twoiloight_spurnkle: Laziness :I
I'll have none of this "brown" on my blue and red map.
No turd on my map kplz
CriticKitten: Giant black square

Florida's still trying to decide what they want for breakfast 12 years ago.
13or just google 'election' :3
hen3ry: ???
Florida seems to be democratic this election
why do no one vote independent
always democrat or republican
Shizuka: Thank you
long, complicated story...
I want difference
But the west coast isn't in yet, so Romney has an uphill battle.
05,15Strange, ABC count is 173/163 Obama
and ABC is talking about racial votes :I
Fuck this country
^
13they're calling states way too early
ABC and NBC predict too early.
lol racial votes
that's journalism for you
They were calling some states with only 5% of the vote.
>_>
13what votes are in are split hard in most of the important states
So I stopped looking at theirs.
HoodyNinja: fuck this country for making ppl talk about politics
if i was in dc i would vote incumbent too
I just want to know Ohio
that google thing is calling montana with only 0.5% of votes
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352251617481.png
Florida, stop being a turd!
PICK. :|
CrimsonPhoenix: I love you
Sarah_B, ohio leading still.
HoodyNinja, no homo
dat Toy Story reference
Florida seems to be blue
08,01so
16k vote difference in Florida. Holy crap.
Why is Florida always a floozy when it comes to elections :|
08,01who is winning?
CrimsonPhoenix: :)
08,01the good guys or the bad guys?
By less than 1 percent
theres only .5% people in montana
me
CrimsonPhoenix: All of the homo
05,15Some places are saying Romney, others are saying Obama
08,01fluttercry: overall?
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
05,15No, West Coast states still aren't in yet
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: neither is MLG this year
08,01both are NBC
There are 6 states that are still open. Of those, Idaho and Alaska are for Romney, the other four (California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii) are for Obama.
The... news channel?
Romney winning in electorals
none of them are swing states.
170/148
Oh we talkin politics?
And California is "really big."
Romney wins popular, but Obama wins election
bam
2000 repeat\
HoodyNinja: That's just because the west coast hasn't been called yet
of course alaska is for romney
they're far enough not to give a shit
this is the most excite I've been for elections
Midnight_Fyre: I know
05,15The states that matter that are up in the air are Virginia, Florida, and Ohio
Doubt it. The west coast will push Obama over the top in the popular vote too - not that it matters that much
13fox is calling 174/163 romney so far, not terribly surprising
hes going to win florida, win virginia, lose Ohio, lose Colorado, and then thats it
05,15Well yeah....Fox
haha
Faux News
05,15MSNBC is probably doing the same for Obama
fox...
CNN was saying 152/143 Romney last time i checked
13let's find out
Fixed News.
If Romney drops Ohio or Florida at this point, he's probably dead.
its too early right now for predictions
but so is cnn and most others
you so funny
05,15Both those channels are poison
Yup. Any of the big swings left are Must Win
agreed, CriticKitten,
I'm watching older chat reactions. :D
13actually
fluttercry: Yes
Romney took Arizona?
I call for a re-election!!!!!!!!
13msnbc is calling 174/172 romney
Obama gets either, he can put off calling U-Haul for four years
who's streaming anyways?
13yeah arizona's not going to put up with obama for another term
I demand a recount!
05,15Woah, I wonder if half the control room has commited seppuku yet?
gamers are calling 1000000/10 halo 4
lol
California dealt with Dubya for 8 years, Arizona can suck it up.
please CrimsonPhoenix don't remind me, i'd like one aneurysm thank you
05,15I blame Halo 4 for low youth turnout.
13fox just closed to 174/173 romney
casheeoweone: Give it a week for BO2 to come out
05,15Like...seriously
08,01so, who is leaving the country if romney wins?

I have this site up called Politico... it has Romney winning at 170/148
08,01because gay marriage is going to be legalised in scotland soon

"slow erosion wipes out information"
only issue is, he isnt going to win any more states
politico is reliable. ^^

according to nbc, only 7% of cali reported so far
thelonepony: Well, watchu gonna do?
11,01Maybe this election will teach some businessmen to stop being assholes and hide their intentions. Probably not, though. I do think if Romney loses, it'll be due to his cockiness.
thelonepony: (\ now i can tear up my suicide letter :3
It looks like Obama's going to win an Politico.com
lol jk
cali is predominately democrat
Now I'm free to push on 0bama without letting that evil thing win.
Yep, BarRockman Obama woned again. (hoof up if you known the joke)

Obama is a weak president but a better choice than Romney

And the Tea Party types are crazy enough to want to go off the cliff. Figuring, hey, Obama will get blammed by history either way.
Disregard that post everyone! I didn't know US of A don't like it when you take a picture of a ballot!

But to be fair, had Romney won, we'd still have gridlock, it'd just be the Senate we were talking about being the gridlock source.

oh hey I remember that tank ting
Just as a warning?
05,15StudMuffin but it would be worse without it
actually, every single possible voting system is deeply flawed.
Hello!
11,01Don't know why it kept repeating the same IP
Hello Friday
fluttercry: how? popular vote count everyone's vote
Kurra: That's why I support monarchy
i don't
13virginia's gotten closer, florida will go obama, colorado too
Hi Friday :)
13StudMuffin: if it was a national popular vote, why would anywhere other than the big cities matter
hen3ry aw heck no D:
/me Movie Night: in 2 days, 19 hours, 16 minutes.
05,15StudMuffin because then the big cities and large population states would hold ALL the power. The small states wouldn't matter
i may have bit off more then i can chew w/ these two lunas
Obama's leading in Virgina
I think the stream stopped.
anyone of you ever heard of JoaftheLoaf?
it did
13there are eight million people in new york city alone and overwhelmingly democrat, why would you bother campaigning in the rest of new york?
Time: no streamatm
there's no possible way Romney can win now
fluttercry: So, everything would stay the same?
Shizuka: because, big cities dont matter in the popular vote. it count eveeryones vote. if your talking about where the rpesidents would campaign, well, they still dotn campaign in California and Texas
Shizuka: because we're a 50-50 country, so the votes matter nationally. It'd be a matter of turnout.
13no see
13big cities would have to be offset by a hell of a lot more small cities
Hmmm
13and they wouldn't
I can see those suckers booing at Obama now...those poor ashamed maggots...
Oh hay, my internet is being silly, and I ought to be doing work things. G'night everypony.
05,15StudMuffin you don't understand. The vote of the big cities would overwhelm everyone else
I s'pose I could clean the fan in my laptop Thursday-ish

Ciao.
this guy really deserves more views http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h28QdJG3nUY
13picasso: because not everyone has internet
Shizuka: The presidents dont campaign aat all pretty much in California, because its mostly demorcatic. Obama knew he would win california. so he didnt go there, or at least very little. Romney probably did the same thing with texas
Hi Twilight :)
StudMuffin: Big cities votes would overpower the small cities vastly. >_> EC allows small cities to have a say in the race, and it keeps the elections at the STATE level as they should be.
Since Romney won the popular vote, maybe we can finally get rid of the electoral college.
:) Hi
13StudMuffin: exactly, instead they spend time in STATES with more distributed populations
homeless people don't vote
13seriously?
Nittany_Discord well it seems twilight is ban evaiding
Shizuka: if they did popular vote, theyd have to reason to go to EVERY state, not just Ohio and Florida
80% of the country had no say whatsoever in who won tonight.
that's not true picasso
13StudMuffin: no they wouldn't, they would hit the big population centers and be done
Shizu: It's like I said. The folks who want the EC gone don't understand why it exists or what it does for us.
#Twilight Motha Effin Sparkle is here!
hay every poney
13if you secure the population sinks, you win
Shizuka: no, they wouldnt
13no candidate would ever have to care about small towns again

Yes, they would.
Hello Sad_face
Hi Sad_face
Only people who lived in Ohio, Florida, Virginia, etc. New York, Texas, California = worthless.
the thing is, you can spend a million dollars campaigning in any town or city in any state. Why spend that million in a town of 15,000 when you can spend it in a city of 1 million? See, big city swayings.
They don't now
Twilight ? You aren't Twilight.
Shizuka: they dont right now with the EC
13and if you can't see the simple math, you have no business advocating abolition of the electoral college
Why would you visit a small town if you can secure New York City and thus take the entire state?
now its exceeding my reading ability
13what you SHOULD be advocating is the abolition of winner take all
hen3ry EXCUSE ME? >:|
obama won gary johns never stood a chance i know but y obama
Silly I'm Twilight Velvet!
13more states need to follow nebraska and maine where the electors are split by district
kinda amazing that newyork voted
Shizuka: 1st amendemt, freedom of speech. I am not saying that whta you think is wrong, or stupid. Dont get me wrong Shizuka. But i think it should
yes
Twilight Velvet? That doesn't make sense.
Shizu: Agreed, winner-take-all rules are idiotic. Electors should be based by region.
Kurra: No matter who the candidates were, Texas was going to go red, California was going to go blue. No reason to even bother voting.
I'm wearing pony shirts to school for the rest of the week in honor of Season 3 coming out on Saturday :P
in 2016, Texas will be red, California will be blue.
I'm the mother OF twilight.
Ponies47, do it with PRIE
Don't fuck with Obama, bitches. http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Obama+2012_3a43e5_4074045.jpg
13alternative vote would be nice but there's no way that would overcome the inertia of one vote one candidate
hen3ry, it matters more than ever. <3
Doesn't matter who runs.
Ponies47: See if you can find any bronies there if you do. :)
oh lovely
1000 electoral votes seperated by population

No you aren't.

You are a silly person.

If you want to choose who the President is, move to Ohio or Florida.
VenHur: lol
HoodyNinja, Duh. I have 5 pony shirts :P
11,01Under Twilight?

Well your just a, a, a chair!
Ponies47: woot, wear dem shirts :3
Ponies47: Sweetness
13romney came to minnesota
13that would never happen if there was a popular vote
AJIsAwesome, I hope atleast one
Shizuka: im guessing thats where you live
Why wouldn't it?
No, Houston was Rep
xoxtwilightsparkle = Friday = Twilight
13because the twin cities are hilariously democrat

Twilight (prrgpbvgab@qxnv-298-13-351-326.nycmny.fios.verizon.net
And you are still a silly person.
In a popular system, they'd distribute more - they'd have to.
You can only raise NYC's turnout so much.
13no they wouldn't
Twilight's favorite book is...The Wonderbook.
11,01I did the ban improperly.
Shizuka: you knwo, people from the small cities could just drive tot he big cities
...U MAD?
13um no
13you vote in your precinct
13anything else is fraud
I'm wearing my shirt that has Derpy eating Pinkie Pie's tail tomorrow :3

Ponies47: But why?
BREAKIN DA LAW
DUN DUN

Increasing turnout in rural Kansas might not be as easy as flying in for a quick visit, but it's a lot cheaper to buy airtime in those markets than it is in NYC, LA, Houston, etc.
RawketLawnchair, Because I can :P
Ponies47: you should link me a picture of that shirt, it sounds cute :3
seemed right for me missed an * or something ?
Because they're really that dumb Nittany, or they been sleeping in caves...
Ponies47: I implore you to reconsider.
...Your choice.
fluttercry: No, but i watch eough politics and hear about it. Although i amy be biased I was raised at a young age by Republican parents and a Republican commmunity. So idk, maybe im just ignorant.
Obama won because Romney got cocky
going omegal
RawketLawnchair: Reconsider doind what?
At present, it's looking like the final tally is....
*doing
Wearing a silly shirt.
RawketLawnchair, I already did it today. Fucks given by other students = 0
ohh wait *@* goes first
So you think.
RawketLawnchair: It may be silly to you, but not to others.
StudMuffin, doesn't matter what party you grew up with.
Maybe i am wrong. But 2 peoeple telling me that isnt enough to change my mind
Ponies47: same :P
11,01Yeah. nick@host.
Kurra: im talking about not liking Obama
While I don't care about polictics sometimes, I had a strong heart for this beautful nation we lived in...
screw e3. I want to go to netroots next year.
yeah, and your party doesn't matter.
...And it's fond history.
whatever it is.
203 for Romney and 316 or so for Obama, assuming all polls conclude as they are now.
VenHur: Of violence
Kurra: Republican. Although i didnt really care for Romney either
CriticKitten: isnt Ohio and Flordia still voting?
See beyond parties, and I don't like Obama or Romney. And I don't even like lots of what Clinton did in his time, though he is pretty bawss and a neat thinker.
/me keeps saying Jon Huntsman over and over again.
Speaking of E3...GIMME MUH STARFOX AND F-ZERO NINTENDO, OR BITCHES BE MAD.
Ponies47: well at least you dont get constantly asked by students or sometimes teachers why you wear pony shirts
13all the polls are closed except alaska
Ohio's been called.
Well, I like ROmney and Obama in certain things
Florida's close, as is Virginia, but both are leaning for Obama
Ponies47: :D
13ohio still has early votes and absentees to work out, but romney's too far behind now
just, I look so much more at ther character....
Ponies47: :D
Nevada's leaning Obama and so is Wisconsin.
don't like parties?
Ponies47: That's not cotton candy, Derpy. :D
13he could take all the remaining states and still fail it
Ponies47: :D
Shizuka: well, im just really pissed that Obama is gonna leave my mo homeless
Yep.
*mom
13innit great
not homeless, jobless
And if the polls conclude as is, then it's pretty much established that Obama has a solid win now.
ohio is a statistical dead heat now
He might've won even more than he did against McCain....
Ponies47: Dis mah fav :3 http://www.redbubble.com/people/ak71/works/7872232-im-special
13i don't have the numbers on hand but i'm sure even if romney took ohio and virginia and florida now he still wouldn't catch up

http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83450.html donald trump throwing a fit like a child due to the election
http://www.motherearthnews.com/uploadedImages/articles/online_articles/2006-10-01/peaches2_resized400X266.jpg
Welp, Dems need 1 more seat and they're have Senate majority.
I had to complete the pseudo code part of it and had to promise that I will turn in the chart portion on thursday
When I last saw, it was 50/48. What is it now?
I guess?
13so trump was unconscious for 2000 i guess
Donald is now Dolan to me
Even though Romney won't win he still won't give up until Ohio comes in
It appears Reps will keep the House though.
romney shouldnt give up until the absentees come in
Love his reaction
13even if he manages to take ohio he's still done
"Oh no, they didn't get the guy I liked, this nation is in ruins!"
VA and FL have only gotten wider.
Everything is broken!
08,01wait, obama won?
yep
He needs 87 or 88 votes
Wasn't it obvious enough?
Sounds like the average 10 yr old cod player
Obama lost and S3 is cancelled
NOOOOO
Episode 3 will never be made
"FUK U XXX_BR0B4M4_XXX, STOP VOTE CAMPIN U NOOB"
Cya everypony
Now that Disney is uncertain about the markets, They won't purchase Hasbro.
And Gabe Newell took your lunch
Pretty sure it's already made
bye DerpyMuffins :)
latas Derpy_Hooves
bye DerpyMuffins
DerpyMuffins*
http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83450.html This is hilarious
HoodyNinja: And were Mr. Romney to have won, the vast majority of the Left-- and a fair chunk of the press-- would have reacted eactly the same.
Night, DerpyMuffins. :)
Kencolt: Exactly
13if romney won the media would have gone into shock
oh, Derpy_Hooves beat me too it :L
13as it is they're just creaming themselves that they got obama elected again
All but Fox
More than a few political students-- conservative and liberal -- agre that the Elctorial College needs re-examination.
Fox b mad
13winner take all needs to end
13but it won't
because people are dumb
Fox isn't mad. In fact, Fox is merely saying, "Looks like Obama won."
13there's states looking to get together to form a "national popular vote", where these states agree to give their electoral votes to whoever wins popular vote in aggregate
Jon Huntsman, and you should have Ross Perot'd the Green or Justice Party.
Whoa no way Shizuka!
Only Gary Johnson was on my ballot.
13or so says dad anyway, he's more willing to keep on top of politics than i am
Oh hey this discussion again
13and he's mad
Obama's going to win Virgina looks like
6th of november, always remember
Now he's over 300
What was the 6th of november? I forgot :P
Shizuka, this would be... what, collusion to gather votes among states?
Um, It's the 7th now
13yep
Shizuka: Technically, a state need not have a popular vote at all-- instead the state legislature can use anymeans it wishes to assign theelectorial vote. Up to and including dartboards. Of course, that govenment would not stay in authority very long...
it happened on the 6th
13that too
Shizuka, sounds like war.
13nebraska and maine do it right
13electors by congressional district, the two senate votes go to the popular
They tried to break up PA like that
K, well, I gotta get some sleep
Night everyone

Ahh, a sore throat, you seek tp cure. Perhaps this recipie, you can endure - boil up a cup of water - hot - throw two bulion cubes into the pot. A dash or five of black pepper, and onion too, should cure up any aches troubling you. <3

Hey :)
but see im past experation date
so my name melted
eww
Hows h
hows things?
I drawed Twi yesterday! :D
So . . . I just read the newsletter. "How To Train Your Dragon"
yay :D
I thought your name was Dolanized, twoiloight_spurnkle. :D
being a fan of the book series, the movie is disapoint
And I drew Fluttershy today! :) And they all look like they have insanley short legs...
AJIsAwesome: taht 2
AJIsAwesome: that wuz the originul reezun
also, this is my new fav button next to he inception button: http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
the*
and by that, I mean I HATE IT!! This is the 2nd movie I've seen based off a book (or book series) that I adore and completely f*cks it up.
fak teh rules
moo
. . .
*cough* Percy Jackson *cough*
:>
moo.
siddelthekiddel exactly
meow?
Lunar_Brony: They could have done so much with that book. At least they did a pretty good job with the Hunger Games.
bark im a turtle :3
I'm still real tired, been moving all day, will be continuing tomorrow.
woof I'm a duck
Meow
Baa!
neigh!
Who here would like to be a tree? :o
ah
ME!
i would love to be a tree~
tree~
actually nevermind being a tree would be boring
now i want to hear that song again
Guys. Altair or Ezio?
:
:3
you would just sit there doing nothing
siddelthekiddel "The Hunger Games" was . . . /decent/. I don't like how they treat the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. In the book, she clearly states she doesn't really love him. In the movie, I didn't get that message. And don't even get me started on Katniss herself...
ezio for the most part
Neither, Pinkie Pie.
im gonna go to bed, night
Lunar_Brony: how do you feel about Eragon? :P
Lunar_Brony: Well, they always have that issue. The Hunger Games gave you the view through Katniss herself, and she never really said out loud that she didn't love Peeta. One thing that will complicate things is how she got the Mockingjay pin...it was a LOT different in the book.
thelonepony: I personally prefer Ezio, never played AC I, but Altair just...LOOKS boring-er?
weeping_pegasi82 never read the book, forgot everything about the movie.
bah
siddelthekiddel:
oops
what was that ghost command again?
Lunar_Brony: well don't it's all travelling and the movie ugh the movie
/ns username password
oops
same, was just checking in, night
I mean /ns ghost username password
tnx
there we go
sefadsf
...
no Blueblood is :3
siddelthekiddel Katniss doesn't display her emotions very well in the movie. I remember watching the trailer; specifcally the reaping. Katniss . . . ugh, it makes me cringe just thinking about that scene.
No crackle is :V
weeping_pegasi82 I never planned on it, so yeah :p
No, Spike is Bestpony
Crackle
moo
Tom.
moo?
Moo.
08,01bitch, please
Lunar_Brony: Yeah...I'm really curious how they are gonna play it out when they make Catching Fire. A lot of things they didn't add in the first movie will kick them in the head. Although, I have to say that Jennifer Lawrence is a better Katniss than a Jennifer Lawrence... :3
08,01discord is best pony
Discord is Notpony
Discords more of a pony than spike is.
well he's part pony
xD
08,01\o/
But Spike is Bestpony, I didn't say anything about spike /being/ a pony
You have to be a pony to be the best pony.
:3
siddelthekiddel hehe, dat true man. I hope they also solve the camera shake problem. It's difficult to focus on a single scene because the camera's bobbing everywhere.
siddelthekiddel: i'm a pony :3
Yest, to be the best pony you need to be a pony. But to be Bestpony you have to be Spike.
<see :3
I see what you did thar.
Lunar_Brony: Yeah. I still loved the movie, just not from a skeptical point of view. Part of me wanted to kill the directors for not adding Madge. xD And the other part wanted to chill and enjoy a movie.
NewSuperBronyU herro
KILL YOU FAMLY
goddamn
Wat
dat stream XD
Kill your family :3
Do I hear stream? .-.
yes master
Dafuq...?

It's the KILL YOUR FAMILY show! I love this one!
where's my knife :3

thelonepony: sorry i had to borw it

damn it :I
eww no D:

11,02JRP2234: hai :)
He does love that show :3
thelonepony: moo
Bark
How are the streams on bronystate? I'm new here.
:3
siddelthekiddel stand alone, the movie is pretty good. It is very rare for me to find a movie based off a book in which I liked the movies more . . . except LOTR. J.R. Tolkein wrote the damn books in blocks that go on and on and on and on.. that make it impossible for me to read the stupid book.
08,01?/?
stream!
Much lag on them?
:>
Lunar_Brony: So true! Lol. But yeah, they are gonna kick themselves for some of the things they didn't add.
what's this?
moo
08,01i am streaming some more Journeyman
ah
08,01because Journeyman is awesome
Yay :3
I don't get the Hub on campus and am trying figure out where/when I am going to watch
Basically I'm trying to figure out if I'm watching on youtube two hours after the show on saturday or watching the stream here
Brony Movie night
I don't get the hub luckily I have bronystate
^
we stream 1 A movie and 1 B movie
ok then chees
when i mean we i mean the mod
find mo mo
Does the show get streamed while its airing?
what show?
That's what I'm curious about
08,01thelonepony: come watch it here!
08,01it'll be awesome
Press X to Dad
MLP on saturday
yes sumi always stream episodes in the morning
As per usual . . .
Lunar_Brony: KABOOM
I'm thinking of gathering a few people from different floors in my dorm and/or a few people from different dorms to watch
Lunar-geeky-gaming why did you type out an onomatopoeia?
Lunar_Brony: a what
that will be a kickstarter for season 3
Lunar-geeky-gaming -_(\ sound word: ie buzz, flash, KABOOM
TOTAL OBAMANATION
Lunar_Brony: ah
The Hub really should stream ponies live with comercials the morning it airs - they would get more ad revenue that way =P
Lunar_Brony: looks like youll be needing an alarm clock like this: http://conmedisys.com/img/e0/e0f/World_s_Loudest_Alarm_Clock_.jpg
I'll probably stop in some time tomorrow to ask more questions
have fun tonight
did you hear obama won the election againts McCain's?
Lunar_Brony: :D
what's on stream ?
My alarm clock plays the super mario bros theme XD
Anyway, have fun
Gah, thanks youtube! I was just about to watch a commentary and the some clips just HAPPENED to just pop up on an ad. Even Youtube isn't safe from spoilers. :I
AJIsAwesome ad block
*clips from S3
AJIsAwesome: that sucks :I
thats why i havent been on youtube when S3 was announce :P
+1 for Adblock Plus

so many people in this chat and allmost no one is talking

jup
i miss the times when trolls actually tryied to do something and didn't think that insulting evryone was trolling
^
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, be the change that you seek
i hate the people who think that's someone faills at trolling while the're not trolling
Lighthearted, harmless trolling all in good fun.
That was a lot of lunch.
oke i will troll
good
from now on
Linux, then what were you trying to do then?
Yeah you aren't trolling, what you're doing is being two ignortant dumb retards who can't even signify the difference from a peanut and a brain.
You obviously aren't going to go far in life, so go sit in the corner and assess your life.
we're not trolling, just insulting
Even if you can do that.
Linux is right he is not even trolling
Your insults are pathetic and wortless, they're words.
also Linux you are the best operating system ever
The only people you are making angry or annoyed are the people who need to get a grip of the concept of the internet.
Jmo concept ? internet ? what you talking about ?
If you're going to get butthurt over someone saying something to you, you obviously need to toughen up.
They're just words.
Jmo: im hurtin u with werds go cry lel
and i'm just bored
You're a bored child who thinks you're getting entertainment over insulting people over the internet. Congratulations, your intelligence really shines.
i know thanks
XAX pls, go 2 bed u kiwi

ROboGerbil Yeah because it's so sh#t. God Pokemon SUCKS nowadays!
arent there over 1k pokemans now?
How long did it take for you to realise that?
I spent 60 dollers on that! Sixty bloody dollers! The reviews said it was good. Why did you lie critics?
Hey guys i love to stay up with yall a little bit more but i got to hit the hey myself so a see yall and talked to yall in the morning aight.........night guys
First mistake, believing critics.
00,02i have a gb color, pokemon red and 2 copies of pokemon blue
Shove money in their mouths and they'll sing any song you want.
lol it might be good if youre a lobotomized 8 yr old
I bought it out of nostalgia! WHAT HAPENED TO YOU POKEMON!
TheRandomkid321: nintendo took it over?
00,02RoboGerbil, they added pokemon
00,02and then added some more
00,02and more
aww yeah my backhanded comment about nintendo
00,02and i think you can see where this is going
Maybe they'll add more pokemon in the next one.
Just a hunch.
pfft
lies
TheRandomkid321 dis happend basicly http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj359Gi4y7c
Phase4 see same vid
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, on that note, the black and white legendaries, what are they?
Black and white.
dunno
cwatididthar.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a bit of large trout
Oi
Phase4: ones named whocares and the others whoplaysthiscrap
If only the pokemon fanboys were around.
God I hold in my hand the very game that should BE RETURNED TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL OF WHICH IT CAME!!!!!!!
/me throws a muffin at TheRandomkid321
ADAM! TYOU SAID THIS GAME WAS GOOD! DID YOU NOT!?
never say no to muffin
No, Gold Demona said that TheRandomkid321
Oh
BerryPunch, go home, you're drunk.
00,02BerryPunch, now stop drinking :<
00,02you have important job here
I said I stopped playing Pokemon at Ruby/Saphire.
She kicked 6 people before due to being drunk.
I thought the gen 5 legendary was Metal and nature
just 6?
One after another.
or something about technology
DAMN THIS GODFORSAKEN GAME! I'VE SEEN 10 DOLLAR GAMES BOUGHT AT DISCOUNT STORES BETTER THAN YOU!
Phase4 i won i won
umadbro?
So Obama is el presidente?
Correcto.
Coolio
When's the elction?
>_>
TheRandomkid321, it's over
VERMIN SUPREME WON RIGHT :(
00,02http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Reshiram_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29
00,02huh
Indeed the Obama part is a cover up
00,02appears that its just a dragon
00,02http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zekrom_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29
00,02this one too
DNA Splicers? What the fuck?
I should bury this game... then burn it...
Phase4 zekrom and its counterpart Reshiram are based on the concept of yin and yang- wikipedia
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, so... they're just dragons except theres two of them
it seems like it
Phase4: there's the two mandatory dragons, a fusion of them, three (really four) elemental deer things, a pyrokinectic ferret, a sreel caterpillar thing, three wind gods
I should have saved my money instead of buying this game... where's Gold_Demona I want to have a talk with 'er!
You can't blame others for your mistakes.
*steel
You made the decision yourself.
Jmo My decision was based on Gold_Demonas opiniion.
still your fault
That is your fault.
00,02perhaps if they had stopped increasing the number of legendaries per generation
So, how come the bronystate site still doesn't define A movie and B movie in an objective way, so as to remove the arguements on whether the picks are or arent?
00,02could have been reasonable til the 6th
Phase4: aye, they seem to break the game :D
So, don't you dare even try going and blaming it on her for your own mistake.
00,02EspyLacopa, how do you define that objectively
I thought I heard something about basing it off RottenTomatoes.
Phase4: I liked though that you can't import Pokemons until you complete the storyline of the game
EspyLacopa, pfft, t'is only BrownieStaet tradition for one to get their movie lottery vote rejected at least once in one's lifetime.
Fine... Jmo you have a point... only one man can get rid of this god forsaken thing for me... but I owe him money...
Quit being down over a game as well.
next time try a game instead of blindly beliving in opinions and reviews
This is not just a game. It's the worst game i've ever seen... and it's POKEMON!
/me has seen worse.
yes yes i get it you miss the old ones like the most
Quit your complaining and go kick a ball outside already. Jeez.
It's 9:30 pm
or finish your game and then sell it
Oh. That's right. You're an Australian as well.
Sell it? Why do you think i'm so cruel as to pass this onto another human being?
Think this network is ready for the premiere this saturday?
It has been made to be reay.
sell it to the game store for credit ?
Tech-heads were working on it around the clock.
/me tugs on Phase4, may you do the honours?

Good morning Bronystate
If MLP season 3 wasn't enough
My mac is in the shop and is being fixed. :3
Yey
How much did it cost?
Good morning Gold_Demona
hey gold_Demona
Jmo: The repair is estimated at about 170, which is way better than I was expecting.
>____>
I wouldn't even
Jmo: Apparently the graphic chip went bad
Blocks placed: 66188
Blocks broken: 52341
Ah
Makes sense
It went splodey and decided it don't work no more
So mac store will put in new one for me. And reinstall OSX in the process because I asked them to.
Fairo.
Glad you're getting it fixed.
Me too! I like having a second computer. ^^
00,02ohai Gold_Demona

but yeah BACKGROUND PONY 18,19,20 SOOOOOOON AWWW SHIT I'M HYPE
Hiyo Phase4 =D
doesn't see the *
AdamTheDuck: I can be in the chat on one computer and play a game on the other
Adam, you can't see anything.

00,02Gold_Demona, steam for linux beta
00,02is out
24x Xeon Cores • 96 GB of DDR3 RAM • 6x OCZ Agility 3 SSD's • 2x 1TB SAS Disks for Backups
Phase4: I don't know how to linux. o_o
00,02i have (via bug, didnt actually get beta access)
00,02is good, smoother than on windows
goodbye bronystate
Bye trollhunter
Yeah, but don't you need to know hacking stuff to do anything in linux?
Or am I thinking of unix?
I'd love to see comparison charts before believing that.
00,02Gold_Demona, not really, ubuntu is easier to install (and imho use) than windows
00,02don't need to know any more than on windows
I don't mean the installation. I mean actually using it
Strong bold on IMHO
Phase4 24x Xeon Cores • 96 GB of DDR3 RAM • 6x OCZ Agility 3 SSD's • 2x 1TB SAS Disks for Backups is this good andrew?
00,02JRP2234, uh... that is a compute server, not sure what you'd need that for
Thing is I like being able to see the stream AND the chat and still be able to play full screen games.
Before anyone thinks it, I'm not hating on linux.
Also skype
And internet
Gold_Demona, just get two monitors and then play the game in borderless windowed mode
I use PC for games, and I use mac for everything else
AdamTheDuck: Not all games have that tho
Adam, shh. personal preference.
00,02Gold_Demona, multiple desktops make that kind of multitasking trivial
Gold_Demona, http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769
^ that's what I use .-.
AdamTheDuck: Not all my games are on steam
AdamTheDuck: I have games that are older than steam
Phase4 make me a midi driver that i can use sounds fonts with
Can't Dema just do stuff the way she likes it :<
Gold_Demona, it will still work unless the game can't run in windowed mode.
00,02JRP2234, uh, theres several already
AdamTheDuck: Some of them can't.
Will you stink Phase4 :P
doom hates it
Well*
^
^^
Phase4 how tall are u?>
00,02JRP2234, no idea
00,02Gold_Demona, hopefully wine gets a few more developers, lots of older games actually work better under wine than new windows
At any rate, this is the system that has worked for me.
Fair enough Gold_Demona :P
You got proof for that Phase? >.>
00,02Jmo, red alert 2, deus ex
Not proof like that .-.
00,02former has performance problems, theres a project that ported the wine dll to windows
It's especially useful when I'm playing games like SWTOR which eat up a LOT of memory. So multitasking is almost impossible on my PC when I play it.
00,02works fine under wine, the latter crashes
00,02on windows i meen

Bronysith, please
It needs to be deep fried
darker than the night sky, hotter and more bitter than the depths of hell, THAT is coffee
then covered in a layer of salt.
i just like egg and toast is enought for me
AdamTheDuck: not necessary if there is gravy
Deep fry the gravy .-.
then smother the deep fried gravy with more gravy.
I seen someone actaully make friend cola
^ wat
What is this I don't even
fried*
if available, I digg a Bun or a Cosseount with lot of Nutella
fried cola.
friend cola?
weird..
lol
i thought only lovers and friends with benefit make "friend cola"
lol
and now i watch gaogaigar before going to class
on the way ill pick up a coffee of some sort
whatever canadian
Australian. .-.
And no, I don't usually pour gravy over everything I eat.

fuck that shit
delicious friend cola
now
with flavor
and when i say flavor, i mean grenadine
and when i say grenadine
i mean blood
I agree with you on coffee
except
it must also be as bitter as a lost love
wait shit, you got that part
hotter
and bitter
like the depths of hell
Yeah
THAT is coffee
um...
same with tea
hot
I like my coffee with LOTS of sugar and LOTS of cream. ^^
no sugar
food so many food o3o
Gold_Demona: but you are already sweet enough
Lots and lots and lots of sugar
I drink tea with milk and sugar
fuck that
Coffee black
and only black
I can't stand black coffee. >__>
sometimes with a little sugar
i just heat up water in the microwave for 1 minute, get my tea and then enjoy
I HAVE to have milk and sugar in it
oh fuck no
/me has to try black coffee some day >.<
I use a kettle for me tea
^
No stream correct? :I
^^
Heretic.
Ponies47, no stream. :/
Correct Ponies47
Ponies47, go to school.
Ah. Well then have some laughs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar08QK8cJ2I&feature=g-all-c :P
Hanako: I drink my tea with no milk or sugar, if that makes me any better. :P
i dont have a tea kettle ;__;
Does that save me?
Ew.
Bronysith: I don't have a tea kettle either. I use a colombian kettle. :D
Gold_Demona: Oh, that wasn't directed at you
Gold_Demona: i like my tea bitter with a sweet treat on the side
oh lol
That's just the way my family makes tea
Bronysith: Although, I haven't yet had any of the teas that usually get milk and sugar added to them. :D
Jmo, I don't have to be at school until 10:00 this week. Sophomores are taking some special testing this week :P
Only green tea, some fruit teas, and some herbals.
i dont see why people put milk with tea
i just drink black tea
sugar and milk, use a proper kettle, a big mug (not a tiny little teacup)
MOTHERFUCKER
Saucers are acceptable but not needed at all
i prefer my tea in a little cup, more concentrated flavor
saucer or coaster so i dont spill on my wooden table
Oh, we just use more tea
it's still quite strong
I don't get what the difference is between using an open top kettle and a proper tea kettle. The tea making happens in the mug when I make tea. =/
There isn't one, it's tradition
ZONDER
/me Doesn't like tea
Also
I prefer coffee myself, but the teas I drink are better for me.
Ponies47: out
The boiling itself is a part of enjoying the tea
Bronysith, You first ^^
I like using my colombian kettle. :3
chicken fried steak, eggs, buttery biscuit, smothered in gravy
that is a good breakfast
right now my jacket smells like sausage...
I LOVE IT
Everyone around here drinks their coffee with all this creamer shit in it
disgusting
Hanako: ikr
if i wanted a sweet coffee, id get a frappucino at star bucks
Also, sausage gravy and biscuits
i cant drink sweet hot stuff...except hot chocolate
Hanako: /)
(\
at this one hotel, the buffet
my god the buffet, i had like 13 strips of bacon, eggs, biscuit and all covered in deliciuos gravy
in one sitting
Oh, I can't eat much
honestly though Sausage patties>bacon
but I always eat well to make up for it
Yeah, sausage is way better
im a 6,5 motherfucker
i need my fill
and i have to drink like double the normal amount of water in a day as everyone else
so i dont dehydrate
/me 5'5, usually 115lbs at the most
i weigh 180
Hanako: you tiny
everyone tiny
/me nods
All this talk of good food and I'm sick :\
Hanako: eat something uber spicy then
can't even have any ;-;
Can't be done, spiciest thing in the house is my personal bottle of Tobasco
I'm about to have softboiled eggs and toast
hard boiled eggs better
^
and then sunny side up kicks all those asses
with salt
no salt
Bronysith: I prefer softboiled eggs for breakfast. Hardboiled are best as snacks
ranch or super spicy wing sauce
Gold_Demona: healthy snack, as it has the same effect as celery
sunny side up with salt, pepper, and a slice of bread
Scrambled with baught but tobasco
Bronysith: It has negative calories?
*naught
i dont like toast
Gold_Demona: yea
Not toast
bread
i dont like just plain bread
to wipe up the yolk :3
i just lick it up
I like to dip my toast in the softboiled eggs. :3
you know, HOW you are supposed to clean yolk
by licking it off the plate
By eating it
It's the best part
I use my spoon to scrape up the yoke myself. When I have no more toast.
i dont like toast for breakfast
...
unless its french toast or texas toast
/me *really* wants some eggs now
You're weird, Bronysith. :P
or stuffed french toast with strawberries
/me concurs with Bronysith
As far as breakfast goes, my favorites are softboiled eggs and over easy.
over easy is cool too
Favorite types of eggs
scrambled is decent
that goes best with gravy really
I like hardboiled eggs as a snack, but not as breakfast.
Not really a fan of hard yoke. =/
I only like scrambled with something else or tobasco
Scrambled comes a close second on the favorites
It's just meh on its own
ZONDER
I make my scrambled eggs with a little bit of milk to make them super fluffy. :3
Time to hit the hay.
Goodnight everyone. :)

i think i like it better than Gurren Lagann
Oh, good on you
are yall excited for season 3 of MLP?
>better than gurren lagann
...
/me alllows it.
flamewingdiablo15: why? so i can be disapointed ?
*allows
Yeah, don't care about S3 at all
if it's decent, okay
flamewingdiablo15: every brony ever is somewhat excited for S3, except me, cause disapointed
if it's not, meh
seriously, with that disapointing finale
I stopped caring some times after the S2 opening episodes
*time
I'm looking forward to it, but I can't really say I'm excited.
the only reason people like the season 2 finale is because This day aria and fight scene
other than that it is your average disney story line...and mediocre at that
well im lookin forward to it too but alot of other bronies say their excited for it
DAMMIT, I forgot to set the timer! T^T
I don't know how long I've been boiling these things! ><
You mean This Spaghetti Aria?
seriously, that fight scene in s2 finale was completely pointless
"only i can open the vault where the elements are stored...you must go there without me"
/)_=
even if they made it there, they wouldnt have been able to open it
sorry if this changes conversations but whose your fav pony on the show
i friggin hate supposed to lose battles in RPGs so thats why i hate that fight scene
It's a children's show Bronysith. Plot holes abound.
Hello everypony
Gold_Demona: im a writer, i hate plotholes so much and i neeeeed consistency
"consuming your love has made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "o you trying to get power with love? yea that wont work" /)_=
thank you, worst villain ever
well i am off to college, see you guys later
bye
later bronysith
That's another one who complains too much
Who?
Bronysith
Oh there's alot I could say about him.
Which is why it's always "fun" when he and randomkid are in here at the same time.
:P
I'm nota happy dema now...
Aww, why? :<
Cuz I ruined my eggs due to lack of timer and having NOT looked at the time when I put the eggs in to boil. T^T
Ahh.
They didn't cook long enough...
tsk tsk.
I HATE making mistakes like that
Silly dema :P
It really upsets me. T^T
I mean seriously.
I blame browniestate :P
T^T
And I don't have enough eggs to try again...
D:
Need enough eggs to make my husband's breakfast the rest of the week.
Poor dema.
So now I'm left with two pieces of toast and nothing to eat them with. :<
[first world problems]
Indeed.
feels good watching boondocks episodes...
The only other breakfast food I have is cereal...
can't wait for the new Megasxlr
What type of cereal?
honey nut cheerios
Interesting >.>
I like it, but it wasn't what I wanted... And it's not a proper companion for toast...
[spoiled brat first world problems]
O U Dema.
I'll just eat the damn toast and have cereal when I'm done.
Gruumpy demaaa~
And probably by lunchtime I'll get over it. :P
You will indeed.
:O Gold_Demona! *hugs*
ohai MadSurge
You best not eat that toast
I hate you chav.
DashWithRainbows: Why not? O-o
That jus
Joomay: Good :3
Wrong, written all over.
Gold_Demona: so I met some chick named Cynthia. Didn't like the fact I could back off from her challenge. Is she a bonus boss or something? *still a noob*
Pokemon?
Aye
Gen 4 champion
Wut
Basically you can fight her during spring.
WUT
MadSurge: Cynthia is a bonus boss. She was the champion of Gen 4
She was the champion in Diamond, Pearl and Platinum.
Which is gen 4
o.o
I go afk and return to pokemon.
What have I done to deserve this cruel fate.
Cynthia is the SCARIEST of all the champions
In B2/W2, she has level 75+ pokemon.
I blame the Garchomp
And they have a previous final boss run at you like any other person without any "watch out, champion abound" signs?
Not really, she asks if you want to fight
She dresses sexy.
you have the option to fight her.
DashWithRainbows: yeah, which is why I backed off immediately
You should
Her team is quite powerful.
Sounds like chavo got his ass whooped something chronic.
:>
If they give me the choice, I'm sure I shouldn't mess with her
Hello Everypony! :)
No stream?
Joomay Nope, I had my Latios.
It kicks ass.
I'm here
lol latios
you queer chav.
Pfft
Don't care.
Still a good pokemon.
DashWithRainbows: Every pokemon kicks ass
Same goes for Gardevoir.
Rather roll with Groudon.
That's some serious shit there.
Kyogre is better.
:>
Bull.
Special ability makes it rain, give it Water spout
it will own
i say raquaza is better then kyogre
Kyogre and Rayquaza is gay.
Rayquaza?
Meet Sheer cold
get owned.
Mate, you wanna start?
They need to make a pokemon game where all the regions are connected
DashWithRainbows: sheercold can fail alot DashWithRainbows
Not for me.
Ye pokemon is a slag chavo.
:>
I get it almost every time.
Same
i use mudkip alot thats why hes lvl 100
lolol^
Pfft, water type starter
not a challenge
no one say it
Grass is a challenge.
I HERD U LIK MUDKIPZ
Sup.
Thats it im going to go replay fire red
pfff Fire starter is more challenging
my rayquaza is only 88 and my kyogre is only 57
DashWithRainbows: I started with Snivy :)
Good boy.
I always go grass type starter
MadSurge: Because hes obviously the coolest
DashWithRainbows: In my eyes the quick stat was the best stat at the beginning
Ew 5th gen.
you took the easy path ashie
Oi
You don't call me that.
Anyway gotta get my brother, see you in 10 minutes
See ya Surge.
later
See ya later MadSurge
DashWithRainbows: don't ignore the word of girth
wow
im gonna go play some TF2 later everyone good talkin to yall
YEEEEE DED.
/me slaps DashWithRainbows
Ye mom is a slag.
no one slaps each other thats weak i say punch other people. your listenin to a kickboxer

Boy, I would go to down on correcting that message, flamewingdiablo15.

Joomay
Gimme pilles.
Wat?
Pilles?

Are you Louis all of a sudden?
...
Yes.
Give me pills so I can hate you more.
So if I don't give you pills, you will show a 0.001% of non-hate.
Nah, I'll still forever hate you
I just want more reasons to do so
Oh well, no big loss.

/me i'm ''meh'' with him anyway, though i don't hate him----
I am surprised of the turn out really
I wonder how big the chat exploded last night when the results were put up...
I remember where I was when Obama hit 275
Personally I don't really care for either of them :I
and I respect your opinion
I don't like people who don't like gay and think women should stay in the kitchen :|
@ MadSurge omg you just made me think of that Batman Beyond clip
Squallken: :O ?
...wat
there is a clip from Batman Beyond, that is brought up as a joke, its basically this guy saying "get back in the kichen" and it use as a joke in some amvs
Squallken: ahhh

Heya MLP_Brovakiin , CountDoofus , BladedWings :)

Oh hi MaxTheBrony. :)
Howdy, strangers.

/me come at me
/me hugs Barb|DontHugMeBro
/me melts
whoops
well i didnt say anything SafariMonkey but hi!:) .. i was just hiding in chat
Mmmm UCK
:/ sorry Master-Derps
sorry for what?
just a tab fail?
CountDoofus: I wonder if all kids are like that after "the talk"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR8cI4HHUvQ
xD
:)
"Silly Face Maker"
Ohai MaxTheBrony!
Heya MadSurge !
No some people don't like to be greeted until they talk I think Master-Derps.
I imagine most will be either embarassed or going "Eeewww!"
What count?
MaxTheBrony: what MadSurge said about my comic.
May i see it :)
SafariMonkey: that me :) well i dont mind it but most of the time when im not saying anything im playing games
thats#
CountDoofus: I dunno, as far as I recollect I was pretty okay about it. My parents never tried to cover it up with the stork or cabbage patch stories
I never had the talk
I didn't realize people actually did have the talk
Well sorry Master-Derps.
Ah
Heya Vivix :)
Hiya max
again SafariMonkey nothing wrong
In Sweden we dont do the "talk"
:)
/me rolls back into the list of names
:p
Same here MaxTheBrony - guess it's our scandinavian nature
MadSurge: I had to rely on school sex ed. Never heard it from my parents.
I remember we had sex ed once, with an old priest showing us how to put on condoms on chair legs
and then we all got free condoms with strawberry taste
Whaat
Vivix.
Heya Jmo :)
yeep--strawberry taste
You
just
We didnt get no Strawberry tast :<
Why would you taste a condom.
well, we were what--14=
SO? >_>
so we took em ou and threw them at eachother
O.o
everything smelled like strawberries, and it said "Strawberry taste!" on the pack
So full of excuses you are Vivix.
haha
I'm sure.
Um....
My sister's school had chocolate, blueberrry, strawberry, vanilla, all sorts.
CountDoofus: O_o Well, my parents also got me an illustrated book for ten years old about babies and sex :D It was done pretty well
Hehe, crazy schools
D: Lazy school , we got rubber flavor
awww
:s
I wonder if taste-condoms are nice-
Dodging this convo egh
haha
Vivix: lolwut
Only one way to find out
Weell- you know-
haha
yep~~
Why is the chat talking about condoms? What?
._.
sex-ed class talk
Someone was talking about sex ed or something
i came back to that as well lol
Same
:P
We are talking about the birds and the bees
wooo
I never got that saying, it promotes interspecies sex
O.o
Yeah i dont get it either
why is it Birds and bees?
Wut
Google will most likely explain
bees and the flowers would make sense I guess- but birds?
"According to tradition, the birds and the bees is a metaphorical story sometimes told to children in an attempt to explain the mechanics and good consequences of sexual intercourse through reference to easily observed natural events. For instance, bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain example of male fertilisation. Another example, birds lay eggs, a similarly visible and easy-to-explain example of female ovulation."
:o
O.o
Revelation :O
Also: Cole Porter might have coined the phrase-
and here I thought it was cause mt Beedrill could mate withe my pidgey :/
Lawl
Hehe
Jmo: Help me out :P Give me something i can Improve or add to this picture ^^
Saw that.
Back legs could be fixed abit, they look abit too skinny.
right
huh, when people post art in main chat I have a tendency to assume it's not going to be good
and what is a tail bro.
wat.
And for once it was wrong
:D
MaxTheBrony it instantly made me think of pokemon.
^
MaxTheBrony it's very good. ;)
SafariMonkey: Im pretty sure i made it look like somthing unintentionaly
:P
Like a pokemon *
As if you did.
Frekin Pokemon
So , a tail and wider back legs?
Jmo not a pokemon fan? :P
Pokemon lost my grip after Gen 3.
same
What program do you use, MaxTheBrony?
Jmo: Same
I use Sai Painttool
Better be SAI or I'll hurt you Max.
Good boy.
:P
Im still learning SAI
Me too
Just got it a few days ago
its a fun program :) and very easy to use
Jmo I still only play up to emerald. :P
Its a hard adaption from PSE tho
Meh Emerald.
Ruby/Sapphire was the last for me, Emerald didn't grip either.
RaveBrony: Yeah i can understand that :)
Emerald was my favorite! :$
egh Rayquaza
Love that pokemon
Jmo I see. Well I got emerald before ruby or sapphire
I liked the way "I" pronouced it....rather than the show/movie
As if.
RaveBrony how did you pronounce it?
I pronounced it rye-KWA-za
Rahquahza
Not that damn Ray-Quay-za
Ray like light ray?
Yeah
Is that how they said it? Ugh
I think thas how i heard it, cant really watch any of the movies now :D
RaveBrony so you said it the same as me. :P
Yeah :D
Hey Everlasting_Joy

ohai Everlasting_Joy
Howdy BladedWings!
Ohai Everlasting_Joy
Nice to see you. :)
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Gameloft Facebook Page Teases a Release Today
Howdy SafariMonkey!
JUST RELEASE IT ALREADY.
GOD DAMN.
So, only 3 days till S3!
Yep Everlasting_Joy
Everlasting_Joy: IKR :$
At first, I wasn't as enthused as I should be, now I'm gitty with joy for it (no pun)!
Everlasting_Joy: the poniless drought is about to end <3
BTW is it worth watching a rerun on here? (I'll miss the first ep airtime)
If so, whem?
SafariMonkey: I think after European Movie Night?
^
MadSurge that's a bit late for me. :/
SafariMonkey: Awww :(
MadSurge I'm UK
So it'll be after midnight at least probably
I wish it aired another time. :(
Oh well
SafariMonkey: I know what you mean.
I don't mean this in a sarcastic tone, I do enjoy sleeping in and than watching the show at a latter time.
Everlasting_Joy it's 3pm for me.
;)
*:)
I know.
Thanks to Wre-k, I have a very good knowledge with European time zones.
Everlasting_Joy I see. It also helps that tom gives time in utc
^
Is UTC the same as GMT?
whats the CET on the new pony epi?
CET?
Centra Europian Time
It's the standard, and it's based on GMT dari
GMT is the standard though
Haio Everlasting_Joy
Howdy CountDoofus!
no dari
But GMT is standard here
How are you CountDoofus?
UTC 0 = GMT 0 + leap second
there's been 37 leap seconds since the creation of UTC
UTC = Ísland time
UTC is universal time coordinated
All's good, Everlasting_Joy. Got a new comic up :) But my friend wants to do a commentary on the new episode MLP, and we're not at home when it airs, so I have to wait a few days after the next season begins :'(
who here went to EQLA? just curious
UTC is atomic time, GMT is normal time, so- for us who look at our clocks, they're the same
how was the convention? heard it was fun and went without a hitch
CountDoofus: :(
Interesting fact, UTC was a compromise between the french TUC and the english CUT
SafariMonkey: I was just about to say it
And it's currently the SLI isn't it?
or..SI
whatever it's called
Well UTC is still pointless for telling the time.
since it's effectively the same as GMT, yeah
SI Vivix
Maybe it's something they use for satellite geolocation which needs an accurate time or something
But it's pointless for the rest of us
I think that's the case yeah, with the leapseconds and such, but ultimately,--for us it's just GMT
Actually atomic time is TAI, not UTC
UTC is not the atomic clock but molecule or atomic time measurement-
Well I don't know anyone here who uses UTC
I read up on it on wiki a week or so ago, but I can't remember
!cd does
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 2 days, 21 hours, 57 minutes, 56 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
woops-
I've never heard it before people on the internet started using it
my computer does- but I personally say and use GMT
I'd*
/me is a GMT fan
don't like CET--PDT DST--all those, easier with just GMT and UTC
Vivix, TAI is the averaged time of 200 ish atomic clocks around the world, TAI differs from UTC by something like 35 seconds
Aah
Mmmm. Copypasta
That's how it is yeah, it's an SI standard, so it's supposed to be universal
just like metric
Well by 'here' I meant UK
OK gotta go
Bye guys
bye SafariMonkey
Cya
baibai
Take care SafariMonkey!
Take care SafariMonkey :)
I guess big countries might like using timezones to announce their shows, or internet
Yeah bye. :)
but like most european countries have one timezone- so -I mean, I've never heard anyone say a timezone in person
like totally ever yo
/me inb4 nor'easter messes with the premiere showing
I'm expecting John de Lancie's return as VA more than the season opening. Buck me right ? :p

Does anyone read the topic anymore?

^
It's only like that around roads

11,02Lil_B: Most of it, yesh :3
moo to you too SB
three months of winter coolness
NewSuperBronyU despite the fact that it was Iwata calling Raggie, it still sounded like Iwata was really annoyed by Reggie xD like he would say "Fine, shut up now!" any second :)

11,02But the food we stored is running out and we can't grow in this cold

You're tearing me apart, Lisa!
hi RainbowAsh
Yay, grouphug.
Lisa is a executioner
I have no idea what that is from, but hours of CaptainSparklez has imbedded that in my head AJIsAwesome
Hi Invi
she tears people apart by tying them to four horses
Vivix, you have issues.
Vivix: The Room. :D
/me hugs RainbowAsh
;__;
That's a movie, right?
<.<

/me hugs Lil_B back, and Invi for good measure
Yep. :)

AJIsAwesome dont you mean eayup
HUYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
rainbowcrash1357911: i do that a lot irl now lol
rainbowcrash1357911: Eenope. :3
Song 2 was my first taste of hte 90s, ona gold-coloured motorcross VHS I found in my dads tape collection when I was a kid
does anyone know why a fire alarm might go off with 1 beep every 38-40 seconds? i think my neighbors are hiding something
Vivix, have a link? ^^
twoiloight_spurnkle, battery is low
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk
shes the t to the w i
RainbowAsh: hm ok, thats what they said, i just doesnt make sense to me how they could sleep under that, cuz i couldnt, and i live next door, and they told me they didnt hear it... but yeah, thanks :P
Vivix, GEMA censors it O.O
waat
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=936oRZXcAsw unlicensed upload
l i g h t
y a g a m i ?
Song 2 has--great bass distortion, I want an old Rat pedal
d a m n , t y p i n g w i t h s p a c e s i s l i k e c a p s
twoiloight_spurnkle, did they at least turn it off after you told them?
rainbowcrash1357911 have you heard of tara's other characters' songs?
hey everypony :)
twoiloight_spurnkle, atleastittakessomeeffort
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
now rainbow my dear i can not express my delight
Vivix, oooh dat song :d
Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
wow i just got my dog back from the groomers and wow... they did a really good job
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/04a6258b3d8fc6520700218c0c483eea.gif AAAAAAAAAA I WANT TO DO THAT ;~;
Hehe yeah Invi, it's used in soo many things
RainbowAsh: they said theyd replace it, which again doesnt make sense becuase i dont understand why they didnt turn it off weeks ago, i even offered a battery. it doesnt make sense to me, id think theyre hiding something, but i cant think of what. that or theyre insanely stupid
Vivix, ikr?
:O
Shizu stream!
STREAM
oh my shizu stream ^_^
the stream is on!
Shizuka: <-< You too my image I gave to you!
suddenly a wild stream appears
a wild stream has appeared
:o
Hello Shizuka! :$
qube?
ohai pony pepple
took*
Hai Shizuka :)
lol a shizu stream is what it took to get AttackWithHugs to talk :D
Heya TheMightyIsh :)
Ooooh Qube....
QUBE?
hoi Shizuka and TheMightyIsh
shut up BladedWings, i'm mining
It's like the vault dwellers crawled out into the real world for the first time and going crazy over the sun.
hi shizuka
Hai TheMightyIsh :3
twoiloight_spurnkle, that does sound strange, but I just don't know what else it could even be. Any theories?
AttackWithHugs: i thought so *nuzzle* have fun then ^_^
That moment when you're looking at a website in complete silence, and suddenly a stream springs to life and you jump out of your seat at the sudden noise.
what is this?
People don't like to accept things from nosy neighbours, and things go beep when low on battery
Shizuka used hypnotize. it was super effective.
Mineshaft search COMPLETE
nothing like these nice Grinding noises when I put in a old CD... when I have to question if I should put on a gas mask when I open it again
TheMightyIsh: from what i understand, QUBE
What game is this? All I can think of is PN-03
you never hurd of qube?
nope
^
RainbowAsh: yeah i have no idea either, especially because of the 1 beep, instead going off like smoke. i dunno, maybe they broke it or something. i thought maybe smoke detectors sense weed or something, but that doesnt make much sense plus the 1 beep
Lil_B, why? have you burned a CD? ^^
wat game is this?
rainbowcrash1357911, oh, okay. So this is Qube?
its reminding me of potal lol
Lil_B, remember when sometimes you'd need to put tape on cds to stop them wobbling in your drive?
yes
I see. I know PN-03 isn't First person.
moment
Invi nope, currently making an Audia Rip
So did this come before or after Portal?
this feels like portal
what's this now?
evening. who's playing?
Vivix actualkly now, I've never done that
evening Eli
no*
looks liek a cross between portal and jenga
whatever it was, it looked fun ^_^
Hai Eli :)
RainbowAsh: i certainly felt the urge to strangle them, because that goddamn beeping has kept me up for the last few weeks
Really? We had to do it to some cheap cds or cds that came with computer magazines to sotp them--rattling and grinding
Eli: Shizuka is :)
and hi Eli it be a shizu stream
still have some ancient linux distro cds full of tape
You okay, Shizu? Your wallpaper seems.....concerning.
twoiloight_spurnkle, WEEKS? Wth is wrong with them?
!CD
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 2 days, 20 hours, 20 minutes, 36 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
wohoo
so close
I can TASTE IT
/me prepares to celebrate
Vivix got a new music Project I want to finish (I have many, but most are... meh) a slow Waltz Version of this day Aria :)
Vivix, you're being locked up and not able to watch it.
gg
twoiloight_spurnkle, maybe you should tell your landlord. Or even the police.
I can taste it too
http://imgur.com/ZayfB
Jmo staap jmo u evil man
How about nooooooo
tastes like meat
Invi bought some Afri Cola to Celebrate
Lil_B, ooh nice, waltz can be really cool
no...
RainbowAsh: well, i did manage to fall asleep, but it took a while, i had to turn on my fan to somewhat block out the beeping, though it didnt help much. but yeah, like i said, either theyre retarded or theyre hiding something
cupcakes
/me grins
beeping?
found out today i have "extra courses" with my school this weekend. FML
twoiloight_spurnkle, have you tried music via headphones?
Lil_B, I always buy that stuff when i see it ^^
It's more likely they're lazy and its in their hallways than anything else
Vivix I'm basicly just transforming the main song into 3/4 , keeping the key, and trying to make it sound a bit Waltz like
Dark_Horst: yeah, my idiot neghbors, according to them, have a smoke detector on low battery that has occasionallyt been beeping very loudly the last several weeks
Ah nice
Lil_B, I also bought some cola rebell bonbons. they taste.... intresting ^^
Why did Shizuka stop?
BladedWings: She had to take care of something. :)
needed to get food out of oven
I think I'm gonna go into town and buy some maple cola or something fun
ah ok :)
http://i.imgur.com/JqRLO.jpg
twoiloight_spurnkle: they do that when they're low on battries. but not changing the batteries for weeks is just them wanting to piss off their neighbours
RainbowAsh: no, but i dont have any music that is both loud enough to block it out, and doesnt have any sort of beat that wouldnt prevent me from falling asleep
Invi I recently wanted to try out some different Types of Cokes, Sinalco Cola was good, Vita Cola was Awful, just downright hureandous
This looks like a portal knockoff. Is that for kinect or something?
twoiloight_spurnkle: as the other guy said, landlord or police
fisn isnt vegan? -todd ingram
GAME?
Dark_Horst: yeah but what makes no sense is how the hell they managed to sleep in that, and they even told me they didnt know what i was talking about
Shizuka: Didn't knew you liked Qube? Or just got it? =3
twoiloight_spurnkle: either they're deaf as fuck or trolling
twoiloight_spurnkle, that's too bad. I think it would be really justified for you to call the cops on them.
Lil_B,Sinalco cola was okay. Africola is still my favourite. it has that cola taste without burning a hole in your stomach because of acid :P
Dark_Horst: they told me they thought i meant a constant beeping that never ends, theirs does end, but it lasts many hours a day at random times
Invi found the "Werner - Das muss Kesseln" Soundtrack in my Fathers CDs xD
lol nice
oh my...
my dad hated that show ^^
RainbowAsh: well now that ive nailed their asses, if they dont, ill have to do something like that. can i call the cops for something like that, though?
and i purchased armored core 2
Invi... man, I should vote for Werner... wait, Im don't think it haas an english version -.-, well gonna stick to Manitous Shoe for B Movie than
is it good Bronysith
alexxm: dont know, hasnt arrived yet
so, I take it this is some sort of indie game?
alexxm: and wont be for a while
Bronysith I heard lot of good Stuff about this Franchise
Lil_B, i voted for dracula ^^
i voted for the crow and the castle of caglistro
U
Invi which dracula?
We had a spanish movie here once I think
twoiloight_spurnkle, the beeping ends? That is strange. If it was low battery it should keep going. And eventually run out. Yes, you can definitely call the cops for that, it's disturbance of peace.
Lil_B: all i know is that it is about giant mechs and is difficult...cant wait
I am heeeeeeere
Vivix I don't think it has even that
bleep
Aww-
Lil_B, Bram Stoker's
This feels like Portal
Vivix yes, just 2 weeks ago
RainbowAsh: yeah thats another thing that doesnt make sense, it Does end after several hours. none of it makes any sense, maybe they broke it
Wow, this game is really cool :o
Lil_B, and nosferatu as B-Movie :D
bram stroker you say?
Invi 1920 Nosferatu?
>RAPE
Now im sad i didnt buy it when it was on sale
twoiloight_spurnkle, if you ever find out be sure to tell me. It's a real mystery to me.
Lil_B, the black'n'white movie. yeah ^^
Oh really? Hope that wins, never seen that
Lil_B: 1920 Nosferatu rocks
RainbowAsh: k, theyre indian though, so i wont be able to tell what theyre saying if they talk about it
Invi wow xD that movie just don't wanna leave me alone xD it always pops up on the reccomandations on Amazon :P
RainbowAsh: with each other i mean
Lil_B, I wanna watch it :D
Invi me too, and the Klaus Kinski Version xD
is taht a comedian?
Invi german acting genious
twoiloight_spurnkle, if they were up to something, I guess they wouldn't talk about it in front of you, if they thought they could understand you.
I'm afk for a bit.
hehe
RainbowAsh: yeah, but they talk somewhat loudly, i can sometimes hear them through the wall
so, that game takes place in an 1000x1000 white Rubix Cube?
seems like it
Mr. Monk would love this game
o_O
Monk....i need to watch Monk again
I hate that it ended :(
by any chance does this end with a fight with a psychotic robot puppetmaster?
i mean its perfect for his ocd, its clean, its square, its puzzles
Indeed

WOO
FINALLY
SUCK IT DISNEY.
dat post
Whew :3
/me slownod
SO NOW YOU CAN ALL SHUT UP ABOUT IT
nu u
/me does like snowflake
YUUH!
there were rumors?
^
why does this never show pony episodes
yeah for a day or two I think
i didnt hear rumors either tbh
Deacon: yes unfortunately
I give no fucks either way
rainbowcrash1357911: Check the FAQ. :)
soon it will be Disney vs. Hasbro for the fate of the world
twoiloight_spurnkle: had to listen to them all day in TF2...
twoiloight_spurnkle: ;d
*;d
rainbowcrash1357911 it does, just on special occasions, like this saturday and fridayus
*:D
lawl eyjey
lol good thing Disney didnt get Hasbro,no KH Equestria...for now :D
twoiloight_spurnkle: but i think they were really just fandom rumors
oh shush, sprinkles. :D
DISNEY SUCKS
Eli: Agreed.
Eli: looks like
its BronyState not PonyState
THE but...they brought us lion king and toy story....
NEW DISNEY I MEAN
wouldn't have minded KH equestria tho
Tangled?
Eli: that would be pretty awesome
THE: Youe were already about the all caps. :)
Disney TV sucks, Disney itself is still good
*You
*already warned
We can do that on our own twoiloight_spurnkle :D
idk, i like that disney wizard show
SpeccyRush, true
Except for Gravity Falls, I reckon
my little cousin's auditioning for a disney show, no idea what it is though
but srly? two 2-5 billion dollar contracts in less than 3 weeks? na i don't think so
Polydunami: this
MadSurge: do what?
IS HAVING ALL CAPS ILLEGAL?
Disney probably would have pulled it from the hub, and dunno who DHX would have been in that move-over
indeed THE , the caps police will see you soon
THE: No, but it gets on people's nerves. :)
twoiloight_spurnkle: our own Kingdom Hearts Equestria :D
HOW?
inb4 pool noodle
Pool noodle?
hell was that?
THE, apparently it is
MadSurge: ah, well, we still havent seen how the other big mlp games project will turn out
Yeah, don't be excessive about it.
its just rude to talk in all caps all the time
I really like the visuals in this game. Very nice. :)
caps is cruise control for cool, but you still have to steer :)
caps lock broke though.
yello
Orange.
blue
Okay, that's fine.
O-Range
...why do i even bother?
I have no issue with that :3
Violet. :3
:p
then hold shift
umm....magic?
everyone seems to have problems with the caps key breaking..
man this game is like Tron meets Portal meets Marble Madness :D
...magic *snort* *snort*
Violet to blue (minus Pink) is my favourite color span
bossfight!
vs, GIANT QUUUUBE
if it moves it needs ponies.
twoiloight_spurnkle: actually, half my left hand is permanently numb, so i hit the caps key quite often on accident
no, the final boss is a .... sphere!
this actually reminds me of a psp game parody video, called cube, but i cant find it anywhere outside the rss psp video
Eli: damn, what happened?
twoiloight_spurnkle: that's what i would like to know :P
twoiloight_spurnkle: sucks when writing
Eli: hm, youve talked with doctors abot it and they dont know?
Y game look so...wierd?
This is a neat game :3
hammer hell, hammer heaven, transform into light!
^
twoiloight_spurnkle: yeah, me and doctors... that never worked
Eli: ah k
Lil_B, isn't pink rather in the red direction from violet out?
Eli, how do you say ELI?
evenin' everypony
Hi, SirGanjalf. :)
sorry had to restart

Ee-lai, I reckon, THE
Invi yes, but I know a lot of people just see it as Pink=bright Purple
Hai SirGanjalf :)
purple <> violwt ^^
hey there SirGanjalf
*violet
cubes. cubes everywhere
Why cube glow?
Invi I know
THE radition
This reminds me: We should watch "Cube"
SirGanjalf: no
Think i gonna vote on it as B movie, next
Eli: Why? To Gore-y?
lol now im remembering Cubix:Robots for Everyone :D
im going to vote batman and robin for B
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I remember that show. :D
SirGanjalf: i don't like gore :(
All the Bat Credit Card jokes. :D
:D
Eli: Oh too bad... this movie freaked me out when i first watched it
next movie should have a spider named greg the spider on it. who agrees?

YES BRONYSITH YOU'RE
because old man jenkins caught you on his lawn DUH
i cant tell if this game even has any physics, or is just animations in 4 directions
Arkie: i thought it was cause the guy forgot to pay the rent
maybe both
the game is full of humor anyway
ohohoho
Weee
[wub]ehren: what is the name of this game anyways?

Deacon: well it's the pool nodle of death
ah

Deacon: all we can say about it is: be afraid. be very afraid
99% of the people in here are most likely virgins
THE sounds like a seal... |:(
Polydunami, what about the one who spoilerd?
most likely?
100%
I don't remember that.
Polydunami, he got a 1 day ban 1 or 2 hours ago
Well there was a spoiler ban, but it was withou drama or hostility
o thats right, the new mlp game is out soon
true
I wasn't here yesterday :S
hes a planet
Bronysith: well i'm libra, thank you very much
been around for millions of years
Eli: what the fuck does that have to do with anything?
Bronysith: :P probably only works in german
Bronysith: forget it, i derpt
Jomfruen
It's not called Virgin in english?
Virgo?
Vivix: ah yeah
why are you so smart shiz T_T
/me knows zodiac poorly
I have a confession to make.
Vivix: same thing no?
Thiink so-
You're a brony, turtlegod98? :3
...I don't like cheese.
Gah, laptop was derping so I had to reboot. :D
Oh :(
THERE! I SAIS IT!
I AM THE CHEESE~
gasp
*said it
I am the best character on the show!~
I love Brie!
BRIE
BACK IN TOWN
Vivix: brie <3
so good~~
turtlegod98: That HERESY will not be tolerated! *goes for his chainsword*
[wub]ehren not saying anything bad about her, but just so you know, she doesnt do blind runs, she preplays the gaame
I loved a girl named Brie, but than she tried to kill me~
....
i hope scootaloo flies in season 3 or there will be hell to pay :[
i love cheese
HELL.. to pay
twoiloight_spurnkle i wouldn't be able to clear it in the first place though
Arkie: Lauren said she would never fly
I hope at least one of them gets their cutie mark :S
...
Lauren no longer has anything to do with the show
Anyway, this is all speculation
Arkie how will hell pay? debit or cash?
Polydunami: and that's very unlikely
but she probably won't get cutiemark or flying
Eli: Well, that was her concept. She's not sure if that's going to be confirmed.
i dont know what to say so heres scootaloo in a tre
Dafuq.. she has wings but no anility to fly
if they get their cutiemark they'll get boring
Arkie she's a cripple in Lauren's draft
having a tortois on the show is the closest thing their will be to a turtle on the show. hope they bring tank back with a turtle friend in season 3.
but we don't know what she is in canon
Hi, i like cheese. My favourite is mozzarella, ut i also like emmentaller:P
Vivix: :O
SirGanjalf, get bacon with your cheese ^^
Mozzarella is good, I like Chedar too, even if it is kinda boring
who wants tank in season 3?
[wub]ehren: eh you probavbly would, these games tend to not be very hard because people wouldnt buy it
me
SirGanjalf: mozzarella rocks!
im watcing it right now
Silly Invi, bacon is not a cheese. We're talking about cheese here:P
and it looks impossible
mozzarella is nice, but brie and camambert are my favorites
Arkie: yeah, faust is cruel with little scoots
I hope the supposed one shot characters make returns in later seasons. :)
We caan make bacon a cheese
SirGanjalf, yeah, but like cheese, bacon is an universal food ^^
I, for one, would like to see a dynamic between Celestia and Luna in season 3.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I am partially vegitarian, but I will never stop eating bacon
Oh?
oo
Eli: But then again, it's a good concept for Scootaloo.
13rainbowcrash1357911: Don't spam.
Polydunami, mee too
08,01whee!
Vivix: partially vegetarian?
Polydunami: Same.
Invi: I can agree with that
im spike
Crippleloo is a good concept
Federer's favorite cheese is Tilsit :3
Hey, back again
rainbowcrash1357911 I'm guessing you don't like the princesses?
Welcome back, RainbowAsh. :)
Eli yeah- not by choice, just- don't enjoy meat very much. Bacon is--DIVINE though
well observed
08,01i like the princesses >.>
Vivix, so you are a baconvore?
yeah
Deacon what do you mean?
Chedder jack is the best cheese ever, at least for cheez-its
Vivix: not by choice? uhhh what do you have?
Ironically, I don't like pig meat
AJIsAwesome, thanku ^^
rainbowcrash1357911 ah nvm
I used to be meatarian
Oh just because-- a lot of meat tastes bad to me
nothing medical
Hello everypony!
Hi, VenHur. :)
Hi VenHur
Hey there, VenHur :3
hi VenHur
Hello VenHur!
elllo VenHur
I can't eat minced meat- pork, lamb- deer- reindeer- chops-- I can eat steaks and bacon, and various pepperonies, chorizos, etc
just because of taste and texture
Hi VenHur!
Schmancy gloves
Ping, then pong, pings, then pongs, PINGS EVERYWHERE!
Hai VenHur :)
Hello VenHur
gracias VenHur
ELLO Stallion_of_War
As much as I love meat, I can't eat stuff like pork chops and some steaks.
what about turkey?
Is anyone paying attention to Qube?
Vivix: yeah, deer is disgusting to me too. but lamb? *drools*
Deacon: Nope, don't like that either. :)
I respect meat eaters, but- I don't eat alot of it
Hehe
Lamb is SO GOOD <3
What is point of game?
Lamb I dunno why, it--smells so strange, and to me it just tastes like wool
Polydunami: i only like it when it is lamb curry
I certainly don't mind it roasted :3
Stallion_of_War cubes have points, there's your answer
I could go for some curry. :)
Also, curry is good.
^
can you use a microphone to say things
who thinks i'm annoying, types alot and asks too many questions/
Curry is good, but I have to decide what meat to put in
*?
turtlegod98: I don't. :)
Vivix: Same.
You're fine so far Turtle
you will never here Shizus voice, ever.
/me drools on. "curry"
EVERYPONY CALM DOWN... Haku is here
THE DAY IS SAVED!!!
SpeccyRush course we have, she's been disembodied robotic voice
:3
can we kick for Swag in name?
who's haku?
make that a ban
Vivix:tortuous
Eli SWAG and swag arent the same
lali-ho Haku
turtlegod98, I don't know, but I am sure he will tell us what to do.
What's SWAG6_9
Eli D:
Yo Deacon, sup
rainbowcrash1357911, ;__; but he named turtlegod
SirGanjalf, it stands for secretly we are gay, if the internet is to be believed
sounds the same to me
SWAG: So We're All Gods. Twas a clan made in FLuttershy room several moths ago
crush kill destroy swag
ah, the original SWAG crew, kinda miss the others
what is with newfoals and being ban trigger happy lately
I remember the swaggers
eeyup
Haku is all that is left
RainbowAsh: Yeah, i've heard about it
SpeccyRush: *shrugs*
the last SWAGger
A mision to Olympus took a turn for the worse
/me glomps [SWAG]Haku
anyone watching everfree radio?
Everyone dead, or wishing they were
You mean listening to everfree radio?
How do you watch a radio?
rainbowcrash1357911: that's a swag i accept. god i died laughing
rainbowcrash1357911 I don't think I've ever watched a radio before
But that's what happens when you leave Haku out of Game Night
i wish i were dead...
/me has watched radio many times
turtlegod98: Why?
i meant listen to it
im not worth anything.
Dang it, radio waves are too big to see :|
turtlegod98: Why would you say that?
On the bright side, everyone went to God Heaven, so there's that. it's like normal heaven, only, you know, better
Also, woohoo!
Must be Shizu streaming
i watch the radio sometimes. it's awful
Stallion_of_War: Yep. :)
Stallion_of_War mmhmm
because i'm a failier.
A lot of radio stations will sometimes livestream or film their studio so you can watch them- I guess that's like watching radio?
08,01i've got the Pokemon battle music stuff in my head
turtlegod98: Why do you think you're a failure?
Got it Shizuka? =3
08,01AJIsAwesome: red and blue
long to explain but i just fail, ok?
Vivix: no i literally watch my radio. it's boring
All those blocks. :O
Of all things?!
I am soooooo hungry right now for some reason.
i bet you cant sing the pokemon theme
I just ate lunch though
Whoa
Eli get one of those old tube radios and make the tubes visible
08,01does Crystal have the same music?
Hella fun to look at
AND THIS FOLKD IS WHY YOU DONT TAKE LSD BEFORE PLAYING MINECRAFT
08,01becuase it might be the battle usic from that
Crystal is the next generation
08,01i've only ever played Red and Crystal
/me hugs turtlegod98
thanks.
i wanna be the very best
08,01i didn't really grow up with Pokemon
Portal and Minecraft had a baby and Shizuka's playing it?
Yeah, Crystal is part of the second generation of Pokemon, and Red is part of the first.
^^
08,01i played it a few months ago for the first time
Beautiful creatures though, aren't they?
08,01was quite cool
Hi
Hi, CrazyCherry. :)
like noone ever was
lali-ho CrazyCherry
I stopped caring for pokemon when they came out with the Trash Bad pokemon
trippy
rainbowcrash1357911 is catching them your real test?
2 days 'till season three.
08,01alexxm: ha! yes
I still need to play Black 2. :D
08,01i have a GBC emulator on my phone for Crystal
08,01which i enjoyed more than Red
I was recomended black 2 and white 2, but I don't own a DS-
I feel like pinging Shizu just to see what the lag time is between sending and hearing.
to train them is my cause
Possibly
Red and blue are actually the most broken gens ever, so many bad programmin
08,01CrazyCherry: yes, but i'll let you see yourself out
Banned for what?
this looks like a puzzling game
XD
i will travel across the land
GOAL!!!
Psychics are the most broken types in Gen 1. :D
there was one move that decreased your critical rate when it's supposed to increase it
hallo :)
Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
allo DaringDerpy
Deacon, missingno!
Hey there, DaringDerpy :3
this game is reallly messing with my sense of reality.
:)
searching far and wide
08,01Vordox: i do, but it's linux steam
Or Sumica? Want a game? =3
08,01so there are hardly any games i can play
Haku must leave for now

Play what?
OH YEAHHHHH, My Gameboy Pocket works again, finally I can play in 4 shades of Green again!
catch them all? there's like 600 of thosee buggers, forget that
I'm confused
Giving some random game I found that may have potential for stupid fun. :P
i now its my destiny
I had a feeling this game isn't Portal due to the gloves and the low resolution graphics.
Vordox name?
VenHur wonder what gave that away?
Deacon: Well, you actually do get something useful if you get all of them in Black 2/White 2. :)
POKEMON!
VenHur... Whatabout da gun
Lil_B: Can't say, only those who given it know the name
Arkie: No gun.
Well, who else lives in USA?
didn`t you notice that first?
VenHur how can you tell the resulotion ingame if you watch it via a 360p stream?
Deacon: It's a special item that increases the chances of finding shiny pokemon. :)
AJIsAwesome og yea, heard about that
I'm off again. The stream gives me an urge to play minecraft. Bai
Bye, RainbowAsh. :)
laters RainbowAsh
Vordox: Is it free?
bye
Hello all.
Lil_B: It's obvious, the game isn't that polished.
Hi, Punkie_Pue. :)
lali-ho Punkie_Pue
What is this? The game looks fun.
NewSuperBronyU, Sumica, you here? =3
And the gameplay is MUCH different than Portal.
VenHur so you just assume it?
its Qube
Lil_B: Quite correct.
Yeah, but I don't like people spending their money on me
It just feels wrong
Pinky joins the chat.. Yes
If you tell me the name I might buy it myself
I don't have you on steam. :( I think
Is there's a story on Qube?
No one has me on steam
lali-ho Pinky, don't think I've seen ya in awhile
pinkie and the brain
VenHur: I think it's an open-ended story. :)
pinky is suprised at Deacon... yes.. for she is master uber overload of the world and can surgically attach frogs to ponies
Looks pretty cool
Pinky uh...cool!
If I want it I'll buy it myself.
:P
Fuck's sake
?
pinky is cool

VenHur:thats a system
Not bad, that went fast, Shizuka
08,01the sun has an 11 year cycle
08,01it goes through a maximum then minimum
warming*
08,01Vordox: no...
08,01it means there'll be more aurorae
08,01more sunspots, more solar flares
08,01and, most importantly, more coronal mass ejections
guys i know im a brony bust im actully nine years old
Are we reaching the maximum?
Shizuka: you ever stream volcano?
13 here
08,01AJIsAwesome: near the poles
16.
rainbowcrash135791: You're 9? O.o
:3
yes
9?
wut?
He's NINE?!
13Then you are too young to be here.
Whatchu doing on here?
NIEN NIEN NIEN NIEN NIEN!
Aren't those ages too young to be participating here?
DashWithRainbows: this just keeps getting better
rainbowcrash135791: Well, we have s certain rule here, if you're under 13 you shouldn't be here.
NEIN
who's 9?
is the season premiere gonna be live streamed on here
so?
Isn't 14 he age restriction?
*the
Vordox: Under 14
08,01even at 56 degrees north, we had some a month ago
Ah, 13, not 14, bah
NICE!!!!
rainbowcrash135791 doesn't matter, but you know the rules, you know howpeople behave when you break them, and there is no reason even a 9 year old shouldn't understand and be able to follow them for a brief period of time
Niiiiiice
Oh, the legal bronystate age is 13?
Who is 9?!
or over
Bronystate is 14+
Polydunami: 14 it seemed
Um, Lil_B, he's already banned
hi thelonepony
i hear birds
Birds, woot?
CALLED THAT POOL NOODLE
/me hugs Invi "hi" :3
Pool noodle???
08,01wasp moth: http://www.flickr.com/photos/artour_a/445309151/in/set-72157603542118616
You know what the worst thing is?
"The birds are singing! Isn't it beautiful?
08,01Sylandest: ask away
Even if they are under 14...
Hi everypony :)
Polydunami not at the time I typed his name... had to get it out anyway than :/
Hi, thelonepony. :)
Isn't it cruel to take away freedom due to age?
08,01AJIsAwesome: do you know what latitude is?
Not based on maturity?
*ehem* Moving on.
/me glomps thelonepony "hai!" :3
08,01Invi: neither, no
Oh
I would HATE it if I was not allowed anywhere due to age.
how've you been thelonepony
08,01doesn't even have a digestive system
I-Fluid?
im so lonely
hm, at least the wings are awesome ^^
I am a birdieee
I was almost 20+ mentally when I was around 8. ._.
Narf.
Vordox: we are also PG-13 in terms of material on chat and stream soooo
Vordox: I see what you mean.
Aaaaah, wher is Gigabit??? I love these cards! :D
Vordox I suppose so, but I guess that depends on the mentality of the person
This game again? Sweet :3
08,01Invi: it doesn't
Deacon: Haven't we broken the rules for some people in the past?
I-Fluid :)
doesn't it live long enough to eat?
I've never seen Shizu stream this game before. :O
08,01it lives on the reserves it's builds as a caterpillar
huh what game is this
Vordox no idea
SOmeone was 11 but was shown to be quite mature for the age and therefore the rules was lifted?
She's streamed it before, AJIsAwesome
08,01Invi: only lives about a week as a moth
About February, I think
up to a month? wow
Sooo...I-Fluid is a game about...pipes...
Mm'kay.
Polydunami: I know that, just wasn't here to see it streamed. :)
ik, I'm afk for about 1h, gotta get clean
Right
Dafuq is this game!
have fun? Lil_B ^^
Also, this game is featured in the outro
11,02Vordox: I here o3o
Vordox: Actually, didn't we have a very young brony here that was allowed in chat once?
NewSuperBronyU: YAY!
yes
NewSuperBronyU: Do you have steam? D:
bye Lil_B :3
NewSuperBronyU: Yo.

11,02Vordox: Yesh D: But I rarely use it
wut this?
You are a water droplet
AJIsAwesome: Yeah, that's the person
thanks Invi and MLP_Brovakiin :)
raindrop
11,02dat thelonepony :3
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin :3

Vordox: no, before that.
NewSuperBronyU: Would you like to play something with Shizuka, if she ever will play it? =3
/me hugs thelonepony tightly :3
AJIsAwesome: Then I do not know, not the name atleast.
/me gets hugged tighlty :3
tightly*
Vordox: Okay. Last I remember he/she was around 8 years old, if I recall.
11,02Vordox: Does she want me to play a game with her? o.o
Dat NewSuperBronyU.
11,02Dat VenHur :D
NewSuperBronyU: Don't know ask her, but she's busy atm. D:
so what do you do in this game
I'm giving away a game I found just...well...
You're so silly, SB. :D
Had a good week, feel generous. :P
11,02i liek silleh :D
So giving away the game to the people who can stream it
08,01Sylandest: in answer to your question, solar flares and CMEs do have an effect on radio communications
ok, one thing left to say here, when you have to avoid absorbing materials, because you are a droplet, than why does this tiny drop not evaporate?
11,02I feel bad now, I was sitting within a few feet of Sibsy at a panel at EQLA and I didn't say hi to her and she told me that I should have said hi on Twitter /)~(\
lolwut
anyway ~~flies away
NewSuperBronyU: You aren't a brony, we know. *Pat*
Oh yeah, the fireworks of household objects :D
08,01but unless you're using affected systems, like if you're in the military, you won't notice anything
bye Lil_B :3
11,02Vordox: :<
NewSuperBronyU: EQ pretty much souped up her name and all =3
NewSuperBronyU: But since you hate 1 person or the very website, you miss those thing
08,01Sylandest: yup
flood
08,01Sylandest: put it this way, we already had a *massive* one a few weeks ago
Sylandest: So what countries are unable to see the auroras?
11,02Vordox: Huh?
08,01doubtless it went unnoticed by 99% of the population
NewSuperBronyU: EQD: :P
Whoops
11,02Souped up her name?
NewSuperBronyU: "Made her famous due to how many people don't know her."
NewSuperBronyU: And hey, BG Pony now as well...
Even more fame(Which she deserves)
11,02I knew who she was
anypony care to tell me what we are watching?
08,01AJIsAwesome: 56N is about the minimum latitude in the north
11,02I just didn't say hi cause I was shy :(
NewSuperBronyU: You, Shy!? must be a canadian? :P
08,01AJIsAwesome: the higher you are, the more likely you'll see them
Peh. I'm Canadian
so what exualitly do you do in this game
i'm leaving now
11,02But then she replied to me on Twitter about it saying that I should have

Shizuka: how is she, by the way?
11,02DCD streams himself with shoes on his head...we're not worthy as streamers.
hahaha
08,01actually, Sumi is best streamer
Vivix: du!

Hey there, Meanwhile :3
alloha Meanwhile
Given the chance to have 100 Million dollars, or go to Equestria, (You have 24 hours to make the choice) What would you chose? I would probobly sleep and think about it. I would end up sleeping for exactly 24 hours though. :(
100 million dollars.
BlazeAngel: The money. :D
Makes things just a bit better when somepony actually brings up a spoiler :D
100 million dollars.
Y???
Are you kidding?
equestria
wait.. do you become a pony
[Scootaloo]: You're a mong.
BlazeAngel: Because it's make my life so much easier. :D
*it'd
i'm a sponge
100 million dollars. The student loan will start calling six months after December
Wait
Who's BlazeAngel?
do you have any idea how much 100 million is?
Who are these new people who are being made staff members?
cause i dont want to be a human in a cartoon world.. :O
No idea.
What's going on?
Ponies, Ponies, Ponies, SWAG
I don't listen to rap.
But AJIsAwesome... Equestria! *Shakes you* WAKE UP.
WHAT IS LIFE
ScootaChicken1: Staff.
WHAT IS THIS ANYMORE
id choose equestria probably
BlazeAngel is the black drop...
See, BlazeAngel, what would I do with a hundred million dollars?
Equestria
ScootaChicken. Wut.
im takin the money :D
Most of it would be sitting there doing nothing.
Yeah BlazeAngel, who're you? What department?
BlazeAngel: I'd like to think that I'm fairly up to date on BronyState's happenings, and you'd have thought a new staff member is a fairly big thing.
I'd give ALL OF IT TO CHARITY.
Lies
Well. Its not big ither.
confetti
;.;
Screw the charity, Equestria here I come!
id give it all to hasbro
Also, Im in da art department.
I'd...give it to myself ¬_¬
Hasbro has more than enough money.
...I know magic...
Yes they do, Polydunami. Remember the new Furbys?
ScootaChicken1: I am art dept.
no i would become a pony and go to equestria just so i can make rainbow dash say swag
New Furbys?
XD
The one with the LED eyes
Giving nonames who we've never heard of voice is confusing.
I would go seduce a certain purple pony.]
No clue.
:o
You're supposed to land on the yellow thing.
AttackWithHugs, furbies with LED eyes? sounds creepy
BlazeAngel: :I stay away from her!
Meanwhile: I heard it's all the rage these days.
Meanwhile, you donot remember me? :(
No. No I don't,

BlazeAngel: I've been here about as long as Meanwhile, and I don't either.

Fine, fine...
Okay. I have a very deep question. Answer it honestly. If Princess Celestia came to visit you, and told you you can go to Equestria for eternity... But, there is a catch. You have to eat a pony, and take their body, and shape, and you will ive their life. Well... answers.

BlazeAngel: eat celestia!
BlazeAngel, I'll skip the offer.

Yup, i'm mad.
This looks a bit treacherous...
It's Morphin' Time?
