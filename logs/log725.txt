if available, I digg a Bun or a Cosseount with lot of Nutella
fried cola.
friend cola?
weird..
lol
i thought only lovers and friends with benefit make "friend cola"
lol
on the way ill pick up a coffee of some sort
whatever canadian
And no, I don't usually pour gravy over everything I eat.
http://derpy.me/Ey8Cl http://derpy.me/VaP8V
fuck that shit
delicious friend cola
now
with flavor
and when i say flavor, i mean grenadine
and when i say grenadine
i mean blood
I agree with you on coffee
except
wait shit, you got that part
hotter
Yeah
THAT is coffee
um...
same with tea
hot
no sugar
Lots and lots and lots of sugar
I drink tea with milk and sugar
fuck that
sometimes with a little sugar
I HAVE to have milk and sugar in it
oh fuck no
I use a kettle for me tea
^
No stream correct? :I
Heretic.
Ew.
oh lol
That's just the way my family makes tea
i dont see why people put milk with tea
MOTHERFUCKER
Saucers are acceptable but not needed at all
Oh, we just use more tea
it's still quite strong
There isn't one, it's tradition
ZONDER
/me Doesn't like tea
Also
The boiling itself is a part of enjoying the tea
I like using my colombian kettle. :3
that is a good breakfast
right now my jacket smells like sausage...
Everyone around here drinks their coffee with all this creamer shit in it
disgusting
Also, sausage gravy and biscuits
(\
at this one hotel, the buffet
in one sitting
Oh, I can't eat much
honestly though Sausage patties>bacon
but I always eat well to make up for it
i need my fill
/me 5'5, usually 115lbs at the most
i weigh 180
everyone tiny
/me nods
All this talk of good food and I'm sick :\
can't even have any ;-;
Can't be done, spiciest thing in the house is my personal bottle of Tobasco
I'm about to have softboiled eggs and toast
^
Scrambled with baught but tobasco
*naught
i dont like toast
Not toast
bread
i dont like just plain bread
to wipe up the yolk :3
i just lick it up
I like to dip my toast in the softboiled eggs. :3
you know, HOW you are supposed to clean yolk
by licking it off the plate
By eating it
It's the best part
I use my spoon to scrape up the yoke myself. When I have no more toast.
i dont like toast for breakfast
...
unless its french toast or texas toast
/me *really* wants some eggs now
or stuffed french toast with strawberries
As far as breakfast goes, my favorites are softboiled eggs and over easy.
over easy is cool too
Favorite types of eggs
scrambled is decent
that goes best with gravy really
I like hardboiled eggs as a snack, but not as breakfast.
I only like scrambled with something else or tobasco
Scrambled comes a close second on the favorites
It's just meh on its own
ZONDER
Time to hit the hay.
Goodnight everyone. :)
why do you keep saying that

Yeah, don't care about S3 at all
if it's decent, okay
if it's not, meh
seriously, with that disapointing finale
I stopped caring some times after the S2 opening episodes
*time
I'm looking forward to it, but I can't really say I'm excited.
the only reason people like the season 2 finale is because This day aria and fight scene
I don't know how long I've been boiling these things! ><
seriously, that fight scene in s2 finale was completely pointless

even if they made it there, they wouldnt have been able to open it

Why would you taste a condom.
well, we were what--14=
O.o
everything smelled like strawberries, and it said "Strawberry taste!" on the pack
haha
I'm sure.
Um....
Hehe, crazy schools
D: Lazy school , we got rubber flavor
awww
Dodging this convo egh
haha
Only one way to find out
Weell- you know-
haha
yep~~
._.
Someone was talking about sex ed or something
i came back to that as well lol
Same
:P
We are talking about the birds and the bees
wooo
I never got that saying, it promotes interspecies sex
O.o
Yeah i dont get it either
why is it Birds and bees?
Wut
bees and the flowers would make sense I guess- but birds?
"According to tradition, the birds and the bees is a metaphorical story sometimes told to children in an attempt to explain the mechanics and good consequences of sexual intercourse through reference to easily observed natural events. For instance, bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain example of male fertilisation. Another example, birds lay eggs, a similarly visible and easy-to-explain example of female ovulation."
:o
O.o
Revelation :O

egh Rayquaza
I liked the way "I" pronouced it....rather than the show/movie
As if.
I pronounced it rye-KWA-za
Rahquahza
Not that damn Ray-Quay-za
Yeah
Is that how they said it? Ugh
I think thas how i heard it, cant really watch any of the movies now :D
Yeah :D
orly?
Ahahaha
Brilliant
DEFIANCE!
/me runs away
Nice to see you. :)
JUST RELEASE IT ALREADY.
^
I wish it aired another time. :(
Oh well
;)
*:)
I know.
Thanks to Wre-k, I have a very good knowledge with European time zones.
^
Is UTC the same as GMT?
CET?
Centra Europian Time
It's the standard, and it's based on GMT dari
GMT is the standard though
no dari
Well UTC might be standard for America
But GMT is standard here
UTC 0 = GMT 0 + leap second
there's been 37 leap seconds since the creation of UTC
UTC = Ísland time
UTC is universal time coordinated
how was the convention? heard it was fun and went without a hitch
Interesting fact, UTC was a compromise between the french TUC and the english CUT
And it's currently the SLI isn't it?
or..SI
whatever it's called
Well UTC is still pointless for telling the time.
since it's effectively the same as GMT, yeah
Maybe it's something they use for satellite geolocation which needs an accurate time or something
But it's pointless for the rest of us
I think that's the case yeah, with the leapseconds and such, but ultimately,--for us it's just GMT
Actually atomic time is TAI, not UTC
UTC is not the atomic clock but molecule or atomic time measurement-
!cd does
woops-
my computer does- but I personally say and use GMT
I'd*
don't like CET--PDT DST--all those, easier with just GMT and UTC
Aah
Mmmm. Copypasta
just like metric
Well by 'here' I meant UK
OK gotta go
Bye guys
Cya

Yeah bye. :)

08,01the sun has an 11 year cycle
08,01it goes through a maximum then minimum
warming*
08,01Vordox: no...
08,01it means there'll be more aurorae
08,01and, most importantly, more coronal mass ejections
Are we reaching the maximum?

08,01AJIsAwesome: near the poles
16.

"The birds are singing! Isn't it beautiful?
08,01Sylandest: ask away
Even if they are under 14...
Hi everypony :)
Isn't it cruel to take away freedom due to age?
Saturn, can it sting or bite?
Not based on maturity?
*ehem* Moving on.
08,01Invi: neither, no
Oh
I would HATE it if I was not allowed anywhere due to age.
08,01doesn't even have a digestive system
I-Fluid?
I am a birdieee
Saturn, then how does it digest
08,01Invi: it doesn't
I-Fluid :)
doesn't it live long enough to eat?
08,01it lives on the reserves it's builds as a caterpillar
SOmeone was 11 but was shown to be quite mature for the age and therefore the rules was lifted?
08,01Invi: only lives about a week as a moth
About February, I think
up to a month? wow
Saturn: And that's why I don't kill Moths. :P
Mm'kay.
ik, I'm afk for about 1h, gotta get clean
Right

Saturn: Disturbances
ok, one thing left to say here, when you have to avoid absorbing materials, because you are a droplet, than why does this tiny drop not evaporate?
11,02I feel bad now, I was sitting within a few feet of Sibsy at a panel at EQLA and I didn't say hi to her and she told me that I should have said hi on Twitter /)~(\
lolwut

11,02Vordox: Huh?
08,01doubtless it went unnoticed by 99% of the population
Whoops
* Saturn
11,02Souped up her name?
Saturn: Indeed...unless I should worry about that one day I felt immensely fuzzy and warm...
Even more fame(Which she deserves)
08,01AJIsAwesome: 56N is about the minimum latitude in the north
11,02I just didn't say hi cause I was shy :(
08,01AJIsAwesome: the higher you are, the more likely you'll see them
Peh. I'm Canadian
