jewish fanatics?

so, Pi is the answer to everything?
otakon: They think the number he knows is the true name of God and that'll do...something.
So... the key to heaven is PI????????????
Jews. :D
otakon: We're near jews lets get in charater, heck*
Meanwhile: ah

04But I don't know if Pi is considered the true name of God

bananashark: haha.I see what you did there.
So, 216 = JHWH?
oh oh oh , /your/ god is controlling me, i get it now.. loons
Pi=Gehova?
So...staring into the sun will allow you to know the true nature of God?
Wieeeerd.
it is a 216 number sequence starting at the 216th digit of pi?
Erm, Is the guy with the beard.... Tom Jones?
Wait, all 216 digit numbers?!?!
Age ain't nothin but a number.
I'd rather smash my brains out with a thin slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.

God is best fraction

Bronies4evar: yeah but what type f music do they play?

I don't know how ashley makes time for both voice acting and concerts.
Honestly, I'm not going in Brony-Regalia, but let's be honest. If it gets butts in the seats, why complain?
That sounds like a panflute

DaringPatrick :D
10LUGIA used AEROBLAST
/me licks DeathStar
10Moves too.
at least this guy is actually makeing progress
02yeah
8,1Wrek: it's because of slow compound time
03but still
/me dances on Gunthler s tounge
10I have an idea why
Furthest I ever had to drive was to Colorado and that took...a day and a half
not counting stops
8.45 pm BST now.
03because of technical limitations on the original Red and Blue.
great and powerful *smooch* that kills me everytime
03on the Japanese version, they didn't have to worry about different cases
10To make those words more noticeable, take a look at the difference in graphics from RBY to BW
03it was ust the kanji
03no, that's not it at all LOL
furthest i had to drive was 7 meters
People should be telling the server that they need to go to bed in about 1/2 hour.
lol
03at least I don't think so
worst 7 meters my family had n a car
02it's probably both
Yeah, I'm definitely going. I NEEEEEEEED to.
10Just my two cents
7 meters to what? cachi01
mechanic?
to my house
00,10backed a car in to the mail box didja cachi01?
lol
I heard there is a GPS with fluttershy's voice in it :(

a cliff, even.
Chrysalis: you linked em wrong so there all the same..
TheGreatAndPowerfulT ikr i still need to get a more up to date shot though hes done a fiar bit more
00,10Dash just keeps telling you to go faster and how she would have been there by now
02Easier to program and more noticeable with low graphics
8,1i'm not a big fluttershy fan
i wonder when wrek will do OC's again, i want to see how he twist mine
8,1i prefer pinkie
ah, i linked one twice, so 3 links are ther
Sumica: Sounds about right.
my current gps voices are all annoying - :) I can imagine fluttershy's - Um, Turn right in 2 miles, if you dont want to miss your turn
"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, go back!"
8,1twilight and rarity are really really funny, though

FlareChaser: :(

Bronies4evar 2am
Thanks!
Scotland is the land of pizza crunch and stabbings

Scoot-Scootaloo: really? take it away twilight "YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES"
otakon: it's ok I know :)
Cypresswolf: it's cooked sheep's stomach.
hello sound hound, how i have missed you for wrek streams
I think I look Scottish enough to blend in :)
8,1he returned me an absolutely horrified look and said, "of course not! then how would we kiss 'em?"
LOL
More Rainbow Mod Colors! More!
otakon: :) I know
You know, I totally misread wellies.
Sumica: I am not familiar with that, what is it?

I'm half welsh half new zealander *sigh* I'm doomed to a life of sheep shagger jokes
8,1yes, in *that* way.
New Orleans cuisine & cub scout camping trips have prepared me for the more....exotic dishes :)

8,1Cypresswolf: did you then eat them?
ChrysaMaid: that's unhealthy
Heheh
DeathStar, I think rams are bit more choosy
8,1because roast tarantula is delicious
whats unhealthy?
Litwick: as who?
Mutterguy: lol true
Litwick: but then youll miss all the poines
ChrysaMaid: I'm not sure
00,10I think it's time to go shout things to death while looking like pinkie pie.
8,1Litwick: you'd be surprised. there are a lot of people that exist who have... let's just say unorthodox sexual tastes.
Yep, don't like spiders - but crikets, meal worms, earth worms are alright - beware of certain beetles
>_>

8,1TheGreatAndPowerfulT: pffft, no such thing!
DeathStar: only if one knows where it is
8,1otakon: oh aye, yeah, i saw that on the news
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: one guy made his entire apartment int a Star Trek set.

Cypresswolf: only the best chefs cook fugu and the sack is not hard to find
/me 13sneaks in, drops a wrek picture, and runs http://i.imgur.com/dmTJp.jpg
Gunthler: Don't you know, everything causes cancer? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yzbxwxWUz0
China or one of their surrounding countries, chef's have to train to specialize in preparing fugu
otakon not talking about the R2D2 desing, just too clean and perfectly in order

13note to self... next time we play moonbase alpha.... sing we didn't start the fire
I'm fine otakon. Thanks Bronysith, and I've already tried that DeathStar. It worked for all about 2 minutes
Sumica, do you know anything about brazilian or Portugese cuisine? trying to think of something for a vegetarian potluck ...
Ryanier128: the alchohol or ponys?
00,10Not off the top of my head but i could check my notes
DeathStar both
or sing it in the disembodied voice of Shizuka :3
8,1http://buttersafe.com/2012/05/17/swimsuit-season/
I know your pain. I lost two cats lately. Now another one is bugging me.
Ryanier128: I suggest you sit down and watch a good feel good movie. Something you both enjoy. Just try to relax and eat some popcorn.
Shizuka when we playing moonbase again?
13that's much easier... just drop it into balabolka and save the file
Ryanier128: hugs??
13i dunno, nittany's the one that instigates it :3
you know... just a little fun fact cause Pick of Destiny was played today... Tenacious D has a new album out called Rize of the Fenix... just sayin
13http://i.imgur.com/it7Wi.jpg mfw nopony ever comments when i post this... it's because it's not ponies isn't it
my other criterea is it has to be gluten free
Shizu: Dat a nonpony Shizu? :o
Shizuka: I haven't seen you post that it looks awesome
Shizuka: i never see you post it ever tbh
thanks otakon. I've tried that too DeathStar, but not even allowing her to call me "Snuggle Bunny" worked . . . don't ask about that, it's a long story
mfw its still an awesome pic Shizuka
13yup from years and years ago
maybe its bad timing :/
She's kewte. :3
Shizuka: it's a girl.........I don't know what to make of it besides she looks a little .....sad I think.

We saw on Sunday otakon. I think making her a nice dinner would work, though. Speaking of which, I GTG. be back in a few minutes
Shizuka: about your art drawing, i assume its yours at least. reminds me of another friend of mine who likes to draw anime style. your styles are kind of similar
13not my drawing silly
Ryanier128: try to go out! Hell, invite friends over to take her mind off of it. I still suggest sitting down and watching something good together.
13i can't even draw competent circles let alone something like that
Ingwaz: hiya man
Sounds like my artistic ability. >_>
otakon: YO
Shizuka: I can draw on paper, but I can't draw with a mouse to save my soul.
Dat pic
otakon: i cant even draw on paper, not unless i'm just copying something

Nittany_Discord: no scarring
Sounds like confirmation to me
Nittany: They're not, do you SEE an open chest wound?
CriticKitten: hells yeah

Scoot-Scootaloo: :O
00,03It makes me not have nice things...
EVERYPONY http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2792/

so trixie, so it is meanwhile
00,03Apparently I'm still down >:/
8,1i find it odd how most people are either cat people of dog people
i liek stegsaurus
I prefer cats as far as pets go, but I like playing with my neighbors' dogs from time to time.
I have 2 sugar gliders :) that's it
I like both, though I'm only able to own a cat at present.
8,1TheRainbowDash: there were when we had a cat
Scoot-Scootaloo: =/ well your computer makes Blizzard piss on it
Oh my.
doooh, it's meanwhile!
but the last meanwhil you did was an earth stallion
8,1except our dog could probably fit the whole cat in his mouth
What?:D
I KNEW IT!
8,1but he was *terrified* of her
8,1we have a biiiiiiig dog
IT'S TRIXIE AND MEANWHILE!
Who are the ponys you are drawing? Are they real ones from the show or your own ponys?

8,1Biglaw: i had 3, but they're not in a better place; they're dead

Cuz if it is YOU ARE AWESOME!
8,1i do feed a stray, though
8,1sometimes sleeps in the house
Well shit.
8,1but she's very nervous
I thought my wireless was more stable than this.
8,1and doesn't like people approaching her
8,1loves to be petted, though
Scot-Scootaloo I know how you feel, but I, literally, dropped out of college
8,1odd little cat
i've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
8,1aww
So CriticKitten, I'm guessing you're rather amused that your apprehensions towards D3 were vindicated?

TheRainbowDash :p
twilight_sprinkler: tab skills are reduced to 2
RAWRity: Very, actually. Obviously I feel sorry for people who bought the game, but I do somewhat enjoy the fact that Diablo 3's disasterous release has sort of helped prove my point that Blizzard has finally given up on being a good developer.
i have been shipped with otakon
holy shit, disaster avoided
hey cachi01 and Ryanier128!
SunderlandPony89: shipping of me excessivelhy is a bannable offense
That face, wiped off.

SamanthaGirl159: it's Trixie giving Meanwhile a lapdance
:D
10Light~
RAWRity: No...no...oh.oh god, noo....(shudders)
i've found worse
SamanthaGirl159: more or less, Meanwhile being ponified here
02wouldn't bother me. How bad it is for you is what would keep me from drinking it
/me hugs DaringDude back
RAWRity: Ewww!! lol
RAWRity: HOW DARE YOU BRING THAT ABOMINATION UP!
^
6it's not overly bad
6bad yes
02although that is gross
02:x
6nah its not gross really
O_o
6it's found in bull piss
6its not bull piss
So, who is Wrek drawing?? (I left right after i came back, just in case anypony answered me the first time :\)
otakon please tell me if Ryan is in the chat right now
03still
03REd Bull is gross
WHEN YOU WILL DRAW THE NAUGHTY BITS?
03never even had it, but I heard it tastes disgusting
03XD
6didn't say that
SamanthaGirl159: he was here a minute ago, how are you dear?
6rock star was the only energy drink i ever had
RustyMeat: it's NOT THAT KIND OF PIC!
6it tasted alright for the first couple sips
that thing on her leg... is naughty enough
RustyMeat: Ewm uhhm, NO!! :D
What I think of this drawing: :|
6then it was meh
/me smacks RustyMeat with a Shallot of Shame
6but then the energy kicked in
6I didn't get much energy
otakon: What kind of pic is it then?! I'm confused
Whats a shallot?
6I was just sickly jitteryu
Woah....getting to R34 levels...:D
Darkts33: it's a garterbelt that's all
6and then crashed by 11:30am
I approve though.
6it was horrible
SunderlandPony89: it's saucy, or ecchi if you like.
/me clops to R34
O_o
wat o_o
TheRainbowDash and you know R34 levels how? :|
<_<
>_>
otakon I'm going to go kill me groom. I'm already stressed from the wedding coming up and now THIS?!?
03I can drink 5 Hour Energy but it tends to make me mentally insane
Biglaw: Ummm, uhhh, ummm, nothing...(sweats)
Hey, it could be worse. It could be LEMON SCENTED.
03which, these days, is basically no change at all :D
SamanthaGirl159: wait, what's wrong?
Better NOT be R34 ponies!! or im gonna have to start kicking some mad flank!! :[
inb4 only 1 person gets that reference
02XD
TheRainbowDash sure, sure :|
RaveBrony: it's not relax
Russian girls are looking for me? O/////O stupid ads
Biglaw: Hahaha:d, you got me.
CCCP: I got that awhile ago! :D
07http://tinyurl.com/ypkef4
otakon: Ok :P
saus
07that is all.
/me clops
/me runs
SunderlandPony89: i get it all the time lol
O_o

TheRainbowDash :|:|:|:|:|
03LOL
03that's awesome
hi Gunthler... :o D:
/me dances
CCCP: Those Russian chicks really want you man ;)
lol ohai CCCP
SunderlandPony89: :$
This reminds me O.o i still have FlareChaser's pic to draw....lol
Oh mah...
OH GOD
02;3
I really need to start writing down my passwords for everything...I have a different one for everything and I just can't remember what word goes to what site anymore :|
SamanthaGirl159: no really, did I miss something? He said he had to go do somthing and he'd be back, please stay calm eh?
CCCP: u stud
Biglaw: Fine, fine, you got me, just don't be so critical of my decision of R34 stuff.:F
:D
Oh, another stripper pic? Haha :D
RaveBrony: :| you...never started it :P playing WoW right now cant talk
u stud MahBoi777
This pictures is inaccurate. Ponies do not have paper currency.
Cypresswolf, take a look at Keepass or other password managers.
FlareChaser: I have to finish your "wings" >.>
TheRainbowDash it's okay, everypony has their likes and dislikes :|
RAWRity: Where is my 5 million money?
CCCP: I just got the Russian ad :P
Kirz|art loves strippers =/
otakon I can't seem to relax. Ryan is in crutches, I'm about to get married, and now I just witnessed this . . . what was is, Rule 36?
SunderlandPony89: lol
RaveBrony: wait, your almost done?
FlareChaser: Colgate is already done :D I think youll be pleased...
does Keepass require a password?
Biglaw: It is just my likes and dislikes, you dissapprove of, that is the point.
i still think this is otakon, it could be meanwhile but dat is a unicorn so no
02LOL "it's your mind that's the problem"
02XD
SamanthaGirl159: Yeah, this is Rule 34
SamanthaGirl159: um..........I'm not sure. Just relax, Wrek draws this stuff at times. It's saucy at worst, but always well drawn.
05^ i laugh at your missinformation
RaveBrony: just get my wings, HURRY!
/me hugs DeathStar
Yes Cypresswolf, one masterpassword to secure it's db of passwords/account details
SunderlandPony89: it's NOT
Wrek: I laugh with your laugh
as far as i know he goes by an earth pony i think
Wait, what is this? who is Wrek drawing? :P
Darkts33: I laugh at your laugh of his laugh
FlareChase no it's obviously me :p
FlareChaser: If I were to guess, Meahwhile getting a lapdance from Trixie
O_o
otakon: It's a type of clop pic
Ouroboros: I can't even remember my youtube word, and Im on that everyday...a new one isn't going to help
otakon: yum.
SunderlandPony89: argh
its a clop pic DEAL WITH IT
otakon: o_o, oh my...I am going to get my camera.
/me facehoofs
wut
Anyway, back to listening to uncannily catchy K-Pop
otakon i though meanwhile was an earth pony
Wrek: what? what is it then?
Darkts33: it is not or it wouldn't be being streamed dammit!
this pic still probably wouldn't become canon
it's just a pic lol
becuase its too
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: not in this pic he's not
otakon fair enough
CCCP: that's because you haven't read my meanwhile x Trixie fic yet.
ohhhh
it is Meanwhile x Trixie
:3
thanks SunderlandPony89. otakon have you ever been proposed to and the next day watch yourself and groom be in a car crash? Relaxation just isn't going to happen any time soon!
RAWRity: OMG!!!!!!!!!!! I NEED TO READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is it out?
RAWRity you finished already ?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: CCCP not yet. But SOON.
otakon: Well, it is a type of clop pic!
RAWRity: can't wait!
im going to make a fanfic of Otakon kissing at his own reflection
....now we need more Flare Chaser x Colga- ah screw it.
hahaha
Well the idea being you just remember one password (to access the db) and then keep the account details in keepass, Cypresswolf, but if that's a problem too then it isnt going to help much.
I need to make some quick revisions, because Wrek gave me the GREATEST IDEA EVER.
RAWRity: Oh ok, but send me a direct link to it, immediately when you finish that fic.
Cypresswolf: sounds like one helluva good day
SamanthaGirl159: well, freaking out is not going to help. All you can do is be thankful your both still alive and try to relax.
TheRainbowDash: can do
SunderlandPony89: its not rule 34 the picture could make it onto EQD
uhh whats that
I could just write it all down and hide the list REALLY well....but then I'd forget where I hid that in a few weeks anyways
/me dances
..we're getting more Flare Chaser x Colgate? right? RIGHT? .....nevermind :|
CCCP it could but saucy trixie is not something sethisto post daily
so... two strippers =/
>_(\
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i know
/me dances
otakon Ryan said something like that earlier. I don't know, I guess I could go see my parents, they're always supportive.

I ate there for lunch 1 day - $35 for salad, steak, & fully loaded baked potato - SO worth it!
high end though
It's usually drive through at 8 bucks or less
DaringDude can a pony be a stripper if they don't normaly waer clothes ?

:D
Dat feel when that Fantastic Four movie is why they had to call the aliens "The Chitari" in Avengers
^
he makes a valid point
that will help :|
do you think nudists mentally dress eachother
00,03RIP: Nice Things
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the work in reverse....
1,3pony stripper = putting on more clothes
lol
Sparta is a city in Greece where many warriors were made. It has gained great popularity from the movie "300"
LOL
something is obviously wrong here
kirz|art nooo, that means all the sock shots are ponies being burlesque
Scoot-Scootaloo: they will be missed.
Chrysalis: lol, why is it a pair of pants when you only get one?
otakon so they keep clothing ?

Gunthler: :Oo

RAWRity: DAAAAAAAA FUUUUUUUUUUUUUQ
MahBoi777: Ponies
Bacon[Hazard]: well dammit are you gonna quit now? or are you gonna pick yourself up by the bootstraps and TRY AGAIN?
SamanthaGirl159: cuz i think shes just insecure
WELP! time to micspam COD and listen to people rage about why there is no nugget in the biscuit
MahBoi777: i havn't slept in hours

...
Gunthler: dinosaurs

otakon: :( FIIIINE
when wrek do something like this. i ask myself why did i say trixie x meanwhile, that could be me, but then i remember it would not be as funny
CriticKitten: He's already stated he's not going to play Stark past Iron Man 3
:D
cya...
she is twilight_sprinkler, but she isn't as bad as any of the Mane 6, especially Twilight
RAWRity: but......WAHT ABOUT AVENGERS TWO!?
MahBoi777: Appearently I'm still known for that even though I havent said that for months :D
kirz|art: dont you think this picture needs more.... <.< >.> pegasi and unicorn?.... not that its bad... :$
bye Bacon!
otakon: They'll have to get a new Tony Stark. Or replace him with Ant Man
bye bacon
RAWRity: Yes, and Pirates was going to be done after 3 movies.
SamanthaGirl159: isnt as bad? what do you mean
RAWRity: oh goddammit

Gunthler: Lol indeed
dat corset
Wrek: Thats really saucy
I know a girl that looks damn good in a corset
RAWRity: STOOP MAKE IT STOOOP
What does a corset serve for a pony?
hmmm
dat horn
05sauce
We'll see when it's closer to the date of the movie, I suspect.
saus
twilight_sprinkler watch Lesson Zero. That is all you need to know
she is just dancing
sauce?
Biglaw: bc we humanize them
Also, I know the perfect celebrity to play Hank Pym.
00,03Trixie in lingirie?
otakon :p
Wrek: more sauce.
IKR
RAWRity: who?
hmmm... hmmmmmmmm... hmmmmmmmmm
Litwick: sauce
SamanthaGirl159: twi is my fav pony...
DOHOHOHOHO
RAWRity: me?
RAWRity: I have no idea who that is...
hmmm.
oooh its not me :(
00,03:'(
apparantely Scoot-Scootaloo
Wrek should be paid for this, hes that good
Guess what time I skipped today?
otakon: it's a joke about domestic abuse.
RAWRity: I still don't get it
otakon: ...Ben Stiller? REALLY?
wrek eez good
00,10ohmy~
11,01No guesses?
very good
00,10what did i just come back too
RAWRity: what? he's a good actor why not?
05me being bored jsut enjoyign the chat getting chocked
Sumica: meanwhile x trixie
00,03The reason why we can't have nice things, Sumi
hey Sumica
RAWRity: Besides, if he wants to ditch the role, they might talk him into playing Iron Man for Avengers 2 and kill the character off. They ARE facing off against a guy who is best known for singlehandedly killing half the Marvel universe.
dat purple
Sumica: trixie..... in lingirie
11,01Glad I skipped Maid Hour.
00,10seems nice to me Scoot|NoNiceThings
Guys, I'll brb
lol
Sumica it's Trixie and meanwhile. Something to do with shipping
00,10I am ok with this
he uses skype
Wrek: I am not being shocked! I am simply entertained.
i want to eat chicken
00,03Oh that's Meanwhile? 
CriticKitten: Or, they kill him off in Iron Man 3. Have War Machine take his place in Avengers 2
Scoot|NoNiceThings he's ponified
she is sexy dancing!
Oh Wrek.....haha
oh myyyyyy
is he getting a lap dance?
yep
00,03Oh man...
so...there will be much clopping to this one
0_0
>_<
RAWRity: Don't think they can pull that off. War Machine's already changed actors once, and the new guy isn't nearly as charismatic as Stark, who...let's face it....is part of the reason Avengers is so GOOD
/me clops
:D
the clopping is strong in this one
00,03Shining Armor seems to have a LOT of nice things!
first to clop?
Wait... Wth!?!? How does Wrek get contour lines to work for him?? Omg, on my tablet thats absolute madness to even Attempt contour lines X_x
Damn, that's what a bachelor party is like?
clopping is naughty :(
Scoot|NoNiceThings: we have nice things! ME :|
>_>
lol
00,10Shame meanwhile is't around
but cloping is k
I do NOT want to know what our Bachelor Party will be like. If it goes anything like this, Ryan's going to need more than his crutches to help him get around
im okay if you clop but i dont want to see it
And NOT accepting cloppers for who they are is hypocritical against what bronies are. Pick your poison.
CCCP: clops
Gunthler: :|
SamanthaGirl159: dayum, seems fair lol
my mind is full of Colgate!
whaaa!
i want t be in charge of my friends bacchaleor party
bbs
THE HANGOVER IRL EDITION
hmm Shining Armor's Bachelor Party... No wonder guards were gone
CCCP: wait....why would we do that in front of you.....
CriticKitten: actually, Stark in the films is one of my nitpicks about the Marvel films. He's just...not Tony Stark.
Litwick: i do accept cloppers
Kid_Cobalt: lol
/me clops all over CCCP
CCCP: I know you ninja'd me as soon as I finished typing it up.
cloppers gonna clop
:|
^
but not really
if im in charge of someones bachelors party im going to hire a bunch of quantum physicists and have a lecture for the party
00,10is that spike?
lol DaringDude :D
/me buries her face in her hands
RAWRity: Whether he is or not, he helps carry The Avengers. That much is undeniable.
:) Shining Armor's Bachelor Party - 2 days after returning from the honeymoon 6_9
/me clops all over CCCP :D
Jking :P
O_o
I LOVE PINKIE PIE
RAWRity: So lacking him will hamper the movie significantly.
JK :d
05needs more fittign music
But i hate it how when i look up my little pony one of the first things i see is rule 34 IT PISSES ME OFF
CriticKitten: I guess. Personally I found Bruce Banner and Cappy to be more interesting.
Now that otakon shipping is SO 2011, we can now bring Meanwhile shipping!
/me dances
Gunthler: :[
Careless Whisper would fit for this.
CCCP: I FUCKING KNOW RIGHT?

CriticKitten: I wouldn't say he's the weakest. He's just the most outright "good" guy. If this were DnD, he'd be Lawful Good, while everyone is is Chaotic Good.
OH GOD THIS SONG

oh my god . . .
RAWRity: He's the weakest by virtue of the least screentime. The new characters got more time because they needed it, Banner got good banter time with Stark....but Capt settles into this leader role that isn't fully established.

Shizuka: nahhhhhhh........*hooves crossed*
Wrek if you somehow ad Colgate FlareChaser is going to be so happy

cachi01: No, that'll make FlareChaser happy.

I suppose he can, being all virtuous

Or not to buy overhyped games?

I heard Borderlands. I'm intrigued
kirz|art during zombie tiem ?

I didnt request anything! dont yell at me!
Thats what I thought.

Kirz|art: Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuughhhhhhtyyy
So RaveBrony, what are you drawing for Flare?
Ryanier128 YOU'RE STILL HERE?!?

Biglaw: thats private info..
gotta get the average up a bit to be 3.7 for maximum hilarity

/me pushes Biglaw away slowly
Well he never tried in the movie so maybe its still possible
SAI seems quite popular of late. Any reason to use it over photoshop/illustrator etc?
FlareChaser: OMGXD
03Unfortunately, the sales results will probably convince other publishers to opt for "always-on" DRM, but without a good game to back up the awful DRM, gamers may just save their money and get the pirated version instead.
RAWRity: Hulk couldn't pick it up with raw strength, that was the film pointing out that Thor's hammer is enchanted like in the comics. It would have thrown off that narrative if they showed Cap picking it up.
otakon: So then, you still convinced that this isn't Rule 34?
yes Samantha159, I'm back and there's nothing you can do about it
Hmm....
03there you are
03>Sonic 2 is out
not that cap could have done as much as thor with the hammer
03>You're nowhere to be found
03er
03*Sonic 4 part 2
Remember, this film is as much for people who have NEVER read the comics (like me) as folks who have.
in cap's hands its just a hammer in the hands of a slightly stronger than normal human
Rave Bracelets
CriticKitten: I know, but still...geek blue balls.
SunderlandPony89: it is NOT Rule 34, bc there is no nudity or "acts"
while thor happens to be a god
All of the extra things on the ponies seems borderline R34, not quite there yet.
Episode
i approve this drawing
and I played it you dolt lol
Ryanier128 if you here right now . . . aww screw it, I love you
03you know what
03LOL
05if i do like this
03...the entire game?
/me peeks into chat.
05its r34
Before it was even out
yep
03LOL
im starting to wonder
RAWRity: Not worth throwing off the narrative. Save it for Avengers 2 as a surprise.
was fun
/me smiles
This pic needs more naughty bits
Eyup
03right, tell me again how you aren't a hipster
/me runs
Woah....:D"
Episode Metal sucks though XD
otakon: ...but it's still sexual, so it's Rule 34
yeah i think so Wrek
y does somepony have my nickname?
worry*
um
He's worthy, sure. But what would he do Thor couldn't do on his own?
Its official. Its r34.
because I know a guy
who is
:P
make that a SITE
03so?
|D
RAWR
so
lol
03>I played it before it was out
05see the difference?
that's why it's just a nit pick. I have very few real, legitimate criticisms of the movie. It's mostly just little stuff I would have loved to see in there.
SunderlandPony89: it's called INNUENDO.
03nah
00,03Desppite not being R34, its still doesn't give us nice things...
and now everyone was just like: ADD FlareChaser and Colgate HUURHHHZLL and I was all like :|

I get my stuff from said site

nope
00,03Lace the back, you rule breaker!

They don't want to because of piracy
mfw leon kennedys VA also voices the merchant
:p
Xbox hax0rs
hmm
WHAT U BUYING?
Sumica: some times its in the front ^^
kenne: lol, hey looking forward to RE6?
as I said before. Trixie either is going to or just got back from a showing of the RHPS.
Ryanier128: then good for you. Not to sound callous, but I dont get attached to anything anymore, you see.
so leon talks to himself
00,03Why? Why did he have to use the blue?!?
Sumica they do. A wedding dress is very . . . discomfortable
otakon: hell friggin yes!
TheMaster: sounds about right
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN, MY BRAIN.....RED HOT.....STINGING.....PAIN!!!!! -- Ren Hoek
11,01But I am concerned about the bronyfunds challenge. I think people will take off with it in all the wrong ways.
03no, because Xbox is actually sane and doesn't allow evil DRM
03:P
kenne: Dragon's Dogma comes with the demo for it.
What the hell is on the screen?
if I went back to a showing i'd dress up as Brad Majors
ScooterHax0rNova: because he wants you to imagine and cock block you at the same time ^^
according to Samantha
otakon: i even bought that craptastic pile of doo doo that is ORC thats how much i like the RE series
1,3who else want to shoot zombies?
05me fucking with you Randomnerd
though maybe i'd go as Riff Raff. Always fun to do the time warp
00,03Randomnerd: The reason why we can't have nice things
I do kirzstryfe but only irl
otakon: just a demo or a beta?
so, no
kenne: wow, I heard ORC was lackluster, too bad.
11,01kirzstryfe: I'm firing my PC up.
kenne: full demo
otakon: lackluster is being generous.
otakon: i thought it was a beta
otakon: mfw people know what Dragon's Dogma is
00,10funny wrek, it looks more like Trixie fucking with meanwhile
and I dont own the game
I want DD, I cant afford it.
isn't that fancy pants?
Wrek -I not mad :D
Error37: nope, it's a full on demo from what i kno
00,03Oh Wrek, I coulda sworn you were Fucking ME!
otakon: i almost wwant to buy dragons dogma now, do you ahve to preorfder it?
WallDives: do what I did and trade in stuff to amazon to help cover the cost
Sumica: its funny because in a sense its all of those things fucking with each other.
I herd the record skip
Sumica that's what they want you to think
1,3oh blue screen of death, why do you always get in the way of my fun :3
Even better angle
kenne: no you don't, it's out next tuesday
why not kirzstryfe
otakon: then I cant participate in tournaments, cause I dont own the games I practice in.
. . . why the fuck am I still here?
00,03Kirz: Because it used the Blue Dye :|
Ryanier128: idk.
I did see some footage of Dragon's Dogma, and....eh?
otakon: you should give me the demo code
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/homework-class-test-because-who-isnt-a-fan-of-webdings.jpg

kirzstryfe: who else is gonna keep your dreams in check?
kenne: no, it's MINE DAMMIT!
00,10wait wut, Game of thrones: the game
02see, the reason I don't want to play it on my PC is because my PC is crap
02XD
Sumica: eeyup
1,3hehe, as if that little box could handle the job
otakon: sold those to cover moving expenses for next month. It just isnt happening.
Sumica: it's a RPG with Dragon Age like combat

sometimes i feel like im the only person who is tired of vulgarness...
13canary canary <33
O U Shizu
It's....kind of neat I guess? Climbing on big monsters IS a cool feature, don't get me wrong. I don't know if it makes up for the fact that you have to stab the monsters COUNTLESS TIMES to kill them.
WallDives: well that sucks man, you'l just have to wait
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/307/430/7eb.gif
03it's probably just as good as the Wii in other words.
Shizu Shizu :3
thats nice twilight_sprinkler
00,03Game of thrones: The Throne is Blue 
03anyway bbl shower
CriticKitten: well they are HUGE FRIGGIN MONSTERS!
What the what?
02LOL
Whoooooo!
02atleast the wii is met to play games
Game of Thrones. ALL THE THRONES.
otakon: But you have to stab them even moreso than is rational.
Game of THrones: The Game...........
I'm fine with that. Besides, I played Dark Souls. damn near beat it.
I get the impression that these two havent commited to any kind of excusive pair bonding.
00,03I swear to god, if that condom on her mouth is blue...
o.oooo

wait . . . god damn it
Sumica woudlnt really mind, as long as he finishes it
/me huggles LadyCanary and Shizuka Shizu Shizu and squees
otakon: I watched someone fighting the first big monster of the demo, some sort of griffin. The monster had THREE health bars, and each time the guy stabbed it, the monster lost less than 5% of its health.
well, we're fucked
13flaria canary <3
:D Flaria!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey, isnt this considered cheating on trixies and S. Armors part?
Ryanier128: now what?
:3
i will just get dragons dogma for resi 6
00,10that's not shining armor
also, spike chillin in the back.
spike is pim´´
Sumica, its not? then who is it?
Suddenly solo
pimp
norly
CriticKitten: that's what the pawns are for and why Fire spells kick ass. Hit a enemy with enough of them and they catch on fire, doning consistent damage.
The allure of climbing onto the monster RAPIDLY gets old once you realize you're still stabbing it a million damn times to kill it. If you integrate the climbing mechanic with "weak points" for higher damage then fine, it WORKS.
00,03Wait I just realized Shining Armor has a blue mane...
But it doesn't look like they did.
00,10Meanwhile supposedly
oh wow
00,03FFFFFUUUUUU-
1,3inb4 Caramel
WallDives I was afraid ScooterHaxOrNova might give Wrek an idea
Sumica, oh an OC :D
00,10hahaha
orly ScooterHax0rNova
1,3owait, Wrek's already done that one >.>
02my computer can't even play 1602 AD >.>
Meanwhile is a lucky pony XD
suddenly a pole
00,10wait he did?
00,03NO! No more rule breaking!
dat pole
1,3hehe, yes he did
/me suddenly wonders if ponies faces are identifiable without color and mane.
panda: Meanwhile HATES Trixie.
is a lucky pole
00,03YOU BROKE THE RULES!
00,10damn I missed that one
1,3wasn't one he streamed here
WallDives: WHAT! he hates her? why? D:
orly WallDives
DuskStarshimmer: yeah they are depending on the artist really
hiya panda
/me cries out the chatroom
Wrek, you are such a troll :D
also, I kinda feel dirty that I want Trixie in Fighting is Magic, but thats me.
Scoot-Scootaloo you've gone back to normal! . . . I don't expect it to last very long
00,10as i said, damn I missed it
otakon, bout time you said something to me ^^
otakon: If you're designing your combat to be realistic then you should try to be consistent about that. If you're allowing me to climb up on a monster's back and shank it in the back of the head, I expect to deal significantly more damage than if I'm stabbing it in the heel.
panda: what?
otakon, I'll take you work for it and hope its true,
CriticKitten: IT'S NOT FRIGGEN REALISTIC!
00,03I.. I can't handle...
otakon: I said hi to you about 40 minutes ago
portal is playable on my laptop
1,3need 3 people for a L4D2 Vs match, any takers?
FPS is decent
Actually, using a scar like that *is* kinda hot.
scarf*
Kirakura, im in
panda: Meanwhile hates Trixie, because he does. his reasons.
otakon: Then why bother with the climbing mechanic at all except to look cool?
>_>
panda: sorry, I'm falling asleep here
kirzstryfe,Im in*
Randomnerd x trixie
otakon: its cool ^^
/me pokes everypony
The Great and Powerful Meanwhile.
1,3DuskStarshimmer, do I have you on steam?
CriticKitten: so you can KILL HUGE THINGS besides just slashing at their kneecaps
WallDives, well i dont like her either... but for some reason the fandom kinda make me like her ya know?
nope just a sec
/me has been shipped.
Scoot-Scootaloo step away from the monitor and take a few deep breaths. Say "Rock Farm". I swear, it works
panda: to each their own. I dont have a favorite.
the great and powerful meanwhile x otakon
/me removes himself from dat crate.
CriticKitten: you can also pick up and throw your own pawns at large enemies, throw enemies at other enemies as well
00,03Okay... Rock Farm...
JanitorVarkian: dat great and powerful ship
ikr cachi01
00,03Hmm.. I guess that made me feel a bit better...
kirzstryfe http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorsummoner/
otakon: The entire reason they added it was to make the fighting seem more real. I *know* it's an RPG and I *know* it can't be 100% realistic, but don't give me the nonsensical excuse that you can have realism in the "climbing" mechanic, but a stab to the monster's head is equal in lethality to a stab to its kneecap.
WallDives: D: really? ^^ every pony is best pony?
Because then you've KILLED the novelty of the climbing.
thats nice CriticKitten
00,03wait... this band...
I'll just grab its ankle and slash away, rather than wasting time to climb up to the head. :P
panda: more like they're all at zero. -3+3 is still 0.
Scoot-Scootaloo just by saying "Rock Farm" can clear you mind instantly. It works for songs, ideas, and strange converstations you may be having with yourself
00,10I just noticed my Ogame planet is realy cold
i hear vices
WallDives, hm.. havent heard that one before XD
=/
00,10-35 to 5C
CriticKitten: are you a game designer? I forget
CriticKitten: that is the POINT, a stab to the head DOES do more damage then a stab to the kneecap. I trashed the Griffin in the demo in under 5 minutes bc I climbed on him and smote his feathery head while my blades were aflame.
02EW playing the PC version of Portal
00,10intersting pic to use for color samples
Mouse ftw
lol
or touchpad portal
:P
and coloring ^^
wait............someone here IS a game designer
00,03That... was really Trixie....
02unless you have one of those gamers PCs
The climbing mechanic is cool, don't get me wrong, but it needs to be supplemented with logic. If you expect players to climb up to the head, you really should let them deal more damage than if they slash at the ankles, else it's identical to not having the mechanic at all.
otakon: you?
why was Trixie sitting like Lyra?
Or
00,03GAHHHH! EVERYONE IS GONNA GET MAD AT US!
maybe if you had a half decent laptop
only Lyra sits like a human!
00,03NO! No more!
Scoot-Scootaloo: why?
http://www.bronythankyoufund.org/?q=node/9 wow
00,03I'm done, goodnight everyone!
CriticKitten: I just don't think you noticed it, too busy not trying to fall to your possible death
night Scoot-Scootaloo
night Scoot-Scootaloo.
cause portal doesn't even need much GPU/CPU power to run
bye Scoot-Scootaloo
i cant wait to see where this goes
night Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03Bunch of rulebreakers...
Scoot-Scootaloo: but... dont... oh ok night night ^^
I'll be taking the night too
02if I can find a game for PS3/xBox I play it on that
remember: Rock Farm
Scoot-Scootaloo: oi, I havent done nothin.
00,03<3
1,3isn't Meanwhile an Earth pony though?
Airpuff: night night ^^
CriticKitten: play it again and try to NOTICE how much damage attacks to the head do compared to the legs/body.
Good nigt 'Scoot
Scoot-Scootaloo: you know you wanna join us....
night Airpuff
wait, who here is the game designer >.>
otakon: I watched someone playing the demo who stabbed the griffin in the head for a very, very long time before it died, and he didn't seem to be doing any more than ankle-level damage. I said SIGNIFICANT. :p
kirzstryfe he was in the last pic
02if I had a decent PC maybe not
enjoy the stream *-*
this design is also incredibly similar to his last otakon pic
/me pokes LunaTheMaid back
CriticKitten: well I don't know, everytime I fought it it died damn fast
Anyway, I'm off to bed for the night guys
dat pimp
night otakon.
take care and dat Spike
/me doesn't know if he should still be here
night otakon
bye otakon
JanitorVarkian: Actually, yes, I am. Guess that disables your pointless aside about how only game developers can critize other developers, eh?
night otakon
Well the fact I can play it on an core i3 laptop (Intel HD 2000) means your PC is really bad.
See you all tomorrow for the Princess Bride stream hopefully!
id hate to see ya leave otakon but seeya
ddid I say that? CriticKitten?
night otakom
otakon: for sure ^^
02um
I thought I was planning to...
i mean cachi lol
Wrek: MAKE SURE TO FINISH THE BUCK DESIGN DAMMIT!
otakon: see u tomorrow ^^
Heck, even my PC's HD Radeon 4350 (Very bad) is better than the intel
JanitorVarkian: No but you rather heavily implied it.
bye all!
BronyCody: lol
kenne: I'm tired and it's late
cachi01, um... was scoot really that mad?
are they showing all the movies twice? I have to go to University tomorrow and the movies start at 11:00 am here
1,3Nittany_Discord, if you want in, one spot left
:) bye all take care!
/me giggles
panda: naah it was scoot being a silly filly
HRRNNGG
otakon: ive seen you up to 2 before, much much much later than it is now
/me hugs ot--- aww
02any computer that has a i3 processor is pretty good
I only asked you CriticKitten because I thought that you were one >.>
JanitorVarkian: Basically dismissing my argument with "lol but you don't make games". Except that a) I do in my spare time as a volunteer, and b) that has nothing to do with my ability to criticize a feature in a game. :p
I'll go if Nittany doesn't want to
cachi01, oh, is his drawing breaking the rules or something?
11,01OK.
2.13 ghz, not very good
11,01Give me 5 mins.
panda: wellll it has sexual content
3CPU: Intel Core i3 M 330, 2.13 GHz, 0 KB (6% Load)
panda: and pimp spike
cachi01, so if he erases the condom, its fine? right?
panda: and the lingirie
02it's not all about how much ghz it has
panda: i think lol
02mine is 3.20 ghz
JanitorVarkian: Again though, it doesn't matter. It's a silly feature unless it works properly. If I still have to shank the griffin fifty times in the head to kill it, I'm not sure I'm getting a very good deal. :p
cachi01 oh... haha but shes just wearing a corsette so nopony sees her rolls ^^
CriticKitten: I wasnt sure if you were a game designer, and then had a greater insight in the industry. I didnt mean to offend >.>
panda: xd
wow 140 ponies connected and just 20 are talking lol
00,10ever notice no one cares if a pony is nude, but if you start puting clothing on them.....
Granted you can't make it kill the thing in one shot. I know that. But fifty times....yeahno, that's just not fun. :P
02and it's just a Celoron D
dat perception.
hello
cachi01, well... to me its like this: If it doesnt make me erm... you know... its fine with me lol
Sumica: maybe being dressed for them is like being naked for us
JanitorVarkian: I suppose I'll let you off the hook this once. :p
I was talking about compared to any i3, not another line.
Yeah. That is wierd
indeed
panda: oooooo i know what u mean lol
And Celeron sucked in general
Same with P4
02yeah
once they go anthro all bets are off
cachi01: but the pole makes it even more suggestive...
=/ how did this change from a sitting pony to a pole?
00,10so that meens canterlot is full of a bunch of fetishist. and deveants.
panda: yeah O_O
Sumica: O_O THEY ARE?
I'm okay with that Sumica
or that Ponyville is a nudist colony.
Sumica: just liek real life!
00,10Darkts33, the magic of layers
Sumica: ya
thats sluttyville
02but i3, i5 and i7 are pretty awesome
JanitorVarkian: But, again, some of the best opinions tend to come from those who haven't developed games, honestly.
Hey you guys... I'll be back in 30 minutes, I have to get something to eat kk?
brb
k panda
mmmm ponyville nudist colony...giggity
00,10bye bye panda
panda: chat isnt going anywhere, hopefully.
Sumica: well not leaving... just getting a burger ^^
JanitorVarkian: You can hear a lot of good feedback from people who haven't made games but have just played an awful lot of 'em. Because they know what people will like.
/me watches how chat gets legs and starts walking
11,01Steam is borking on me.
:D
v3
ok CriticKitten
hurray for gmod ponies
it would be funny if he turned the pole into a lampost, gave trixie an umbrella and turned her into mary popins
hmmmm
/me pokes LunaTheMaid again
Well, Wrek is clearly drawing sexual attire on Trixie. And of course, the clothing the elites of Canterlot as seen in the cartoon are not sexual in nature.
JanitorVarkian: Personally, I like discussing game design, it's a hell of a lot of fun. :P
/me giggles again
for science!
so.... CriticKitten are ypu a Critic or something like that?
*you
00,10I kinda liked it better when it was a lap dance =p
I'm cynical and critical, yes.
05couldnt be assed sketchign the colt too :P
Which is why nopony will ever love me. :D
sumica: lap dances are best dance

yeah, I like discussing game design, but I dont know a whole hell of a lot about it... except that which I do >.>
i'll be in my bunk
lol
Spike is pimping.
then it went boom
00,10understandable wrek.
ok kids what did we learned from this episode?
well, CriticKitten Im sure you'll find some other cynical, critical bastard that'll slightly like you >.>.... not sure if that was a complement or not
pie is yummy
I'm back. What did I miss?
cachi01: Trixie is sexiest poni?
00,10Honistly I figured that would be the case some time ago when I said einb4 you replace em with a poll
uhmmmm yeaah
Nonsense. :p
but also
cachi01: that if Trixie gives me a lapdance, she will be best pony, no exceptions?
we learned that lingirie is expensive
. . . not much I see
WallDives: yeah also
Ryanier128: you were hoping for something different?
and so trixie has a lingirie spell
so yes
this may or may not be true.
oh joy, matlab likes to die from critical errors too
norly Ryanier128
/me 11,01explodes
Stockins mmmm
inb4 garter belt
my god, Wrek is still drawing? :O
JanitorVarkian: Not concerned about it anyways. As I said, CK ships with no one. There's a reason for that. :p
/me is in a constant state of explosion
i think Wrek should add audience
Rain: Problem with that??????
thats fun CriticKitten
not really though
Sumica don't give Wrek any ideas! We narrowly avoided that with Scoot-Scootaloo
I'm playing Call of Duty 2 for the first time.
00,10but I have great ideas
phobos2390: Sweet. It's a pretty good CoD game
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 4Caterpie.
no, Kid_Cobalt. You miss understood me. I love it when Wrek draws. Im surpriesed that I am lucky enough for him to still be drawing after having to be away for so long
This is the first fps game I have ever played. I got it on steam today.
Sumica nobody has only good ideas
phobos2390: im s sorry phobos.....
Phobos2390: that was the time when Infinity Ward's ppl wasnt fired
why did you choose cod 2 for the first fps to play?
phobos2390: Congrats man. I would also reccomend CoD4. Best CoD game EVER
if there is audience, there should be one pony with a trench coat, hat and an obvious moustache
00,10true but i keep the bad ideas to my self
phobos2390: im so sorry u had to start with a great game...
Rain: And you misunderstand me. Regardless of what your respponse was I would have responded back jokingly and light heartedly ^-^
13aww it broke up the dream team again :<
and will end with the deception of its followers..
/me facepalms
*spelling
JanitorVarkian: Yeah, it's not
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: but I would be too obvious...
JanitorVarkian: Actually it's fine AFAIC. Don't have time for that sort of thing, and can't afford it either. My college debts will own me until the day I die, most likely. :p
00,10that sucks Shizuka.
11,01I wanted to play with Shizuka :<
/me hugs Shizuka
00,10damn random teams
/me eats the pie

Hey Rain

11,01:<
00,10oh look an audance
02installed what?
....
02derp

cachi01: I just haven't ever felt the need to until now. Technically it is not the first fps I've ever played but it's the first fps I have personally purchased and played.
Okay, can't resist.
diablo III
an audance?
02ah
Shizunom.avi?
11,01I still <3 you Shizuka.
00,10on stream, Rain

Rain!!!!!!!
sure
lol
eeyup
/me hugs LadyCanary <3
/me hugs Rain <3
/me glomps Rain
cachi01: I don't plan on playing them. I'm really just looking into these games just to say that I have given FPS's a try. I am enjoying the game currently. I just don't think it is going to be the only game I will ever play.
/me and LadyCanary
/me isnt sure if she knows Ryanier128
xxXRorauroraXxx
dat obvious pony in the audience xD also is that epic sax spike ?
*again
/me runs
phobos2390: If you can, I'd HIGHLY reccomend Bioshock for an FPS
my city just got a little shake}
noooo
o-o
I might just use sareii
but I want something more
05i highly recommend Deus Ex as a good FPRPG
gameish
or skyrim
cachi01: Damit who divided by zero in your city???
02Diasareii
02?
cachi01: sry I didn't mean to party that hard
I DID!
Hmm...I'm not sure yet. I'll try to get back to you once I am done with Call of Duty 2. I purchased it along with the original.
please tell me you're joking lol...
I'm back gu.... HELLO!
my sight is gettin bad, the sing reads "not meanwhile" ?
Kid_Cobalt: xDDD its funny cause yesterday i was oh uhmm........oh shit
00,10so how does a pony pole dance work? they put on more clothing?
flutter_spin: SEXY TRIXIE!
And there's Meanwhile in the trenchcoat.
Rain you probably don't, so I'll give you a quick description: I'm Canadian and SamanthaGirl159 is my new fiance who I proposed to on Sunday. We were both in a car crash on Monday that left me in crutches
hi flutter_spin
I highly recommend Wrek streams to help pass the time and learn what good art is.
I have a question. What is United offensive?
00,10Dem bits
Sumica i asked the same thing :p
02nono, diablo9001
phobos2390: Erhm, in what context?
Did some thorough reading on proper writing :P
that sucks, Ryanier128 :<
ok
It was exhausting
Uggh, today I kind of broke everything :p
Needs moar moostache
Sumica: Yes.
Bed timeee, Good night everypony!! Take care and have fun!! :)
Ryanier128: damn im sorry
it's bad enough battlenets require numbers at the end
00,10hope it pays off flutter_spin
night RaveBrony
night, RaveBrony
Night RaveBrony
Unmuting stream again
night RaveBrony
but that's so that I can choose whatever name and it'll be mine, even if it's not unique
Ryanier128: Sorry that happened to you. But mfw you're engaged?!
I hope so. I was quite surprised at the number of things I DID RIGHT! :P
Cya RaveBrony!
SunderlandPony89: I purchased the War chest pack (don't quote me on that) and got the original, 2, and united offensive.
they're awwful
Ryanier128: Holy crap, that's awful! Feel better
well, Ryanier128 you're still alive, right?
kinda like weeaboos
imo
yes I am LadyCanary
for $30
oh gawd my ears
Bye, RaveBrony
05have soem techno
00,10well you had to do alot right flutter_spin, eles it would have been unreadable
and I'm much better now that Samantha FINALLY calmed down
phobos2390: Another CoD game I'm sure
wrek do you have Justice?
nooooooooo the techno IT BURNS
only techno son i like is invaders must die
/me bobs to the beat
song*
SunderlandPony89: Probably. Maybe a spin-off.
00,10so what would you call a pony "strip" club?
02EW weeaboos
Wubwubwub
Hey, I like this better than some of the regular music that he plays.
lol, thanks Sumi.
she was so stressed this week
Sumica: hay strip club
Saddles
Sumica: Pony Dress Club
Sumica: i call it giggity
05show-mares
^
lol
Blazing Saddles
hah
/me heald cachi01 techno burns with liquid beatles
Ryanier128: blazing saddles sounds like they all have stds
00,10lol no I meen cause they seem to put on clothing to become sausy
Sumica: A Dress Club
Wrek one word to describe the drawing, BuckingAwesome
00,10instead of striping
Ingwaz I'm drunk
Saucy Mares.
Ryanier128: no excuses!
00,10and yes wrek I like that name
DeathStar: not a fan of beatles..... but thx!! lol
05owned and run by cleptospike
phobos2390: Not to sure it would be a spin-off, probably just an expansion pack type game of some kind
thats... good? I guess Ryanier128?
strippers remind me of....
Oh, you want a club name? Hm, can't use "Dizzy Donkey" since that's my idea for a pony-based pub....
strippers
Obviously ponies find clothes kinky. Maybe they're 'dressers'
I need to mop first
I hear canadians do that Ryanier128
cachi01 :|
then I'll decide
stfu Ingwaz I'm drunk, crippled, and engaged
00,10if that's keptospike where is his hat?
i like TheMaster's idea
cachi01: your welcome and you clearly haven't herd run for your life
Ryanier128: the good news is that two of those are your fault.
DeathStar: no i havnt
and considering how many clothes rarity wears...
lol
we do JanitorVarkian. My best friend is a Newfie
SunderlandPony89: I dunno. I just got the three games for $30 and I will be satisfied for a while.

02I have a few friends who are weeaboos. It gets soo annoying after awhile
03That sounds showing-offish to me
that is true WallDives
and that you're still alive to be all three.
eeyup'
a waht Ryanier128
03scanning emails for viruses, so pointless LOL
Hey SuperBrony64 you there?\
00,10so that meens rarity is running a kink shop
Yep!
gotta go guys! cya!
Sumica ;)
bye FlareChaser!
00,10then again she does have alot of saddles and bridles
You know, I suddenly want to see a fully grown spike wearing a scaled up version of his pimp hat
someone needs to write this.
02drf, you would be surprised
/me dances on Ryanier128 s head
uh oh. I think I had too many wheat thins. I'm getting sick to my stomach
See ya later FlareChaser|L4D2!
JanitorVarkian a Newfie is somebody from Newfoundland. They're the "Crazy Drunk Sex Party" people
and they are AWESOME!
ah, those people
00,10WallDives, I am sure it's been done.
Sumica: why do you think she was so eager to get twilight in to that saddle?
flutter_spin I can eat a whole box. they're bucking awesomde
I want to know those people Ryanier128
probably.
02Attachments can have anything on them
00,10ohmy~
05this saddle?
03yes, but >false positives
flutter_spin: I told ya' if ya' ate all thos wheat thins you were gonna get a wicked bad tummy ache.
lol
Music isn't helping!
btw Ryanier128 im 'Murican
00,10indeed wrek
phobos2390: I'd also reccomend Crysis 2. One of the best and longest FPSs I've played in awhile
^
rarity likes to pretend she's high class but obviously she services another side of ponyville. I can't imagine all the ponyvillians need fancy dresses all the time
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy1RW2Atigc
03LOL what
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Teachers Dancing Behind Students | by | Length: | Views:
OH MY
Kid_Cobalt I can eat an entire box, and feel fine
hnnnnnnnnnnggggggggg....................
DAT PLOT
wrek, i meant the ticket master episode saddle
I can't tell whether I should stay or go. Does it make sense to say I want less saucy by her taking off her clothes?
00,10ah there is spikes hat.
Well I was walking down the side walk carrying Eddywhen I saw a bug. Hello bug! I followed the little dickens to this tree then I hit my head on the branch! *Bonk* Nope sorry it was this 1. *Bonk* Then I gazed at the stars.
not really flutter_spin
*Eddy's
flutter_spin: Not really.
Wait, if clothing is saucy, does that make Canterlot Vegas?
must resist clopping urge......
Biglaw: that was kind of a left field response but thanks for the input anyways I suppose.
00,10guess we now know what trixie has been up to sence loseing her showcart.
flutter_spin: only wih ponys
SunderlandPony89: I'll think about it. For now, all I want to do is play a few FPS's to get more of a feel for the genre.
When Trixie returns I wonder what EQD will look like
phobos2390: crysis is a really nice fps
00,10nah they already have a pony vegas
I'm glad I didn't go with that Sumi in my fic
Kid_Cobalt I love wheat thins. :)
I've said too much.
dat is totally not meanwhile
If seth finds out about this, Game over man, game over!
me too Biglaw
Sumica: Ya' gotta use whatcha got to get whatcha want in this world kid..
00,10might have been funny flutter_spin
Wrek, this is looking glorious
Yeah but *puts hoof in mouth* comes after
phobos2390: Kewl, kewl. Plenty of FPS I can reccomend and plently I can advise you to stay away
...from
Sumica well she is a showmare
Biglaw: well dont eat too many guy, or your gonna get a wicked bad tummy ache.
I want to go back up to Canada...
05oh look
well Trixie is a showmare. She didn't say all she did was be a stage magician.
05their new album is out
The only FPS you ever need, battlefield 2
05lets listen to it
I didnt even know that newfoundland was like that Ryanier128, so no I dont think of them like that
SunderlandPony89: Yeah...
Justice? Cross album?
00,10gonna be hard to find a good color for her outfit.
And then there is the part with Wrek... uhhhh .... well he does stuff
Trixie chillin like a villain
Kid_Cobalt I am Biglaw, I shall eat as many as I want! :D
WallDives you left? Mah gawd . . .
TheMaster , yeah, It was completly Treixiefied just from that small mention from Rainbow Dash. imagine a WHOLE episode
I like the way this tune huts my ears its that loud
Biglaw: then grab some cider and a box of those wheat thins and bro hoof me /)
I just want them to give the nod for 12 additional episodes for season 3.
/me touches trixie
00,10sounds......kinky flutter_spin
Then I will be happy
DAMMIT ITS HOT
*one
/me brohooves Kid_Cobalt, and shares some wheat thins
Its rated E if you really want to know, but I've caught what I wrote to sound... saucy sometimes
JanitorVarkian yeah, you would be surprised. I suggest reading "How To Be Canadian *even if you are already one"
00,10honistly TheMaster, I am sure it's already in the works
so funny
TheMaster: I'm buying as much as I can!
I know but. ;-; my heart can't go on being unsure.
00,10I just cant see them dumping Studio B like that
How episode's are there gonna be in season 3?
Besides Wrek goes on about ... I mean , he says stuff
/me hides
03EW NORTON
flutter_spin: so erotic then right? I mean if your gonna say sausy why not go ahead and go the whole 9 yards?
20 whatever hours of content ISN'T ENOUGH
I regret not participating and donating MLP stuff to Toys for Tots.
Ima go see if I have wheat thins :3
lol Kid....
00,10we know they have at leat 13 eps in the works and that studio B is not doing them
LOL Biglaw
has anypony here taken on the Ultimate Brony Challenge?
D:
no.
wait. what? studio b isn't doing episodes anymore?
what!?
dont have time...
what?
Ryanier128: nope where can i found it?
Biglaw: I'd reccomend Triscits. Much better :)
ew everything escape MalWareBytes
02Norton is pretty good. It just cost way too much money now for what it is
find*
dhx
Sumica, Studio B isnt doing them? :<
except
Sumica: :O Then who is!?!
that makes me sad..
00,10no I am just taking of what is confermed TheMaster
I cannot get that much time alone.
02>$80
confirmed WHERE
So far, I am enjoying Cod2 and am satisfied.
cachi01 look it up. It's on "My Little Brony", a section on Memebase dedicated to MLP
give me source
03Norton is absolutely awful
Ryanier128: thx
00,10fffffff, you all are gonna make me go look it up on eqd arnt you.
02why do you think that? Xd
and since when did Studio B stop doing MLP?
normally it takes seasons of time for them to get rid of all the original creators who made a show great. how could they do such evil things? why does the hub and hasbro hate money and fame?
yes we are Sumica
03because it doesn't detect anything?
since season 3 apparently
WAIT I TAKE IT BACK!!!
Mcafee is horrible
00,10no one said they stoped
I once freaked when I read "Rainbow Dash VA isn't going..." and then I realized they meant something else
03and the only stuff it DOES detect isn't a virus
I beleive ya Sumica.
. . . shit, too late
03yeah, Norton and McAfee are equally garbage
Rain: then have some cider and some decent convo with your fellow bronys and "smile smile smile, fill the world up with sunshine sunshine"
00,10I said what we know
02EW Mcafee
I dunno though. I think overall, the FPS genre is overrated. I am just enjoying this game.
Alas, I have no wheat thins...
I still can't believe the reference of MLP in Diablo 3
02Norton 360 does drf
wait, waht Ryanier128
Kid_Cobalt, what the hell are you talking about..?
Biglaw: Hahahahaha
00,10the rumor mill is saying that we will get 26, 13 from new company and 13 from studio B
03No
03it doesn't
02donno about other types of Norton
why would they dump studio B though?
00,10No one said they did
any milky ways Biglaw ?
Are they keeping the music people? the animators?
Rain: pfff.....i'll be honest. I don't even know anymore.
02Norton 360 never comes with PCs btw
/me dances on TheMaster s head
Norton= Waste of space
If I had a ti..stop that deathstar
Sumica: hmm These other poeple better do a good job! :[
Mcafee- Waste of space and slows your PC down
02^
this argument=waste of time
:P
^that
Wait.... a new company animating the first half of the season?
03Real pros don't even need antiviruses, LOL
TheMaster: but but :'(
its a candy bar, Biglaw.
JanitorVarkian I don't know, I just felt like doing something like that to see the reactions
03just don't download random 30kb exe files that appear to be music
03and you shoudl be good
Do you want to get erased out of time and space?
so, no confirmation sumica?
>.>
This is going to be a high-stakes experiment in consistancy
:(
Well I has no candy
05yay or neigh on the hat?
Wrek your art skills have improved, I'm proud
:(
TheMasters can you do that?
Only 1 problem she cleans them with wubs.
02drf, things happen
This is sounding..... interesting.
I can do that you know. I'm mag..time lord.
g2g everypony night!!!!!!!!
hmm
YES THE HAT.
yay
03but with the amount of porn sites BlueFlare goes to, I understand why he wants one
/me runs
bye cachi01
night cachi01
Wrek zoom it out so we can see her whole body
TheMaster: no :(
Oh Hi CCCP! *glomps*
Good evening everypony
Trixie has a hat now? At least she knows how to play TF2 now
Goodnight cachi01!
KEEP THE HAT. BECAUSE IT'LL PISS OFF MEANWHILE.
02:|
hi NickleBack
NIGHT NickleBack
lol
Anyway, I'm going to have to brb. I have to do something.
02stop calling yourself BlueFlare
Night NickleBack
/me hides
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L3V3S1wjpdw/TMLbt2qDfkI/AAAAAAAAAR4/dkkrL6dcvd0/s1600/milkywayfunsize.jpg you know... Milky Ways
hi NickleBack
Wrek: Considering that putting on clothing is the equivalent of taking it off in "pony stripping" Im gonna go with yay..
00,10hat is a nice touch
03your jokes are bad and you should feel bad
Greets to all
00,10also it lets you know who it is
have her outfit on the ground by that dude, Wrek
So obviously the height of sensuality in equestria is wearing a burqa.
Oy. dat pony.
DeathStar, CCP, Ryanier128 howdy
:(
NickleBack I suggest running. For your sanity. Now
also, how is Diablo III, rawra?
TheMaster: lol
Sumica: cutie mark doesnt give it away?
/me dances on NickleBack s head
CCCP I feel broken :p
Mareabia is the kinkiest land in equestria
I lost mine a long time ago
Biglaw: :(
if there is a new company doing the first half, and studio b doing the second half, then that means that each company can spend more time on their half than having to split it up. Quality increse predicted by Rain.
Arabian is a breed of horse, ya know
Fixes Biglaw
rather than*
Rain that's actually a good idea
CCCP I tripped and scraped my knee and pulled a muscle in my left shoulder :(
/me would be a donkey
Yes, but its not punny enough just being 'arabia' since its also called that here
This is some nice techno, but I got to go soon
What kind of magic is this?
sexy magic
00,10at a glance Kid_Cobalt
that sucks Biglaw :(
02Not all viruses/malware is user error
/me dances on NickleBack s head
Saddle Marabia?
3Well even stuff like firefox has antivirus nowadays
its the magic of Wrek, the sexiest and most powerful magic there is.
if only meanwhile were here . . .
Randomnerd: and grannysmith was the name of a brand new baby filly. interesting facts deserves interesting responses. ~Kid
The Saddle family has ruled in Mareabia for generations.
03I beg to differ, BlueFlare
CCCP it does, can't really move my shoulder too much without it hurting
quite.
:(
02are*
Ryanier128 I already lost my sanity :P
Oh, my... I cannot remember all the bad puns we made a few months back. we must have had 40 or more lame jokes.
00,10gonna take me a bit to find this info on eqd
Biglaw what happened to you?
I was honestly thinking imagining what the opening to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic might look like if it were made to be Sharia compliant.
all the ponies are depraved and hedonistic. They wear full burqas.
I have my sanity.
because being insane got boring.
im so sadz
Ryanier128 an intense game of grounders and tripping in a parking lot :p
I don't think they'd approve.
Sumica: what info you looking for?
since...celestia and all
I'VE LOST ALL SANITY! :P
expoded
05so much wub :|
uhh
/me explodes
Derpy is not crazy! She's just clumsy.
hi FlareChaser! *cleans up remains*
Biglaw that is so much fun when your drunk
And we <3 her.
00,10trying to find the post where it says 13 eps for s 3 confermed and it's not studio B doing them
/me hands Ponies47 some sanity "I found this under the couch"
DID SOMEONE SAY DRUNK? did they?
Ryanier well I'm not of drinking age, so I wouldn't know
I was trying to find that too...
:(
03Ad Muncher makes a better anti-malware than actual antivirus programs
I have decided to explode *explodes*
FlareChaser Ryanier128 did
This is some sexy Dupstep
can't wait to see this when finished
/me must not get drunk and sing the "Find A Pet" song at the Hey Ocean concert in NYC
00,10problem is every one asumes that meeens studio B is out rather then jsut being more secretive and doing their own 13 eps
Biglaw: does this mean I can get drunk now?
FlareChaser no, you are angry drunk.
Does anyone know the artist or the song?
FlareChaser I'm drunk
dat netflix
THEY KNOW
koso, i haven't started
Biglaw: whooo said that? I am already druuuunk!
Randomnerd: I think you accedently added not in that sentence
I just installed it
Ryanier128: not drunk enough!
Sumica: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/top-draw-production-board-includes.html
now I'm trying to come up with a decent battlenet tag
Well, it's the whole irony that combines a religious law that treats women as 2nd class citizens with a world that is prodominantly female. I honestly don't think there will be too many people comfortable about this.
FlareChaser *facehoof*
02besides, I bet the reason HML thinks i3 processors are slow is because he has so many viruses on his PC from not having anything installed on it :P
plus, I've no idea which class to use
DeathStar: Thanks. But I'm still grossed out by a fanfic I just listened to a reading of 0_0
ugh :(
03no, i3 processors *are* slow
...dat sexy mare.
i'm torn between Wizard, Monk, and Witch Doctor
mm
00,10Thanks Ingwaz
DeathStar: looooool
03i5 and i7 are good... i3 is the little sister version
ah ok
Sumica: i think thats what you're looking for. and actually i saw a lot of people saying just what you were saying about it
Ponies47: oh dear
FlareChaser I got hurt today :(
Witch doctor lolol
You know. I organized with my suitemates, repeated pizza parties up to 12-13 college people to watch my little pony all night. It was suprisingly succesful
Biglaw: hows that?
00,10and yeah
WallDives Samantha won't let me :'(
^lol
that one sounds legit
Wow, how did I miss that post?
that pissed her off
witch doctor looks awesome
DeathStar: I gotta stay away from the bad ones :P
but so does monk
/me sighs
and as for magician, dunno I feel like that would be fun
I was searching for it too Sumi. I guess its an obscure posting
FlareChaser well, pain isn't the funnest thing, but I guess it's better than chores
02well yeah, but he makes them out to be really slow and I've used demos that have it on them before
...
wizard
00,10I just cant see them dumping a company doing such a good job so honistly I belive it will be two companys makeing 13 eps each
esrdtfhg
03can't you just switch whenever you want?
DeathStar: BUT I CAN'T! :[
Biglaw: hey chapter 11 is out! imma go read it! :D
00,10Ingwaz posted it for us
05and that concludes the rough sketch
Wow that is some impressive art mate :D
two companies? oh god, double the pony?
flutter_spin: all i did was search for season 3 in the search bar on eqd
00,10color time wrek?
FlareChaser you do that
AFAIK, it means that when outside, women are REQUIRED to wear burqas at all times and they have to have a male escort.
It looks fantastic Wreky :3
Ponies47: oh silly filly
<3 Wrek <3
I wouldn't mind hour+ long pony specials ala doctor who
like the season finale
I've had this laptop since Sept 2010
and no viruses
ever.
lol poor meanwhile
DeathStar: I know :(
No active anti-virus either
so
drf, no
Wrek: Will you be drawing again tomorrow and if so when?
I have a tendency not to believe everything that goes on EQD :P
00,10meanwhile got replaced with a poll
wut did i just pop in on?
TheMaster who didn't like the Season Finale?
nobody, thats who
Derpy_Hooves88: greatness.
00,10that is a good stance flutter_spin
03like you can't just make a new character if you get bored?
unless you were asking that to something else
02how would you know HML? some viruses hide
oh ok
you can
00,10but generaly if they link a source check it out
Biglaw: Dick Y R I NOT IN THIS?
Sumica: while i see the logic in your argument, i also see the potential reasoining in the argument that it might just go to 65 eps and stop as that is apparently the trend. While i am hopeful, ia m also concerned
I like that change.
but that requires playing the story again
well by everypony, you wont be seeing me much any more :(
03heh
a virus wouldn't be very competent if it couldn't hide itself somehow
i'm just saying. If they wanted to make a doctor who spin off of my little pony, I would hand them more money thant hey could know what to do with
I'd like to stick with one save file right now
Even DHN tends to say "looks like EQD got it wrong. We have proof..."
Derpy_Hooves88 run now. Get youself and any sanity you have left out of here right now
Derpy_Hooves88: nothing out of the ordinary....trixy stripping....ya da ya da
00,10Hasbro is not gonna let go of it. they wont shoot for sindecation
I would personally fly David Tennant to canada/US to supply the voice
02Exactly
DeathStar: The guy who was reading the fanfic started screaming after he finshed reading it.
Derpy_Hooves88 do it before it's too late
03well if a virus doesn't *do* anything, then what's the point LOL
I haven't had a single BSOD either
trixie stripping? oh ok, thats normal
And exactly DRF
Ponies47: oh that's not good
she's not stripping. she's clothing
at least its not derpy
i have mad respect for her
If the 'virus' does nothing
in equestria putting clothes on is what's kinky
DeathStar: IKR
and Mbam doesn't pick anything up
or Rainbow Dash
wait what Ponies47 ? What?
dunno, Monk is fast and I love playing as fast characters, wizard has a lot of fun skills, witch doctor as well
00,10also sindication is best if you are aiming for more then 65 eps, not stoping at it
the more clothes the kinkier
oh fuck
Derpy_Hooves88: now that would be interesting.....
02drf, they slow your computer down and *can* steal your info?
Then there is nothing bad on here
Derpy Derpy Derpy Derpy
Sumica: that would certainly be the most logical thing to do, i agree, but recently companies have shown me they don't always follow what i consider to be very clear logic. honestly, i'd like mlp to go on for as longa s possible
Nittany_Discord for some reason decided to DC me, reconnecting
03well there you go, if your computer doesn't randomly slow down...
Derpy Derpy Derpy
Kid_Cobalt: I couldnt look at it. would feel wrong, wrong personality.
...What language is this song in? o_o
Wrex is still working?
00,10think of 65 eps as the soft cap not the hard cap
Most viruses are fake antivirus programs now
03I've had Malwarebytes on here (in active mode, too) for the past couple years and the only virus it's detected is the false-positive of bluesun's Dream World hacker
03yeah
As long as they have a big budget and arn't morons (the biggest issue) they won't kill the goose that laid the golden egg
Just saying, I hope they let MLP:FIM go when its still good, Not drag out 100 episodes, steadily getting crap
Pretty obvious when you get them.
What I liked about the last episode: http://derpy.me/vZuuB
03those things are such a pain
For some reason it sounds like Hebrew. derp.
03honestly, Ad Muncher is the way to go
flutter_spin: I was listening to a fanfic reading. I twas so nasty. Infact it was so nasty the guy who was reading started screaming after he finshed
Rain: the problem is we have no proof if its they need help doing 13 eps while dhx does the other 13, or if top draw is doing the only 13 eps
03since there's really only two ways you get viruses
we'll know when FIM has jumped the shark when they...make a movie
I think its sweedish
031. Be a complete idiot and download files without even thinking
Huh.
WallDives: oh shut up and do it are you a foal or a colt!
OHAI
Probably is, Golakka
00,10dat rideing crop
a tv show getting a movie is the death call..is that a whip?
032. Accidentally click on ads that look like they have an "X" button but really don't
LOL. Oh man.
Kid_Cobalt: I dont draw.
riding crop
03Block the ads, eliminate #2
....
03and as for 1, nothing can help you but maybe solitary confinement? :P
05actually i wouldnt be suprised if its hebrew
IT IS IN HEBREW.
Ingwaz, problem is that you have no proof that they arent just getting help. Everyone is likely over reacting'
Lyra's one of my favorite Background Ponies
screaming AFTER finishing is a bad sign
OH SHEET.
Oh, im back and thats a lovely drawing Wrek :D
Golakka: a show doesnt have to go bad after 100 eps
02those are just the main ways you can get one
WallDives: ohhhhh.....I thought you were talking about watching wrek draw derpy stripping....
Her name's fun to say. "Lyra" . . .
I didn't know israel had techno bands
I'm drunk
I'd be happy if I could just outline a pony
Col hazman. THAT'S IN FREAKING HEBREW.
flutter_spin: eeyup
And Im understanding a bit of the song @_@
03well
:3
Kid_Cobalt: I'm saying that would be something I couldnt look at.
Is it me, or has this chat grown over the weeks?
I know Ingwaz, Generally shows start to get crappy the longer they go on
LadyCanary: you understand hebrew?
00,10TheMaster, infected mushroom
once a tv show gets a movie then all is lost. its way to much money, executive meddling and they bring in new movie people and the show is never the same again.
03I rest my case :P
Rain: that part is not a problem, i don't require proof that theyre not getting help, i require proof that they are
simpsons, spongebob...every time
05currently listenign to infected mushrooms latest album released quite recently
WallDives: oh in that case...shut up and do it are you a foal or a colt!
LadyCanary I'm still working out the lyrics to "Ballad of the Goddes"
05havent heard it before so listenign through all songs
I hope they lay MLP:FIM To rest at a good time, Before it has a chance to rot and decay
Hey now. If "Q" wants to do a doc on bronies, not all is lost
Golakka: generally shows dont do this well and have such creative talents behind them
Ingwaz you are just paranoid :p
00,10i like it wrek
Rain: only the paranoid survive
11,01Chrysalis: I didn't vote-kick.
Kid_Cobalt: I have my reasons, quiet child.
a documentary isn't the same as a animated movie.
WallDives: I was in a Hebrew school for 8 years. I can read it and write it, but cant understand certain parts.
00,10then again i have always liked there tracks
Wrek: i would not mind being that pole
Heh, a live action my little pony movie.
that would be hilariously awful
TheMaster: Perfect example Spongebob
Hey everypony
LadyCanary: interesting.
Wrek, infected mushroom? arent they the spanish band who did "I'm going insane" ?
ohai DerpStar.
TheMaster: NO
WallDives: Kid! the term to use is quiet "KID"
05israelic and yes
MLP:FIm live show is terror
directed my M. Night Shamylan
oh dear Ingwaz
I see we have a trixie in the works
Anyway, I figure Twilight Sparkle's male escort would be Spike. Applejack's escort would be Big Macintosh. Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash have nobody other than their pets as longshots for male escorts. And Rarity? How about one of the diamond dogs?
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/homework-class-test-ideally-this-would-happen-with-more-parents2.jpg
02either way, it's just smarter to have some sort of anti-virus on your PC
the twist is. IT WAS EARTH ALL ALONG
^
Wrek israili? they sounds spanish ^^
00,10i have a awsome 5 hour track from this group
Also spike
03right, but it's not smarter to PAY for said anti-virus
Ryanier128: what?
03just get Malwarebytes
She reminds me of something. I can't figure it out. .. ... something magical.. ...
03honestly
male escorts? what?
DeathStar: :3
WallDives: ya' darn teenagers with ya' rockin rollin music and your 8 track tapes........
its going to drive me crazy
Spike has one in each arm :p0
WAIT! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PONY?
/me sighs
Well Hi Everyp- OH GOD WHAT IS THIS NO!?!?!?
02some people just want to be extra safe
03most of the brand name ones are terrible, because anybody who knows anything about making viruses can just program around those
DeathStar: Dances :d
lol welcome Aircrafter
It's Nauuuuuuuuughty
I CAN'T SPEAK SPANISH! (nor do I want to)
Ingwaz why would you want to be a pole? . . . oh, I get it now. Stupid drunk brain
Is that Spike in the background?
Aircrafter: you know you like it
05anotehr one added to the chock counter
Ryanier128: ....
also seth is in the audience, covertly
00,10oh hi Aircrafter
Ingwaz: ...Shut up <_<
Ohai Aircrafter
05what spanish Ponies47?
03hence why Norton and McAfee suck, because they've been around for so long it's child's play to disable those and make your stuff not detected
So this IS Infected Mushroom?
Ingwaz I told you I was drunk
05still hebrew i think
This is hebrew
Hi sumica, flutter_spin, CanaryL- I mean, LadyCanary.
It is, Wrek.
When seth sees this, Concequences will never be the same again
Ryanier128: no excuse
DeathStar:
its that hat. That hat looks just like the little tihing in my memory
a good name for a band it seems
00,10wrek is having so much fun with this drawing between chat reactions and just geting to draw
ANYPONY WANT PAINT TOOL SAI? xD
02Kaspersky free trial has been pretty good
stfu Ingwaz we've been through this before
Does EQD make money at all? I remember reading that Seth spends most of his time managing the site
I would love to know who composed that last song, Wrek. I liked it!
Lol Epic Phwoto :3
while trixie certainly does make a good "showmare", i think pinkie could give her a good run ;)
O_O WAIT! WAIT! Thats Tr-....Oh god. Fav Pony forever ruined.
00,10should have seen it earlyer Aircrafter. The pole was originaly Meanwhile
GaP Trixie Pony is Best Pony
03why, did you go download viruses to test?
03:P
Aircrafter: trixie is your fav?
fucking bitch is sitting like a human!
Wrek: IDK?
02LOL
:D
ONLY LYRA SITS LIKE A HUMAN!
03because seriously
Aircrafter: but that picture made her a ordinary pony to one of my favorites.
03the only time you can really tell if an antivirus is worth its weight in salt
TheMaster: i imagine they get some money from advertisements, its also probably funded through other means
03is when you actually NEED it
IMO.
03so go infect yourself with something and then we'll see who's talking
/me runs
Afternoon.
02well yeah
The brony mafia probably keeps it going.
hi XAX
be back later everypony.
hello XAX.
uuuuuuuhhh Wrek?
00,10intersting place you picked to color first.
02not going to risk it :|
^
haha.
im actually home now >_>
bye Gunthler
XAX, don't look at the stream! you're too young :P
mmmm trixie
/me Zzzz
>143 people watch wrek color in a ponies private places
lol
guilty.
02it does scan everything before you download, which is good
Mutterguy: i wasnt going to, but you had to say that.
XAX: I hope your body is ready for some RULE 34
/me falls asleep
yes
there's another.
!pokemon
Kosoveon|Writing, you are a 4Nidoqueen.
XAX you picked the wrong time to come here. Run. Take any sanity you may or may not have and run damn it! RUN!!
02it even scans SD cards, etc :P
00,10this music, so fiting for a "dress" club.
Gunthler|ZzZ: WAKE THE BUCK UP! :[
BlueFlare
00,10this is not r34
UGH! Where have I seen that hat?
that picture :notbad:
do you use Microsoft Security Essentials?
Oooh mai
02nope
Sumica: It's a form of Rule34. And I'm not calling it crap if that's what you're thinking
/me zzzzzz
that works good for me
Good night!
Rule34 is a statement! Not a description!
as does Norton and Malwarebytes
she can put on her robe and wizard hat all day, man.
LAUGHS LIKE A NUTJOB!
you imature people and your inability to watch Wrek create art without freaking out about where he is coloring.
panda|Burgers: One of my favs, not my fav fav...or waifu. or somethin'.
So, if you had to pick one thing you could see in season 3 what would it be?
03please tell me you don't actually have 3 antiviruses going at once
you know, Wrek is awesome! does he have a DA account?
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/02/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-propose-a-new-rule/
05ok seriously
only norton I run in the background
CLOCK IS TICKING Ponies47 CLOCK IS TICKING!
Since they've already put in derpy anything is possible at this point
05this album is jsut gettign ebtter and better
02this is drf's day
das quite a sawsy picture
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMc1oA9bdbM
03LOL
00,10ikr wrek
03want a Malwarebytes premium key? :P
00,10this is sick
no thanks
/me had the old stream window with the embarassed meanwhile in it... Derp
this might be good club/dancing music...just really not my thing it seems
00,10brb, swaping sound to the suroundsound
Sumica, guess what ^^
even if it was a single sentence. I want to see David Tennant voice a pony. specifically the brown one that looks kinda, sorta like him.
My life would be complete forever
02might look into Microsoft Security Essentials after this trial ends
So uh...Why is Spike in the background?
00,10panda|Burgers, chicken butt?
I've got the stream muted. I'm playing music I like :P
The only thing that irritates me about mbam premium
because spike opened up the pony 'dress' club.
Is the stupid website blocker
Aircrafter this is the Bachelor Party
Aircrafter: Spike jasa thing for Unicorns
03yeah
I see....
flutter_spin: That will be a challenge to enforce, but it can be done.
03I disabled that.
I need another beer
so, Wrek, its 5:43am where you are. Did you recently wake up or are you just doing an all nighter?
no lol, a new resturaunt opened near my house ^^ guess what its called Sumica
03LOL BLOCKING PIRACY WEBSITES
same
03anyway
yo whatzup im back
03how about this

wtf.....pornies
Don't forget Sweetie Belle Aircrafter
Hello deadchat!
tis a shame, Wrek.
Hey guys, check it out. I finally finished carving Princess Luna. I may make some minor touches to it, but for the most part she's done: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg201/scaled.php?server=201&filename=img0114fg.jpg&res=landing
Sumica lol "luna grill" and sorry I singled you out cuz wrek is drawing ^^
00,10lol
Impressive, What is it carved in Midnight_Fyre?
05hah! who are you, to judge me?
DerpStar: OH GOD DON'T make me imagine that...My mind is tainted T_T
millions of years from now. Aliens will find earth and wonder...what?
resident hax0r Bluesun
http://derpy.me/lMl1d I think I'm getting warmer...
I'm back. Did I miss anything?
03well
/me bops head to music
LOL
LOLOLOLOL
05i do what the hell i want.mp4
Chrome troll
03apparently about half of antiviruses flag that file
Plaster i assume
03because it contains some code that communicates with the Internet
00,10I still want to do a mexican/italian fusion restraunt. I will call it Que-pasta
"Dw vblah blah appears malicious!"
03I mean, how else would you send data to and from the Pokémon Dream World
03LOL
Wrek, Im not judging.. >_>
Out of curiosity, who is _?
Wrek is best rebel ^^
03that's what I mean
03>_>
oops, that was just the head. Here is the whole thing: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg7/scaled.php?server=7&filename=img0113mn.jpg&res=landing
LOL
03literally all that thing does
Well
And this doesn't taint you Aircrafter ?
03is log in as you to POkémon Global Link
03and win all the minigames
now go and hide that in a archeological dig Midnight_Fyre
DerpStar: This is child's play comparing to the things I've seen
Sumica that was a bad joke. I'm drunk and I didn't find that funny
Golakka: Yes, plaster
03but antiviruses are like "Oh no, this thing can send data to websites, it must be stopped"
Aircrafter: exactly...
so that we can learn about the ancient aliens who watched MLP because aliens
02okay, Kaspersky blocked it
at least chrome's built in malware blocker 'works'
03not really
03because that isn't malware
03:P
Well I'm glad I'm a woman I don't have to understand cloppers
I still find it odd for her to have "legs" like that, but otherwise I think the shaping is awesome
Sumica: i will totally go there ^^ are you a cook?
Exactly
I can't beleave I only have a little MOAR then a week left of school. AWESOME! /)^3^(\
03Firefox doesn't care LOL
WallDives: Don't blame me...Blame the web
But at least it is there
:D
03yeah but
justincase (tm)
03can you tell it to gtfo?
I'm back
I did
03like if you know it's a false positive?
03OK
"u mad?"
02it gave me the option to doawnload it though
DerpStar: AND I'M NOT- A clopper. I wouldn't dare...Thats...just awful.
phobos2390: hiya :D
00,10Chef actaly panda
lol'd
Aircrafter: I blame living in a high-crime city.
and it downloaded anyway
I blame everypony!
welcome phobos2390 ... :P
there is a keep option
02download*
:p
DerpStar: I blame you.
03yeah, my Firefox didn't do anything
DerpStar, Im fairly certian women masturbate too. Actually, Im 100% certian.
DerpStar . . . poor soul.
I blme sxyprtndr
But if I bury it how can I show it off? :(
So is that Spike in a pimp's get up in the background?
MahBoi777 :3
03and then Malwarebytes flagged it right afte rI saved it
I BLAME ALL OF YOU AND PINKIE PIE! :[
uh could you repeat that?
Sumica: WHAT O_o i didn't know! omg, be my live in chef? I'll pay you :D
This music is dangerously appropriate for the artwork in question :p
I didn't say you were I'm just saying the whole wierd XXX pony stuff holds no appeal
Mutterguy eeyup
3 No one :P (and kicked)
mbam here
didn't do a thing
Sumica is a chef? Learn something new every day.
Wrek, add glasses and you got yourself a nice girl
XAX :3
03wtf
Heheh
03try running it
02wtf
I'm thinking of trying to carve stone next
It doesnt for me either.
02Kaspersky is going insane now
03that's when it pops up
there we go
03LOL
03yeah
03see
DerpStar OH holy shit my bad I'm drunk. Yeah, I hate Rule 34 as well
03if a virus doesn't run
DerpStar, its all based on personal intrests.
Gah, I thought you were Slurry for a second there.
Oh we do Rain, just not to Ponies
03then there's no point in flagging it
03:P
dat music
00,1075% of all people admit to masterbating and in a unrelated survay 25% of all people lie.
03as soon as it tries to run, it gets blocked.
03but at least MBAM isn't intrusive
Ryanier: I hate it too
DerpStar I was thinking of a different clop
DerpStar, Im pretty sure I do.
03what pisses me off to no end is McAfee
Midnight_Fyre: Saw your carving, immediately thought "EGYPTIAN RUINS ;D!"
Sumica: 76% of statistics are made up on the spot ^^
Sumica: So 100%?
ill haunt u all
03"This is a virus, so we deleted the file without your permission and there's nothing you can do to get it back! Have a nice day"
I'm glad I have a lock on my door. I don't think anyone would completely understand how dressing = sexy
liez, all liez
03I'm like, go die in a fire
I have been to strip clubs and found them... exciting
phobos2390: not really.
SD
*XD
the two are unrelated, there could be some overlap.
Dear Princess Celastia today I learned there's good fanfic's bad fanfic's and then there's Paddycakes.
and there's no option to change it?
82% of people will automatically belive your argument if you quote a false but realistic statistic
She's bring sexy back :D
03as we had students at the camp I worked at make computer games that got flagged by McAfee and NOTHING ELSE
03Then they're like
pornies......
WallDives: Yeah, probably not.
03My entire project got deleted
that is, some of the 75% are also some of the 25%.
03and I'm like
03>_>
this should make things simpler
thats not a false stastistic mind you
03<_<
Aircrafter: Why did that not cross my mind at all while making it? Now I won't be able to stop
00,10I would not go to a strip club. Why would I want to get all reved up just to be frustrated.
03Camp's fault for using crappy antivirus
ha
strip clubs are friggin boring... they just make you pop one and you cant do anything
oh
Midnight_Fyre: What have I done ;w;
03and university computers, we didn't have admin rights
03so it just delets the files
03and won't let you get them back
I've been to a few strip clubs. most of them was because liquor was paid for.
03at least malwarebytes ASKS you
03quarantine or ignore
It's interesting, usually I'm the desginted driver for the gents in my group of buddies
Sumica: Really, who would want to pay to be teased?
weird....
designated'
Sumica: lol, yeah, i never really understood why go to a strip club. they just make you really want to do something inappropriate in public, and thats generally frowned upon
03hm, I want to try something though
DO NOT WANT.
00,10I do like being the desagnated driver for party like that though
03yeah
03Malwarebytes shows it as Backdoor Agent
Sumica: Why so?
00,10friends get so drunk I can stop and have them pay for gas 3 times on the way home
XD
03really all that means is "this program COULD be used to do harmful stuff"
same
dw.exe?
03yes
Sumica: thats brilliant
Sumica: nice.
Sumica last time I was a designated driver I ended up drinking anyway
03but all it does is communicate with pokemon-gl
Sumica: YOU ARE A CHAMPION MY FRIEND!
Sumica: XD well.. i usually record my friends and what they say and play it back to them later ^^
Here she is again in case you didn't bother clicking the first time: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg7/scaled.php?server=7&filename=img0113mn.jpg&res=landing
lol
Sumica: reminds me of a foxtrot cartoon
03theoretically yes, you could use the same coding to attack websites
03but dw.exe doesn't
Oh, Sumica...I salute your practicality.
RyanierIsDrunk: they have a place for you, its called AA

Midnight_Fyre: did you make that?
Ingwaz: he doesnt need AA he needs PA :D

Aircrafter: how does SB64 scare you?
Aircrafter: How can you be scared of SB64? He lieks poniez. And says moo!
FlareChaser: Calm down Flarey. Have some Colgate. Whats a wrong?
We alway end up just walking home
Sumica: hehe you are a perv ^^
hehe....the leg look like a curved spoon
And Meanwhile being a sneak and hiding in the treanchcoat.

Ingwaz: Thanks. I kind of messed it up a little in an attempt to get rid of air bubbles
03I don't care if you delete it
Sumica, the way magic works it still could be..
Sumica: O/////O
RyanierIsDrunk: I almost wish that would be a option for me and my folks.
inb4 BlueFlare is a worm
Anyway...I went hiking earlier today.
RyanierIsDrunk: the crap is a newfie?
I
am going
to regret this
00,10oh dear, did I go puting thoughts in ponies heads again?
but screw everything that needs to be done
02well, at least it shows that it's working

WallDives my house is a 15 minute walk to a local Irish Pub

hi guys
phobos2390: how did that go?
Aircrafter: oh wow. you know you are right. hes the nicest most clam mod evar! maybe he smokes weed? O_o
Oh! I also seem to have cleared up most of the bugs surrounding my collision detection program.
Aircrafter: If you should be scared of anyone, be scared of Shizuka. She is calm and nice and happy...and a ninja who could easily kill you in your sleep. While she, too, is sleeping.
well
Ingwaz a Newfie is somebody who lives in NEwfoundland. They're the "Party Hard Drink Harder" kind of guys
Were you really kicked?
RyanierIsDrunk: I dont drink alone, thats sad, and I cry. No, I go with a group, and we travel.And play games. And yell, get drunk, and other fun.
Aircrafter: first, my girlfriend yells at me for no god damn reason, then I failed my god damn test, then I cant play L4D2, THEN I CANT TALK, THINK OR SUGGEST MY SHIPPING BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK IM OVERDOING IT, then I fucking. Cant. handle it.
02inb4: addictive is her last name
when you don't get much time to play games during the school year
Shizuka: is master at ninja-ing
00,10oi. Dont be talking about SB like that.
nah
RyanierIsDrunk: i see..
I worship these moments
her last name is mudkipz
Wubwubwubwubwub
WallDives sounds like my birthday party last year

Sumica: I wasnt lol but I wonder why he is so calm, hes like fluttershy ^^
Yeah, SB is Wrek's colleague :P
DAT DUBSTEP!
MahBoi777: There was a lower turnout of people going than was expected and it was a really long hike. My legs are going to be yelling at me in the morning.
Well, I got to go for a while. I hope to come back to more of this, but it looks like Wrek is almost done with Trixie.

Ingwaz: -pats on the back-
Ingwaz: second that... one almost killed me
I told my workmate that I've been listening to dubstep. He had NO clue what I was talking about
This dubstep is sexy. Just like dat Trixie.

MahBoi777: Yes and No. I liked the hike overall, but I made a few mistakes. I had taken a camera and accidentally deleted all the pictures I had taken on the trip. I was also hoping a friend would come but she probably had something else to do.
WallDives: A lot of Ohio bronies on this site. You know about Trotcon?

Love you

Reikim: The government on mars asks the diplomats of the other planet governments for mining rights on vesta.
pony_892: greatness.
The real question is why your are not a maid RyanierIsDrunk
:3
pony_892 that is Queen Chrysalis drawn by Wrek
MOAR APPLEJACK DANIEL'S!

Reikim: They get denied this almost immediately.
Okay SlurryMaid. YOU SO CUTE

Barbetos I'm not a maid because I'm drunk
phobos2390: So Luke's dead.

this song is messing with my MIND!
RyanierIsDunk how about drunk maid?
dat wub
who died?
Reikim: No. Luke's not dead.
heheh cheese legs
panda, step one: Be born from the cataclismic explosion of two galaxies coliding. Step two: Draw it. that is the exact process Wrek has used for everything he has ever drawn.
wub wub wub
phobos2390: But...the asteroid...
00,10wubwubwub
WHats this song called?
phobos2390: Oh, so this is soft sci-fi. 'Kay then.
Reikim: Was the size of a golf ball
Rain, dammit now I have to find a TARDIS and alter how I was born.... great
Sorry I'm wub the cook. :P
also, Donna Summer passed away today.
Barbetos I don't roll with being a maid. It just doesn't fit my style. Besides, I'm drunk bro!
Reikim: The asteroid was the size of a golf ball
WallDives: who is that?
WallDives: Who?
/me facepalms
phobos2390: They go damn fast. Golf-ball pieces of rock in space can kill very quickly, especially if they hit a ship and compromise it.
00,10musisian
WallDives what happened?
OH! SONIC SEDUCTION
well....
0_o oh my

HORY SHEET! Now THAT'S "saucy"

Also, DAT THE PRETENDER.
who is that?

original version of this song was better =/
Wrek, you are hereby found guilty of making ponies illogically sexy. How do you plead?
what are you all talking about? Im still seeing pinkie.. >_>
who is that?
Reikim: But I told you that that...never mind. They were going pretty fast themselves though.
Super Saiyan DCD
moostache
Okie...doki...loki?
who is that?
phobos2390: That...would make it worse...depending on how it hits...
that looks like what I'm going to see when I look in the morning tomorrow morning
00,10well this one should be showing up in the skype group shortly
Whats the name of this group?
i dont understand
Hey guys! whats going on in here.... oh god
Sumica: there is a skype group?
Reikim: What if it is going in the same direction only faster?
there's a Skype group?
05Reikim: guilty as fuck
/me glomps DaringDude
00,10for the mods yes panda
phobos2390: Depends. On how much faster it's going.
03OK seriously, what
who is that?????
/me ish glomped
Sumica: dammit :/
03are all artists this crazy?
/me runs
Sumica okay, nevermind

Hey hey hey somepony_else
:D dat fez
This really
Rustles my jimmies ._.
Reikim: I think the ship is going somewhere in the Mach 10,000 range. It is space after all.
Why did he have to shave?
What does "Rustle my jimmies" mean?
I belive the correct term is "Wrinkled my Jammies"
I need to go to bed. Goodnight everypony!
05shaved
yay shaved!
now what?
:D
Panda... ruth?
Midnight_Fyre: that really speaks to me
XDD
panda . . . are you a chick?
MahBoi777!
phobos2390: ...You know what, I'm too tired to actually think about physics in a functional manner. So I can't even say whether or not that would damage the ship right now.
Golakka: why does everyone call me ruth?
Ok back......is that wrek???
Pinkies4thWall!
RyanierIsDrunk: im a boy >.>
Because ruth is the BronyUK convention panda :p
no, that isnt Kid_Cobalt
thats DCD
ah.
Golakka: oh lol well, im a guy and not ruth ^^ sowwy
Who is that?
Hey I know this pony

CupcakeWarrior, DCD
...I do believe that pony's on fire.
Whose ponysona wass thas

That's LadyCanary pony!

LadyCanary: You look like something out of a Tezuka manga. If Tezuka did ponies.
LadyCanary's pony has a mane of fire?

Daaaaaaw! ;3

RyanierIsDrunk: well... someone tell me please? ^^
One day I'd love to see a Black Canary pony in full attire >w<
dat RD
I can see that being SuperBrony64
her face
Reikim: I am more concerned with the sheer distances involved in space travel and how the technology would actually work that I will be about how a rock the size of a golf ball managed to crash into a ship going 10,000 times the speed of sound in the air. All I'm really concerned about is the tactics involved in a space war and...oh...I haven't covered that yet...oops
your babies :3
I need to go hit the hay. Good night everypony!
dat wall of text
Stupid chat derp
D:
gnight RyanierIsDrunk!
Nyt RyanierIsDrunk
phobos2390: Are you going with realism or fun-ism?
night RyanierIsDrunk
night RyanierIsDrunk, moar liquor!
dat trixie
later RyanierIsDrunk
gah! I better start cooking for my potluck
Alright! I'm awake and now up.....Trixie O.o
Samantha says good-night to all of you as well
Ponies: The only thing that is sexier with clothes on
Vordox: hehehe up? in more ways than one?
CupcakeWarrior: ^
bye RyanierIsDrunk
Vordox: I know right
panda: I don't find ponies sexy. =P
Dat. Dat corset. And the leg-thingy.
Reikim: I don't know. I think I am going more towards realism. The stupid rock thing is the worst bit.
Vordox: lol xD
panda: So how's that drawing coming along?
dat plot
00,10garter, Reikim
0_o
DEAR LROD
CupcakeWarrior: That's just because when they have their clothes off we know there is nothing under there
SunderlandPony89: havent started ^^ too busy basking in Wrek's awesome ^^
phobos2390: Humans develop ultra long-range cannons. Whoever gets the first shot off wins.
speechless lol
phobos2390: And that's without getting into the problems inherent with the light-speed barrier...
Reikim: But the characters do note that it is roughly a million to a trillion to one.
dat blushing
/me arrives to wubs
/me throws money at Trixie
Ohh, so THAT'S what Trixie's doing now...
Ok, how did you do that color replacement?
00,10I might have to pick up this CD
is he using a mouse???
Cya guys, I gotta head out to sleep
inb4 Sumica puts ideaa in everypony's minds again.
later SunderlandPony89.
lol at spike
Reikim: Huh? I never mentioned the light speed barrier. 10,000 times the speed of sound is nowhere nere the speed of light.
later SunderlandPony89
gnight SunderlandPony89! sleep well
cya SunderlandPony89
YamaTHou: no he is using a special pad.
00,10oh, did some one need help down in to the gutter Reikim?
phobos2390: I mean with space battles.
oow....that explains a lot
Night! :)
Sumica, I am so far past the gutter right now that I think it counts as spelunking.
Sumica: I'd like for you to help me out !!
Reikim: Why would they be concerned about the speed of light in space battles?
Reikim: lol, spelunking...
Reikim: Never mind stupid queston
phobos2390: Depending on weapons range...yeah.
00,10that word sounds dirty
/me saw her name on that list :3
13it's a cute jab "you'll be letting your team down"... i let my team down four maps ago don't know why the game didn't offer to just kick me
Spelunking...is exploring caves...nothing else...
00,10lol weapons range. in space
Well, I'm off to bed. See youz
Reikim: I have decided that most of the killing will be done at a distance. It is space after all.
lol, caves
Sumica: Exactly. If they're not energy weapons, they have theoretically infinite range.
Reikem u ther
Pony war?
Reikim: wanna join our xbox party nd just tawk?
Reikim: Radar, Binoculars, Timed Charges, and Nukes.
PONY WAR???
05speaking of space
00,10ever see the speach in Mass effect 2 Reikim?
phobos2390: At a certain distance, by the time the light gets to you...your target will have moved. And mass-based projectiles have theoretically infinite range.
SPAAAAAAAACE
I like space
Did I just hear Goofy's laugh sampled into that?
1,3I set /gompShizu to on, prevents any Shizukas from leaving the game
Sumica: SIR ISAAC NEWTON IS THE DEADLIEST SONUVABITCH IN SPACE so yeah.
wanna go to space space space
13just drags it out
00,10eyup
MahBoi777: no you dont
Reikim: Like a nuclear weapon? of course.
13we lost from the first five minutes of both games
05dead spaec ponies ftw
/me hugs Shizuka
ikr, Wrek?
panda: yup yup, wanna go to space
Hand lightning is best energy weapon
Reikim: A space war would be ridiculously complicated.
DaringDude: Sorry, I ahve to sleep soon...
Because alive space wasnt good enough.
MahBoi777: but, you'll get bored of space
okeee
GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY!

gnight Ponies47!
I dont get the reference D:
phobos2390: Until they got close enough to a planet, anyway.
Reikim: what?
hmmmmmm
star trek
Did anypony else think Sunny Smiles from Fallout was hot?
phobos2390: Things get complicated around planets. Especially if the invading force wants the planet's resources.
13it's just not fun to play a game for twenty minutes when you only actually get to interact for thirty seconds
lol that cardassian
Shizuka: You mean like any arena-style mode in TF2?
13and then get to sit and watch everyone else be that much better than you
Reikim: Yup. Planets are huge. Gravity comes in to play. Orbits come into play.
Shizuka - Are you talking about L4D2?
phobos2390: But also a desire to NOT just nuke everything to death.
13that was my worst session yet
!pokemon
Kosoveon|Writing, you are a 6Mew.
00,10one book I read had and intersting play out on how space combat worked.
Reikim: The distances and scale of an actual space war would be enormous.
there... are... four lights :[
ITs twiley cyrus
phobos2390: If you want to, say, colonize the planet and perhaps terraforming it, you don't want to nuke it. Which you could do, but which would irradiate it.
Reikim: I guess so.
00,10I see wrek is checking on his empire
oh man, I made an ogame account once
phobos2390: disreguard distance, aquire death start
*...
I wonder how dead my little planet is now
STAR, DEATH STAR
Well, orbit is actually a perfect balance between velocity and gravity. I think that's how it works.
Wrek, What uni? :p
phobos2390: Thus, you'd have to engage the defense fleet /very/ carefully, to avoid hitting the planet
Pinkies4thWall: invite me t partry
hey DaringDude how comes oyur not talking or anything
/me explodes
if I knew FPSs better, I could offer advice, but I know what you mean, Shizu...
apparently i keep laggin out
phobos2390: Then you'd have to somehow land ground troops and take any points of interest.
join Pinkies4thWall party
Reikim: Very very very very very carefully.
DaringDude: lame, where did inglorious go?
Shizuka - Free for alls are better, you get the chance to pick off weak targets and then respawn
oh
idk
Because I have no multiplayer fps skills :D
Unless COUNTER STRIKE
Shizuka: The problem here...is that you die. And you don't respawn. A bit like real life :(
Brony party on XBL @ my place!
What game are you talking about, Shizuka? Left 4 Dead 2?
Stallion_of_War: im so tired of that game. every freakin time it never fails. just as were on the last stretch someone falls and needs help my team mates all turn to pusses on me so I go it alone with nothing but a magnum and an axe. Lo' and behold as soon as I help that person up I get mauled by a tank or a charger and they leave me to die.....OR whats even better we will be truding along and I say that there is a witch nearb
13Reikim: not as humans, as infected
Reikim: yeah, but landing the ground troops would be fairly easy if you had disposable space craft that could go into the upper atmosphere and let the soldiers skydive.
13first round, i lived a total of 17 seconds
13out of five minutes
dat wall
10 light fighters! Holy shit! we have a badass in here!
ow mah head
phobos2390: Without getting shot down?
11,01Shizuka: what's wrong with you?
Good job Shizuka !
Shizuka: That's still better than me!
Shizuka: L4D?
13yes
Reikim: How do you shoot down a person when you are several hundred miles from where you are?
Shizuka: You should play vs with someone who equally sucks as infected (<---)
/me hugs phobos2390
/me realizes it's late
hi mario_pony
I feel like playing Happy Wheels
05how
hi mario_pony
05the sun is in full galore outside
/me hugs mario_pony
Full GALOOOORREEE
00,10I know that feel wrek
Good boy, back to work :p
WHOA
your fleet can wait
phobos2390: Defense fleet shoots down anything that gets remotely close. Detection is really, really easy in space (thermal emissions and all that). And in order to even HAVE space travel, you need super-complex computers. Not that we don't already have anti-missile missiles.
IF THE PSYCHIC ISN'T SECRETLY TIMELORD THEY'RE FULL OF PONY FODDER...
Wrek: really cause ms. moons is beaming something fierce over here..
00,10Wrek's empire is so much further along then mine

Better be Mizar, so i can

Hm, what game is this?
05apply for NLR
ooh, just started earlier tonight
2-94-10
Reikim: but it would still be ridiculously complicated to find them and shoot them down.
This music is fitting for saucy Trixie.
^
00,10I am just geting metal 15
Sent the app wrek
Why... why is there no Saucy Luna...
dragon's don't go to school
im working on metal 4 right now :P
What game is that?
there's NEVER any saucy luna
:(
www.ogame.org cupcake
14not in italy .w.
This is a browser based game?
aye
phobos2390: Not really. Again, detection is really easy in space. Battles are fought long-range. And it's actually more obvious than you think to notice something falling from the sky if you have planet-wide radar coverage (or similar).
F2P, microtrans heavy
03LOL what?
03also dragons don't exist
03your move
/me runs
microtrans only makes things "easier", you cant get any shit a F2Per cant
Stallion_of_War: I can fix that, but then Sumica will accuse me of gutter-membership again.
00,10damn, cruisers already wrek?
man those teams were SO unbalanced
>komodo dragon
055 of them
00,10slick
Chrysalis you think ?
That feel when you build your first battleship
klnow
00,10and that's not a bad thing Reikim =p
Luna is even more awesome because she uses lightning :)
then you realise the guy next to you has 2,000 of them
/me dat lightning
Is that one of those games that you need to play often?
00,10check it once or twice a day CupcakeWarrior
Not really cupcake
o-O
Early on, No, you can go away for days
komodo dragons
late on, check every hour, ifnot more
phobos2390: Now that's just a bit unfair. Of course Africa will ahve its own missiles.
phobos2390: Install DEATH STAR
05some dude is aboot to attack me
05he's roast
00,10all dem fleets dispatches you got wrek
Whats he got, and what do you have?

Ahahaha
nice
11,01Horrific final match.
05large cargo and 1 recycler vs 5 cruisersr and several fighters
Eyup
thanks for the games guys, hopefully the random number gods are nicer next time
11,01Ended it early.
ha!
Reikim: O//O
Nittany_Discord: tis was bad.
Reikim: Also, wouldn't thermal tracking be harder when the paratroopers are skydiving in the atmosphere?
That doesn't ACTUALLY look as much like Luna as others...
pwnt
Destroyed in the first round!
:(
phobos2390: That's where radar comes into play.
11,01Well, our damn team rushed and left me behind when they could have saved me.
00,10that's not an attack fleet wrek, that trash pickup
phobos2390: Also the atmosphere is damn cold.
11,01It was downhill from there.
13i was going back for you
Got recyclers yet?
13but was armed with a worthless weapons
05and ima gona obliterate it
13and was boomed
13and swarmed
1,3not my fault someone called rush mode and everyone else listened >.>
05still 36 hours before he arrives
0526*
Boom! ^_^
And now that I've shared saucy Luna pics, I think I'll have to go to bed in order to forget the experience. Night, everypony.
Where the fuck is he comming from!?
now THAT'S saucy
00,1036hours, damn his fleet is slow
Stallion_of_War: HA!
:D
00,10what's he useing , combustion 1
Stallion_of_War: OMG THAT SAUSY
He is probably fleetsaving at that duration
lotsa spaghetti
SAUCY*
11,01Doesn't help that I'm being ignored.
FlareChaser eeehhh, naybe
Reikim: I guess the attackers will just have to launch a massive attack like the one on D-Day and hope for the best.
Biglaw: NOW :|
Now GOOD NIGHT everypony! Quick, before I get distracted by saucy pics again...
Nittany_Discord, I glomped you :/
00,10nice tempo to this song

Wait... SaxyPretender... Saxon... Harold Saxon?
Reikim: I was thinking about the second space war having the invasion of mars be a bit like that. Enough troops would land and then most of the battling would be on foot.

Sourcefed's gotten kinda sluttly recently...
wait, wat.
Wrek would be okay with you, if i make that trixie a spray for l4d2 ?
Rize of the Fenix, Roadies and Throw Down are the best songs on that album
gonna take an hour to get enough metal for solar V :(
This song has bad language in it
my bad, solar 4 :p
TheGreatAndPowerfulT it looks quite good as one
mario_pony: how are you doing today?
CupcakeWarrior, does that really matter?
also, K-POP GIRL GROUPS. Y U SO CATCHY?
Traing montage music!
I love Jack Black's voice
Wrek: can you play the deathstar song again
MahBoi777: well in the morning i was happy then in the afternoon mad now i'm kinds mad and happy
/me tries to peak at what Wrek might be doing on the rest of the screen >3>
RAWRity ikr, they may "be 20 years behind" but that;s awesome
Wrek: please
05its queued after this oen
*kind of
Roadies <3
Seriously, I've had a playlist of SNSD, 4Minute, and F X on all day.
MahBoi777: and you?
Hey Wrek do you mind if we use that new trixie picture for l4d2 sprays?
RAWRity: I DONT KNOW.
05go ahead
Roadies is the best song on that album
Wrek really really really really really seems to be drawn to Twilight.
I'm fairly certain I've heard "Hoot" 20 times, and I STILL LOVE IT.
cool wanted to check before i used it in a game
0,14RAWRity, try Abracadra by Brown-Eyed Girls
mario_pony: I'm good, sunburnt but good:)
http://screensnapr.com/v/r2JlIE.jpg

/me slaps himself for silly
SO ADORABLE.
03meh
daww
03well
RAWRity: You have a silly kitty
I find myself thinking I'm fitting to the personality of Twilight. Need to analyze and predict and plot everything.
03the only one I see, then, is that demo-mode 3.30
03but it's all scratched up on the outside, which is like :|
Hehe, plot
03as this one I have is actually in good condition
03though I wonder if I can buy one of these $40 broken ones and just take the parts out and put it in mine
/me throws a cute grenade into the chat

MahBoi777: yeah
that cat attacked that doll/toy.
Golakka: thats just a silly idea, you know that
MahBoi777: and then only 4 more days and it's summer!!
I personally find myself in the same situation than Twi.....i have all this intelligence, and i want to feel loved....
mario_pony: u can do eet!
Not really
1,000,000 LFs can take a deathstar easy :p
the greatest flaw in every plan is the assumption that you know more than your opponent.
/me yawns
:3
hell, enough LFs can take down superor numbers of BS and above
given enough time :p
LF?
light fighters
ah
badabum

Huh.

Noted
and now I dont give two shits about them
haha
Apparently Linkin Park's releasing a new album. As a former fan, I feel as if I'm obligated to listen to it, just so I can confirm how much it sucks.

Wrek: mental note, 1:207:4 is a enemy.

05try to steal mah metal
RAWRity: They used ti be good

I will steal your metal.
CupcakeWarrior: I disagree.

Wrek just called a hit squad on that guy XD
/me steals everyones metal.
They've actually improved slightly over the years. It's just that when I was 13 I had shit taste.

CupcakeWarrior, you could say the same about WoW and Runescape xD
2!touhou

dat robot ded
2it's still in the afternoon here o3o
I used to play Runescape when I was a kid
oh, i misread your nick
Just wish Activision would stop being such a dick to its customers.
Polydunami: hehe didnt we all? :D
I haven't played Runescape in years
hmm
My username was "The Yakuza" of all things :$
Ive never played runescape
IKAAAAA!
I'm not kidding
Yea, I didn't play much Runescape.
Runescape was my first MMO. :$
Good times.
Inddeed
Polydunami: well.. mine was panda69 :p
*indeed
same here Ninjazz lol
/me puts a giant pickle on jun :3
I first played around 02/03
I remember playing it back when it was still 2D ish.
dat 300 damage
Yeah!
I remember those days
My first account was named Santa_bot. Guess who i looked like? :P
12I WANT PICKLES
I've been playing WoW since shortly before the first expansion came out, and I still love it. I still think it's the best MMO on the market right now.
Spiderman?
12DAMMIT
:S
Sumerpan?
If spiderman had a beard, maybe. :D
Ninjazz: wait... your name was santa_bot?
clark kent?
no
Goodnight everyone.
Smiderpan?
Yep, panda.

Gnight Cobellanez
My first account was called Nice Man xD
gnight Cobellanez
12!pickle
12:3
WAZZZZUP!?!?
/me waves
Nice name, Polydunami. XD
Ninjazz: i remember getting pwned in the wild by some guy with that name and he took my full rune armor
!biscuit
mine was SoopahFreak7:P
*bonk*
12XD
12!kyu
/me 07does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.

12nope
So... who is streamin?
Or something
wynaut
Polydunami: well... now we have bad blood lol
This is ValtheJean's
I never went PKing in the wild, panda. Could have been the fool that I "lent" my account to.
12b'coz
Wait... I do think I remember a panda69...
Ninjazz: oh hehe, i just rmember that i was so sudden xD
I hate the Wild
12!poke
really? Ninjazz
but i pratically live just over the ditch!
Perhaps... We did meet before panda...
Ugh, the Wilderness was no place for The Yakuza. Just sayin'
I cannot tell what gaem you are talking of... but i will assume its WoW
I'm just not too certain. :S
oooh
Ninjazz: hm... destiny that we are both bronies? ^^
Even though I WAS The Yakuza
kinky
/me hides
12D:
12ewwwww
Nope. Runescape
/me 12shudders
┐(￣ー￣)┌
There is no PvP in tunescape is there?
ohai macross
12frack no
unles teh arena
Same here, Polydunami. Never liked the thought risking my armor.
TheRandomkid321: yes there is ^^
What show is that commander guy from?
If so, panda. Quite the small world. :)
I remember they took it down at one point
I... I dont have any armour in runescape. I need help just to get pass wolf mointain
Did they actually?
┐(￣ー￣)┌┐(￣ー￣)┌┐(￣ー￣)┌
I think
Ninjazz: well... my little brother knew this kid for 5 years on RS and later turned out to be his neighbor lol
10 whole damage:O
:O
DAT 10 Damage
SMALL WORLD INDEED.
Actually, it was one of my classmates who got me interested in Runescape
Its a small world after all....
that mecha reminds me of the FAZZ Gundam...
fuu
And I influenced my friends as well
lol
:3
None of my friends play that type of game
I think I played RS for all of...2 weeks...back in my first year of college...lol
Polydunami: same here, and he introduced me to Alt Tab so i couldnt get caught in class ^^
I was F2P, I didn't have a fancy membership
I was the first to bring Runescape to my friends as well.
hi bluebolt
BF
hi NiS
Being a member was fun, for a while... :S
02ohai Bree
02and jouh
Yeah, I guess

02junh*
Ninjazz: I just hacked people who had members accoutn and stole their gold ^^
I also played Anarchy Online for a couple months

Midnight_Tempest: trippy isnt it
CupcakeWarrior: in sept
Shane377: not really

Midnight_Tempest: its some wut trippy
Shane377: uh...ok?

panda: Understandable.
I saw Chronicle for the first time last night
CupcakeWarrior: i am 21 you?

Ninjazz: hehe well they had it comming....
Polydunami: OOH how was it?
It was pretty interesting, to say the least
panda: Indeed. I hope you got what you were looking for. ;)
DOUBLE BOOMERANG!
I enjoyed the movie, to be honest
hi
Are we giving our ages again?
Ninjazz: oh yeah.... several hundred mil that was alot back then ^^
I don't think we have to this time.
I want to see Chronicle, and The Avengers before it stops showing in theatres >_<
Actually, my cable company has Chronicle on rental
MahBoi777: GO WATCH THE AVENGERS! I didn't care, but when my friends dragged me along... Dude, just watch it...
MahBoi777: geez i would totally take you
I MUST GO
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 4Wigglytuff.
lol
I feel old now: I'm 22
Lemme tell you, the hype is correct for once.
I got 6 free movie tickets lol
avengers is great, but dont go cause people are yelling at you to watch it...
Worst movie I ahev ever seen was Fingerprints. 1989... wait... Are you joking!? Its impossible! Umm my mistake The Movie Fingerprints was made in 2006... You are joking right?... No... Your serious...
Ninjazz: I heard it was awesome and funny
Wait, otakon is 28!?

Holy crap
Polydunami: if I remember correctly, yeah
26 here
MahBoi777: Incredibly so. Its great!
lol
I think Im the only person ever who doesnt want to see the avengers
13.. YOUNG BLOOD!
great!
Polydunami 22 isnt old
TheRandomkid321: XD youngin'
Kencolt is the olders one here, if he was here
I know, I was just saying random things
oldest*
As usual
CupcakeWarrior: I used to be just like you, till I took a "why the hell not" to the knee.
Midnight how old is he?
54
Kencolt is older than my mother
^
@$$$$$$$$$$

You know, if life had hp meters. it would be fun ^^
pff.. XBL...

If his birthday is earlier than March 5th, he would be older than my FATHER as well
PSN is better
PC > XBL > wii> ps3
PC is best
Burn Micro$oft. :|
PSN mics make my ears hurt.
Chrysalis: lemme guess you have a souped up computer
PS3>360>PC
PC > psn > xbox > wii
panda several
PC>WII
stil gundam?
still
Chrysalis: ah i see ^^ max specs?
PC>your mum
I hate microsoft (on an apple) but I must say id prefere xbox than playstation... I do not wish to start a war
not really, the CPU is aging a fair bit
its only a c2quad
I'm more of a PS3 gamer but I agree PC is the best system to play on. It's almost obvious.
Console gaming is way better than PC gaming imo
I like xbox too TheRandomkid321
Kosoveon is tuff
like a wiggly
!pokemon
TheRandomkid321: u hate microsoft and yet u like xbox360 <-- ironic much
CupcakeWarrior on what grounds?
i'll stick with mewtwo
I don't care about the platforms themselves, so long as I get some good gaming material
Chrysalis: dont have an i7?
03hm there
ps3 games r too expensive\
on all accounts the PC version is always better

03granted 6 minutes is still really long for a radio song, but whatever. It's two songs in one :P
03and this is an awesome live recording xD
Im fine with people saying PC is better than xbxo. It is factual. It has more RAM and MODS but I hate PC gamers who hate us console gamers for no reason D:
freaking gamestop is a rip-off
I don't really care about xbox live, cuz mah internet isn't compatible :P
quite an old chip, the GPU is quite new but i do alot of shaders so i need the power
lol MahBoi777
Polydunami: I find people's loyalty to blood sucking game publishing companys to be very scary and funny.
mario_pony: Gamestop is awesome
what is this game?
TheRandomkid321 except for people say consoles are better than pc and have NO grounds on it
Super Robot Wars
ValtheJean: why no burning finger? :D
I forget which one
:S
I like how Gamestop won't let u simply leave the store lol
Chrysalis: Its just a matter of preference
Nintendo>Microsoft>Sony. I just dont like the wii
Super Robot Wars Z2 i think
GameStop has problems.
I live gamestop
love*
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 6 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
CupcakeWarrior except for playing games it really isnt, the PC is actually BETTER at playing games, better framerates and better looking, smoother controls
What game store will sell second hand original xbox games?
CupcakeWarrior: you live there? oh man im jelly :D
03what is this blasphemy
and not full of 13yo screamers
o-O
what
I dont get why people hate gamestop so much
you didn't know?
