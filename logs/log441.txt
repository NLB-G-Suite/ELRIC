Because then you've KILLED the novelty of the climbing.
00,03wait... this band...
I'll just grab its ankle and slash away, rather than wasting time to climb up to the head. :P

lol
:P
00,03That... was really Trixie....
02unless you have one of those gamers PCs
The climbing mechanic is cool, don't get me wrong, but it needs to be supplemented with logic. If you expect players to climb up to the head, you really should let them deal more damage than if they slash at the ankles, else it's identical to not having the mechanic at all.
Or

00,10instead of striping
05owned and run by cleptospike
strippers remind me of....
Oh, you want a club name? Hm, can't use "Dizzy Donkey" since that's my idea for a pony-based pub....
strippers
I need to mop first
then I'll decide
00,10if that's keptospike where is his hat?
i like TheMaster's idea
and considering how many clothes rarity wears...

eeyup'
00,10so that meens rarity is running a kink shop
Yep!

00,10then again she does have alot of saddles and bridles
You know, I suddenly want to see a fully grown spike wearing a scaled up version of his pimp hat
someone needs to write this.

dhx
except
that makes me sad..
I cannot get that much time alone.
02>$80
confirmed WHERE

03Norton is absolutely awful
00,10fffffff, you all are gonna make me go look it up on eqd arnt you.
02why do you think that? Xd
03because it doesn't detect anything?
since season 3 apparently
WAIT I TAKE IT BACK!!!
Mcafee is horrible
00,10no one said they stoped
I once freaked when I read "Rainbow Dash VA isn't going..." and then I realized they meant something else
03yeah, Norton and McAfee are equally garbage
02EW Mcafee
Alas, I have no wheat thins...
02Norton 360 does drf
03No
03it doesn't
02donno about other types of Norton
00,10No one said they did
Are they keeping the music people? the animators?
Rain: pfff.....i'll be honest. I don't even know anymore.

This is going to be a high-stakes experiment in consistancy
:(
05yay or neigh on the hat?
:(
TheMasters can you do that?
Only 1 problem she cleans them with wubs.
02drf, things happen
This is sounding..... interesting.
I can do that you know. I'm mag..time lord.
g2g everypony night!!!!!!!!
hmm
YES THE HAT.
/me runs
Good evening everypony
Trixie has a hat now? At least she knows how to play TF2 now
02:|
lol
Anyway, I'm going to have to brb. I have to do something.
/me hides
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L3V3S1wjpdw/TMLbt2qDfkI/AAAAAAAAAR4/dkkrL6dcvd0/s1600/milkywayfunsize.jpg you know... Milky Ways
00,10hat is a nice touch
03your jokes are bad and you should feel bad
Greets to all
Oy. dat pony.
:(
Mareabia is the kinkiest land in equestria
I lost mine a long time ago
Arabian is a breed of horse, ya know
rather than*
Rain that's actually a good idea
/me would be a donkey
Yes, but its not punny enough just being 'arabia' since its also called that here
This is some nice techno, but I got to go soon
Saddle Marabia?
The Saddle family has ruled in Mareabia for generations.
quite.
:(
02are*
Oh, my... I cannot remember all the bad puns we made a few months back. we must have had 40 or more lame jokes.
00,10gonna take me a bit to find this info on eqd
all the ponies are depraved and hedonistic. They wear full burqas.
I have my sanity.
I don't think they'd approve.
since...celestia and all
I'VE LOST ALL SANITY! :P
expoded
uhh
/me explodes
Derpy is not crazy! She's just clumsy.
And we <3 her.
DID SOMEONE SAY DRUNK? did they?
I was trying to find that too...
:(
I have decided to explode *explodes*
can't wait to see this when finished
dat netflix
THEY KNOW
I just installed it
now I'm trying to come up with a decent battlenet tag
ugh :(
03no, i3 processors *are* slow
mm
03i5 and i7 are good... i3 is the little sister version
You know. I organized with my suitemates, repeated pizza parties up to 12-13 college people to watch my little pony all night. It was suprisingly succesful
00,10and yeah
^lol
that pissed her off
/me sighs
02well yeah, but he makes them out to be really slow and I've used demos that have it on them before
...
esrdtfhg
03can't you just switch whenever you want?
00,10Ingwaz posted it for us
AFAIK, it means that when outside, women are REQUIRED to wear burqas at all times and they have to have a male escort.
like the season finale
I've had this laptop since Sept 2010
and no viruses
ever.
No active anti-virus either
drf, no
I have a tendency not to believe everything that goes on EQD :P
00,10meanwhile got replaced with a poll
wut did i just pop in on?
unless you were asking that to something else
oh ok
you can
00,10but generaly if they link a source check it out
I like that change.
but that requires playing the story again
well by everypony, you wont be seeing me much any more :(
03heh
Even DHN tends to say "looks like EQD got it wrong. We have proof..."
00,10Hasbro is not gonna let go of it. they wont shoot for sindecation
02Exactly
I haven't had a single BSOD either
trixie stripping? oh ok, thats normal
And exactly DRF
she's not stripping. she's clothing
at least its not derpy
i have mad respect for her
If the 'virus' does nothing
and Mbam doesn't pick anything up
or Rainbow Dash
00,10also sindication is best if you are aiming for more then 65 eps, not stoping at it
the more clothes the kinkier
oh fuck
Then there is nothing bad on here
Derpy Derpy Derpy Derpy
Derpy Derpy Derpy
03yeah
Just saying, I hope they let MLP:FIM go when its still good, Not drag out 100 episodes, steadily getting crap
03those things are such a pain
03honestly, Ad Muncher is the way to go
Rain: the problem is we have no proof if its they need help doing 13 eps while dhx does the other 13, or if top draw is doing the only 13 eps
03since there's really only two ways you get viruses
we'll know when FIM has jumped the shark when they...make a movie
I think its sweedish
031. Be a complete idiot and download files without even thinking
Huh.
00,10dat rideing crop
LOL. Oh man.
riding crop
....
03and as for 1, nothing can help you but maybe solitary confinement? :P
05actually i wouldnt be suprised if its hebrew
IT IS IN HEBREW.
Lyra's one of my favorite Background Ponies
screaming AFTER finishing is a bad sign
OH SHEET.
02those are just the main ways you can get one
Her name's fun to say. "Lyra" . . .
I didn't know israel had techno bands
I'm drunk
03well
:3
03if you use a web-based email like Yahoo, you won't get the viruses from opening files unless you actually download them
03I rest my case :P
Rain: that part is not a problem, i don't require proof that theyre not getting help, i require proof that they are
simpsons, spongebob...every time
Rain: only the paranoid survive
11,01Chrysalis: I didn't vote-kick.
a documentary isn't the same as a animated movie.
00,10then again i have always liked there tracks
Heh, a live action my little pony movie.
that would be hilariously awful
Hey everypony
05israelic and yes
MLP:FIm live show is terror
I see we have a trixie in the works
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/homework-class-test-ideally-this-would-happen-with-more-parents2.jpg
the twist is. IT WAS EARTH ALL ALONG
^
Also spike
03right, but it's not smarter to PAY for said anti-virus
03just get Malwarebytes
She reminds me of something. I can't figure it out. .. ... something magical.. ...
03honestly
its going to drive me crazy
Spike has one in each arm :p0
/me sighs
02some people just want to be extra safe
It's Nauuuuuuuuughty
I CAN'T SPEAK SPANISH! (nor do I want to)
Is that Spike in the background?
05anotehr one added to the chock counter
05still hebrew i think
This is hebrew
its that hat. That hat looks just like the little tihing in my memory
a good name for a band it seems
02Kaspersky free trial has been pretty good
Lol Epic Phwoto :3
while trixie certainly does make a good "showmare", i think pinkie could give her a good run ;)
I was thinking http://ponykillerx.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4qzgf9 but... no can't be
03:P
02LOL
:D
03because seriously
03is when you actually NEED it
IMO.
03so go infect yourself with something and then we'll see who's talking
/me runs
Afternoon.
02well yeah
be back later everypony.
/me ZzzZZzzzzzZZZ
00,10intersting place you picked to color first.
^
haha.
mmmm trixie
/me Zzzz
lol
guilty.
02it does scan everything before you download, which is good
/me falls asleep
yes
there's another.
02it even scans SD cards, etc :P
00,10this is not r34
UGH! Where have I seen that hat?
that picture :notbad:
Oooh mai
02nope
/me zzzzzz
that works good for me
Good night!
as does Norton and Malwarebytes
LAUGHS LIKE A NUTJOB!
00,10did't know we had sub clauses to r34 now
03please tell me you don't actually have 3 antiviruses going at once
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/02/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-propose-a-new-rule/
05ok seriously
only norton I run in the background
Since they've already put in derpy anything is possible at this point
02this is drf's day
das quite a sawsy picture
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMc1oA9bdbM
03LOL
03want a Malwarebytes premium key? :P
00,10this is sick
no thanks
this might be good club/dancing music...just really not my thing it seems
00,10brb, swaping sound to the suroundsound
I've got the stream muted. I'm playing music I like :P
The only thing that irritates me about mbam premium
because spike opened up the pony 'dress' club.
Is the stupid website blocker
03yeah
I see....
03I disabled that.
I need another beer
03LOL BLOCKING PIRACY WEBSITES

http://derpy.me/lMl1d I think I'm getting warmer...
03well
/me bops head to music
LOL
LOLOLOLOL
03apparently about half of antiviruses flag that file
Plaster i assume
"Dw vblah blah appears malicious!"
03I mean, how else would you send data to and from the Pokémon Dream World
03LOL
03>_>
oops, that was just the head. Here is the whole thing: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg7/scaled.php?server=7&filename=img0113mn.jpg&res=landing
LOL
03literally all that thing does
Well
03is log in as you to POkémon Global Link
03and win all the minigames
03but antiviruses are like "Oh no, this thing can send data to websites, it must be stopped"
02okay, Kaspersky blocked it
at least chrome's built in malware blocker 'works'
03not really
03because that isn't malware
03:P
Well I'm glad I'm a woman I don't have to understand cloppers
I still find it odd for her to have "legs" like that, but otherwise I think the shaping is awesome
Exactly
I can't beleave I only have a little MOAR then a week left of school. AWESOME! /)^3^(\
03Firefox doesn't care LOL
But at least it is there
:D
03yeah but
justincase (tm)
03can you tell it to gtfo?
I'm back
I did
03like if you know it's a false positive?
03OK
"u mad?"
02it gave me the option to doawnload it though
lol'd
and it downloaded anyway
I blame everypony!
there is a keep option
02download*
:p
I blme sxyprtndr
But if I bury it how can I show it off? :(
03and then Malwarebytes flagged it right afte rI saved it
uh could you repeat that?
3 No one :P (and kicked)
mbam here
didn't do a thing
03wtf
Heheh
03try running it
02wtf
It doesnt for me either.
03that's when it pops up
there we go
03LOL
03yeah
03see
Gah, I thought you were Slurry for a second there.
Oh we do Rain, just not to Ponies
03then there's no point in flagging it
03:P
dat music
00,1075% of all people admit to masterbating and in a unrelated survay 25% of all people lie.
03but at least MBAM isn't intrusive
Ryanier: I hate it too
03what pisses me off to no end is McAfee
ill haunt u all
liez, all liez
I have been to strip clubs and found them... exciting
SD
*XD
the two are unrelated, there could be some overlap.
and there's no option to change it?
03as we had students at the camp I worked at make computer games that got flagged by McAfee and NOTHING ELSE
03Then they're like
pornies......
03My entire project got deleted
that is, some of the 75% are also some of the 25%.
03and I'm like
03>_>
this should make things simpler
thats not a false stastistic mind you
03<_<
00,10I would not go to a strip club. Why would I want to get all reved up just to be frustrated.
03Camp's fault for using crappy antivirus
ha
strip clubs are friggin boring... they just make you pop one and you cant do anything
oh
03so it just delets the files
03and won't let you get them back
I've been to a few strip clubs. most of them was because liquor was paid for.
03at least malwarebytes ASKS you
03quarantine or ignore
weird....
designated'
03hm, I want to try something though
DO NOT WANT.
03yeah
03Malwarebytes shows it as Backdoor Agent
XD
03really all that means is "this program COULD be used to do harmful stuff"
same
dw.exe?
03yes
03but all it does is communicate with pokemon-gl
Here she is again in case you didn't bother clicking the first time: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg7/scaled.php?server=7&filename=img0113mn.jpg&res=landing
