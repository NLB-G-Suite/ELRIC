Ohai CupcakeWarrior
Airpuff: make your own assumptions
/me hugs the Lady that is Canary
Om: .. ofc i will.. specially when it comes to you...
It's rehashing the stereotypes that bronies face.
Airpuff: Whyeee, I'ma normal internet partizen
Om: No you're not :d
the internet is for porn and ponies
when you die your brain is still active for 7 mins and in those 7 mins you relive your life, so whos to say we are not dead right now?
Go play with your noodles.

cachi01|rockband3: i back ya up on that statement :d
Om: ahahha ofc, wanna come with me?
Do the noodle dance!
Kandarihu: Seems to me that they just host popular images
6_9
/me does the noodle dance?
:D
Airpuff: Whats wrong with here?
Airpuff: What was that a reference to?
But I guess you're right. It is merely a portrayal of existing stereotypes. AD! takes the anticonservative stereotypes and makes it into a cultural landmark.
CupcakeWarrior: ahaha, good question

Dat laugh
Om: ... i donno. I like it intimate ;)

/me is trolling myself wait how does that work ;/
So today in class, people were talking about how awesome dubstep is, and only 3 people said they hated dubstep :|
Wrek: Is this from a musical or something?
i once had a dream about bronystate
alexxm: same way you get sprays in other source games to work
Ahaha sure Om , just gotta change music so i dont fall asleep :P
CCCP: go on...
CCCP: And?
flutter_shy: Samething as everything works when you're doing it to yourself~

ded people everywhere!
/me killed a pumkin
CCCP: go on...

11,01Does Wrek not have a shotgun?
/me headbangs to the music
Nittany_Discord: mhm~
Before I play TF2 again, I have to get the hang of sprays.
Airpuff: Again. Suck it up.
alexxm: theres norm a multiplayer tab in the options menu that allows you to do sprays and cursors
He replaced it with the horn thing that helps your teammates~
Om: :|
Nittany_Discord: dunno, think he does....
Cool song.
Om: i love you too
:d
thanks Shamroc
And what song would this be?
:D
hey Nyria hows your day been
12don't worry
Still feels like a song from a musical
:D.
12people with cancer can pull through
all i remember was the Wrek was streaming
Okay, why does wrek have a trumpet?
It's been eventful, got a physical~ How about you alexxm?~
sounds like iron maiden
03depends what kind it is, really
....sagas. This song?! From a musical? *facehoof*
Nyria: A physical? Oh my
12even if it won't go away
LOL
12youcan shrink it
i'm good Nyria did it go well
12prolong your life
LadyCanary: Why not?
Of course it went well~
cachi01|rockband3: Not likely. Bruce Dickinsons voice isnt this girly sounding. And maiden is a bit heavier.
12well, Edd fell to leukemia
12but then again there's always
12ahh
Everything is fine thankfully ^^
Dat Futashy is steam rolling everyone lol
sagas: .. from a musical..? :D
03well yeah, leukemia is kinda bad
This song is called Enter the Metal World, by Battle Beast. Brought to you by Shazam. :P
sagas: It sounds NOTHING like something from a musical. And I've seen many in my lifetime.
12yeah
12he was doing well, but then went into remission
Airpuff: Why not?
sagas: i beg to differ.. its a bit too heavy :D
Thank you ZappyTheUnicorn ^__^
good to hear Nyria
it's one of the more difficult types of cancer to treat
Hai LadyCanary :)
I wonder, does anypony like King Diamond or Mercyful Fate? :o
12:c
sadly
00,10nice shot sir
LadyCanary: your welcome, and hello.

Hihi DaringDude and ZappyTheUnicorn :3

12D:
Can you kill your own team in TF2? O.o
hi DaringDude
LadyCanary: Well its narritive driven lyrics with a large group for a chorus. Musically for me. Like one of those hip broadway plays
LadyCanary: These names are very new to me~
LadyCanary haven't heard of eithor of them are they good
LadyCanary: they well known? never heard of em before

LadyCanary: well king diamond didn sound like a heavy metal.. thingy :D
/me waits for the right moment to play TF2.
:D
03no?
nono
hiiii alll!
03Apple was actually good at first
There once was a man in Puru, who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come ture.
Hi Mutterguy.
03:P
and to not be a money hog
;D
tbh it would be better to stop WWI
03which, granted, is quite hilarious
hey Mutterguy hows your day been
HI Mutterguy!
03Nick, why?
So...you cant hurt teammates??
03WWI was less deadly
O.o
LadyCanary: 6_9
03granted who knows what would have happened if Germany's economy wasn't destroyed as a result
03because that's how Hitler came into power
Well technically I got snowed in yesterday
tf2 with friendly fire = Fuuuu... let's better play mw3
xd
02Stop WWI, WWII might not happen
So how would Spy-checking work if you could take friendly damage?
That basically yeah
hey guys im gonna be in albany on saturday pretty psyched
what do you mean Mutterguy it's summer right
i don't have tf2 :'(
my mom liked still alive =D
lightingzoom: I dont either...
but now she wont stay away from the xbox :|
cachi01: Oh the irony. :D
........
but WW1 pretty much made the Russian Revolution speed up, thus forming the USSR, WWII happens then the Cold War happens and it becomes someting else one after the other
As in there was snow and and the usual response here is SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING. alexxm so says you MR Nothern hemisphere :P
Wrek: Crack that whip!
03USSR wasn't as bad, since the cold war wasn't an actual, you know, war
ZappyTheUnicorn: they weird thing is that this always happens :D
Woodenshy|Facebook_a why are you going to albany
03and the soviets were actually our allies in WWII
surprisingly
xD
cachi01: lol :D
and
well guess i derped there Mutterguy
NASA.
03well if anything, the competition helped both countries LOL
...Might I make a suggestion?
SLAP MAI ASS.
03I'm not saying the Soviets were a good model, tons of people died and all that
does the whipping do anything in the game
...O mai.
That's what the whip is reminding me of XD
03XD
LadyCanary: Is that a request?~
Seriously Wrek .. that whip of yours :D
Nyria: :| Nuuu.
Of course not. It's a demand.
I mean what?
Oh okay, sorry I just walked in here~
02Revolutionary war would be a good war to stop. It was completely unnecessary
02if you ask me
in b4 Little Miss LadyCanary ...
07that
07I actually agree with lol
what is it with team fortress and hats
?
What chu talkin bout Mutterguy
03LOL what
alexxm: What is it with valve and hats you mean~
NOTHING!
so basically this: archduke ferdinand assisnated>euro powers declare war>russian revolutionaries take advantage of war to to overthrow the tsars, form USSR>WW1 ends via treaty>versailles treaty heavily penalises Germany, creates great anger and basically gives rise to Nazi Party>Once in power, Nazis perfect their battle plans for modern warfare (blitzkrieg)
yeah i guess Nyria
alexxm: i dont know but may i have your hat sir?
/me hides
It's like a medal~
cachi01 i have no hats
03no I know
07if we were still british, we'd basically be one large country that included Canadia
It shows you played it for along time or you have enough spare money~
alexxm::|
'canadia'
xD
03there's really no telling what would happen in any of these cases
03I mean even with WWII
cachi01: Is this the krusty krab?~
03so you stop Hitler, fine, but Germany would basically be a poor country
03and might not be the place they are today
and practice in Spanish Civil war>Start seizing territories and Europe tries to appease them to prevent war>fails, WW2 starts>Germans invade Russia regardless of Non agression pact> and I think you see my point here
03this is why time travel is a mindf-
Nyria: no this is patrick
WW1 really was where it all shaped modern history in the west
cachi01: Spot on ^^ /)
sorry cachi01 but you can have this *gives him the book of the dead
Hello this is dog.
Nyria: (\
book of dead?
Moshi moshi dog desu
/me opens book of dead
Mutterguy: http://thazing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/thazing-2117.jpg
/me 08,01is a terrible person
the bitterness from th treaty of versailes was what set things in motion for WWII, because the german people felt insulted by the fact that they had to have to take full responsibility for the war
Nyria: ... da fuq? :d
*the
at least that's how I think
03WW1 was hardly modern
/me glomps Suturn
03against each other
03:P
Nyria how did that happen
Nyria: WAT. I laughed...
I have no idea~
yeah but there is a saying in the Uk that WW1 although this rings true for all sides, that it was 'lions led by donkeys'
Hitler just played on their bitterness...even without him it still would have been there. I think someone else would have explioted it instead if he wasn't there.
/me glomps Nyria
Be riiight back
wooo pased you up on the score board Wrek
Someone shoved a bathtub into a phone booth. Duh!
/me hugs alexxm back~
LOLZ
11,01Wrek sure loves to whip people.
like the cavalry charge and facing each other on an open field
Hello Bronystate! What goes on today?
I don't blame him~ Whipping is nice~
when the modern rifles were introduced, that form of warfare was suicide
11,01Hi FlootahShy
0_0
For all those involved
WWI ushered in a lot of new weapons/technology as well
Nittany_Discord: so thats why he gave AJ a whip on his completed picture
hey FlootahShy hows your day been
yeah thats what I'm getting at
11,01I didn't see a whip.
DaringDude: That isn't all he gave her.
like mustard gas, machine guns, tanks...
yeah
00,03I whip my peeps back and forth I whip my peeps back and forth~
alexxm: good, how about yours?
03WWI was trench warfare
03WWII was easily more deadly
in fact in WWII, the UK/France were preparing trenches expecting somethign like WW1
i'm good FlootahShy
oooh, now i know what's on the stream
O really i didnt notice Om.....
sort of...
DaringDude: Oh, would you like me to point it out?
Germany made the whole concept of Blitzkrieg/armoured/combined arms warfare to defeat that and they rolled over Europe in like a year
00,03Mutterguy: It's MW3
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hey I just met you and that song is crazy, here's my whip, Sometime in my room maybe?~
or two
00,03Nyria <3
hehe~ <3
Nyria: Was that a reference to something?
Om i think im ok
11,01Where's the predator missile?
11,01There are no killstreaks. :p
07is it just me or are european people so much more knowledgeable about wars despite the US being so gun-happy
07|D
lol
CupcakeWarrior: That one song~ The one that's parody'd on the internet so many times~
no killstreaks im not playing!
lol
DaringDude: You sure? Well, if its to hard to spot just zoom in a bit.
OK. I just want to throw it out there that whenever I see MW I keep thinking mechwarrior for some odd reason
03depends on what side you study, really
but I do like military history
he is so sexy
I'm a history nut so I know that sort of stuff
/me looks at Wrek's finished drawing
DaringDude you act like you have a choice
have been since I was a child
0_0 Ill be in the bathroom...
that`s not funne
Hey everypony
lol
03I like studying wars, but it's been a few years since I took history
hey Very_Silly_Filly what have you been up to
I'm back after a bunch of random things
12back
11,01I'd like to see CoD vets play L4D2. That game requires teamwork to win.
Very_Silly_Filly: Hi, dont look at wrek's latest drawing
I went for a bit a cycle
Nittany_Discord: im a cod vet :3
Nittany_Discord: Why, you think they would do worse? ^^
how'd it go Very_Silly_Filly
Nittany_Discord: my l4d2 is for xbox
11,01Not saying all of them would do poorly.
im a pony
Well, I went about three times the distance I wanted
yeah... I should trek out into the sonw and get lunch. I spied a bus
11,01The stereotypical CoD player might fail.
I'm pretty much dieing here from how knackered I am
back
Nittany_Discord: I want to play a game.. http://wiki.urbandead.com/images/c/c6/SAW_TV.gif
considering WWI was triggered by a relatively small conflict, I worry if something similar could happen today :/
FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
03I worry more about Skynet
03:P
11,01I have that game.
Nyria what do you do in it
11,01No dis to CoD players. CoD is fun.
07*google
07there, fixed it
Syria? @ Kos
Hello all :)
BRB
alexxm: Uh.. There's a room filled with legos and the exit is on the other side of the room~
that really worries me since ya know, China and RUssia wanna act all Cold War again about it
hi irish_pony
I'm thinking more of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but syria could play in too
i tend not to dis people on what games they play i mean i don't want to be dissed for being a brony so why should i dis someone for playinf cod
yes
it is with friends and in the infected ffa gunplay playlist :3
yeah I'm going to get food. back later. Hopefully I don't slip and end up at @ ED...
I can already see sides forming around that issue
internationally
hey Irish_Pony hows your day been
I try not to judge people on what they play, but I can't help but hate CoD
Nyria: Whatever fate I'm jelly
03Kyubree, google itself isn't going to start killing people
lol its just a game i dont see whhy the hate
03it's more if militaries rely too much on AI
same here cachi01
*Making a new CoD game* Hmmm... How to get people to buy.... Shoot people... WITH MORE GUNS! YES!
03and let's face it, that can certainly happen
Mutterguy: Mmmm~ Jelly
I guess I'd have to try it out to see what's so wrong with CoD.
CupcakeWarrior: yea?
IMO, I think it's contributed with how the gaming community has fallen
Bronysith: Giant gummy bear
CupcakeWarrior: ikr
Oh well I have food that was accidently left in the oven for an hour~ Still good though
Kandarihu: the only thing wrong with it its that its the same thing every year
who here knows Alfa995?
Before CoD and Halo and such came out, the community was more into OTHER games
a*
Kandarihu: people really overreact to CoD
cachi01: I see.
00,03Thunderstorms :'(
also, Nick, China had sent a message to the nation of seychelles a couple months ago telling them to prepare for "total war," since they apparently house chinese weaponry
which obviously really worries me
Scoot-Scootaloo: hi there
By other, I don't mean bloody porno's. usosilly
i might be that pony that strangely obsessed with Jelly as in Jello, not jam but they aren't mutually exclusive
lol nick alert for Seychelles
you scared of them Scoot-Scootaloo
|D
Hello Scoot-Scootaloo.
forgot you had that nick XD
anyone else just get kicked off of steam?
11,01Chrysalis: No.
Yeah, it just logged me out actually :s
Chrysalis: Yes
Right, back to work!
back later everyone!
any ideas why that happened
huh, maybe a login server went donw
Mutterguy: may the force be with you
wait really kos?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m57hl8GCDV1rr3l61o1_500.gif
bye Mutterguy
Chrysalis: yeah like 10 mins ago
Nyria: ikr
nah i lost connection about 2 mins
kicked me out the game which was annoying
yeah
On the last day of school, I'm gonna bring one of my guns in and shoot the sky
Nyria: That's exactly how I feel on the last day of school!
when did that happen?
Wrek: welp im done for a while......those spys are really buggin me
11,01And get arrested?
There is that actually :c
a couple months ago, I think like february or so
I would love to do that though
so does whipping the scout make him go faster
The amount of screams would be epic
alexxm: most likely yea
alexxm: yes
http://cowboycurtis89.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ballface.gif
alexxm: No safe word, so I presume so ;)
thanks ZappyTheUnicorn and Bronysith
Derpy_Hooves: I stared it down~
any time alexxm

Derpy_Hooves: That would be fucking scary in 3D
damnit, "We'll be updating the #Steam servers on Tuesday, June 5th, 2012 at approximately 18:00 PDT (GMT-0700)"
considering the condition of the global economy it wouldn't surprise me if some kind of conflict broke out :/
i'm assuming thats now
Should I go to footy ? Carlton vs Geelong. Well I'm not
why would china wanna go to war with some tiny island in the indian ocean?
oh wait, its thurs
Derpy_Hooves jesus what the hell is that thing
no no
Chrysalis: june the 5th?
Chrysalis: I doub tit, it's 0113 here
although looking at it on the maps its not far from the suez canal opening to the indian ocean...
I just realized that I've been watching Wrek play TF2 for over an hour, thinking about wanting to join in.
huh, UK?
12everyone should chill out, eat kfc and spread peace
seychelles houses chinese weaponry for the sake of chin
alexxm at first i thought it was the moon from majoras mask lol
a
12screw war
GMT = UK and that area
anyone that got disconnected NOT in the UK?

Bronysith: same lol
12I'm too lazy to fight for people sitting in their fancy chairs
Chrysalis i'm from england
12who had a conflict with other posh fancy chair people
08,01i am a terrible person
Brits unite!
were you disconnected?
and why do china wanna go to war with them over that?
12wheeee
China wasn't specific about what kind of "war" it was referring to, it just told seychelles to be aware that one is coming in the future
since ya know syria also has their weapons
Suturn: what did u do?

03this seems like the ending of the play
03or maybe I'm forgetting it
I'm watching a video that happens to have Q in it...
yes... yes you are
lol..
and wow, he's just like Discord
uh
spahs
Only he's more jerkish and pretty much god.
00,10well yeah Discord was based on Q
WindWhistler well he is based on Q
Dat auto tune~
Oh, I didn't know that. All I knew was that Discord was voiced by the same guy
Sumica who? I don't know who Q is
I'm 14, k?
/me is hungry
Canadian_Brony: from Star Trek, The Next Generation.
Canadian_Brony: Excuses ~
Canadian_Brony the guy who discord is based on
Canadian_Brony: im 14 also and i know who is Q
being 14 doesn't excuse you from being ignorant
kissy kissy
I keep thinking blister in the sun
Q is best discord.. :d
and guess what my desktop resolution is
my leg is aching
Actually, someone accused me of living under a rock for the past 30 years just because I didn't know how the RickRoll became a meme.
1920x1080!
11,01JDL's Q and other Qs were in later Star Trek series.
Woah.. He's big~
08,01we watching star trek?
Kandarihu k, thx. Nyria umm, okay. alexxm that's not helpful. cachi01 that's not helping either
I repaired the HDTV today
Man hes huge
12I saw Gattaca last night
all new capacitors
lol
large man...
they are Nichion
08,01oh, we're watching the... thing
Hello.... is this Gundam?
Dem lovebirds.

Hey everypony! I'm back!

hi Biglaw
Wb Biglaw.
Hi Biglaw
Are they small.. or are they large? or.. what :s
hey Biglaw hows your day been
hi Biglaw
Hey Biglaw~
That Man is a SPY!
Hey Biglaw
alexxm good
So... what the heck is this? For some reason, I thought it was Gundam.
that SPY is a Man
that man is a person
Oh thank god it's a jet~
I already tested the ATSC/NTSC tuner
that works
Airpuff: they are small conpared to the eninmes they are fighting which are as big as the human mechs
THAT MAN IS A JET
plus the VGA input works too
Biglaw: ...
Shamroc: okai :D
the prisoners escaped
/me crash glomps into Biglaw
Well, that's an idea. If someone would stream the Star Trek TNG episodes with Q in them, that would be awesome. Q is featured in both the season premier and the finale and goes through some nice character development over the course of the series.
nope foun em
that is ma jet a

WindWhistler: deus ex machinas

So...This show is about kids from a school who find a portal to a video game world, and when they go in it, they become CGI ninjas that have a friend in the video game world that can go to large towers and deactivate them with the SAME DAMN CODE every tower, and these towers almost kill the kids in the real world, but they don't die because activating a tower (Or deactivating, I don't know) causes a time warp that saves the day?
CupcakeWarrior: :) Way ahead of you! Foundation is 2 rack of ribs

nintendo video should not count. its pretty much shoved in your face to download and its worthless
pony_7007: its not you, this is almost as painful to watch as the Gamefly commercials :)
ingwaz: I can't wait for that.:)
How dare you try and infiltrate my home, in hopes you may steal my precious jewels

ingwaz: me too
geeky-brony: batter up!
sagas: lol
DocSane: Time to innovate myself while I have the opportunity to.

MahBoi777: lol :d
TheRainbowDash: And take some advice from a grownup: no matter how crappy anything in high school may seem, it counts for exactly jack and squat once you leave.
D:
CCCP: its because of his boring monotone voice
sagas: last time there was a good reaction
CCCP: except for nintendo, nintendo was awesome as always
none of this really interests me... but then again, my most recent gamesystem is an old PS2.
DocSane: Wow, i needed to hear that.
I want a pokemon game that has all the regions and all the pokemon in a single game - call it Pokemon Overdose
hen3ry: dat ps2 :D
hen3ry: kingdom hearts ftw
cachi01: No... just no
The guy could at least try to sound like he's not bored as all hell
hen3ry: Hey, I still have my Sega Genesis and N64
DocSane: Yeah, everything counts now. Well, at least I'm starting on a good foundation, taking AP/IB classes next year.

SuperBrony64: I can't hear it that well, it's really quiet
MahBoi777: Well they had to bring out this new guy, so clearly the old guy needed a break!
New Super Mario Bros 2 meh. I've played the first 1 it's alright.
Hey, wanna flip a coin?

cachi01: printception?
cachi01: I do that everyday at home. How is that unusual?
Thst one greek king who turned everything he touched into gold?

If that happens....
MahBoi777: eeeyups
While watching John Carter, there's a point where the good guys break into the enemy city to save Princess Dejah Thoris. They're told that she and the bad guy are in the other city, getting married. My friend next to me suddenly said "Your princess is in another castle!"
I'll RAAAAAAAAAAAAGE
RaveBrony: eyup

No one would do that
I've been waiting for over a year since this game was announced!
WindWhistler: do eet

WindWhistler: Did you say RAGE!?! :[
DocSane: we are sorry john carter but our princess is in another castle!

CCCP: waht
Cypresswolf: lol :D

I cant believe that Nintendo thinks the 3DS is such a big deal that it needs its own conference
Leave him, leave player 2 behind to die!
SunderlandPony89: 3DS came before its time. Its games have too many issues...
WindWhistler: in 3 months in Japan

sometimes malicious rumours are spread for financial gain. eg,
make a bad rumour about company X,
stock prices drop, buy stock while it's cheaper,
stock prices rise & you profit
Wii Fit U sounds like it's going to prompt a lot of dirty jokes.
3I'm streaming for whoever asked.
The only thing I actually looked forward to that I found out last week? Lego LOTR
Its always AWESOME
inb4 people remove platforms under others

MahBoi777: lol

00,03I... I don't know what to say...
SuperBrony64: A Pokemon title should never have a number!
03it doesn't mean anything
11,01Everything but SuperBrony64 is terrible.
geeky-brony: inb4 her name is Zelda:P
11,02I like Pokemon, but having a sequel like that is stupid
03but nice try LOL

MahBoi777: i knows
SuperBrony64: why is it stupid?

SB64: Yeah, it's totally different from every other Pokemon title in that they actually change the color. :P
11,01SuperBrony64: E3: Sequels and Motion Controls.
SuperBrony64: I suggested rainbow version. But everyone was like...nah..lets just put a 2 on the end of it.

Wow, that's a terrible description

SEX IS INTERCOURSE?! YOU DONT SAY?!
CCCP: I opened with where MLP came from, showed a bit of Midnight Castle, then the movie, then a bit of MLP Tales.
Bonding of the souls.
sex is sexual intercourse?? hmm
00,03Sex is not supposed to have fun >: (
Who is this guy
yo man
.. dat rapeface...
00,03be*
hi
Sex is sexually stimulating someone else
yay
this vid means SlurryMoon is streaming
12 ih
DocSane: is it on youtube?
....
Scoot-Scootaloo: agreed, its a disgusting state of mind
Scoot-Scootaloo: lies
hai SlurryMoon ~
sex is sexual
wtf
CCCP: No.
He has a weird sexlife
DocSane: awwww
sagas: by that definition, making r34 stuff is sex
What the fuck is this?
/me feels unsafe
LOL
yay
OH UCK NO. NOT RELIGION.
^
Man I've got some really good Spongegbob YTP's :P
WAHT IN OBLIVIN
CCCP: If it's on YouTube, why do it at a con?
Litwick: there's nothing wrong with that.
Violin is worst sex noise O_o
*Spongebob
Don't drag religion into this please no!
yay
00,03NERRRRRRRD
DocSane: but i wanted to see it :(
for oblivion what is he talking about?
Indeed
hen3ry: On a personal level
foreeeeeeeever :O
03Way to go
Yes, the sequel idea is dumb. Much better idea would be to have just remade the last 2 games with a few added bits of storyline. It's so stupid to be getting new characters, new storyline, an expanded regional pokedex, and continuity between games.
CCCP: I also showed the Dexter's Lab cartoon where Dee-Dee wanted to be a Pony Puff Princess.
/me hides
that chick looks like sh want to hit him
Kandarihu: I don't mind people believing in gods, but don't drag religion into unneeded thiungs.
haha
wait what?
Lul.
DocSane: lol xD
Ohai baby... i can haz the sex now, pl0x?
This guy is fucking retarded
3you gonna die if you have sex o.o
yes
3Oh man
hahaha
3oh man
CCCP: Which was notable because Craig McCracken worked on it.
00,03You would get a knife!
RaveBrony: careful, it may kill u
oh man im going to die
Its worth it
MahBoi777: I know o.o
I mean, why not just release Grey so I can fight N and Ghetsis again, but now with Kyurem?
I saw Full Metal Jacket today. Yeah it was epic! :)
best way to die. in bed, at age 80, with a couple playmates.
Nothing like scaring the kids from having sex
twilight_sprinkle: Nonono, normal sex is not disgusting, it's natural. chrysalis.swf is a disgusting state of mind, sir.
DocSane: he did? oh
SlurryMoon yolo(?)
CCCP: And he later went on to marry Lauren Faust.
11,01Sex is fatal. Don't have sex.
wer going to die enny way
Sex is best death tho >.>
11,01:p
DocSane: i knew that
who r longtail
O hey Nittany_Discord :)
Fun fact: 100% of people will die.
Did you know if you drivea car, you're gonna die
yay
Death by snu snu?
Lol RaveBrony
00,03Everypony! Don't have sex or you will die a horrible, painful death!
but i din't know he did that! DocSane
uh
CK|Bed: not if our god friend condom helps us
Scoot-Scootaloo: :O
11,02Why is Barrack Obama lecturing these kids?
Scoot-Scootaloo: ok
Did he just call a penis a "wee-wee"?
every creature on this earth is gonna die
Hai SuperBrony64
CK|Bed: goodd*
SuperBrony64: xD
Scoot-Scootaloo: It would be worth it
WHAT IS HE FOUR?
CCCP: He was art consultant on it.
no exceptions
Scoot-Scootaloo: Pfffft!! Ill die with a smile on my face then! :[
3Magic Johnson is gonna die in front of you all because of sex before marrage D:
SuperBrony64: LMAO :D
SuperBrony64: O YOU! :D
11,02Hai CupcakeWarrior :3
SuperBrony64: lols
LOL SuperBrony64
yay
I have no idea
DocSane: i see
SuperBrony64: does he even sound like Obama?
Scoot-Scootaloo: If you have sex you WILL get chlamydia and you WILL die.
00,03If you have sex, your *** will fall off to another dimension where dogs will eat it.
CCCP: I think the Pony Puff Princess in that short looks a bit like Pinkie Pie.
this guy, he gonna die. you, you gonna die. me, i'm gonna die. everyone dies
Scoot-Scootaloo: lol
Scoot-Scootaloo: isn't that a family guy referance?
Scoot-Scootaloo: sounds like fun
I don wanna die!:O
were all dying :(
Scoot-Scootaloo: Family Guy /)
11,02Kandarihu: Kinda :D
family guy nice Scoot-Scootaloo!
Im betting driving a car is more dangerouse statistically deadly
00,03Yessir~
The only thing I've done with a girl is dance with 1 :)
CK|Bed: sex is when people discard all thought and focus on pleasure, and imo thats immoral and disgusting
Sex: it's bad for you. That's why you should focus entirely on R34 on the internet instead.
y we watch dis?
DocSane: :)
That guy is just jelly he couldnt get sex before marriage >.>
CCCP: But my point in the panel was that FiM is basically a combination of G1 MLP and MLP Tales.
0,14Sex? Bad?
He's not speaking against all sex. Just irresponsible sex.
someone who now doesn't like you :P
I fucking hate morally self-rightouse people like that

11,01This stream is so slurry!
twilight_sprinkle: Except that it's not. There's nothing wrong with enjoying it. It's supposed to be enjoyable, otherwise any given species would die out. >_>
gintent red thing
twilight_sprinkle: no, it isn't. Trust me.
50 pts? worth it
...
CCCP: And the FiM pilot is essentially a remake of Midnight Castle. Lots of story elements are 1:1 between them, starting with the villain who wants to plunge the world into eternal darkness.
/me is an achievement whore
xD
lol this is like me
The dissappointment in his voice after this is heartbraking
11,01It's so hard to wade through.
datt huge ass wall
CK|Bed: its not about enjoyment.
Worth the 50 pts

I'd like to enjoy this, but I'm getting yanked out.

twilight_sprinkle: Yes, it is, actually. If it weren't, then you wouldn't exist. :p
DocSane: it is? i must see this now
CK|Bed: I dunno. I don't think cats enjoy sex. Fuckers howl like the world is ending.

Eddmario: Static.
wow, I never knew that he was interested in Static music

that denial
Ah yes, buy what is more addicting than Bronystate? That is something quite hard to find
Videofreak1127: I'm a adict of Bronystate, even ask Shizuka
that alright geeky-brony. Go enjoy whatever the hell your about to do with your life outside Bronystate

FlareChaser: That's ominous
02well, I will admit the PSP and Vita have some pretty good games, but I don't think they can replace the DS/3DS
*omenous
/me is now too scared to sleep

03PSP has better graphics than the 3DS >_>

WorldTraveler: I'm from the state of (wait for it) Mane
WorldTraveler: Right... its what i meant but spelled right
XD
I made a travel blog and am doing a world tour
wow this game looks as easy as pinkie pie
Huh. I'm from Neighvada, myself
02who cares about graphics if the game is crapy
wow
Well, Lesson learned today kids, Bronies shouldnt hate eachother or be mean to eachother on purpose, we should love and tolerate eachother, we should all just calm down and become friends.
I LOVE DIS SONG!!!:)
:D
DaringDude sooo, extremely difficult to understand?
Nopony will guess where I'm from!
Las Pegasus

Zebrica I've heard before.... I thought it was Caneighda
Canadian_Brony: BC?
WorldTraveler: Is there a pun for texas?
So guys, Announcement Time: Since what was meant to be a joke has now unintintionally led to me hurting somebody's feelings, and to people taking stuff too far in other cases, I won't be doing the "Official Ship" stuff anymore. The google doc's being deleted, and I won't be writing anymore shipfics.
Canadian_Brony: You're clearly from Prance.
a donkey one. Also for Kansas
02I've seen PS do worse stuff
FlareChaser yeah! Guess the city
What can you make out of "Sauk Centre"?
03inb4 too much dust
Canadian_Brony: Umm...city or town?
03I hate Sony too, but PSP is a decent system
03as is the original DS
/me glomps bee3ry
033DS is just unnecessary for what it adds
03it's like, 10% better, buy an entirely new system
Big town... Small City
Texass and Kansass where most of the Donkeys of equestria come from I guess
Bed time for me... good night everypony! Take care and behave! :D My apologies to whomever is streaming atm >.<

Canadian_Brony: ....Vancouver?
Nighty RaveBrony

RAWRity: Really? One person takes something to seriously and you back off? Screw the guy, if he can't take the heat...

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/997822-/61336418
FlareChaser Canadians generally use time to measure distance
Whinnesota
either way
although when you think about it, isn't Rarity's rant about why being called a 'mule' is offensive.... kinda racist?
Because, your house must lack spiders Videofreak1127
Whinneapolis, Whinnesota
Big_Macintosh_1992: /)
That must be it
SunderlandPony89: you? (\
Canadian_Brony: ugh, screw that.
Canadian_Brony: I learned that 19.8 parsecs ago!
02Games can freeze, that’s to be expected
scared me half to death
O.O
SunderlandPony89: The whole shipping thing was always meant to be a harmless joke, but it seems taht, despite my intentions with it, it can lead to people feeling bullied or ostracized. I care a lot about this site and the people I talk to on it, and the last thing I want to do is make somebody feel unwelcome.
SunderlandPony89: *cough* *cough*
SHIP ALL the MODS
9 hours north of Vancouver... hmm... Prince George?
/me ships.... Bananas
/me ships... stuff... <.< >.>
another Alicorn?
when I get on the internet, I leave my ability to be offended or give a shit at the door
bee3ry daaaayuuum, right on the money!
/me noms on RAWRity
i don't understand those who fail to do likewise
ohai everypony! :D
although I once made a joke of henry VIII
Hey valoreins
o hai valoreins @
WorldTraveler: well that's a step too far
make him a female chicken HENry VII
hi valoreins
RAWRity: I still think he's just taking to it damn seriously. But hey, you can do what you want
*VIII
WorldTraveler: too soon
who's streaming now?
lol spyro
Prince George, the alicorn
I was a Sony Console and Nintendo Handheld fanboy
lol
OKAY who left Biglaw with the shipping license?!
Canadian_Brony: huzzabah wha?
02http://exophase.com/3240/psp-overheats-in-childs-pocket/ <-- at least Nintendo's stuff never does that
Now I'm a retrosega, PS1/2 and Nintendo fanboy :D
Henry VIII? Isn't he the one who turned his seventh wife into jam?
o-O
03haha Farmington Hills

Detroid
hah
see ya around
I feel like I should got o bed soon, but I don't wanna because I'm having so much fun
what would be a good pony pun of Spain?
bye SlurryMoon :)
I think something Mane, but not sure
RAWRity I remember Reikim saying something about you planning something
Maybe Espana would be easier to use...
Canadian_Brony: is all your road maintennance money being spent on health care or something?
yup
I'd take health care over road maintennnance
and SunderlandPony89, it's not just tonight. People took the otakon shipping joke so far that the mods had to step in, because people were making pedophile jokes. If that's what is going to come from that, then I'd much rather get rid of it.
I'm going to bed
goodnight all
Espotro.
Canadian_Brony: well there ya go then
RAWRity yikes, I'm glad I missed THAT
where bull fighting is actually more like minotaurs mexican wrestling each other
Spain
ohbai Videofreak1127
Es from Espana + potro = Spanish for "pony"
bee3ry: ooh nice you've expanded my headcanon
RAWRity: Woah. Now pedophile jokes are going a bit far. Jokes like that shouldn't be allowed, but the basic otakon shipping is harmless I think
huh?
02man, I hate websites with white text over black
02:|
03go make me a theme already
do you guys know the pony year is in AD?
SunderlandPony89: wheter it's harmless or not, it's what people were doing with it that was problematic. Better to get rid of it and be without one (admittedly rather tired) joke, then to let people continue to be ostracized here.
Remember, it cannot contain white or silver
He hates those colours
02I can't see anything right now after going on this website
:p
What are we arguing about now?
A.D -- After Discord
03in that case
033DS sucks
/me runs
CupcakeWarrior shipping
02brb
I think . . .
1003, WorldTraveler
CupcakeWarrior: shit happened, fixed it, meanwhile is happy now.
we are arguing about jokes
CupcakeWarrior: I've decided to stop the "Official Bronystate Ship" stuff.
Aww :(
Why?
FlareChaser meanwhile? How did he get into this?
pedo jokes equals unfunny, CupcakeWarrior
seriously arguing about jokes being serious... :s
Canadian_Brony: why my good sir, he was the 1# ship.
now Biglaw says hes gonna ship which scares me and makes me want to slap him.
/me slaps Biglaw
Dead stream?
RAWRity: I can get behind stopping a joke if it's getting old, but not because someone takes offense to it. Oh well, might as well just be done with the whole thing to avoid anymore shit
I'm not shipping
CupcakeWarrior: well, it's unintentionally led to me making FlareChaser feel bullied, and people making pedo jokes about otakon. I meant it as some harmless prodding of fun at my friends, but apparently it leads to this.
FlareChaser I though that was otakon, though. I mean, when your official ship is EVERYTHING, that puts you up pretty damn high
isn't pedo the word for feet?
Biglaw: good.
yet
:p
Pedometrist
Pedometer
And whoever said this was an arguement?
pedocure?
wait
it's from pedis, I believe is Latin for feet
pedicure
Biglaw I think it's "Pedicure", but I don't care
OTP= Bronies + Ponies
Canadian_Brony I corrected myself
However, when used as a word on its own, it definately does not mean "feet"
bee3ry that would make sense, cuz Manus is latin for Hand
Canadian_Brony: we can still have shippings, but I'd just say lets respect each others shippings, thats what we Bronies are all about right? Caring for eachother, face it we're all one big family.
Look at mah Pedis
the ped root means foot in greek, and child in latin, I think
anyway, I'm off.
Stuff to do.
weird
Cya then RAWRity
FlareChaser okay, I get it now . . . hmmm . . .
0,14later RAWRity
RAWRity: cya dude :)
bye RAWRity
yeah, that's right
/me ships FlareChaser with ClareFhaser
FlareChaser: awww *hugs FlareChaser *

should pony have a Vactican?
Biglaw: wat
RAWRity see you soon!
/me hugs teh|PheonixWright
WorldTraveler: are you doing a pony world map?
Travel blog.... like the travel channel
in my head canon, the capital of Prance is Piaffe instead of Paris
I'm going to bunches of locations and talking about them
do you like that one, WorldTraveler ?
RAWRity's gone? Let the fun begin
:3
......dafuq just happened?
I do plan to go to Paris and Mareseilles
/me ships... Coconuts
/me kicks Canadian_Brony out. Trust me, you DONT want to be here
Biglaw: no, thats bad and you should feel bad.
/me goes to United Kingdom
SunderlandPony89 wait a minute, I'll be back in a sec!
this place is nice..
I only ship myself and Lyra
/me grabs his Newfie friend
SunderlandPony89 I went to Michigan a few times, and the first thing I said when I got there was "It smells like burnt toast here."
now I'm prepared!
CupcakeWarrior: I'd be sure it would be a good ship ;)
I liek Lyra <3
WorldTraveler: in my unfinished fanfic I called England "Geldingland"
FlareChaser: yes it is, its the whole reason why i stayed
Computer derp. Back :)
teh|PheonixWright: Holy shit, can I move in with you?
Biglaw: I'd gladly move to Canada or the UK given the chance. But alas, I am poor
WorldTraveler: I remember seeing a "world map" of Equestria somewhere back that had a lot of rl nation parodies
Hi
FlareChaser: not to sure about that
I do too
see? I'm ready as I will never be!
hi Comet
I see a big laoding screen
teh|PheonixWright: ...I will be a maid.
I would like to be a tree :)
Will anyone be streaming soon?
SunderlandPony89 Canada is great, we have health caarre, and Bacon, and hockeeey, and maple syruuuup
Comet that's cuz nopony's streaming currently
FlareChaser: HOLD IT!!....no
Biglaw: Just be glad you dont live here
I plan on visiting the Gallopagoes Islands hopefully
ugh I couldn't stand moving anywhere where soccer was bigger than baseball, I'd commit suicide
Biglaw: And canadian bacon :P
/me chugs Maple Syrup
teh|PheonixWright: aw... okay.. well, yeah..
They should atleast stream every episode
CupcakeWarrior most certainly.
FlareChaser: yeah...:)
Canada is boring guys, lets go get an island and name it Brony island.
^^6
YEAH!!!
FlareChaser: YEAH
get it, Gallop-agos Islands
yes
BEST IDEA
Of course, canadian bacon isnt actually bacon
08,01goddamn
/me makes the Brony Island Fund
But, Brony Island is right next to Manehattan, isn't it?
roid rage pony: YEEEEAH
Comet just wait unil Movie NIght, they stream 2 movies and 2 Pony episodes, each one voted by the community

I like Skype
Nope
I like Skype.
5 days. each day 2 movies picked by lottery
neeeope
i has skype
hi flutter_spin, and nnope
anyone want to add me on Skype? midniteflames.
this week my vote got picked for pony episode even though I really only cared about my movie choices
Just reworking my stories. Adding bulk, emotions, backstory, etc.
I picked Sidekicks and The Postman
FlareChaser: WTF is skype?
teh|PheonixWright: ...google it.
teh|PheonixWright: Hvave you not heard?
I voted for Good Bad and the Ugly for A movie, and White Heat for B movie
SunderlandPony89: no
teh|PhoenixWright Skype is a free, onling video chat service
both incredible film experiences
FlareChaser: Ill add you
CupcakeWarrior: good..good..
FREE CALLS???
We should have a lottery week
I got a question. How many Dark Souls players out there? Any at all? :3
FlareChaser: As soon as I make an account really fast :P
* RUNS TO INTERNETZ*
Shamroc: Good news, we cant ship you with Scootaloo anymore unless you want it.
teh|PhoenixWright eeyup
CupcakeWarrior: lol
SaxyPretender: I know! We've had this convo like 8 times now!
that way MANY people that might not normally get the chance to win, win
0,14oh yeah...
what do you think Saxy?
wait...if we cant force shippings anymore, whats Meanwhile gonna do?
I finally get picked for the lottery and it's for the pony episode, but I love all the pony eps and was hoping for my movies
..oh....shit..
FlareChaser so, somepony actually shipped another with Scootaloo? SHe's a filly! At least I would choose a grown mare like Rainbow Dash to get shipped with
"His balls aren't strong enough" is the first thing that popped in my head. What's wrong with me.
we have a whole week of lottery picked movies
besides the movies that got picked sound really sucky
CRAP DON'T SHIP ME!!!
No Dark Souls players out there? :(
0,14of, WorldTraveler?
0,14oh
Canadian_Brony X DONT SHIP ME BRO
0,14week of lottery movies...
Canadian_Brony: you want a ship? :D
0,14hmmm
0,14not sure if feasible
If Im only shipped with certain ponies i wont mind :)
I don't think it would be that hard
/me yells at FlareChaser "NO!!!!"
Irish_Pony x Gamer_Luna
Alright. So Mom issued me to pay the insurance. That's alright. It is only ... $400? crap
instead of 2 movie winners, just pick 10
CupcakeWarrior: Exactly :)
Irish_Pony: Good news, we cant force you now unless you want the ship :)
SunderlandPony89 you do that again, your getting shipped with Duct Tape!
Mon-Fri at least
Canadian_Brony X DONT. SHIP. ME. BRO.
11,01Irish_Luna x Gamer_Pony
Nittany_Discord: now say mine :|
like the week long things you guys sometimes do
SaxyPretender: how do you mods even get the rips?
0,14Magic >.>
and what about the Disney Movie week?
snort snort
Nittany_Discord: Wait.... Irish_Luna???????!!!!!!!!!!
11,01Lol Irish_Pony
Luna with bushy red hair (like from the movie BRAVE)
Nittany_Discord: Not cool man...not...cool.....
Well kids, its been a good day! :D but I gotta go now! <3 you all! cya! night! remember FlareChaser x Octavia!
otp otp otp otp = SunderlandPony89 X Rosie Palms
bye FlareChaser
I hope you guys show both the Star Wars trilogies
Cya FlareChaser, have fun with Octavia!
apparently i blew up the internet at my house... Just shut down and couldn't connect with anything
:|
cya! :D
cya flare
WorldTraveler: I'm pretty sure Brave is set in Scotland, not Ireland
Scoltland, not Sireland
02hurr
durrr
02zurr
*remembers to add those to list of destinations*
not Trotland?
Sire is the term used as a horse's Father
WorldTraveler she's Scottish, I can tell by her accent. I have Irish and Scottish heritage and I can tell their accents apart even when both are drunk
A sire is a pony's dad.
_LS_CONDITION
Back
hi Kandarihu
Hey, Canadian_Brony.
Kandarihu: hi
whee
I was trying to think of a good ponified version of Rome or Italy
Big_Macintosh_1992: hey there
when ponifying something u want to try to change as LITTLE as possible. Make it sound the same, similar history
So, no stream right now?
that moment when you realise if you get a 0 on the final project you still pass
Itaily
Kandarihu eeyup
I hope that Facade stream was fun.
hmmm idk WorldTraveler
Anyone come up with one for "Sauk Centre"
Rome, Itaily
02still can hurt you though
02derp
maybe
i know
Saddle Arabia is canon though
i mean
er, Roam, Itaily
that's a good one
me, i'm always afraid of failing
and definitely on my list
02same
0,14well, I'm off to bed
or getting a D or lower
Big_Macintosh_1992 how do you pronounce it?
who isn't?
Night Saxy
0,14good night everyone and enjoy the stream!
Egypt?
Night SaxyPretender :)
so the fact that worst case scenario, i still pass
bye SaxyPretender
makes me feel a lot better
Sleep well SaxyPretender
sock center Canadian_Brony
gnight SaxyPretender
doesn't mean i'm going to just give up
XD just means i can stop worrying so badly
sock center, sounds ponified to me
...
why did my other computer just ping
03who knows
you know.... ponies + socks
Ha
evening, everypony! :) I'm home from work! How are you all tonight?
Big_Macintosh_1992 . . . uhh, I got nothin'. Gimme a few years so I can drink and I'll tell you in the morning
we don't normally wear socks...
Sylandest: we're all filtering out
it's sitting right next to me using the same internet connection so
XD
02!Pokemon
BlueFlare, you are a 10Volcarona.
years? Canadian_Brony
bee3ry: bullshit! ponies in socks meme
ok Canadian_Brony
thanks
Hey Sylandest. I'm doing pretty good myself, you?
hi Sylandest I'm doing great
02so many pings
beevarkian I'm 14, bro
ah, forgot
SunderlandPony89: I'm good, if exhausted, lol
Austin Powers Trilogy?
you are canadian though Canadian_Brony
Sylandest: iknowthatfeel.jpg
it's a shame they never made a back to the future part 3
ingwaz: hehehe
Hey Sylandest :) I'm fine. Just working aon setting up my Steam account so I can play TF2 :)
hey Sylandest
*on
/me is jelly of Ponies47
beevarkian doesn't mean I can drink 5 years ahead of the legal limit
Ponies47: ahhh, gotcha. A worthwhile task
fine then, be that way, Canadian_Brony
be all legal and whatnot
beevarkian: howdy! :)
Sylandest: eeyup. It's not easy finding a small picture :|
I will drink twice as hard for you Canadian_Brony
Ponies47: find a normal picture and shrink it?
beevarkian trust me, if I could, I would do something else besides drink
As will I. Although 2 x 0 is... well...
because, don't you see I love you, dammit!
sounds fun, Canadian_Brony
beevarkian
are you showing the Evil Dead trilogy
ack!
dammit!
Canadian_Brony
Who here wants to know where Regular Show came from?
stupid keyboard!
please say you are showing the Evil Dead trilogy
Irish_Pony: I do!
Irish_Pony: sure
are worst keyboards? Canadian_Brony
Irish_Pony if you tell me what the hell that is, I'll consider
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y894QNtX0VA No joke this is where Regualr Show came from!
Sylandest: I would. But my computer doesn't have the software :(
which sucks :|
Canadian_Brony: show on cartoon network, its kinda meh
So when are we going to start showing the trilogies?
beevarkian to say the least, this isn't the worst keyboard I've used
Ponies47: hmm...that is troublesome. I wish you luck with finding one!
mmk
Since we saw the Aliens trilogy today does Sumica lose her turn?
his*
00,10eh?
Sylandest thank GAWD I don't get Cartoon Network here than. Unfortunately, that also means no Hub . . . ah, well, there's always Youtube
didn't we see Aliens movie today?
Sylandest: I've found a few. But there not what I'm really looking for. I need to double check my programs and see if I do have a photo program that will shrink pictures. :)
hoepfully we see the EVIL dead trilogy
Ponies47: most computers come with standard photo programs and whatnot. There should be something you can use
maybe the LOTR trilogy?
if that makes sense
Sylandest: Yeah I'm gonna go double check that.
Canadian humour
Irish_Pony: I believe it. Same guy, same voices...
Big_Macintosh_1992: Keep watching
03ugh, y u no allow custom animations, PowerPOint
Irish_Pony: i am
dat JG Quintel, Irish_Pony
Sumica sratch what I just said, "Eh?' does not equal "Huh"
Just wait...it gets better
00,10it was more of eh some one showed them today.
I'm only Canadian when I travel to Europe. :-P
Sumica that does not make sense
Irish_Pony: I figured Regular show had to come from somewhere...this makes sense
yeah
Sylandest: Who knew from a mature short :P
a lot of sense
I did
If I could, I would educate everypony here how Canadian use "eh?". I've done it before
and I can do it again
Irish_Pony: yeah, but still...that show is way out there. How they got that for kids is strange
00,10now ask me if I care
Mad Max trilogy?.
Sumica: Care for what?
Sumica you don't care, I've already seen that
It's not aboot how you say it, it's aboot how you use it, eh?
hey guys!
00,10he can be taught
Sylandest: Meh, in todays society im not suprised :P
I found a perfect trilogy for bronystate
Irish_Pony: indeed. Thank god for ponies :D
stfu Sumica
Irish_Pony: so the acrual characters are showing up
Big_Macintosh_1992: eeyup....
/me is bored, bored, bored
A Man Called Horse, The Return of a Man Called Horse, & Triumphs of a Man Called Horse
Irish_Pony wether or not I can educate other on how Canadian proparly use "eh?"
I can only assume it is about a brony
Canadian_Brony: What does that have to do with being Irish?
bee3ry we don't say "aboot", we say "about" or "a boot"
WorldTraveler: Or a centaur
00,10Hey youwere the one trying to tell me what i ment.
03hm, actually I found an animation that will work
orly Canadian_Brony
03it's a bit of a PITA to use but oh well LOL
http://www.mindistortion.tv/iwantyoursoul/?i_am=FlareChaser
Irish_Pony nothing, it's just that Sumica didn't care
Om: Are you there, by chance?
Sumica is now a honey badger
Canadian_Brony: when you say about, it sounds like "aboot" to us. At least in the Ottawa accent - not sure actually if it's a different accent in the west.
Mighty Ducks trilogy?
Sumica yeah, I realize that
Trottawa
Star Wars, the original and prequel trilogies?
bee3ry Ottawa has a stupid accent, bro. It's filled with . . . Politicians
that soul stealing video....what happens if its used on a ginger? and do we become gingers after viewing it?
Irish_Pony: Yep. I can definitely believe that is what started the show
yeah
Big_Macintosh_1992: eeyup...
Hmm. I fouled up, I think I meant Toronto, but yes, politicians are fit for nothing.
ingwaz I take a great offense to that because my mother is a Redhead. I would suggest you stop saying that and move on with your life before I grab the Duct Tape
And ever wondered where Mr. Lolly Pop whats his face came from?
Canadian_Brony: oooh, is it kinky time?
hai
evening, Mutterguy! :)
I am a redhead
/me Duct Tape's ingwaz's mouth shut
i'll take that as a yes
Dang it. Guess I'll have to put in my Avatar for my Steam on my dad's computer tomorrow. O well. :(
heya Mutterguy
no, it's stfu time, ingwaz
I have a right to make jokes running around a building yelling "My hair is on fire!"
Hai Mutterguy
So is my cousin!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra6yWZQYm5I&feature=related Skip to 3:00 you'll see him :P
Duct tapes Canadian_Brony to a chair
i always thought duct tape time was kinky time
/me rips off the Duct Tape
His redbeard has been at times epic
Ponies47 you forgot to use /me
Irish_Pony: What is that?
CupcakeWarrior: Im showing where Regualr Show came from
Canadian_Brony: yeah yeah yeah.
if they duct tape your mouth, y no just chew on duct tape?
hmm... duct a l'orange.
People like regular show?
I do
Night RX-78-SleepyBot?
MahBoi777: there you are!
CupcakeWarrior: its ok. i watch from time to time
/me enters the chat dramatically
WorldTraveler have you ever had you mouth Duct Taped shut? You can't move you lips
/me glomps Sylandest
hey Petrified_Discord
because if he did that...
hey Sylandest!
/me returns MahBoi777's glomp
hi Petrified_Discord
hello Petrified_Discord
/me puts on glasses
and hey Petrified_Discord!
MahBoi777: and here I thought everypony was gone. Look at the roster! All the regulars are missing!
WorldTraveler: thats the brilliant thing about duct taping somepony's mouth, we use our hands/hooves to type instead
hi MahBoi777. When did you get here?
/me glomps beevarkian Canadian_Brony and MahBoi777
Sylandest: I know!
Sylandest: Am I not a regular?
he'd have a permanent duct-face
/me glomps Sylandest
MahBoi777: what the crap man?
/me was glomped
Hye MahBoi777 your back :)
/me 11,01shines Petrified_Discord
*hey
>.> apparently im not a regular, even though i've been here since fucking january...
Nittany_Discord: Ain't no dust on me! :)
I hope my B movie gets picked
SunderlandPony89: you are, merely referring to the regulars I speak to usually, hehe. I don't see you as much, unfortunately. my apologies :$
hey Canadian_Brony!
I've been here since December
11,01I shined you.
hey ingwaz and Ponies47
CupcakeWarrior: howdy! *returns glomp* :)
ingwaz it isn't the tape itself that's hell, it's coming off that's EXTREMELY PAINFUL FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS
fine, you win SunderlandPony89
MahBoi777: oh, now we're here are we?
Sylandest: M'kay then, yeah. We do hardly see eachother :P
my B movie is The Postman starring Derpy Hooves as Kevin Costner
Nittany_Discord: I know! I'm moving up in the world from dusting to shining! :D
Where do I go to sign up for the Newsletter anyways?
I can stil feel my lips tingle . . .
ingwaz: yea:$
SunderlandPony89: hehe, you rule over the night and I rule over the day :D
Canadian_Brony: unless you're using duct tape thats laced with acid, i sincerely doubt it would hurt for others afterwards unless you're just a big pansy
Alright, I'm hitting the hay. Good to talk to you all!
Big_Macintosh_1992: night! Take care! :)
Once agian no pony answers my question :(
gnight Big_Macintosh_1992!
Sleep well Big_Macintosh_1992
it is a really good movie
sigh too slow make the joke decent...
Ponies47: What was your question?
Night Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
Canadian_Brony: also, duct tape laced with acid would defeat the purpose, the skin would fall off eventually and the duct tape would no longer hold, if it even held at all int he first place
damn, ppl actually don;t understand why so many hate during that usher performing at microsoft E3...
sorry Ponies47 I have no idea
or it just wasn't funny
valoreins: they must not be gamers
valoreins: Thank God for DVRs, becaue mine allowed me to skip over that shit
is thereo a o steamo righto nowo?
ingwaz I used old-fashioned Duct Tape. I'm Canadian, not cruel. Acid could kill you, Duct Tape is just damn funny . . . for everyone else
Tom Petty = DJ Pon3
so much facepalm
GeeGeePony nnope
SunderlandPony89: Any idea where I go to sign up for the newsletter?
Canadian_Brony: kk
Canadian_Brony: i still stand by the "it wouldnt hurt for hours afterwards"
Ponies47: Gotta send an emal to... uhhh... shit, what was it?
Ponies47: Ask a mod, because I dont remember :P
ingwaz it does, trust me. I've experienced it first-hand
since Ponies47 there are apparently no mods on right now

Night ingwaz

Ponies47: Eeyup
SunderlandPony89: maybe someday lol
SunderlandPony89 same here, bro
SunderlandPony89 I did an invert version of FlareChaser :p
MahBoi777: I want to stream Dark Souls or Impostors soooo badly :P
Kandarihu: Thank you :)
beevarkian nah, he's not being a jerk. NEXT!
I want to stream disney movies...
I was hoing it just the right amount of corny
*hoping
i want to stream disney channel... wat
I want to stream me reading "How To Be A Canadian"
it's a funny book
norly
I want to stream RB2 :p
full of Canadian humour
SunderlandPony89: Lol, I've never played Dark Souls is it good?
MahBoi777: hia
Biglaw: Have you played the song Visions yet?
Yes. The e-mail I sent in was blank.
I wanna stream the crosses!!!
Kandarihu: Okie doki loki :)
MahBoi777: It's pretty good. Hard as tits, but good if you're into that kidna thing
they all deserved to die
MahBoi777: It's bloody AMAZING, highly reccomedned
CupcakeWarrior I think so, I've lost track of most of the songs I play, too busy focusing on hitting all the notes
sounds fun Petrified_Discord
I would stream Ed Edd n' Eddy AVGN, NC, etc :P
Yes. Yes. I said that.
welcome back geeky-brony :D
MahBoi777: and it's not nearly as hard as people say it is. You just gotta get use to the game mechanics and what not. By your second playthough, you'll be a master at the game
hi otakon!
SunderlandPony89: what are you talking about\
MahBoi777: my laptop died
Ponies47 I think we would all like to stream something right about now
xmasskills: Dark Souls
hello Mutterguy
Petrified_Discord and SunderlandPony89: I'll have to play it when I get the chance
Did I miss the stream?
hey otakon
SunderlandPony89: what game?
hiya MahBoi777
otakon: Dark Souls
Hi otakon
Dark/Demon Souls
otakon: howdy! and good evening! :)
apparently so, otakon
SunderlandPony89: still hard goddammit
That romhacked FF6. If I could stream, I'd stream it now.
Canadian_Brony: eeeyup. I would love to see The Angry Video Game Nerd streamed! :p
hiya Sylandest
dat otakick
Hye otakon :)
argh
*hey
hi otakon. Yes, yes you did. And a discussion about shipping. I narrowly avoided getting shipped with Rainbow Dash
Ponies47: raaaaaaaaaw
BRB
hmm
huh, actually
otakon: Not that hard. Only a few bosses are difficult for me, and I'm not even that good at the game
don't think about it xmasskills
Canadian_Brony: Launch the anti-shipping battleship
I'll be going for the night actually
See ya then otakon
Canadian_Brony: think about what
otakon: Hey your DA account wouldnt happen to be Otokan76 or something like that right?
otakon: good night
it's 1 am here and trying NOT to stay up all night
Irish_Pony: it's otakon17, why?
Petrified_Discord I like the board game Battleship, but I heard the movie sucked
geeky-brony: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!!!! :[
otakon: i am trying to stay up all night
otakon: Then its officail...I found you on DA :)
Ponies47: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEEEEEE:[
xmasskills: mine is more of a "wasting electricity" deal
xmasskills nothing, you weren't thinking about it (thank Celestia for that)
xmasskills: Lots and lots of coffee! :P
Irish_Pony: well, it's not like I was hiding it.
So is the movie just a version of the boardgame?
MahBoi777: Do you have Live?
Kandarihu: no
otakon: :P
Canadian_Brony: Well duh. Because it was a movie based on a board game! ...Although now that I think of it Clue was actually pretty good :/
otakon: well i have a laptop soo im good on that
That would be funny if it were.
geeky-brony: haaaaaaaaaaappy :)
Petrified_Discord: I heard Battleship was awful and predictable
who here remembers this http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=qViYbxSJ95g
Ponies47: haha cofee makes me sleepy i can stay up till 5 am before i crash
Petrified_Discord I can think of a better movie concept for the movie
Ponies47: ya happy :)
but yeah, it's 1 am so I'm off to bed, see you all tomorrow I hope!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKufz3lDoE&feature=related
Petrified_Discord: I enjoyed Battleship. It exceeded my expectations
SunderlandPony89: mah internet won't let me play games online:S
Come to think of it most of the board/card games I play would make terrible movies...
seeya otakon
xmasskills: I've stayed up later how can coffee make you sleepy!?! :O
Sylandest: Were your expectations a slient film? :P
MahBoi777: That sucks. I'd glady help you out with Dark Souls if you could get online
Ponies47: idk anything that is supposed to give me energy makes me crash twice as fast
Petrified_Discord: my expectations were terrible dialogue and worse plot. It was actually played out rather well, and the characters weren't as flat as I'd expected. The most impressive bit was the lack of any line involving the words "they sunk my battleship" or the like
