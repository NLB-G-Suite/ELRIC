Before I play TF2 again, I have to get the hang of sprays.
Cool song.

12don't worry
Still feels like a song from a musical
:D.
12people with cancer can pull through
It's been eventful, got a physical~ How about you alexxm?~
12even if it won't go away
LOL
12youcan shrink it
Of course it went well~
12well, Edd fell to leukemia
12but then again there's always
12ahh
03well yeah, leukemia is kinda bad
12yeah
12he was doing well, but then went into remission
it's one of the more difficult types of cancer to treat
12:c
sadly
12If I had a time machine...
12D:
;o
:O
03if I had a time machine, I'd like, stop WWII or something
lol

You of course ^-^
/me is eating a popcicle

:'(
brb as in bbl
lol dat disconnected from server :P
:D Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!
to play or not to play tf2
02if drf had a time machine, he would have went back to 1985
02and stopped Apple
12LOL
/me RUNS
/me waits for the right moment to play TF2.
:D
03no?
nono
hiiii alll!
03Apple was actually good at first
03:P
and to not be a money hog
;D
03which, granted, is quite hilarious
03Nick, why?
So...you cant hurt teammates??
03WWI was less deadly
O.o
Well technically I got snowed in yesterday
xd
02Stop WWI, WWII might not happen
That basically yeah
i don't have tf2 :'(
........
03USSR wasn't as bad, since the cold war wasn't an actual, you know, war
03and the soviets were actually our allies in WWII
surprisingly
xD
and
NASA.
03well if anything, the competition helped both countries LOL
...Might I make a suggestion?
03I'm not saying the Soviets were a good model, tons of people died and all that
...O mai.
03but look how much America grew as a result of competing
03XD
Of course not. It's a demand.
Oh okay, sorry I just walked in here~
02Revolutionary war would be a good war to stop. It was completely unnecessary
02if you ask me
07that
07I actually agree with lol
?
NOTHING!
/me hides
It's like a medal~
03no I know
It shows you played it for along time or you have enough spare money~
alexxm::|
'canadia'
xD
03I mean even with WWII
03and might not be the place they are today
and practice in Spanish Civil war>Start seizing territories and Europe tries to appease them to prevent war>fails, WW2 starts>Germans invade Russia regardless of Non agression pact> and I think you see my point here
03this is why time travel is a mindf-
WW1 really was where it all shaped modern history in the west
/me 08,01is a terrible person
*the
at least that's how I think
03WW1 was hardly modern
03against each other
03:P
I have no idea~
00,03Saturn <3
Be riiight back
11,01Wrek sure loves to whip people.
like the cavalry charge and facing each other on an open field
I don't blame him~ Whipping is nice~
when the modern rifles were introduced, that form of warfare was suicide
0_0
For all those involved
11,01I didn't see a whip.
like mustard gas, machine guns, tanks...
yeah
00,03I whip my peeps back and forth I whip my peeps back and forth~
03WWI was trench warfare
03WWII was easily more deadly
in fact in WWII, the UK/France were preparing trenches expecting somethign like WW1
oooh, now i know what's on the stream
sort of...
Germany made the whole concept of Blitzkrieg/armoured/combined arms warfare to defeat that and they rolled over Europe in like a year
00,03Mutterguy: It's MW3
or two
00,03Nyria <3
hehe~ <3
11,01There are no killstreaks. :p
07|D
lol
lol
OK. I just want to throw it out there that whenever I see MW I keep thinking mechwarrior for some odd reason
but I do like military history
/me looks at Wrek's finished drawing
03like learning about wars from the American perspective or on a global perspective
have been since I was a child
0_0 Ill be in the bathroom...
that`s not funne
Hey everypony
lol
03I like studying wars, but it's been a few years since I took history
I'm back after a bunch of random things
12back
I went for a bit a cycle
11,01Not saying all of them would do poorly.
Well, I went about three times the distance I wanted
yeah... I should trek out into the sonw and get lunch. I spied a bus
11,01The stereotypical CoD player might fail.
I'm pretty much dieing here from how knackered I am
back
03I worry more about Skynet
03:P
11,01No dis to CoD players. CoD is fun.
07*google
07there, fixed it
Syria? @ Kos
Hello all :)
BRB
that really worries me since ya know, China and RUssia wanna act all Cold War again about it
I'm thinking more of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but syria could play in too
yes
yeah I'm going to get food. back later. Hopefully I don't slip and end up at @ ED...
I can already see sides forming around that issue
internationally
03it's more if militaries rely too much on AI
03and let's face it, that can certainly happen
Oh well I have food that was accidently left in the oven for an hour~ Still good though
Before CoD and Halo and such came out, the community was more into OTHER games
a*
00,03Thunderstorms :'(
also, Nick, China had sent a message to the nation of seychelles a couple months ago telling them to prepare for "total war," since they apparently house chinese weaponry
i might be that pony that strangely obsessed with Jelly as in Jello, not jam but they aren't mutually exclusive
lol nick alert for Seychelles
|D
forgot you had that nick XD
11,01Chrysalis: No.
