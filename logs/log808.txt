You know, commodus, you could just have him executed for not following the order to kill?
why does the emperror wanna die?
Thumbs up is let him live
Oh no, he didn't!
QI told me
oh damnn
Thumbs up actually meant die
Thumbs down meant live
Yes
he be needing to falconpawnch dat bitch
They reversed it for the film
nope.avi
Because they thought it made more sense for it to be this way
Add which involves a STAIN CLEANER
YEEES
08,01holywood can go eat a fart.
i dont think anyone really knows which it was
I've always wanted a stain cleaner
lol
:(
an no thumb = no killing
Saturn: where's Biggus Dickus? or Incontinentus Anus? i forgot the names you gave us last night
can we all just agree that is all good
It is believed that when the person in charge of a gladiatorial event wanted one of the gladiators to be finished off, he turned his thumb down and that when he wanted the gladiator to live, he pointed his thumb up. The editor's gesture signifying that a gladiator should be killed is not exactly thumbs down, but thumbs turned. This motion is thought to represent the movement of a sword.
xD
TOLD YOU

Epic logic
If you're saying that then you're saying we cna't verify anything about history
then he'd be pinke
Because we weren't actually there
Saturn: He'd give the gladiator either one or two middle finger(s).

We can't say definitely 'everything happened like this'
But we still have a pretty good idea
Was a UFO launch pad
No waaay
ok can we stop talking about thumbs!?
ufo >£
No way is it 50/50
Saturn: Well, not with that attitude you can't
"These men once were horn-blowers and attendants
At every municipal arena, known as trumpeters in every village.
Now they present their own spectacles, and, to win applause,
Kill whomever the mob gives the “thumbs up”.
"
"Decimus Junius Juvenalis; a.k.a. Juvenal
(c. 55-140 A.D.), "Third Satire"
"
Seems pretty legit to me.
DARI
THIS IS SPARTA
Guys basically
Thumbs up is live
Thumbs down is die

And thumbs left/right?
OKAY GUISE

k you talk about thumbs.
i was joking dont worry
" The ancient Romans did not behave in the manner ascribed to them, and the whole story of the thumbs up 'approval' sign is based on misunderstanding and mistranslation. "
Okay channel you made me do it:
Solid
"Pollice verso does not mean a down-turned thumb it simply means a turned thumb -- one that is moved in some unspecified way. No particular direction can be assumed. The posture of the thumbs of those wishing to spare the gladiator was pollice compresso"
