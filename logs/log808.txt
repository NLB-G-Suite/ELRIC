where is bronycon: the documentary?
i wanna watch it asap
aww
Admin just use the resouce monitor and Analyze and cut off the waiting chains
aren't they still to film it? :X
at least
kimplix: they havent uploaded it yet, dont know when
i hope not
RainbowDashSavior11: if it's xp there is no resource monitor
my little filly
just sayin'
o... =(
lemme ask
I love Simpsons, but just like Spongebob it didn't know when to quit
05,15So, here are my thoughts on the new episode. I kind of wish that at the end, Spitfire hadn't brought RD back in. I think it would have been interesting development for RD if she had to give up her dream of being in the Wonderbolts to show that we dream isn't always the reality.
his main pc's on win7 tho
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ4-oSDJXBY this girl is good at math
So many cool pictures
my thoughts exactly fluttercry
Well, she did have to look at reality a bit, fluttercry
so many filly's
episode had QUITE A TWIST
Meaning, ego deflation
fluttercry: But that would've destroyed her motive for the series as a whole.
fluttercry: but I dont like being depressed
Rainbow Dash because best pony :D <3
wait, the side rooms are cut off... nvm
05,15pony_4908 exactly, but that would have been her new motivation. To find something to aspire to.
fluttercry: Likewise.
agreed ash xD
fluttercry: Plus, we know that because of the shows lack of continuity, we won't hear about her being in the wonderbolts, so by quitting it would have been better for the continuity for their lack of continuity
fluttercry: But.. doing the right thing should be acknowledged.
fluttercry: Hm. That would be pretty interesting.
fluttercry: Like, how about she redirected her aspirations to becoming a good mentor for scoots?
05,15Kinixys but it's not always in real life. It would have been a good lesson
how much id loe to stay
fluttercry, I was satisfied with the ending. Rainbow Dash decided to outright sacrifice her lifelong dream in order to not compromise her personal integrity, and she was rewarded for that. That is a message that is VERY much needed in this day and age.
That could've been interesting character development maybe.
my people need me
05,15Giving up on a dream to maintain your personal ethics
brb
later bronystate
Still, I found it a bit harsh that Spitfire just stripped Lightning Dust of her rank like that. :P
Kandarihu: well said :D
You could write a fanfiction about this
Not entirely sure what's wrong
Sumica: why do all mute the side channels when all put them in invite mode
Bye, Snow. :)
Might have to restart my computer
If you guys don't mind waiting
fluttercry: So there should have been a seperate scene of LD getting reprimanded?
It's a harsh world, being a Wonderbolt, pony_4908
I almoste loved Lightning Dust. and then they shoved her cunt-baggishness down my throat
Technician brony here, i can troubleshoot anything for yous
pills heer
And we're back
it's back :D
why are episodes only 23 minutes long? :C
dammit ebay
TOO SHORT
O_O
Step 1 to fixing ur pc is to obviously install gentoo
05,15lol
ohey dari
05,15Boris Johnson!
Ohai
step 1 to fixing your pc is to delete system32
Caraaazy
Boris
>_>
Yeah. XD
Nope, just install Gentoo
Solution to everything
Install Slackware obv
Brilliant, just brilliant
Then again, Rainbow Dash's dream was to have a place among an already-established organization. It shouldn't be out of the question for her to change her dream and seek her fame outside of the Wonderbolts.
very nice :3
Now I know where Tosh.0 came from.

To change audio quality I'd have to stop the stream, change it, and restart it
Gilda: no, it's not. It burns stuff and causes chaos
Hey AJIsAwesome

snap, don't.

How much do﻿ you want to bet that the actual game will totally ignore this trailer and feature a cast of seven annoying characters all of whom have exceptional kicking skills?
Its not the Audio...its the Lip Syncing
It is hijacking my browser
Keeps leading me to viruses and stuff

Lil_B: Holla! :)
Man, those necks...
Someone spends their entire life fighting in an arena of life or death, they better GOD DAMN well get really good at it;.
So they basically proved him right. He insulted them and they're like "YEAAAAAAH, YOU'RE AWESOME MAN, WE DO KINDA SUCK, WOOOOOOO"
Iwa, YOU make ask fluttershy and pinkie pie?? O_O
Never been in Berlin. Live by cologne.

Kurra: No no...I'm just adapt at using search engines :)
I lived in cologne for 5 years
/me is in berlin all the time
Fang an Orgy
Gilda: Someone was cloned from the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, with killing as literally their only purpose in life, they better be damn good at it.
Nice Iwa
Fang: 1000000? i think

Kurra: Sorry for the confusion
nah is cool, that's still a perfect find :D
DaringDerpy What makes that city best city?
THAT'S DIFFERENT!
thundercats are gooooo
Poor slenderman. he did'nt last long.
vanemare: my presence for example :)
Gilda: Moral of the story: If you don't have a face, you're as good as dead.
11:25
/me puts on a helmet
He touched me .-.
tuch
DaringDerpy So if I went there and you are not there, it wouldn't be best city? :)
Kammerjunk: Master Chief.
Gilda: Touché.
I am slenderman.. don't got a face and i boss the streets in my suit w/ tie
Now show us where on the wooden figurine where Marcus Aurellius touched you....
Kurra: Wait untill Commodus does a thumbs down...Got the perfect one for it
Tom 0,44 I think
bladedwings is right
Iwa |v
O.O
I bust into the stores and feck shit up with my slendy skeels
vanemare: it wouldn't be as good, but still best. because reasons
moooooooooo o.o
maximus chould just kill everyone and walk out of there..
Sunlighhhhtttt
Good name for computer? The Computer is for my parents.
Maximus should just kill Rome by stabbing the ground once.
Heh. desert.
the people here are interesting, vanemare. quite open for all kinds of crazyness
^
Maximus should kill the entire solar system by stabbing the air
maximus could kill chuck norris with his finger
/me is not crazy
My desktop is called Ruby, because I don't have a lot of creativity.
/me is crazy, sadly.
mooo O.O
Maximus killed himself killing himself.
My old one was Emerald, just to prove the point.
Nittany_Discord: PONIES!!! :D
Maximus should kill killing, just to kill killing dead.
/me is quite mad though
Hey gunny.
Conyst: dont lie to your self, you are crazy
hai
I can't remember what my laptop's called. I think it's just "My PC."
hi gunny how aee toy

Kurra: Are you Santa?
What do you think of me calling the computer HAL
Kurra: Northernland, got it

Hi pony

Yes...Tonic.
hey fang
GLaOS <3
I used to be an arrow until I opened Photoshop and Final Cut Pro 7 at the same time and became an hourglass...
Why not Hal3000?
Portal 3 should be Aperture Space Program
only the best PCs have names
brb
hey derpy we meet agian
You find wheatley floating in space
shit ensues
call him Hal, cause classics
the sound is slightly off synch
For a long time, I've dreamed of building a new computer. And I would call such a machine "Wings of my Heart"
what was the computer's name from I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream?
SirGanjalf: When my PC starts up, it actually shows the Aperture Science logo and says "Booting the Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System" instead of the usual "Starting up Windows" thing with the flag.
_Dark_Moon_: I thought they already had a space programme...how else did they get a hold of them moon rocks?
I'm sorry dave
That was back when they did shower curtains
DaringDerpy: Glad I'm not the only one
NOW THEY SHALL GO AGAIN

APERTURE SPACE PROGRAM.

CriticKitten: What happens in Rome...
stays in Rome.
Sadly rome back then meant most of Europe
....dies in Rome.
Kammerjunk: is know by the US later in history :D
BladedWings: Pretty much, yeah.
lol bladed
_Dark_Moon_: Welcome to the aperture space program. remember: The cake can not be moist enough to be of enough celebration, hence the vacuum you are currently residing in. Have a good test day.
Mmm.. chicken wings.
I shall call the computer AM
Iwa you genius.
If Rome never fell we'd probably be 2000 years ahead in tech XD
Conyst: HATE.
We shall have
SPACE CAKE
Conyst: Let me tell you how much I've come to HATE you since I began to live.
Space cake, like they sell in the National Air and Space Museum!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream Kammerjunk
_Dark_Moon_: Only if Aperture is a Colorado or Arizona based facility
do they spend every conversation in this movie getting wasted?
Did the Computer from "Dexter's Lab" had any name?
I make space cake with my space cake.
Conyst: It is such a good story. Game, too.
Nope, it was just computer
Don't they?
Aperture have a laboratory in the mountains
SirGanjalf: "Computer," I think.
O_o
same for game of thrones and basically every james bond movie

Kammerjunk: Oh my god, it even has a water story mark!
_Dark_Moon_: Gravity is your friend
I wish i could virtually throw popcorn into my PC and make it fly out of everyone's screen.
"it seems to me like your the eggs bird mark"
_Dark_Moon_: I usually do that with coins.
Doesn't work very well.
Hey, it's the pinty eyebrows man
Everybody gets popcorn and everyone is happy.
*pointy

What happened kammer? :)

Nice speaker systems they had in ancient Rome.
I have them both
XD
And I know it does work
They don't work
The ads still appear
_Dark_Moon_: Might be worth it to get Firefox, the addons are somewhat more straightforward
_Dark_Moon_: I'm using it, never had an ad
ok, im going to go now, buy everyone, good luck with your ads I guess ;) ;)
/me doesn't get adblock plus

Aw. i can sit through a 10 second advertisement.
I just download an ad blocker.
trixie for president
we need square wheels!
Hah, I have like 7 adblockers.
we need more hover cars
Kammerjunk: Yup, why ban alcohol? Ban wheels, no way to get a DUI then
Romans don't kill people, wheels kill people.
I don't even know if some of them work.
Kammerjunk: That's just excessive. XD
i still use square wheels.
I'd be able to block the ads if I could get to the Source code of their Stream, but I can't find the way >.<
Cars don't kill people, wheels do!
Lil_B, I have it
Cars don't kill people. Air does.
HORSEYS
Lil_B: do you have Safari?
So... has anything happened except for loads of fighting? I've only been paying half-attention to this.
Cars don't kill people. People with Cars kill Cars.
GilDash: nothing important
he used to be a gladiator like maximus...
GilDash: thats about it
I kill cars with my pinkie.
LOL
CLOSE CALL
OH SHIT
:O
lol
Now if the Barbarians fought like that, Rome might be knocked down a peg
ded
we should ban cars
Kurra nope, Maxthon, but I can enter simple Filter rules to blog Stuff
lol
Then all hell broke lose...
GilDash: Just fighting and shirtless Russel Crowe
Crush
that guy got headshoteed.
Fl00t4sh41, cowvarkian: I thought that was the case.
this is getting interesting now
Hey GilDash! :) Did you like the new episode?
Ouch
epic
BUT THEN HE TOOK AN ARORW TO DA KNEE, NYUK NYUK NYUK
AttackWithHugs: Huh, sounds like fun.

cowvarkian: Joke spoilers count too. =P
AJIsAwesome: I know
Lil_B: I think it may even be a quadruple crossbow
cow stop with the spoilers all my shows are ruined cause of you
Yes, but the often leads to discussion about it.
cowvarkian Spoiling Level: Captain Obvious! :D
Guns kill people, but to make the guns you need iron, but to get iron you need to mine, but to transport the resources you need vehicles, and in order to drive them you need wheels. FUCKING WHEELS.
RUSSEL CROWEE FIGHTING ROUND' THE WOROLLLDD
Fl00t4sh41: It did, yeah.
Computer is on and working.
cowvarkian: Then why did you do it? :D
I'm sure you can understand I'd rather warn thatn have to ban people.
Lol Commitus
than*
This is totally Pirates of the Carribean.
AJIsAwesome: because its fun
I am a massive wheel
pony_9163: He also wrote the score for pirates :)
I'm wondering: Did they actually allow bow and arrow in the gladiator arena? Any sensible gladiator would use it to kill the emperor with it :S
NO
HORSEY
NO
bac
am I watching pirates of the carribean, dat sound track
cowvarkian: But you could get in trouble.=p
AJIsAwesome: its happened before
GUYS HOW COME IM THE ONLY ONE WHO USES SQUARE WHEELS.. I MEAN COME ON :(
Kurra ... Maxthon has that too... I have to check it than, there should be 2 ways for me than

Maximus is a BADASS
ayyyeeee
hm?
Fl00t4sh41: He's not the brightest emperor on the throne.
Maximus Sexitus
Thu7mbs up Bro
Kammerjunk: Thats puttting it mildly
_Dark_Moon_, he's earned the crowd's appeal
For being a BADASS
yay you killed those guys so good
maximus is so 1337
Huzah for killing women
Dr_Fumbles: that made me laugh
Can' stop playing rave music
aargh
They where amazons so they don't count as women Solid_Sparkle
:D
ouch
the Strings sounded like Pirates of the Carribean
LULZ of course they don't, they're pretty much men
They are just chanting "The greatest" over and over...silly roman naming system
Lil_B: same composer as the first movie
ikr
Die you damned prick statue
The Amazons count as women. But in battle they only count as warriors.
Haha, weakling.
DO IT!
punch it!
Cry baby Cry. Make your momma sigh
that statue always talked smack about him behind his back
FUCK STONE
It wasn't a very good sword anyone
*anyway
Kiss it!

wait
NOW MAKE LOVE TO ME
Keep cryin' baby!:|
PUNCH IT
cue the porno music
But why do they keep hacking and slashing with those gladiuses?
yeah
Sundaysmile: bow chicka wow wow
_Dark_Moon_ I think so
Throughout the movie
thats a inferiority complex if i've ever seen one
dark im pretty sure
those swords are for stabbing, not hacking or cutting
He's epic
He does COD music too :P
Fl00t4sh41: The writers couldn't be arsed researching.
And batman
Fl00t4sh41: gladii
lets not muddy the waters
He's a baossss
Fl00t4sh41: sorry; had to ;)

Yup

Are you not entertained?

Sorry, what?
My spider senses are tingling..
Gilda: I told you. XD

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
boooooooooooo
GilDash, it does, but Maximus doesn't feel like it.
Gilda: wrong pin
*ping
just kill him and be over with it
PUNCH HIM IN THE BALLS
How long is it until this ends?
oops accidently closed window :/
Own that gey empererors faic
Rainbowish: About five hours.
GilDash: it's an historical error. Thumbs Down was supossed to be ''let him go'' Thumbs Up would mean ''kill him''
link i give it another thirty
A good 5 or more hours.
Kandarihu: Yeah, but the emporper/whoeverheis gave the thumps down. Which isn't "kill him".
what?
Thumbs down is kill
You know, commodus, you could just have him executed for not following the order to kill?
why does the emperror wanna die?
Dark92Enigma: Good to know I'm not insane! :)
Thumbs up is let him live
Oh no, he didn't!
QI told me
oh damnn
Thumbs up actually meant die
Thumbs down meant live
are you trying to rustle my jimmies?
nope
Yes
nope
he be needing to falconpawnch dat bitch
They reversed it for the film
what a nice guy :O
nope.avi
thumbs up meant stab him through the chest thrumbs down ment put down your weapons
SWEET
Because they thought it made more sense for it to be this way
GilDash, the coconut effect is in play here. Thumbs down DOES mean "kill him"
half the internet says thumbs up is life, the other says its death
maximus jimmies are eternal
Add which involves a STAIN CLEANER
YEEES
08,01holywood can go eat a fart.
i dont think anyone really knows which it was
twilight_sprinkle: Now I know that's a lie. 90% of the Internet is porn.
Kandarihu: What? :S
I've always wanted a stain cleaner
lol
No bronies in Ireland
Twilight a historian would say thumbs down means life and vise versa for death but no one really knows
:(
kinky indeed
an no thumb = no killing
There is like Nooo bronies over here in Ireland really :\
08,01dear internet, today i found out Kammerjunk's fetissh
can we all just agree that is all good
It is believed that when the person in charge of a gladiatorial event wanted one of the gladiators to be finished off, he turned his thumb down and that when he wanted the gladiator to live, he pointed his thumb up. The editor's gesture signifying that a gladiator should be killed is not exactly thumbs down, but thumbs turned. This motion is thought to represent the movement of a sword.
xD

08,01thumb man
I nearly lost my thumb
:O
11,02MLP_Brovakiin: \:3/
Contrary to popular belief, the emperor did not give a thumbs up or down for a gladiator as a signal to kill his enemy. The emperor (and only the emperor) would give an open or closed hand – if his palm was flat, it meant “spare his life”, if it was closed, it meant “kill him”. Whuut, internet is confused
eeyup
MLP_Brovakiin: He mooed? :D
08,01a man made entirely of thuumbs

Hai SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: Do you know where I can find it? I overslept. :$
I'd go by the oldest Source I know... 70's Asterix and Obelix Comix, which say Thumb up=Life and Thumb Down=death
>Asterix and Obelix
>Roman times
wat
hello bronystate
Asterix and Obelisk. The best historical source
Oh hey, it's a cinema.

Okay, SuperBrony64. Thanks. :)
But we still have a pretty good idea
Was a UFO launch pad

"These men once were horn-blowers and attendants
At every municipal arena, known as trumpeters in every village.
Now they present their own spectacles, and, to win applause,
Kill whomever the mob gives the “thumbs up”.

What if they were ponies? Where is your thumb god now!?
"Decimus Junius Juvenalis; a.k.a. Juvenal

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUUT
THIS IS SPARTA
_Dark_Moon_: truth
thumbs dark thumbs
/me looks out for derpy, while proctecting his muffins
Guys basically
Thumbs up is live
Thumbs down is die
there sorted
lol
nope.avi
_Dark_Moon_: Nope.
The Latin phrase pollice verso is used in the context of gladiatorial combat for a hand gesture used by Ancient Roman crowds to pass judgment on a defeated gladiator. However, the precise type of gesture described by the phrase pollice verso and its meaning are unclear in the historical and literary record.
And thumbs left/right?
/me throws muffins on chat
Are here people looking for the new ep on Youtube?
OKAY GUISE
isnt there a new .mov youtube vid out now?
Thumbs left is rave and so is right
/me noms muffin
Vordox: According to who?

Wikipedia?
So shhhh and watch maximus talk
sword in chest is live, watch people sleeping is die. Wait--
vanemare: I'm already sniping people who ask for it with a PM link to it :)
oh sweet celestia...lets just enjoy the film guys
Iwa, PM what now?
Well I've seen a quote from a Roman about it
Dari it's not like we can go back in time and ask them what happened
And he said thumbs up was death
So that seems like the most reliable source so far to me.
Dude look at a historeh boook
STOP WITH THE TUMBS PLEASE
Kurra: Personal Message, the link to the episode aired today
THUMBS UP IS LIVE
THUMBS DOWN IS DIEEEE
thumbs everywhere
Iwa Oh, well. Wanted to do the same as you. :D
_Dark_Moon_: Nope.
oh oh.
Look it up
right hold on
...
Thumbs are my fetish.
Thumbs up is die
You can find the quote yourself.
thumbs as far as the eye can see
Thumbs down is die

The philosophical implication of thumbs on life and death is of great importance to our society.
Tell that to the Romans.

Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 6 days, 18 hours, 16 minutes, 18 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Guys
Dari is right
It is
oh wait
different sources say different things
Thumbs up is a motion of sword through heart
and quotes can be misquoted
Thumbs down is put your sword down
SirGanjalf: Bah, they lived in Villa's, not in just "homes" :P
ok well thats settled
sorted
Let's shut up and watch the film jeez
^
yup
its unverified
twilight_sprinkle: I say the Colosseum was for rave parties.
The great thumb war of 2012. This is how the world ends.
Dari is right
pie fights it was for pie fights
the emporers were the ones who chose the music for said rave
Thumbs up is techno
Dr_Fumbles, it has begun.
Thumbs down means "Hes had it!" thumbs up signifies "KIll him"
no its thumbs down stupid
For a movie about gladiators, I gotta wonder why they didn't show any of the really cool gladiatorial fights
o hai
indeed
Iwa: That actually makes sense. They want kick them outta their pretty Villa's, so they would to live in common houses like non-romans
yay dinner :D
Zeus: No, thumbs down is drum'n'bass.
keep in mind it is the killer that awaits the emporors command
Fl00t4sh41, they did
Thumbs up is kill
so yeah, dari is right
*would have
Thumbs down is live
like the time the romans flooded the colloseum so they could stage a reinactment of a navel battle
Dari was right
stop with thumbs please
i look it up right now and your gonna be sorry
So stop with all this thumbs
lol wtf is this? cinderella?
_Dark_Moon_: But thumbs are my fetish.
k you talk about thumbs.
i was joking dont worry
Kammerjunk, um... oh my...
" The ancient Romans did not behave in the manner ascribed to them, and the whole story of the thumbs up 'approval' sign is based on misunderstanding and mistranslation. "
GUYS! I missed the new episode this morning! ay idea where i dcan watch it? the 1080p youtube link has already been taken down
Okay channel you made me do it:
what?
Solid
Go on youtube and type in
"Pollice verso does not mean a down-turned thumb it simply means a turned thumb -- one that is moved in some unspecified way. No particular direction can be assumed. The posture of the thumbs of those wishing to spare the gladiator was pollice compresso"
Solid_Sparkle> i shall send you the link
they take down episodes?

Twilight becoming an alicorn?
linkkirby: That would be terrible, IMO.
Oh celestia
"The reason for this is not hard to find. If they wanted the victorious man to plunge in his sword, they mimed the act with their hands, their extended thumbs stabbing the air in encouragement."
...

Ewgross
wincest

linkkirby: Plus, if they did something like that it'd probably be a dream sequence for Twilight.
Noone is going to comment on the incest?
LOL
k
aaaaw
they looked so cute
CHEAP
Fl00t4sh41: Si fueris alibi, vivito sicut ibi.
oO
She's like: "If I play dead, maybe he won't fuck me"
Fl00t4sh41: It's the Ancient Rome. What to comment?
lag
I demand to see mane 6 as fillies in a episode
^
SirGanjalf: I know I know, its tradition, but still
dident they do that in season 1 ep 24 daerk moon?
that already happened dark
Bjornfot: Molest ScootaChicken?
Kammerjunk: May I ask what that means? :)
they have?
I must've missed it
yeah dude
Fl00t4sh41: Wasn't Incest seen as something bad after somewhere around the Renaissance?
link pl0x?
AJIsAwesome: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
i'd like a link too =D
already happened _Dark_Moon_ on cutie mark cronicles
Kammerjunk: Ah, I see.
Ohh
I mean
AJIsAwesome: More or less, anyway.
Iwa: It came with catholism
Like not all flashbacks
No non-image links during stream
Enough with the incest :[
Like they actually are.
oh i see
bloody church always ruins everything iwa
yeah that be cool
her brother hates everything but vests
:'(
:C
AJIsAwesome: I think he was just re-stating the rule :)
and does he look good in them
That would make a pretty good episode :P
I swear, this movie is so friggin' boring.
MLP_Brovakiin: Ah, then never mind then. :)
AJIsAwesome: Looked as though people were about to, it was a premptive warning
Fl00t4sh41: It did? I could be completely wrong about it, but wasn't incest quite at large still in the Medieval times?
i think this movie is ok
tere shall be fighting soon
Kandarihu: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!
this movie got four stars that means its good
:>
I think's it's pretty boring
i like cabbage.
yay kiss :D
MLP_Brovakiin, TELL A JOKE!
good movie
oh love...
fapping
Kandarihu: No :I
Iwa: church banded all nonmarital sex, and banded in family marriges
lol i give all movies four stars therfor all movies are good
so no incest
Ba. Ba. Ba.
I think these are some of the best comments I've seen in Bronystate in a very long time
MLP_Brovakiin, I was making a Robot Chicken reference.
lol
ohhh daymm
Kandarihu: Oh, sorry, I have not seen that :p
If you keep chatting and aren't actually watching the movie and paying full attention to it, yeah I guess you would probably find it boring since you cannot experience it as a whole
lul
o sht
Wincest
actually, twilight_sprinkle it could be interpreted that, since the crowd sometimes chants what they want of the gladiator, that the thumbs up-thumbs down scenario COULD be a sign of approval or disapproval. I guess the reason its so ambiguous is because there are different situations in which the thumb is utilized.
Is the beset cest
OHH U DONT SAY APOKA?
He beams such even here, you really feel like can just kill him.
Apok putting his foot down
MORE THUMBS
YAAAY
I speak out of experience
Fl00t4sh41: Meh, silly catholics :P
This chat is terrible if you want to enjoy movies :p
ikr
@twilight_sprinkle where have i heard that name before?
I can't really enjoy this movie

Apokalipse: I have to object. This chat is great when I want to enjoy movies sometimes. :D
^
/me sigh
pony_6778: prolly from a ytp :P
probly from a youtube poop pony 6778
Apokalipse: It's a double edged blade, rather...During good movies, it's a distraction. During bad movies, most fun I ever had on a movie night :)
^
i thought so xD
JUST FIGHT PLEASE
it was good in the beginning then it took a nosedive
Sex is such an old thing, it's overtalked by everyone ever

twilight_sprinkle: yup

I think Hearth's Warming Eve is the 2nd episode. I can't remember the 1st.
who said you can get the ending monologue?
linkkirby: DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION
back to the kitchen, woman!
lol
:o
Snowden: Meh, if one would say life is a road, then walking that road has no distance to compare to, only the beginning of it, seeing the end can not be through off nor be reached. If one dies but came "too far to give up" , that's a paradox with the idea...if one views life as such :P
And no one gave one fuck about Commodus...
*thought off
and then they were happy ever after
awesome<3
And not a single damn was given about the emporer
And then they buried the emperor in the stadium, under the sand
Dat song title
now to walk home....
His friend survived
Now we are free/10
pony_6778: Not just yet. :)
what is the 2 movie
But this wasn't how commodus died
this is taking a while to end
My mom tells me that they're trying to make a SEQUEL to this movie.
I HOPE ITS BATMAN
he died like a bitch, strangled in his bath
SweetieG4K: Mars Attacks

AJIsAwesome: accidental ping :P
Kandarihu: Oh, she's not innocent at all. However, Pinkie wouldn't let up, and Gilda came there for Dashie and nothing else.
If only Gilda dropped a F-Bomb this episode would be perfect
[]DeadpoolDash: And the episode wouldn't be aired on tv as well.
You know, For Kids
GilDash, good point.

@AJISAwesome you dont have the right to tell me that.
AJIsAwesome: From the people that do Rainbow Dash Presents.
You behave.
Heh, someone's gonna see the mods soon. :D
Anyway, how do I roar with a beak? You are very obviously missing the half-lion half-eagle thing.

GilDash: considering my ping time is < 20ms and download speeds are like 20-30mbps, I have a hard time believing its network related, but like Sumica said, it's probably just my weird connection to UStream \o/
honesty in govt "then I guess we just see what happens"
Having a senile grandpa, I can attest that those conversations are a lot less fun in person

rdash: older? hes from one of th new ones afaik
it's like saying this is the shinning because it has the psychopatic dad in two roles
Has anypony seen xisbestchemical on here
twilight_sprinkle: Well old since he's not doing it anymore
oldest was ian flemming i think
I didnt know he had 2 parts in this movie- makes it double awesome now
twilight_sprinkle: iirc, pierce brosnan kinda retired from that since that new actor took his place... I forgot his name >_<
He's jewish?
/me in space, again...
Muslim.
Daniel Craig, rdash
Cypresswolf: There's a reason he has 2 roles :D
rdash do you mean daniel craig
Not eating pork made him a better man?
yeah, that's it!
and it's like people forgot there were better actors than brosnan before
i ove daniels bond films
new Bond guy sucks, james bond is not blonde
So. Just out of curiosity... What'd everypony think about the new voice for spitfire?
CrystalPhoenix: I've never even seen a brosnan bond movie
I haven't really seen any of the newer movies that have had Daniel Craig in it at all, so I didn't know his name, lol
CrystalPhoenix: Sean Connery :P
SUPERVISE HIM
Vordox: Of course, You don't simply kill Jack Nichoclson off completey
twilight_sprinkle I hope the comment about Ian Fleming was a joke
xles: I liked the old version more. New Spitfire sounds to similar to Dash.
Cypresswolf: ....
Never saw any Bond movie, ever
Cypresswolf: Hur hur hur hur
oh hey, James Bond and the old Joker in one scene
xles: Maybe best to have no spoilers yet untill a full 24 hours has passed...but it fits (though I liked the first more)

this movie isnt spoofy enough
Fun Trivia: Tim Burton had wanted the Martians brought to life via stop-motion animation, but finally went with CGI. The animators told Burton they could animate the Martians without motion blur to make them look more "stop-motiony," but Burton decided against that.
Looks like a big clawgrab game.

I wouldn't say a masterpiece though
it was a fun silly movie
8/10
but that's it
Tom Jones/10
But really, 10/10
for comedia
Fun Alt Scenes: There were a number of scenes in the original screenplay that were never used, which actually made the film a lot longer and much darker. Among the cut scenes were: A scene in the beginning with Mr. Lee (originally, the burning cows trampled over Mr. Lee, killing him, as his family watches in horror);
ack/10
Dr_Fumbles: What did twilight say?
it's still a tim burton film
There are two films by Tim Burton that don't live up to their hype in my opinion. This was one of them.
I say that for the last Friday of the year, we watch the BEST A Film of the year and the BEST B film of the year
ack ack ack
it is what it is, which is a Tim Burton film. they have their own scale
However: Braindead was better, but this is defitnetly one of the better movie nights
Meh, 8/10 if We're being serious, 8.7 if we use the full 10 point scale
alright,good night Bronystate, and thanks for another wonderful movie night
Well that was a very interesting movie
_Dark_Moon_: It wasn't spoofy enough... can you believe that?
Fun Alt Scenes: another where the Martians break into the White House (the White House decorator is decorating the Ronald Reagan Room, and the Martians break in through the window and vaporize him); an extended version of the Doughnut World scene (the Hispanic woman at the doughnut shop is trying to escape the building with Richie and some cops when the Martians attack. Richie gets out, turns around and sees the building burst int
Fl00t4sh41: It was good. 9/10
One day we'll restream Battlefield LEverage
This was a Tim Burton film?
Dr_Fumbles: Not at all.
The best film ever to grace the BronyState stream
On that day dari'll open up massive.
Dr_Fumbles: as far as spoof/parody movies go i like stuff more like that last zombie b movie we saw, this movie felt slow at times on the spoofinh
Goddamit
im totally for seeing Battlefield earth again
Playing LunaGame.exe
an alternate ending where Byron actually IS killed by the Martians and the Martians drag his body away. Planes fly by later, and kill those Martians with the Slim Whitman music. Later, during the award ceremony, Byron is remembered by Taffy in a long and sweet speech. Louise, Cedric and Neville are sitting in the audience of this ceremony, crying and wearing black. <--- BYRON WOULD'VE DIED
twilight_sprinkle: What was that zombie movie?
i hate credits
What is next weeks, have we decided yet
/me has yet to see Battlefield Earth
Maybe it was a bad idea to download LunaGame.exe :| it better not end up like Sonic.exe
Vordox: I see you love Ctrl + V
Pfft
Vordox: King of the Film Unknowns
However: Gotta keep up :p
If you miss Battlefield Leverage
B&
Socks: that movie is hilariously baaaad :D
hey the mummy and the mummy 2 should be next weeks
B& so hard
:P
^Agreed
nooooo!
So... I say that for the last Friday of the year, we watch the BEST A Film of the year and the BEST B film of the year
/me saw bride of the monster once and loved it
Dr_Fumbles: dead alive. now That was some hardcore nonstop spoofing, even if a bit ecessive gore
what is Battlefield Leverage??
YAY!
Battlefield Earth is pretty much the worst movie ever, its why its awesome to watch
Maid_Major: Maid hour?
Fun Trivia: The radio telescope shown in the movie is located at Parkes in New South Wales, Austraila. <-- For Phase4
How interesting, your movie ends just as my movie does
DAYZ WHY U NO WORRRRRRK
I suggest Bubba Hotep as the b film
*heas explodes*
MY BRAIN!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!

Battlfield Leverage is the best film we've ever streamed. ;___;
god no
I'm out guys

MY BRAIN IS GONE
srsly, what is this song called?
ACK ACK ACCCKKK
How many times has The Room been shown on the stream?
G'night micheasl
Fun Fact, Hidden Stuff: When Martin Short is courting the Martian Girl (Lisa Marie), he brings her into a secret room used by John F. Kennedy with a fish tank. The fish tank contains almost the entire cast of Hitta Nemo including Nemo himself, Gill, Dory and Bubbles (no sharks, shrimps, whales and pelicans though.) The coincidence occurred probably because these species of fish are the most popular and colorful types of salt-water
AAAAAAAAAAAACK
http://imgfave.com/view/2929109
Haku1013: I think we also have an awards thing in the spring around Bronystate's anniversary where we vote for best A & B of the year

All da text O.O
Hitta Nemo = Finding Nemo
Kurra: Battlefield Earth, a terrible movie based on a doorstopper by the guy who founded Scientology
Yes indeed LadyCanary
that big wall of text
ACK
/me 's brain explodes
`Xenu: Your poor brain
What was the name of this movie?
J_E_Smith71 I nominate Revenge of the Nerds, seen in earilier this year
MadSurge, Oh, I knew that then, but why's everyone calling it Battlefield Leverage?
ShadowD3mon25: Mars Attacks1
MARS ATTACKS! is the name
Is it just me or am i the only person who hates the credits..
ok.
twilight_sprinkle: Guess it's different tastes then. This just seemes to have more style, and tried to maintain a degree of story instead of "DURR LO0K AT US WE'RE FUNNY!! HURR DURR"
twilight_sprinkle: Well all I can say is that it is both mine and Ghostie's favourite of all the films we've streamed.
Haku2013: Good idea...only one problem...the next Brony Movie Night is on the 21st... :S
Kurra because leverage
soooo... what next?
I nominate this movie.
And probably will always be.
The credits are so boring and im like the ONLY person who thinks this
Kurra: because leverage is a thing in that movie
also Battlefield Earth isn't that great, I saw it a few times, there's just... not that much... in it
Fun Fact; small hidden: The little dog owned by TV hostess Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) is actually owned by Lisa Marie, the actress playing the Martian Girl.
TOTALLY OFF-TOPIC: I just learned Full Metal Jacket was based of the Novel, The Short-Timers
>_>
Well... Bye. See y'all later.
CREDITS NEED MOAR ASPLOSIONS!
My brain!
Bye However :)

What the hell is up with this danger zone thing?
i wub wub wub it
I liked her old one.
ROTFL

It's not bad, just not the MLP standard we're used to
I was waiting this whole episode for her to say MAGGOTs
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAHHHHH
What was that for? ;~;
big body and tiny wings <3
Noooooo
Why couldn't the get Spitfire's original VA? ;A;
Suzano: It did, new VA
This is like the Air Force Academy
Socks: it seems fairly good to me >_ >

GilDash: I KNOW... I want the OLD VA.
OH SHIT

Dat one
However: Or the Swedish Spitfire.
I couldn't! ;A;
so 80s
^
Dark92Enigma, its sooo cute :3
GilDash: D:
GilDash: probably she would sound too much like Gilda with that level of gruffness
Yes, it's not bad, But IMO it's not season2 standard
Awwwwww.
RaveBrony did it out of act of love
I was also waiting for a Full Metal Jacket reference
lol
to cute
Indeed
Compensating for somthing?
MadSurge: No, I think she could make it work.
BTW Spitfire said: you look like the worst flyer (RD) ............it's not like she saved her life!
Right, what's this, then?
Metronome, you're right, it's season 3 standard
aka better
Patience is a virtue
NOOBS
I'm sick and tired of the TOO obvious fannods. Like, I want an A-Team reference. Something tiny, but still nice.
Bullshark testosterone...
new players LUL!
Dark92Enigma: shes a drill sergeant, she has to be mean
Awww dat face.
Dark92Enigma, drill sergeant don't have favorites
LOL
;~;
No letters
All week
pinkie <3
RaveBrony: true
Like, we had an A-Team reference.
i wub pinkie~
Not even a letter to Tia.
and btw, that was a lot like basic
Pinkie still waiting for MLP Issue 2...even though its been delayed
I can see the shipfics being written. >_>
GilDash: that's me waiting for important mail :D
with less explatives, and less stress
we had 2 A-Team reference
mhhhm

Yeah, that's what I'm guessing's going to happen
PINKIE CALM DOWN!!
o____0
Pfft
I haven't seen the ep before
Exactly :D
And then the world ends
Facebook notifications in a nutshell
over reacting 101 by pinkie

thelonepony: whats your point
Lawl
/me shrugs
During a stream of the ep
its just a rebranding of previous pagan festivals
aww
sooo cute~
@_@
However: have you seen the Babs Seed episode?
don't know :3
MadSurge: I usually forget about important mail until it actually arrives. :D
I think Sugarcube Corner had just gotten restocked that day o.o
oh yeah dat Sibsy recolor
The things you notice when you work retail XD
I feel like that pink pony is modeled after someone irl.
BE?
i heard that the dizitron is fake
CrystalPhoenix: Ikr?
and possibly gay
Yeah, Pinkie is irritating this ep. :(
Dat voice
how come LadyCanary
Puke?
She's too pinkie
i love the crysis style face covering
Dark92Enigma: That's... lol, that's what I meant. I meant to say, "Like we had a small A-Team reference". What I mean is something small, not too large, that mostly adults will get.
I dunno. Just seems that way.
Nope, just hurl.
I don't think Pinkie is that irritating
road rash
and there's something in this episode that shows how sibsy wanted to put Wildfire in this episode
o.o
In this episode she is :/
Derp
road rash
However: oops, my bad :)
RD <3
Socks: I didnt think she was

Crap it is 10 days away
Pfft

Poof
AdamTheMaid: Why are you a maid? O.O
Lightning Dust is blatantly going to be better than Dash, obvious episode is obvious.
RD fangirl
Meh, I just think the writer tried way too hard with her
TRYHARD
Dabi dabi :3

LadyCanary: Pfft
WHAT WAS IN THE CAREPACKAGE?!
Poor Ponkie poe
awesome!
The Enigma's review of WONDERBOLTS ACADEMY: WOW, we can see how much RD has matured in this episode. story-wise, the story felt a little rushed. Pinkie Pie, as usual, pulled off her best comedy routines, the Twister reference was pulled off perfectly, but there's one big problem: The ending: we don't know if Rainbow graduated or not, we don't know WHAT'S IN THE CARE PACKAGE.....but RD proved herself once more, to be The Element of Loyalty, and th
CARE PACKAGE LOST
i wonder what was in there
You can be my wingmare anytime
Blazing_Beatz: Probably an osprey.
Probably before the ep even aired for the first time LadyCanary
Wonderbolts. Aim high.
O.o

TheGuyThatsHere: Anyway, fuck my life, I can't get into the server.
Hi, TheGuyThatsHere. :)
Hello :)
DashWithRainbows: ?
[01:50:12] <AJIsAwesome> Dat DWR's a SPY!
Anypony want to play Civilization?
Oh. XD
God damn Engineer, that sentry beeping must be getting to your head!
I really want a Lyra toy, I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy one
However do you have $2,000+
Im friends with a girl at my school and she likes ponies. I never have female friends and I think I like her but I dont know if Im the friendship I feel is love or just friendship. Besides, Im a freshman and shes a junior. Wat do?
OH GOD
Kipkat07_Scarf, show her cupcakes.
Kipkat07_Scarf: Cry a bit
Zamer: no... Why? I meant the plastic one.
uh oh
Kipkat07_Scarf: Stay as friends for now, if you want my opinion.
Kipkat07_Scarf outside ponies what do you like of said girl
Kipkat07_Scarf, buy her a lyra plushie
AdamTheDuck: Shes already heard of it
and let there be pee in the tunnels on the roof
i agree with GabeMoist
plushes shaped like me are all the rage
Lyra`: :D
/me wants a Lyra` plushie :P
:3
Zamer: The fact that shes nice, smart, she listens to me, and shes pretty
it would appear that im in high demand
MLP_Brovakiin: I dont like crying. Did that enough in middle school
I WANT ONE!!!
Kipkat07_Scarf, is she a lesbian? a sure fire way is to see if she has tegan and sara on her ipod
:3
Lyra`: You have NO idea.
I would stick with Friendship for 6months
Kipkat07_Scarf: But as for another piece of advice, if it does turn out to be love tell her how you feel. If she turns you down, then it's not meant to be. The best to do is to tell her if this becomes the situation.
Kipkat07_Scarf: Sorry, I was just being silly :I
ded
MLP_Brovakiin: Ikno
but casually invite her out on stuff
drop hints
she could be a lesbian, and just being nice
Hue hue hue hue
but if you were more adult i would suggest using the Bro Code for picking up chicks
I wouldnt really want to go out with her. I dont want to break up...
Kipkat07_Scarf: Get to know her more. Try to get her to become a close firend.
Zamer: Rule 1: Bros before Hoes.
wow
AJIsAwesome: Thats what ive been doing so far
Bros before gardening tools?
Mmkay.
highest Lyra plushie i seen Crochet $66
DashWithRainbows: hey brah
the other two i seen <$45
Lyra`: I would have no problem with that
Don't call me "brah".
and those were of better designs
>:l
DashWithRainbows: okay, brah
DashWithRainbows: You can't trust those things. They secretly uproot all your plants at night. They're EVIL, I tell you. EVIL.
DashWithRainbows is best brah
:>
:L
The bestest brah
*insert conspiracy rant here*
Lyra`: I do hang out with the socially awkward kids (i.e. nerds)
Y'know, I keep reading "brah" as the word "bra".
lel
But! I just remembered to mention that she has a boyfriend
DashWithRainbows: Nah, brah, you ain't no bra. U a brah.
and I dont know if I like her as a friend or more
Kipkat07_Scarf, eliminate him
Kipkat07_Scarf, well that changes the situation .-.
You've never met me in person, However.
brah, bro, dude
Kipkat07_Scarf: Kill him. When I did it, it worked perfectly.
Lyra` when did you get a new cutie mark
http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-Lyra-Rays-very-rare-3-2-inch-/200795086981?pt=TV_Movie_Character_Toys_US&hash=item2ec051e085
DashWithRainbows: I don't need to brah, I can just tell brah.
/me passes Kipkat07_Scarf a derringer loaded with a single round o.o
You'll want to take away that title from me very, very fast.
damn could have sworn i used derpy.me link
Dat DWR~
Well, you must be very bad at doing so then, However :P
Lol, spy being a spy

Hai PoniesMaid47
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Two Nights in Hoofington
i miss dem maid hours
;~;
My big problem is knowing if I like her as a friend or like her as a girlfriend
I'm a silly pony :4
*:3
what happened to it?
Kipkat07_Scarf: Interpret it as a friend for now. Remember, you have your parents and your friends for advice as well. :)
/me wasnt here for a while and doesnt know
I honestly don't see how people can spend $200+ on a plushie
outside charities
Zamer: Depends on the quality.
AJIsAwesome: I dont have friends outside of bronystate
Okay, Stattler and Waldorf jeering at Trixie will be interesting. Going to read it soon.
Java: THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT? Brb, reading.
Kipkat07_Scarf: You still have your parents as well.
Zamer, what if plushies is their hobby?
Heheh
AJIsAwesome: My mom is 68 and my dad is dead. I dont trust my mom for advice
Java: AFTER I watch Pulp Fiction
Kipkat07_Scarf do something very heroicly stupid
Zamer: Ive done that in dreams
Pulp Fiction need to be finished first.
now just implement it in real life
Kipkat07_Scarf: Zamer: you could almost say Heroinly stupid.
However: Are you insinuating something
why not Hermonely stupid
Kipkat07_Scarf: Zamer: See, cuz I'm watching Pulp Fiction
Hermionely^
Hermione
