No, but putting swear words in sutitles is fine.
MASS EFFECT 2

THose weren't boobs. They were an idealised symbolic representations of... Um... boobs.
Mass Effect 2? NOOOOO

mass effect 4: the reapers came back and also they brought mecha sharks
/me dances

Saturn: and yet here you are...
08,01but i need to get up and attend beltane rehearsals
HOW Do you do replys like that?
Saturn: quit whining, i get up at 5am on weekdays
lol all theses chats are thje same

Bedtimes can be changed at any moment.

I always sleep at least 8 hours.

08,01in other words, it's one of the most epic things ever.
means...5:26?
O_O
Oh, I've seen some of that.
a*
I saw some when I went on holiday
08,01i've been taking part in it every year for the last 4 years
Saturn: where is this occuring?
08,01fapplebloom: Calton Hill, Edinburgh
No thank you.
08,01(Scotland)
Saturn: Were you at it 2 years ago?
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: yup
whatever....will take a few hours until the show begins
Saturn: are you one of the naked dancers?
O___O
llololol
Wat.
You know, I might of seen you :3
okay then
xD
woman...they bite
08,01fapplebloom: not this year; i've not had time
jus lezzing out
Keeper 20?
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: shit, seriously?
It knows every Keeper?
I saw it 2 years ago when I went to scotland for holiday
wow
Saturn: let me tell you i never have time for dancing naked in public
08,01but this year i'm stewarding again
08,01probably going to be painted either bronze or blue
08,01depending on my role
When's it on this year?
08,01monday night
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: are you in Edinburgh?
No, not atm, I'm down in England
08,01aww
Saturn: how long did it take to get you painted?
08,01fapplebloom: not especially long
And I'm a 15 non alchoholic, sorry dude.
hey... that's glyphs voice
08,01total preparation is a few hours, depending on costume
02Hai~
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: well, non-alcoholic drinks are cool
I like pepsi :3
08,01fapplebloom: that part of me was covered up
/me cough-splutters.
08,01it was mostly-naked
this got a little dirty
And Saturn answers truthfully.
08,01fapplebloom: there are degrees of nakedness
08,01most of the girls there go topless
Ikr.
hesaid mostly nakedand remeber it's scotland
Saturn: yes but "naked" typically denotes full nudity
08,01well, then i misspose
Partial Nudity is a type of being naked
08,01*misspoke
i don't say "im naked besides my trousers"
And partial nudity isn't completely naked
Hey guys, what's going on in this cha-OHGODWHAT :D
08,01i'm always naked underneath my clothes
orly?
Pffff:D
Everypony is naked.
You don't say
We don't usually wear clothes. :P
i am naked beside several layers of clothing
08,01every clothed person has a naked person inside, wanting to to break free
Nah, I prefer being clothed.
I like clothes. :3
I am clothed above several layers of nakedness
i am also intelligent underneath several pretenses of wit
usually when no one else is in the house
Ehhhh.
I got little kids around. No thanks, Saturn.
Saturn: are you an attractive woman
08,01fapplebloom: you speak as if those are incongruent
No, he's male.
08,01i'm the most attractive woman.
And his hair is attractive
I'm back from eating
Looks spiffy Saturn :)
They are visiting my house.
08,01TheRandomkid321: pro tip: don't become a pedophile
Pro tip: Don't. really. don;t
08,01just putting that out there.
Saturn dont worry. I WONT!
Gah
I give up
08,01wait!
08,01Very_Silly_Filly:
This looks fun
Saturn: not an unattractive man but still
ME2
No unfortunately.

I would go if I was older,
Ignorance? Where?
Once I can drive, I'll probably go to some bronycons
Saturn... Settle down...
:D
08,01fapplebloom: i'm not in the pics
I am krogan!
Well, I can drive, but I'd need a license to drive legally

There wasn't one
00,10did not see it but it could have been obscure
Who's streaming?
Wednesday, wednesday, it's in the middle of the week, wednseday..
Could have been a "Derpy" style kinda thing.
Huh?
Derp?
i dunno
Odds are, it was probably turning into fireworks, Pinkie-style. It just wasn't as blatant as "Broni-os". :P
I need to read it.
:( I soooooo soooorrrrryyyy........
bye!
BAI EWYONE
i shall find it!!!!!!!!!!
see ya later
Shalom
More likely, it was a background element on the television.
/me yawns
It explicitly meant this one
no wai!
00,10but my bet is it was the "parasprite thing"
and then it gives a preview of this episode
Hrm.
I LIKE PONIES!
I'm starting to think that too
What's the name of this program?
Oh okay
00,10guess we wait a bit to see if a folow up is done
doesn't look like the GIMP
00,10Program is "SAI"
ok
copy/paste is amgic
are you using a tablet
hi i just came here, is this photoshop?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6wfLePQkw﻿ The reference was in a previous episode.
If two hundred obsessed people specifically looking out for it can't spot it, it's not a "subtle" reference, but just simply a bad one
Drawing without a tablet = o_O
00,10Program is "SAI"
00,10but not all the time
and back...With coffee!
Ok, we might have missed something like that
00,10FnF i can say I was not looking for it
Done with that Pinkie Pie Flashlight Mod :D it looks bad but hey I dont care
yeah mabye the episodes were mixed up
I like Fly
The engrossing drama that is aquabats distracted me from looking for pony references.
Yes, that must be it(!)
yeah even though OI didn't see the pony reference I erally enjoyed the show
A hundred or two hundred, doesn't matter
I just hope that people don't flip out over this...
Ten would be enough to be statistically reliable
Of course we won't
2hrs
Right now?
00,10some whee some one is fliping tabels this very moment
Exaggeration reactions happen when people care about something
The AquaBats show can be a lot of fun, but not something anyone actually cares about
I'm used to that (thanks street fighter fans/SRK)
Exactly. It stands out just fine on its own.
ohh
00,10no it's not aquabats that people are careing about it's where is my pony shoutout.
oh, entitlement where it isnt due. got it.
Airpuff....thats really good
Hehe It's not completely mine though. Just edited some parts..
Thanks x)
The Hub is evil now?
00,10we keep showing it cause it's an amusing show mind you
I want to be honest now...................AQUABATS SUCKS
Amusing is an understatement. :3
I think you guys should start playing aquabats regularly on here because it's a really cool show
I thought they already did?
But naturally
Pff I was trying to stay away from that... crazy-ass.. I don't even know how to describe it
i find aquabats amusing
on purpose
I okay with it
I actually wanted to watch this show even before the pony refrences
The only thing I find bad about it is that those commercial breaks got frighteningly long.

are you guys going to continue to show the aquabats?
on saturday
Would you prefer to pay 3 times as much for a version of The HUB that only advertises for it's own programs?
Ahhh movie night in 2 hours...
I dont get how it's.. movie night.. wasnt there one yesterday?
xD
Euro Movie Night, I think
ô.o then i watched the us then..
I missed yesterdays.
Even if the costs of it's programming was derived ENTIRELY from cable subscribers, these shows only fill 22 minutes each half hour. The rest has to be filled with something.
Adverts are the law.
It's not a sequel
It is.
Everyone quickly WMC that Aguirre movie. Why? It's BORING. And tries to educate you WHILE boring you.
lol
.........
Dont tell me it sinks...
Jealousy level.....rising....
please.. dont tell me it sinks -.-
we don't get the Hub
I live in Neighbraska
We need Gohosties for that movie again
00,10Well the one extra long break was to make up for there only being 3 breaks I guess
*Ghosties
Ba dum ching
Shooooo-by-doo.
The plate races are quite interesting
Wb Twilight =P
and they censored the word "loser"
Yeah.
Really? I'm American and Nascar is one of the few sports I don't outright despise.
I kinda like it, the plate races are very exiting
Sometimes more exiting than Formula 1

I have sooo many great memoies from sailor moon
I'm having problems with my CPU. I should try re booting
First anime was DBZ for me.
first anime was Mobile Suit Gundam.
Even today i still watch sailor moon
I wish I could remember Sailor Moon as well as I did then beyond the fact that I treated it like most "Bronies" probably do today.

My first anime(though I didn't know it) was Voltron and the first movie I saw was Project A-Ko
AKA watched in complete privacy in my room... >_>
everyone in my neighborhood watch dbz like a drama show

Seriously. It's like, the animé creators just kinda wanted to see how far they could take GT, and... Destroyed everything memorable about it.

That rumour is most likely false

The thing is, if it weren't for someone without any connections taking a stab at this, this cure would've never happened. Governments are dumping loads of money into trying to cure cancer and got nothing for their expenditure.
