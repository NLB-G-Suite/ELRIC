hi Pterodactyl

No, they keep the stream G-rated
Well, PG. Usually.
G-rated may be a stretch.....
foxinator: yeah NSFW is pretty much not allowed here
Smitty01: They showed the new Lupin III here
00,10nyaa.net
i should hope they never show porn
bah. It's too early in the morning to show any more Lupin III episodes.
PG-13, occassionally R for Brony Movie Night. No worse than that
Oh HAY no! Lupin the third was NOT "G" RATED! LOL :D
BUFFERING
im certainly not requesting that
kenne: so they dont show anything here :p
Eh, the new Lupin III , those boobs were an abstract.
foxinator: well there are some exceptions
pg? da new lupin the III episodes woulde beg to differ
house was on dis stream and it wuz not g rated
what's nyaa.net?
kenne: wot??
foxinator: cant you just enjoy the conversation?
MT. FUJIKO

i almost forgot about the lupin the third thing
Lupin was only R-rated
No, but putting swear words in sutitles is fine.
MASS EFFECT 2
fapplebloom: always :p
fuck yeah
That you, Sumica?
Mass effect 4
Right. Mass Effect 2 isn't exactly G rated
THose weren't boobs. They were an idealised symbolic representations of... Um... boobs.

Go talk to garrus and boop his nose!
Very stylish Sumica

Invi|braindead: That's what people kept telling me, but I was very pleasantly suprised when I got mine yesterday
mica
Mica
goddammit
no big deal...
ninja'd
Sumica : is best terminator shepared
have sex with aria
pfft who needs fuel
gypsys and shisters all over omega
Very_Silly_Filly well, it's your choice. I don't need it :)
Sarah o conner, you have to leave
show me some SEX
So what if you get lost in the middle of space somewhere without any fuel
You have to pay for a tow
aqua_dusk: You use minerals.
then you die aqua_dusk
.....
moin Digitalis
If you have no minerals, you will be baked.
And then there will be cake.
do the suicide mission
Ohai Invi|braindead ^_^

you get hit by a misfired mass drive slug
mmm..
Caaaaaaaaaaaake

Prob uranus
Kammerjunk cake?
/me faceplants cake and eats it
Cake.
/me hugs Digitalis
Kammerjunk the cake is fake

Nuh-uh. I ate a slice last night.
/me hugs RainBowJack

punch him in the dick
Wow bad time to unmute stream.
everypony is interested in myanus
/me tickles fapplebloom
alexxm: are you tickling my anus?
sumica i has desktop poniez now ren i rclick it says take control what is that
no fapplebloom
alexxm: awww.....
Sumica: how do i control it
Grunt doesn't have TIME FOR COVER.
grunt fail Krogan
Grunt cares not for cover
He demands to meet the enemy head on
Shane377 you can run around on your desktop with the pony
There wasn't any cover big enough for Grunt
arrow key ok
:p
ill give it a shot
"we got a screamer"
Yay screamers XD
quit being so profane
SCREAMER!!!
aaaaaaaaiowawiaf;ksdvakwffawasfasffasvcewefadfsd
he came
use ur snper rfle!
Biotic is best class.
what are the other classes Kammerjunk
Unimportant.
Kammerjunk: is that his class?
Irrelevant.
I prefer Infiltrator
Looks so to me. He has Warp, Singularity, Pull, Push, et cetera.
soldier which is boring :p
i was an infiltrator, no big deal
Erectin' a dispenser.
tali is best engineer so there's no point in you doing it
Yeah, Vanguard.
holy shit how is there not a tali mod for tf2
Because making custom meshes is seriously business.
how many points in singularity?
And making them work on servers is even worse.
u r weasel
he's not loud :p
dont talk shit about krogan
That's why there are no Tali mods.
I...am...acting
note don't bring him on stealth missions
Very_Silly_Filly : I R baboon
Fattonie: Gunshot! I've been gunshot!
So why is this considered an RPG? Seems more like a third person shooter with RPG dialogues to me...
Kammerjunk: well then get it done already
I am weasel
WOOF
Oh shut up, Grunt.
hey Dog hows your day been
MadSurge: you get to play a role, therfire rpg QED
MadSurge: *therefore
moin Dog
So what are you up to SuperBrony64?
If you say so :D
THANE HELPED
he took those bullets for you
Hey Dog, I really like your tumblr http://textfromdog.tumblr.com/
Yeah it does :p
YES IT DOES
fapplebloom: Eenope. Like 50% of all servers have sv_pure set to either 1 or 2. Id est, it doesn't work with custom meshes. Most of them just don't let you join if your game files don't fit theirs.
operation meat shiled all the way
:/
it's bullets you didn't have to absorb
XD
distraction is a valid combat tactic
at least he took cover this time
that's what i tell myself in paintball
kROGAN MEAT SHIELD
that bitch in ME1 killed my Wrek :(
Giving someone else cover while they make a run for it is better than a distraction.
/me tickles Dog behind his ears
*Wrex
"What did we learn? I always win!"
alexxm
;
what
what Dog
Kammerjunk: i honestly have no idea what you mean, so ill defer to your judgement
fapplebloom: It means that most servers are party poopers.
nice purple armor
I concur, Sumica.
Kammerjunk: then just murder them with your party cannon
sumica : is the BFG on CoolDown?
Kammerjunk: party cannon as a weapon is now canon
aha okay
>is now canon
Do ho ho.
Shot him in the dick
shoot him in the ass
I like Sumica's voice!
i honestly was not trying to make a pun
you gonna take that from him?
MadSurge don't make this weird
yeah Sumica has a nice voice indeed
your voice is orgasmic
They need bass cannon fapplebloom
What I dislike the most about ME3 is not being able to mess around with corpses.
DAT YAY
Kammerjunk: please rephrase that
shoot him in the ass
NUKE IT!!!
bank shot
wohoo
it would be more disturbing if you could see what i was doing
pew pewpew pewpew pewpew pewpew pewpew pew
nuke his dick off
fapplebloom is a krogan
Arright, but I'm not gay, he's just pleasant to listen at :D
garrus_vakarian: In ME3, I can't move corpses around with biotics.
RUN AWAY
better
ded
CLEAR!!!
WOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
slightly radiated but clear
Dog: is that a compliment?
RPG FOR THE WINN!
Robodogs
really clear. nothing left :) proper work Sumi there is not even a gem ^^
I don't know, you're just a Krogan.
KROOOOOOOOGAN
oopa

Sumica: atleast more renagade points
"Oops, my baaad"

night garru_vakarian
"Nothing can hurt me!" he said behind cover.
cya garrus_vakarian
although In my opinion this is the perfect time to be awake
let's hope the enemies don't have such a overkill gun ^^
cause the moon is up
Kammerjunk: he was right...
good thing it isnt SGT PEPPER
thank you for shooting someone in the dick before i left
nighty garrus_vakarian

Yes.
ME3 I think
:)
God: no answer huh? same as when i used to pray.
Or is it 2? :s
I actually no idea
2
its 2
how about season 4??
do you think MLP will have a season 4?
Maybe.
Season 4 hasn't been confirmed
season 3 was already fortold in january 2012
bronycon
YamaTHou: Maybe. *sniff* Maybe.
i'm sure they done a lot of eps in season 3
mlp will get more seasons than dr who
There should be a season 4
but from season 5 on, it will be horrible
if only season 3 wasnt 13 episodes :c
We'll see.
i still thuiink season 1 is better then season 2
If MLP stop producing what will happen to us?
but the last eps on season two RPCKED
^
Not sure.
after the recption the finale got...they're probly getting ready to write the new contracts
YamaTHou: i think it's perfectly reasonable to expect a profitiable show to go on as long as it can
tHE Writers for season 3 are the same ones from season 1
It will probably be august, since S2 came in August.
When they cancel the show, we will go postal wearing pinkie pie suits
<fapplebloom> yeah I thinks so....
all over the world
More power to the people make MLP!
What if I want to wear a Rarity Suit
YamaTHou: the question is, will it continue to be good

Either Sweden Or Ireland... or england... or Britian in general (i am aware sweden is not in britain)
Hello DavidCortez.
smitlern77: thank you! I think so too

Beer is so much easier than cocktails
08,01fapplebloom: but you were implying you wante to show me pictures of fillies
Ponies ae best ponies. Rainbow dash is a pegasus. Fluttershy is shy. Rarity likes clothes. Applejack likes apples
Ok then Ninjazz.... I once had an erotic dream about ponies... should I see a physcaratrist...
they found astar practically identical to the sun 200 ly away
08,01TheRandomkid321: there's nothing in the show to indicate her sexuality
Yes.
TheRandomkid321: No... Just keep it to yourself.
xD
Ok Ninjazz
wow, did chat.

U serrious?
08,01i've seen r34 of fluttershy taking a dump on big macintosh; doesn't make it canon.

They probably won't do it, but they can make it work.
TheRandomkid321: They made MLP work.
Lets sing a song

/me bangs her head against the wall

Welcome welcome welcomeA fine welcome to youWelcome welcome welcome I say how do you do?Welcome welcome welcomeI say hip hip hurrayWelcome welcome welcome to Ponyville today
<fapplebloom> not sure if awkward moment or trolling
TheRandomkid321: First MLP thing ever had a human. Explain that.
Oh my god
Ninjazz It was the 80s.
Itemrape before the finish line q.q
YamaTHou: neither, im just trolling the doctor
TheRandomkid321: So.
The new villain in season 3 will be a human.
Ninjazz everything had humans
08,01fapplebloom: the hill dancing thing
TheRandomkid321: And?
<Twi_Fi> lol,that's just weird
How do ya know Twi_Fi?
clopping is magic
human's in MLP???
He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheartShe's his cranky doodle joyI helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yes!I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!
08,01fapplebloom: interpretive dance would be strangle appropriate
That will be weird as hell
fapplebloom, as promised, pony sex canon. It's number 3. in the list: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/76295879/130326839506.png

TheRandomkid321: Do I have to?
08,01you know what i meant.
Me too
Yes Ninjazz
fragle rock?
fapplebloom, be strong, it's just a collection of quote's from Lauren Faust's dA
is It some kind of pony porn?
TheRandomkid321: I mean I don't see the relevance of having to do that since we are talking about MLP FiM.
08,01fapplebloom: it's fine, it it was porn, i'd have kickbanned him fo rit
First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!

<foxinator> just fine...talking about pony porn and shit
00,10http://i.imgur.com/GNhyn.jpg
jk
08,01humans in s3 wouldn't fit with the style of the show
Unless they run out of inspiration
The fire of friendship lives in our heartsAs long as it burns we cannot drift apartThough quarrels arise, their numbers are fewLaughter and singing will see us through (will see us through)We are a circle of pony friendsA circle of friends we'll be to the very end

I would prefer some bad art, actually.
dammit i cant type
bad art makes me cry.
post some sexy art
smitlern77, my favorite anthem
YamaTHou: talking 'bout buttsecks and shit are ya .. :p
thank you:)

are we gonna watch the aquabats?
No. Please god no...
I LUUUUV DA AQUABATS! WHO THE BUCK NEEDS COCAIN!??!!?
they're be directly out of power puff girls
TheRandomkid321, look man. All I am saying is that IF they do put humans in S3, then we should have some kind of faith in Studio B.
08,01TheRandomkid321: they'd look like the humans in Dan Vs.
Hmmm... Maybe Lauren Faust could become a character... Her alicorn perhaps?
08,01Ninjazz: if humans appeared in S3, my faith in Studio B would be lost
She's an evil enchantressShe does evil dancesAnd if you look deep in her eyesShe'll put you in trancesThen what will she do?She'll mix up an evil brewThen she'll gobble you upIn a big tasty stewSoooo.... Watch out!
08,01because it seems so incongruent
Ninjazz all Im saying is that noone. Absolutly Noone could make it work.
is wierd al going to be on the aquabats today
They probably won't, though.
Soon, probably.
As would mine and everybody elses
creator self-insertion.. bad idea
08,01RainbowAsh: there's a Dan Vs. FiM tumblr
08,01
talking bout hums in mlp s3? against that def!
Alright. Alright. I see your points. Sheesh.
08,01http://imgur.com/uICCf <-- the sexiest pic
But I seriously doubt humans would ever have a place in the MLP universe.
/me sheesh
I would want to be here for a streaming of an episode with humans in it, the chat would be epic.
lol
Humans are too proud to obey other species
I ahve never lost a adebate... out of the two ive had
Oh my god, Alpine cross was crazt
08,01dan-vs-fim.tumblr.com
Well, you didn't really win the debate...

TheRandomkid321: tell me, how does one win a "adebate"?
/me doesn't care for aquabats.
Im gonna play soem fallout. Ill be back later cya.
You just didn't give me any counter evidence to do so. So I just stopped.
when is the new episode
Hush now, quiet nowIt's time to lay your sleepy headHush now, quiet nowIt's time to go to bed
i cant believe they're making a kid's show about warren buffet

I am happy for you, fapplebloom.

Say I if you think you are sexy
Twi_Fi: so am I. Thank you.
ewwwwww!
god i hate that show.
You know what would be a cool gag and would kind of introduce humans to MLP? If Pinkie Pie would need something and takes something seemingly from the audience, like a tool or a bag of pop corn...

I think Crysalis is better than Discord or Luna. The potential for her backstory is so good.
Aw yeah love that song
Or not
Agh my connection pooped out, MadSurge must be kicked out
I went back and watched the first few eps of season 1 and I noticed something - the Dress Rarity is wearing in Ticket Master when she's talking about what she'd do at the Gala is the same one Cadence wears in pt 2 of season finale
:O
Crysalis is the worst villan in this show.
Ninjazz|SPAZ: Oh hello once again.:)

I thik she has great potential for a Backstory. How well does she care for her the Changelings? She said she invadet Equestria, too provide food for them because she is their queen. This is a nice fact for her personality.

Oh, I've heard this somewhere, but where?
Next FiM villain should be a Nuckelavee :D
How did she grew up in this world of Changelings? how is this world? How did she become queen? what did they do before they came to Equestria? That are some things I wouldn't mind too see XD
Do'h. I meant "Pandora's Piñata"
Cypresswolf: Damn right, it will.
is it hard to draw with a bunch of idiots commenting at you?

He's using a tab, if I'm correct
fapplebloom: he doesn't seem to be bothered by us...
what do you think 350 Million by year's end?
Cypresswolf: At minimum.
EgrusDam: he's just shutting us out. Kinda hurtful to be honest...
Sure, it took them two years tog et to ~170 million, but the fandom keeps growing.

Chex, sweetie, calm down
Oh you, Kammerjunk :D
Season 1 > Season 2
dat drawing skill @_@
Chex, you said that yesterday
I got 30/100 things made up for season 3 bingo...not bad for 1 week
and it's still true
To me, Season 1= Season 2, both 9.5/10.:)
Disagree.
No. It's not true. Nothing is true. Everybody got their own opinions. Nothing is true.
I agree with TheRainbowDash. I rate both series poni/10.
One day Rainbow Dash was flying around in Equestria when Henry VIII came out and was like off with her head, but then Rarity came in and tryed to give Henry a makeover but then Her head turned into a pineapple and everyone died.
yeah work that brush
Chex: You're speaking about an opinion as if it's objective fact.
Pterodactyl: Ummm, what...:P
I'll post the full version on Texas Brony Forum when the list is done
I linked season 1 as a whole better, but season 2 has my favorite episodes
TheRainbowDash: They're a bit different, but both seasons are good, I agree
liked*
Lil_B, you can look him up on google
Well it's just that, even in the weaker episodes of Season 1, I never really felt like I wasn't enjoying it
But that Season 2 finale, that was flawless, and the show at it
Radu I know, I'm just asking if anyone else now who he is

Then Twilight Sparkle came in and woz like " What happened here?" and Fluttershy cried for no reason and then Mario and Luigi threw their hats at Applejack but she fired her lazers and exploded everything.
Then I got a GenMobile... and an FC-16 Go
Pterodactyl: Dude, wat.
Oh, that's interesting Lil_B o:
Clone consoles FTW
miss*
Pterodactyl: What is with you and your idea?:D
It seems so much calmer in here when it's not Pony time
Kammerjunk: mfw I get to visit medieval Forlì and I go there everyday for university :D
i guess i haven't... hello everypony what's up?
Pterodactyl: Meanwhile, in the sane world, I have no idea what's going on.
Chex: When it is pony time, insanity ensures, epspecially that Season 2 finale.:O
anyone know how long until aquabats?
1 hour 40 minutes
Pinkies4thWall: I believe until 11:00 AM EST.
thanks
hi
Hello CCCP! (waves)
/me will become depressed again when it 13:00 EST.
What's on Aquabats?
hello everypony
hi TheRainbowDash!
Sadly, I cannot watch Aquabats, for they have the same timeslot as Legend of Korra.
CCCP: Privyet?
The only things I really liked about the finale was, Chrysalis and the changelings' designs, and that fight scene
Hello yifle1! (waves)
hi yifle1!!
*were
hi CCCP i have been waitnig fora ya!
Kammerjunk: wut?
its been a long time
Umm, why does everyone like Aquabats, I find it average?
It be Russian!
Wierd Al is in Aquabats as well as a huge pony shoutout apparently
hey pablez94!!!!! :D
Korra ep4 is already floating on the internet. Bring on Aquabats
wierd al :)
Kammerjunk: oh lol hi!
CCCP: how has your day been?
Tovler: Wait, really? I didn't think it'd be uploaded 'fore tomorrow.
I shall check it out immediately!
Chex: you still can respect people who liked the finale, right?
what is this
pablez94: i just woke up, u?
So, will Euro Night function the same as regular Movie Night on Friday, or will it be different?
CCCP, welcome.
Doesnt season 4 of Metalocolypse start Sunday night this week too?
Yesh
hi Ninjazz|SPAZ
TheRainbowDash, more or less the same. Just with the euro mods and what not.
I can't wait for that :D
I saw Aquabats for the first time on Bronystate. " Weeks ago. I love it because it's Rediculessness is so freakin Epic
* 2 Weeks ago...
/me almost cried at the end of Korra today due to his stupid empathy chip.
wut do you want 2 see for season 3
Ninjazz|SPAZ: So people like RainBroDash and SirSprinkles?
TheRainbowDash, Euro is the same as the regular movie night. People don't tend to chat quite as much on Euro Night, thoug
TheRainbowDash: Same movies, only at an hour suitable for us europeans
I want sea ponies in season 3
Wow your shading technique is a lot different from mine
CCCP: i'm awake since 8 hours ago... but i took a nap since 10 mins ago...
TheRainbowDash, I guess so.
:D I saw EQD's post about ponies in the premiere - that's too good
Awesome!:)
i want discord to return
pablez94: thats nice :)
(deletes since)
xD
Season 3... it's hard to say
will there be any pony episodes this saturday
no
I think Crysalis is a very interesting character. I would like to hear her backstory about how she joined the Changelings. She has a dark personality and is very appealing to the eyes but appears to ripped off the zombies from Story of The Blanks. So I can't say her design is quite original but her sudden appearance and shit made her all the more epic.
TheRainbowDash: Are you european too?
only reruns
Season. . .has ended. No more new pony likely until autumn.
EgrusDam: No, I'm from Batimare, in the States.
CCCP: what time is it overe there?
hi
:D Batimare
HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i mean just some random episodes
Oh well that is interesting...
EgrusDam: Be sure to visit Fillydelphia and Manehattan and Las Pegasus in the U.S. too!:D
Yes, yifle1, but they'll be re runs til season 3
ok :)
dat sexy flank
:D
Hmmmm.
Europeans should come up with ponified country names too :D
I'm kind of skeptical about Season 3 honestly
when is he drawing genetalia?
France - Prance
No more Faust :(
No more Rob Renzetti
Faust is stepping down?
Norway-Ponyway?xD
Chex: who said it?
When they start the love machine and I can love again, I'll remember what it was.
Italy should become Fillitaly :D
EgrusDam: o u
mmmmm flank
right?
Chex: answer me! who said laure would stop?
What is this music? :D
poor baby
During the beginning of Season 2, didn't she say she was no longer working on it (referring to season 3)
I just read the FAQ, but I have a question. What E-Mail Adress do I send my Movie entires to? I would like to request Metropolis.
Chex: you better answer him fucker

yifle1: seriosuly? u're a luckyguy don't lose her... it's rare to find a pegasisiter out from da brony chats..
Wrek, what gave you the idea to make Chrysalis so bony?
hAHAHAHAHa what a story Pterodactyl
Pterodactyl: hahaha, what a story Mark.
don´t worry she and i have been a couple in almst 2 years now
Lyra, You can't draw! You don't have thumbs! :O

Ninjazz|SPAZ: inspiration?
Yeah, something like that.
:)
hey guys
YamaTHou: hihow has your day been?
yes?
Yes?
I have friend on chat,on facebook...a good friend
what if I tell him to watch MLP?
/me makes an evil face
What do you expect?
I'm not sure
do it >:D
Is he using a tablet or the mouse?
hmmmm
If he is your friend, shouldn't you expect him to expect you as a friend that watches MLP?
a tablet
ok
YamaTHou: if he is a GOOD friend even if i would not like mlp will stay your friend..
Are you scared? I'd do it.
if you just bring it up, it would probably sound weird
it*
yeah I guess so...
just spam the chat with "pony" or something like that
And now his offline...fuck
Soupjuice: Ummm, ok....
pony
No
I say wait for the right time to bring it up, but that's just me
then send him a link to a playlist of the entire first season
-Le poofs-
Getting tired...
Ummm
GETTING COFFEE!
Not Lighty, obviously
YamaTHou: so try... ask him... maybe u can have a friend that's abrony... whatch it with him... explain why u like it so much... just try...
No.
Don't try too hard.
Trying too hard=worse.:P
Just make it look natural.
This band sounds so familiar...
I would ease into it. If it comes up like regular conversation, it wouldn't seem awkward.
God knows how many people think we are weird as hell already.
Another day in Equestria and Braeburn woz walking around with apples in his ass until Pinkie came up and hugged him and he got a wingboner and kissed a wall. Then Rarity tranformed his face into fluttershys pet rabbit.
And with that, I leave now.
I wouldn't try worsening the percieved stereotype of bronies
Anyway...
Pterodactyl: lmao
COFFEE!
I love how Pterodactyl 's story came up right after Ninjazz|SPAZ made the comment about how some think bronies are wierd.
What a story Mark.
Twi_Fi :P
I'm so glad I have you as a best FRIEEEEEEND

Anyways, my favorite fic is Heart of the Dragon. First was My Little Dashie. And my old favorite was Solar Flare.
One day in Equestria, Pound Cake grew up and kissed Pinkie Pie and turned into Cranky Doodle Donkey and Pinkie slapped him and he cried until Fluttershy cut his head off. Twilight seen wot happened and woz like " Letters to Celestia" but didn't bother because they were boring.
so about an hour left till aquabats?
You might be getting too grim dark, Pterodactyl.
oo. New chapter of Bleach
Trixie, because I can't see Pinkie.
Awwww
I personally am liking "Anthropology" and "Tales of Winter Magic Academy"
Ill make a new one
bye
Both very good fics.
jeff jeff jeff jeff go go go
/me noms
I'd try reading more, but for some odd reason I can't read anything other than Heart of a Dragon anymore.
ITS JUST SO GOOD >_<
What about Vinyl Scratch tapes?
Haven't touched it...
Hello
ty
:<
Hello potato. :DDD
I'm thinking of making my own fanfic. It would be a vision of the future of Equestria.
Dat desktop pony
If you want I could pre read it for you.
Just to be helpful. :)
Kandarihu sounds interesting
Would it involve the sea ponies rising up from the depths and taking over the kingdom? :P
the future eh?
28 days later in Equestria, Rarity ate apple pie but then she remembered she was fabulous and woz like " I'm going to love Prince Blueballs" And went to The Grand Galloping Fala and ate to much cake and got fat, then AJ came in and laughed and exploded. Then Rarity used HADUKEN and blew up Canterlot.
...
im gonna go write a fan fic
text wall
CCCP: what you ganna write about?
I already wrote a fic, I'm just editing it.
But in the mean time people have already said they liked my bio page...
hmmm.

/me pulls up Lighty by his tail.
the music lagged :|
Oh, one of my fav fics updated two weeks ago. It only took about two months for the update.....
Well, I don't... I am writing one. BUT its taking me ages to actually finish it.
ah
Funny how 2,000 words is so hard to perfect.
Hello everypony
/me sighs
Uh oh, now you've done it!

Chatoyance favorited my fic.
Alright then Dark92Enigma.
mm, that chitin on her is nice.
Damn chat derped.
lets see
OhioBronyShow: really i'm VERY happy for i wish i could find my very special somepony... but i'm not that beautifull so girls snub me...
Sooo... is the pony shout out on aquabats going to be streamed today?
I love the glyph on her flank.
Didn't Chrysalis also have some armor on her belly?
OhioBronyShow: for U*
good morning, all.
Cypresswolf, stop using vista
Morning y'all
LOL Phase4 :D
WallDives, welcome.
I love how Lyra is swimming in the screen.
O_o how could you tell Phase4
pablez94, linux brony, /)
So... Aqua bats is being streamed today right?
Well, I'm not beautiful either. But he somehow finds me as the most beautiful girl in the world.
Yes.
Awesome!
How late is the Aquabats?
OhioBronyShow: Your feels. It shows. :)
Cypresswolf, /ctcp [nickname] VERSION
:D
Then Cheerilee found herz spacial somepony and married her and they were happy until Rarity done A sonic rainbooom and RD woz like "nnnnoooo"
Ralathon: It will start streaming at 11:00 AM EST.
What's up with everyone asking about Aquabats?!
pablez94: Its whats inside that matters. Don't you forget that!
Thanks
might not work on your client
Because they are doing a Pony shout out today
Pterodactyl: Wait, what....Rarity doing a sonic rainboom?!?!:O
+Phase4: whta do u meen?
whish I could believe that.
Aquabats is finally doing the Pony shout out!
wish^
Personally, I would only install Linux if I needed a new OS.
There is supposed to be a pony-releated reference in Aquabats today, that's why.
Where is the ponies?
RARITY FTW
YEEEEAAAAAAH
In the corner
inb4 they don't do it
I had a hilarious WTF moment this week.
pablez94, i'm guessing your on ubuntu
CTP_Bronystate: They will come soon, please be patient.
So what is being drawn?
Wait for Season 3.
I remember I had Twilight Sparkle in my poket this week.
I want to say Queen Chrysisalisis
Ninjazz|SPAZ: i didn't are the other people that did...
Jewel: Bingo.
Phase4: I do have windows 7, but *expletive deleted* keeps shutting downt the installation every time I fix the former problem
Whoo!
+Phase4: how do u know??? i'm on Ubuntu !!.!=
Though I am surprised, no one has compared Changelings and Flutterponies
+Phase4:11.10*
oh... my
flutterponies?
I like to call her "Queen Swisscheesealis"
pablez94: I doesnt matter what other people think, just remember what you are inside.
pablez94, because super tech powers!
Flutterponies
They are basically ponies with butterfly wings
I like Princess Cadence.
getting bored
+Phase4: ok...
Then Rainbow Dash thought of revenge and captured Rarity and she woz like " You will never beat me batman" and then Applejack came in and woz like " Rarity I lovez you" and kissed Pinkie.
...are we spewing nonsense about love?
Personally I like to believe that they mutated since g3 and g1 ended, and turned evil.
why are we spewing nonsense about love?
Pterodactyl: Dun Dunn Duuuuunnnn :O
Pterodactyl: What kind of crazy story you thinking right now?:
:D
+Phase4: mr.nerd...
/me hugs pablez94
:0
I'll try installing 7 again later today - 100% of the attemps so far have ended in RAGE!!!! **** you VISTA!

/me hugs back Phase4

pablez94: Bro hoof.
Phase4: it's always some kind of error Vista detects - I
Sylandest: Been like this for the past 4 days, and not getting any better, rather worse.
cool
/me brohoofs pablez94

seeing Crysalis makes me want to play as an insectoid in a D&D game
/me /) (\ Ninjazz|SPAZ
well... ponyish
TheRainbowDash: Have you visited the doctor?
http://derpy.me/KxMrY
Cypresswolf, see if you can get a screenshot of it
Sylandest: Umm, well, it is not too bad, just annoying as hay.:|
I wonder...
http://derpy.me/ponies
TheRainbowDash: Get better soon, Dashie.
Nope

TheRainbowDash: same thing here is that bastard influence.. i've partially passed it by taking some aspirine or "paracetamol" medicinals... so...
How long has everyone here been on BronyState?
Apparently there's an interview going on today between bronystate and Babble with the Bronies

Malavolent what gave that away?
It honestly does kinda stink that there seemed to be more commercial than show.
Sumica i think its getting good
FlareChaser: Lolwut!? :D
/me flips another book page
I LOVEE LYRAAA <3333
aquabats can go sucka fat one after they lied like that.
episode was good even without ponies
aczumel: Wait till Season 3, my brother.
No Sumica, they are getting better :D
THEY DIDNT LIE
Dken2021: Just a wild guess.
Needs more Weird Al
Sumica: Surprisingly yes. I wasn't into it at first but now its getting a whole better!
OK........the EnigmaSignal just rang.........gotta go for now (hugs TwiilightSparkle and TheRainbowDash)
Aquabats needs a *two* hour season finale.
/me flips another book page
IT WAS LICKETY SPLIT
Okay. I don't mind the pilgrim singing the monster to death. I DO mind them driving the pilgrim to suicide.
00,10Uhhhh eqd lied not aquabats
Oh bye Dark92Enigma!
Aquabats have earned a lot of money.
aquabats & ponies are awesome
well ima be gone
Now we just need to make Aquabros
yea!
/me is curled up reading a book
TO EQD
00,10and well EQD fact checking is right on par with Fox news
Indeed Sumica
i still liked the episode
Ohai Sumica
the Hub stated it on Facebook
Where did EqD gets the tip?
/me flips a page
i must go now, my planet nedds me.....AWAY *LEAVES*
Hub's facebook page
So. Much. Detail.
Hub stated what?
who cares about a pony reference, aquabats still a good show to watch
TELL ME
Hub's Facebook page should be a good source
00,10exactly Dken2021
hi bronies
WELL THE HUB'S FACEBOOK PAGE SAID THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PONY REFERENCE IN THIS EPISODE
Did EQD just get copared to FOX D:<
allo EpicPwnTime
Hello EpicPwnTime
00,10they only said future ep on the facebook
Dken2021: Being a brony, I can tell you it help that two awesome shows interact in some way or another.
we probably just missed it
WHEN IS THE AQUABATS?
My name is Twilight Sparkle.

Such a good art program
Even with no pony reference, Aquabats is still gold
LUFFY YOU JUST MISSED AQUABATS
Indeed
maybe the suprise was pilgrim boy being a changeling?
imma pause this for some Heavy heavy heavy metal.
Korra>Aquabats, sorry
what is the name of this song?
Nittany_Discord: We need to go look for it later on YouTube.
FlareChaser how heavy?
It would make sense to just mention that ponies will be in a future episode so that bronies will tune in every week.
Or something.... I dunno it was a good episode.
Dken2021: heavy as moby dick
Naturally.
Good morning everyone
Guarantees views.
Euro Movie Night?
what song is this?
Tell me.
So guys, i constantly shake all the time, is that bad?

CupcakeWarrior, welcome.
I was watchin Korra so i missed aquabats

Hmm...the facebook page did say it was supposed to be this episode apparently

Just did, Sumica.
hello everypony!
hello :)
Nitram, welcome.
Luffy http://lmgtfy.com/?q=desktop+ponies
Desktop ponies do not work for me, either because I use a mac or because I am stupid.

Meanwhile x Trixie. where is it...?
Try Wine
I lft the room? Lies
FUCK, I don't know what pony I s- Oh god.. "Which pony should I taaaaake?".
FlareChaser: OTP?
Wine = Wine Is Not an Emulator
/me hugs Twi_Fi
Guys, what's yer favorite song?
/me 11,01Trixie
Luffy make sure to 0 all ponies first
Ninjazz: OTP.
I see.
Pinkies4thWall, :)
lets Windows programs run on Mac and Linux
Luffy: all of them
so what WAS the pony reference in the aquabats episode?
There wasn't one
Flutters, good idea.
i dont know what it was
You know what? I'll go look for it.
NO ONE TOUCHES COLGATE! NO ONE! :| ever......ever.....
00,10did not see it but it could have been obscure
It had to have been the parasprite
Twi_Fi: you liek poniez. You're not stupid.
Who's streaming?
can I pet colgate FlareChaser?
aczumel nothing, EQD is a stupid place
Wednesday, wednesday, it's in the middle of the week, wednseday..
FlareChaser, but, how will I brush my teeth?
Dken2021: You can Brushie her :3
Could have been a "Derpy" style kinda thing.
Luffy, is that THE luffy the grat and powerful from tumblr?
yay \:3/
Yay my Fluttershys are out of the hospital :$
Huh?
What?
Derp?
dat seapony lyra
but even the hub's facebook page said there was going to be a pony reference
i dunno
Everypony! Keep cheese away from the Fluttershys!
Hey Pinkies4thWall!
so it's not really EQD'S fault
Twi_Fi you made them sick, not Flare
Anyways, I gotta go. I just bought "World War Z".
Odds are, it was probably turning into fireworks, Pinkie-style. It just wasn't as blatant as "Broni-os". :P
I need to read it.
:( I soooooo soooorrrrryyyy........
From now on I shall feed them celery and peanut butter
Not a chance, 'Taco
Sumica, none of us saw it. It must be really well hidden if up to 170 people looking out for the reference missed it
bye!
Might have to wait a while for the smarter people of YouTube to inspect the new episode...
BAI EWYONE
bai CCCP
i shall find it!!!!!!!!!!
Eh, there's a chance. Just not a good one.
Cya CCCP. Take care.
bai Luffy and CCCP
see ya later
00,10aczumel they said future ep would have it they never said what or when
Shalom
More likely, it was a background element on the television.
Bye CCCP and Luffy.
No, Sumica; There's no two ways to interpret the post
Sumica, I checked their facebook page. They did talk about this episode
00,10and yeah RainbowAsh but it was alot to look for who knows
Ponies will be referenced in future episodes of MLP.
/me yawns
It explicitly meant this one
no wai!
But I wouldn't worry about it. Not knowing what shoutout you're looking for isn't quite the same as "Derpy may or may not appear one or more times in this episode, feel free to find her."
Twi_Fi: Actually season 3 is going to be about cows
Twi_Fi: NO WAY!
"Weird Al + a My Little Pony Friendship is Magic surprise = best episode ever of The Aquabats! Super Show!!"
here are the words from the hub's facebook page: Weird Al + a My Little Pony Friendship is Magic surprise = best episode ever of The Aquabats! Super Show!!
00,10but my bet is it was the "parasprite thing"
and then it gives a preview of this episode
Sumica, that bug didn't look like a parasprite, though
Hrm.
I LIKE PONIES!
I'm starting to think that too
I'm late. What was the surprise?
Hello im back
Renard, we have no clue.
/me slowly realizes this fandom is so huge he'll never be able to consume all the worthwhile things it does.
What's the name of this program?
does anypony know what that emerald thing is?
Oh okay
00,10guess we wait a bit to see if a folow up is done
doesn't look like the GIMP
00,10I am sure there are bronys with recordings of the ep going over every fram as we speek
It's probably something I'd catch if I weren't half-distracted by the chat.
It's Paint Tool SAI Pederia
what am i watching?
00,10Program is "SAI"
They actually DID make a brony reference. In a previous episode.
That's right blame the chat
ok
copy/paste is amgic
are you using a tablet
hi i just came here, is this photoshop?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6wfLePQkw﻿ The reference was in a previous episode.
Drawing without a tablet = o_O
00,10Program is "SAI"
00,10and yes Wrek uses a tablet
00,10but not all the time
Litwick, nice
and back...With coffee!
Ok, we might have missed something like that
I think people would find it hard to do pixel art with a tablet
00,10FnF i can say I was not looking for it
maybe hub got confused and thought the previous episode with the pony reference was this episodee
Done with that Pinkie Pie Flashlight Mod :D it looks bad but hey I dont care
yeah mabye the episodes were mixed up
The Living Tombstone - Magic..... that is a awesome song... :3
I like Fly
The engrossing drama that is aquabats distracted me from looking for pony references.
Yes, that must be it(!)
so what happens now?
yeah even though OI didn't see the pony reference I erally enjoyed the show
A hundred or two hundred, doesn't matter
I just hope that people don't flip out over this...
Ten would be enough to be statistically reliable
Of course we won't
00,10oh dont worry "we" will
what about fandom overreaction?
Gear up for Derpygate 2.5?
so when is the next stream happening?
2hrs
Right now?
00,10some whee some one is fliping tabels this very moment
Exaggeration reactions happen when people care about something
Ah, stream-stream
Yay I've gotten two faves in two hours on my edit of the twilight picture! =D
The AquaBats show can be a lot of fun, but not something anyone actually cares about
I'm used to that (thanks street fighter fans/SRK)
got a link Airpuff ?
Exactly. It stands out just fine on its own.
ohh
It's Chrysalis
00,10no it's not aquabats that people are careing about it's where is my pony shoutout.
Airpuff, you reminded me to check on mine and it's finally over 100 faves =D http://fav.me/d4xnc2c
oh, entitlement where it isnt due. got it.
and the thing was a magic spark
Airpuff....thats really good
00,10keep in mind the whole reasion we even first started showing it was because you all requested we do so to see the pony shoutout
Hehe It's not completely mine though. Just edited some parts..
The hype over "pony shout outs" sounds just like was said in chat before, Hasbro/Hub probably planted it to get us to watch other shows during the post-season gap.
airpuff, that is wonderful.
Thanks x)
The Hub is evil now?
00,10we keep showing it cause it's an amusing show mind you
Be sure to watch the original >.<
I want to be honest now...................AQUABATS SUCKS
Amusing is an understatement. :3
I think you guys should start playing aquabats regularly on here because it's a really cool show
I thought they already did?
But naturally
Pff I was trying to stay away from that... crazy-ass.. I don't even know how to describe it
i find aquabats amusing
it's So Bad It's Good
on purpose
I okay with it
Pederia: ahaha xD
It's like Titanic II :3
I actually wanted to watch this show even before the pony refrences
The only thing I find bad about it is that those commercial breaks got frighteningly long.
00,10that's just US tv
... diddutz: ... dont make me imagine.. a titanic.. 2.... lol
11,01Titanic 3464: Ponies.
Unless it only feels that way because Aquabats also keeps cutting to the shorts *within* the episode, including the fake ad.
Pederia exactly its just fun and pure cheesyness
are you guys going to continue to show the aquabats?
on saturday
Airpuff: Why imagine? there IS a Titanic II
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1947/ Rainbow Dash is so horny right now.
00,10What sucks is I pay for hub to see those ads.
... What? It is? diddutz: ?!
EgrusDam, I was worried for a sec there.
we watched it a month ago or so at MovieNight ^^
Would you prefer to pay 3 times as much for a version of The HUB that only advertises for it's own programs?
... diddutz: ... oh god why.. xDd
Ahhh movie night in 2 hours...
Twi_Fi, if I said it otherwise it would have ruined the joke :D
I dont get how it's.. movie night.. wasnt there one yesterday?
xD
00,10I would rather not have ads on a service I am paying for
Euro Movie Night, I think
what movie will they be showing ?
00,10we have 2 of them Airpuff
Kandarihu, if I had to pay 3× as much, I at least would expect no ads at all.
ô.o then i watched the us then..
I missed yesterdays.
Airpuff: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640571/
So i gotta watch Euro Brony Night.
Adverts are the law.
Titanic II sounds a lot worse as an idea than the movie actually presents it as
It's not a sequel
It is.
00,10yeah Very_Silly_Filly thanks, some how I think I have been here longer then you =p
Everyone quickly WMC that Aguirre movie. Why? It's BORING. And tries to educate you WHILE boring you.
......... diddutz: .... wow.. sounds.. terrible.. i donno.. it cant be a sequel.. i mean its just flashbacks or something right?
The movie's literally about a ship called Titanic II
lol
.........
SUP
Dont tell me it sinks...
Quick! Before Val logs back on!
cya later Brony State meet ya in a couple of hours :D
Litwick: it's NOT WMC material
Jealousy level.....rising....
please.. dont tell me it sinks -.-
I'm just saying, one of those commercial breaks felt like the length of a commercial break normally used for a show split into two 15-ish minute segments. Again, maybe just me. Not complaining about the length of the ads, just the perceived length of the show. I want more Aquabats. :3
I live in Canada
00,10then how can you welcome me ou silly filly
Airpuff: What else?
we don't get the Hub
hiya Wrek|Observing, Sumica
WindWhistler: wut?
I live in Neighbraska
Airpuff: No they rebuild the Titanic a hundered years after the original sunk and guess what happens :3
We need Gohosties for that movie again
but MLP airs on Treehouse TV
I don't know. There was a mod that made humor out of it. And then there was Seapony Lyra popping out of everyone's forehead.
otakon, welcome.
00,10Well the one extra long break was to make up for there only being 3 breaks I guess
Airpuff: If it's called Titanic II, of COURSE it's gonna sink
*Ghosties
Ba dum ching
Shooooo-by-doo.
diddutz: okei xD Good.. Woudl've been terrible if it had sunk just like the first one -.-
Im back everypony
wb TwiilightSparkle
The plate races are quite interesting
I still can't believe we didn't WMC Titanic 2.
wb TwiilightSparkle.
Wb Twilight =P
welcome back TwiilightSparkle
and they censored the word "loser"
But the others are pretty dull :s
Ninjazz: I concur

Watcha reading TwiilightSparkle?
"Hey kids, stop playing those video games and watching those videos and surfing the internet! Come out here and play some _____" and anything that commonly fits the underscore, I hate.
xD
SpringWonder: Its the last book of Daring Do.
11,01Hi otakon
Ahh, I see.
Blood of Beasts has horrible cinematography
00,10copypasta is magic
Parents just don't use enough of the internet to understand it.
of course
Pasta is tasty
TwilightSparkle: Lend me all the Daring do books Twilight!!
I bought windows 7 last SUMMER! Vista won't upgrade worth a crap
Kandarihu: ugh the outdoors! Gardening is pointless, mowing the yard is pointless
Those who do are very cool or know too much.
the fire consists of animated .GIF files
Nothin' wrong with airing some of the older Cartoon (Cartoon)s.
Vista is the shittest OS there is
Daring Do And the Quest of the Ghostlies Jewel
I really wanna get XP for my laptop
otakon: not if you get fined for not mowing.
05hey
Because it has Vista
otakon but it makes the yard look clean
copypasted over the scene

Hi Wrek

Every time I hear about the Cartoon Planet block, I immediately assume they're literally bringing back Cartoon Planet...
We do
Hello Wrek|Observing
Loved the episode with Rainbow Dash when she started reading Daring Do xD
...Is misread it as Captain Planet.
Makes the inspectors think *Ooh, this place isn't a shittole*
Daring Do does the do.
is the aquabats coming on?
Yup
someone pinged me before and i couldnt check becuase window crashed :/
otakon ok then, be the one guy with snakes and stuff in the yard
Well, I understand mowing the lawn. It has to be mowed every week or 2 so that the grass doesn't get too long and become a breeding ground for snakes.
11,01Aquabats already aired.
Hello everyone
im going to assume this is wrek streaming
dance1211: That ended an hour ago
alllo Cobellanez
aquabats came on an hour ago

Daring Do flies North for the Southern birds!
Should rest my head after 3 hurs of 3D
11,01Now you have to deal with Landbats.
Shibakuzou_WallDives: I wonder why though? WHY is short grass so damn important? I takes time, gasoline and physical injury for a job that has absolutely no real point besides wasting time. And that's what the net is for
It's been a half hour already? Yeesh, time flies in the livestream.
night everyone
TheRandomkid321: Good night =P
Shibakuzou_WallDives: AND what is up with that .........in front of your nick?

11,01Long grass is more annoying.
bye TheRandomKid321!
Nobody knows
2 hrs, missed the friday one D:
otakon: I'm not going to be flippant with you on this. I don't enjoy pushing that mower all over the yard either, but it's a job that absolutely needs to be done.

No reference, dance1211, though still a cool ep
Cya FlareChaser. Colgate is NOT best pony.
00,10Some how I think hub just exploited all bronys and used them to get better rateings on a show
Later FlareChaser
Kandarihu: eh not really. All you need a is a path out and a path in. I apologize if I sounded flippant.
Ninjazz: And thats your opinion, mine differs.

I got voted best pony of season 2!! <3 thank you all

FlareChaser: Just trolling you, bro. :P

Nothin' wrong with that. It's still a solid Saturday Morning schedule. Yes, yes, even with the Shortcake.
Sumica: Probably

I am ok with the hub exploiting us
Bye FlareChaser!
kirzstryfe: those pesky raptors

00,10but then again I figured that 2months ago when they first said that
Euro gets no wub :c
Also, today is/was supposed to have the third(?) Super Best Friends Forever short, right?
That's not how it works, Sumica
So the rest of the yard is just Snake territory, huh?
new post! http://www.equestriadaily.com/
=O
I don't watch Cartoon Network, so...
GameTaco: I saw that one
Sumica: Yeah, but it keeps the show afloat, without good ratings, my little pony will not exist, and even so, it's always good to have a lot of viewers and support for one show.:)
10-m
Cartoon network is now crap
00,10Dari bot beat you Airpuff
:D
It's not even cartoons anymore
Aw xD
Well, you know they did show a cut out of Pinkie Pie on Aquabats. Can that be considered the reference?
It's... Improving.
Gah. The StopForumSpam nonsense again.
What IP is it reporting?
GameTaco: I like those shorts, I still wonder why they made Supergirl chubby though. I don't mind it however.

Okay. Shifting from Pokemon to Nethack, sorry

I loved Toonami.
/me is done reading the Daring Do series
RIP Toonami
To see it come bac would be a dream come true
toonami made my saturdays
Dken2021: you
His ME3 Review was badass.
AdamThePony They brought it back on April 1
i remember toonami from when i was a kid
ryou're right (i cant type)
For one night only.
Obsidian: it MIGHT come back.......it might.
Only for a day though
Daring Do is one good book!
I still remember watching Nezha when I was small. I watched strange things...
i hope it do
R.I.P. Toonami and see you later Tom.
^
I guess you could finally make a start on reading 'The Art of the To-Do list'. :$
It's only natural to try to fuse it back into the Saturday Adult Swim block somehow.
Thanks!
I didnt like that last gen of Toonami, IT was like ThOMas The Toonami Engine
GameTaco: hell yes
Hello all!

Sad Fluttershy is sad.
Dken2021: You used tab key?
yup
GarrettBrony: yeah the look departed too much I felt from the original Tom. But by God was the final goodbye nearly a damn tearjerker
I used tab key alot
10You're welcome
brb
4 years in a row, Adult Swim failed to make their viewers laugh for April Fool's day. This time, they elicited something other than rage.
Hey Ninjazz, WallDives, and TwiilightSparkle:
I use the neurotoxin key a lot
I used to have a link to a video with Twilight staring of into space with Neverwood's Potatoes, Tomatoes, Gravy & Peas - but it got baleeted *yes that spelling is intentional*
:)
Stay gold everypony
:$
what's the problem Dken2021: ?
tom departed too much from Moltar, though.
/me 11,01is platinum
11,01I can't move. Help.
no problem
/me melts Nittany_Discord
Need a Hammer?
Now you can go where you please.
Moltar was probably fired for wanting to air reruns of CHiPs.
/me 11,01is molten
How'd you guys think Holy grail was?
GameTaco: this is true.
quick, somebody undimonize Nittany_Discord
Tom was the Last remnent of Space Ghost coast to coast
oh, man! SPACE GHOST
Tom wasnt on SGCtC, was he?
would a cup of lifenoodles help?
No but he was connected to Moltar
11,01Moltar did Toonami for a bit.
/me hits Nittany_Discord with liquid nitrogen
yep. and almost no one remembers.
I do
:(
/me 11,01is a frozen puddle.
moltar was like the first host right?
yes
yep.
I also rememeber that Moxy that hosted late night cartoons
What does SGCtC stand for?
I think it was moxy
Moltar was hosting Toonami at the beginning. Then the made up Tom and the Absolution
Space Ghost: Coast to Coast
/me hits Nittany_Discord's molten remains with a hammer
Ninjazz: Space Ghost Coast to Coast
AHHH'
/me 11,01rings
Yeah Yeah. Now I remember
ah, Space Ghost Coast to Coast
SGC2C was a real mind trip
Moltar: Hosting and watching shows about heroic, model young women before it was cool.
11,01Great show.
Holy layers galore batman
that was a crazy show
Damn... That's old television.
I remember Jack Black on that show! :D

LYRA HAS BROKEN THE WALLS!
any mods or other people who've been here for a while I could talk to in private?
im still a sucker for the old spider man series XD
he's invaded Wrek|Observing's stream!
DAMN, Wrek You got some great skills within the last time I saw this drawing!!!!
:O
1960's spiderman
How many pixelsxpixels is this pic?
no the one from 1994
1960's spiderman is best meme spiderman
I am Ironman! (I'm not Ironman...in case you're wondering).
and the x-men cartoon
I was born in 1995 so i dont know that one
the X-Men cartoon from the 90's was great
yea, been watching ren and stimpy lately, as much weird and gross it is, it's kinda enjoying to watch, remind me of the internet
Storm and spider man has always been my favorit heroes
Since there are obviously people who never saw SGC2C, let me explain. It's basically an old 1960s superhero (Space Ghost) hosting a talk show, with his archnemeses supporting him, and guests who only appear on screens. And it was ABSURDLY FUNNY!
10Shiro, yes?
If that's the case I'll be NightCrawler
it still hold up pretty good.
<< oh criik! I havn't saved in over an hour!
Kandarihu: It was. ^^
WhatWhat: SAVE DAMMIT DAVE!
Thank for the Interwebs, Watching old show makes me feel like a true kid of the ninties
wait............why did I type Dave?
Yes.
11,01SGC2C was made by Williams Street, who later did Sealab 2021 and ATHF.
The idea, I guess, was that the special guests were actually prerecorded and the show just messed around with the footage. Most of the time, they outright ignored it. :P
I mean...
No.
I have sooo many great memoies from sailor moon
I'm having problems with my CPU. I should try re booting
I m sorry otakon I m afraid I cant let you do that
First anime was DBZ for me.
otakon: Dave sam it
Ninjazz, same here
first anime was Mobile Suit Gundam.
Nice, GarrettBrony.
Even today i still watch sailor moon
I wish I could remember Sailor Moon as well as I did then beyond the fact that I treated it like most "Bronies" probably do today.
The interviews were wierd because the producers would interview the guests ahead of time, and then depict Space Ghost asking them totally different questions.
:3
with Bright Noa's british accent.
Mah first Transformers was Armada
I thought the first anime was Astro boy?
My first anime(though I didn't know it) was Voltron and the first movie I saw was Project A-Ko
AKA watched in complete privacy in my room... >_>
everyone in my neighborhood watch dbz like a drama show
im also making my own group transform videos
1 hour until the interview!
DBZ was freakin awesome.
really only one hour?
Dken2021: it is kind of a soap opera......except with fighting
My first transformers was Beast Wars
First anime for me was technically Go Lion (Voltron). The anime that actually got me into anime was Sailor Moon.
11,01Interview?
Yay, interview!
Interview?
iNterview?
Beast was is probably one of the best transformers
Ninjazz, DBZ was my entry into the world of anime
Its today?
litwick are you sure about that
otakon I know, it even had alot of cliffhangers
Damn, my R key is cra[
You know what both of those two animes have in common? They were both HORRIBLY BUTCHERED dubs.
Ohai everypony :3
/me hugs everpony :3
ONe memory of A kid I had was watching Pet Shop Of Horrors 0___0
Worst Transformers? (Movies dont count)
RainbowAsh: Mine as well. It started somethng that I could not forsee in the coming years.
/me 11,01transforms
then we go awww, just kick frieza's ass already
Cybertron
litwick: are you sure about that
You who freaked me out the most? Cell.
I liked Trans Animated cuz of Tara Strong
I love how in shows, the bad guys always give the heoes optinum time to escape
Then they wonder why
transformers prime is the best
Tara Strong makes everything better
Kandarihu: agreed, I also remember watching Macron 1 from f.m.e. which was actually TWO shows combined. It was also the first time I saw a guy blow himself up AND a funeral in a kids show. THEY MARKETED IT FOR KIDS!
not much of a fan of transformers
Ninjazz, cell was an awesome villain, but I always was most fond of the Freeza arc.
Freeza was the momerable.
10Account
Freeza was my first encounter
he killed Vageta right?
Virginnia
RainbowAsh: except it took 20 friggin episodes for the planet to blow up dammit!
Very_Silly_Filly: :D
frieza's only rememberable cause he took the longest to kill
10He is currently away.
And kakka carrot cake

Hi eveyrpony http://i.imgur.com/NeQN1.gif (scary !)

i dont think akira will die this year cause he is only 57 years old
Shouldn't it Be Deadpool and Pinkie Pie?
Spider Ham
cachi01: well don't get too depressed my friend! he's only 57, and the Japanese on average are long lived. In good health he'll easily have another 30 years of bringing wonder to the world.
Eeyup exactly!
Except show up for Dr. Connors' class. He gets so caught up in what he's doing, he forgets all about it.
Pterodactyl, so, how is this non-sequitur shtick working out for you?
rice gives u lifelol
I never really liked dragonballz
DBQ
cachi01: actually, there was a injoke in the Blue Dragon DS game about Toriyama leaving his legacy behind in a android. But I won't spoil it.
i kinda liked anything my sister liked (She was corrupting mah mind)

GarrettBrony: Z was meant I think as the final chapter........then GT happened
Obsidian: 4 messages in 10 seconds gets you a kick
GT...
blargh
ohhh
All I know about GT is that's a self-contained shark jump.
i grew up with GT
man i missed todays aquabats episode. how was it?
I Dont really talk to her much, if i do she stares at me looking angry
Very good, but it felt short.
Episode of Bardock...Still more canon than GT
rdibp: Really good actually.
GameTaco: just barely self contained, also it had NO input from Toriyama
rdibp, great, but rather lacking in pony
yifle1: I'm so sorry.
I heard there was a pony shout out in it. was there?
I woke up at 9 but didn't get UP DARN IT
?
that you had to grow up with GT.
Plan 9
likety split?
yifle1: you need REAL DBZ experience
Seriously. It's like, the animé creators just kinda wanted to see how far they could take GT, and... Destroyed everything memorable about it.
Pterodactyl: mother of god..
thats like kids growing up with the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era games.
GameTaco: the main villains name is BABY
of course i also saw Dragon ball z
brb
Then, just to show how overboard they went, brought *all the villains back*... And promptly killed all of them again.

I was a child during the NES era, and it was somewhat socially acceptable for me to play video games. The SNES came out at around the time in my life when I was becoming a teenager and I was expected to drop that in favor of TEENAGE things like skateboarding and serious pursuit of sports.
The Carapace seems fine
Any mod/admin I can PM to ask about permission for a post?
dat Baseball stars, battletoads, Punch-out, Metal Slug, ST, Xevious...

The thing is, I have a kind-of cool mom. I don't really enjoy the M-Ratedness of M-rated games. But I tolerate them well enough.

I'm into Role Playing Games. And while mom can't game her way out of a paper bag, she enjoys the OSTs of the games I play.
I Once played A MATURE GAME ON A CRUSE SHIP WITH OTHER PEOPLE UNDER 18
COME ON MOM
otakon sure, should be on for a bit before avengers
If she's a changling, why can't she change into a motorised bar of soap.
SRSLY?
She would get LOADS of wub then
Epic wub time
Today's episode combinatin on the Hub are the Discord two parter
http://derpy.me/3XdRM and people said the LHC was a waste of money :D
If she wants wub, she just needs to ask Vinyl.
Very_Silly_Filly: a motorized bar of soap? :/
Soap?
yep
GameTaco: Vinyl HAS the wubs
otakon: If you were here half an hour ago, you'd know what I mean
My psp is almost 3 years old now
LHC?
whats that
yep
Squee
Largh Hadron Collider
yifle1: mine 5 if my brother hadnt sell it
Then Fluttershy said hi to Mario, but Mario threw his hat at Pinkie, and Rarity cried for no reason, this angered batman and he used his mega chin to beat up Braeburn.
...Or transform into Vinyl. I guess that works too.
hey guys
ok
hi
The Large Hadron Collider? Does nobody watch the news anymore :|
I got my PSP release day
hi Flutters.
its basically a atom smasher StarSwirlTheBearded
hi storm
Flutters, welcome.
I'm sure the wubs are able to be transmitted.
RankWinner: kids in here, remember that
/me Gets Evil Thoughts
allo storm
the only thing i have replaced in my psp is the battery
Maybe the LHC will turn us all into ponies later this year...
RankWinner: THE BEST IDEA EVER xdddd
StarSwirlTheBearded: no you can't use it as a doomsday weapon
I got a new screen protector, and that's about it.
otakon who else is joinin
wait crap 7 zip is murdering my cpu
What if i cut off one end?
otakon: Depends on your defenition of a kid =P I was following it's progress since I was 13
LHC? you talking about that thing that makes anti-matter?
guys did you knew there is a large hadron collider in scribblenauts?????????????
then it wounnd be a double cannon
My psp is like a friend for me
Chrysalis: I don't know, ccouldn't get a hold of kenne or RX yet.
otakon: what is it?
I don't go on my PSP anymore, I might sell it
I only play on my 3DS and PC nowadays
This is STILL on!?!?
kenne: you up for a Gold to extraction?
/me 11,01pets Chrysalis
ughhhh
Simple concept behing the LHC, smash things together and see what's inside.
<3
:)
funny story, I gave my PSP away like a idiot
otakon: idk
Blue_Leaf: yes, it'll be over soon
I only have my old DS.
Yay!
im trying to sell mah ps2 CUZ MY DAD TRIED TO "FIX" SOME OF THE WIRES
kenne: come on man! be decisive dammit!
(hugs Chrysalis too, but has an evil face right behing her eyes)
StarSwirlTheBearded, I guess if it wasn't buried in the ground and you would shoot the particle ray on someone, it might do some damage.
What do you guys think about the psvita
is that Sea Pony Lyra available somewhere?
My old DS was fatally broken a month ago
Dken2021: fun story i did that but with my ps1 and gameboy advance.... i cry for them every night
StarSwirlTheBearded: wait..........your dad tried to FIX it?
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
otakon: idk maybe, are we playing now
yifle1: I kinda find it pointless all it has is better graphics.
(hehe, Chrysalis doesn't know...)
Rainbow, I need a hug. ),:
?
:,(*
cachi01 did you give it to a classmate for free?
To me its just some garbitch
(hugs Blue_Leaf insanely hard)
UGH.
Dken2021: to my cousin
-Is squeezed-
They havent changed anything in it from the last PSP
Wrek needs to start his own radio station, I have yet to hear a song I dislike.
-Eyes bulge-
Only it's graphics and size
:D
Yturns out it was the tvs auxillery so HE DIDN'T NEED TO CUT IT OFF *RAGE FACE*
I was thinking for an episode, the mane 6 or spike himself is somehow transported to an evil residents area where previous villains all gather to create evil plans and relax from their defeat, And while in that area the mane 6, (or Spike) have to disguise themselves while also trying to escape and return back home before terroized by their former villains, What do you think?
yifle1: it's overpriced as hell with proprietary memory cards and a small library. Plus you have to PAY to play any old PSP games you have that you want to play on the Vita. I'd wait 6 months for more releases and a price drop.
I would agree, if Wrek|Observing didn't have any wubstep
I'm sorry.
/me Not sure if like
I'm not getting it full stop, I'm happy with my 3DS
yeah and then EL CHAPULIN COLORADO!! comes and saves the day
Just look at how lively this chat is. :)
otakon THATS RIGHT BROHOOF /)
-Le poofs once again-
DrGNs: I had an idea like that. but the only real villains are Discord and Chrysalis.
otakon: are we doing it now
damn who ever doin the pic it looks real
has anyone played 9 hours 9 persons 9 doors?
kenne: yes, Chrysalis start up a match!
Poor Vel-Vita.

Every since CoD 3, I've pretty much hated it

It's just released WAY too frequently
They add piss all
Nittany_Discord: true every freaking lobby is hacked now and i dont want to talk about COD4
Bronysith awesome
New maps based on old ones, and that's it
Very_Silly_Filly: same deal with the Maddens
I say it is the online community that kills the COD series
Madden and fifa are the same
can u ponies go on youutube and type in skyrim badass its epic
Dances_With_Discord: you mean the immature e-peens?
So I just remembered Ponies are still on at 1, are you still watching it?
mitamaking: no ponies
(flies all over Equestria to try to find Chrysalis)
:(
otakon: yup
StarSwirlTheBearded: I saw that video! It was so awesome!
mitamaking I don't have it.
The episodes today are the Discord ones

Nittany_Discord This, not to mention, those maps are too small.

Man those are great
(teleports to the ME3 universe, thanks to Twilight's magic):)
yifle1: tarzan for gamecube??? CAUSE ITS EPIC
interview?
dammit! I don't want to miss the interview!
Litwick: What are you talking about?
11,01MW3 would benefit from dedicated servers. I couldn't find any last night.
Woah, Commander_Shepard, hello!
morning
What interview?
And you take like 1 bullet from a bastard gun, and die
Back
no the one for ps1
Hai Rainbow
otakon: it shouldnt be until 4
Did you not read their newsletter?
Cookie-Cutter Awww yeah dragon dead Brohoof? SLICE DEAD
11,01Don't have to wait for people to join matches in matchmaking.
whats being drawn?
Nittany_Discord: NO one has dedicated servers it seems for a damn MP focused game
And for the record, Tribes: Ascend beats basically all CoD games and is free to play.
oh haha nvm
is it the one u need to surf on a wooden board and go bungee jumpng??? yifle1
Commander_Shepard: Yeah, just teleported to the ME3 universe, or whatever this is, and I'm trying to find Chrysalis, do you know where she is?
Tribes ascend looks epical
11,01otakon: BF3?
i think it is
And PlanetSide 2 will beat all games ever made and will be free to play
One day Fluttershy was doing a sonic rainbooom, but then Celestia came in and turned into a dog and Married Winona and had two puppies name Sweetums and Fatass. Pinkie Pie used 7
I'm gonna get it after I upgrade my RAM
its the one with clayton
They don't say the time of the interview on the newsletter
11,01Many PC game have dedicated servers.
Nittany_Discord: the same, it's EA so the servers are taxed ALL THE TIME
I'll see everybody later
and the Chargers are on the clock, brb
She maybe the Marauder Shields
bye DrGNs
bbl
the only shooter i have is goldeneye007
Bye DrGNs! (kisses you)
Archeoptryx what?
Tried to help me
COD DEDICATED SERVERS HAHAHA good one XD (I know that past COD games had dedicated servers :))
for wii
Goldeneye is BRILLIANT
11,01EA are Orwellian, so they own the servers and run them like parents.
For n64
CoD 4 did.
Any good games being released soon?
http://pokebeach.com/scans/dark-explorers/48-espeon.jpg
i got portal for wii..........
Very_Silly_Filly: A great movie, and a legendary game, both 10/10s.:)
SpringWonder: Lollipop Chainsaw
11,01No good games that I know of.
05:D
11,01Unless you like sequels.
and i see lyra still swimming around
The Wii has pretty much been discontinued hasn't it?
I wanna see the movies y next chance them at the libraretill g
lollipop chainsaw A.K.A twilight sparkle cursing and killing
I think all PC gamers have a inherant dislike for Ubisoft
Nittany_Discord: Lollipop Chainsaw
Yes
Not yet. Maybe next year.
11,01*shrug*
The only games released on it nowadays are crap oneds
For englend james?
I loathe most Ubisoft PC ports. The DRM Ubisoft has is the most draconian crap ever made
no, for me
I wanted that game beofre the bronies did(Suda 51 fan)
After that Luna exploded like a shark and Then Fluttershy cried for no reason, but then Richard III came in and Henry Tudor woz like " NO U" and explosions
They are doing 3DS and WiiU stuff now
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
last story on the wii is coming soon, isnt it?
11,01I haven't seen an interesting game in years (which hasn't been ruined by publisher greed).
I feel like this year's E3 is going to be awesome, but I say that about all of them... And last year's was the only one that I kinda enjoyed.
Aplot
sup
Very_Silly_Filly exatly
Xenoblade Chronicles just came out, that is good
Nittany_Discord: Torchlight series
:3
guys have you seen the portal 2 second dlc trailer?? THERE IS AN EASTER EGG OF MEET THE PYRO!!!!!!!!!!
the old games are still best
:P
Minecraft.
11,01Maybe.
The only game I think of where the devs actually CARE about their customersa
Daikatana is best shooter.
Sensitive fur indeed.
11,01Old games are better. You have more ownership of those.
/me *trollface*
LOZ:OOT is best game EVER EVER FOREVER EVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
harry potter for ps1
I'm back everypony :)]
Who thinks the entrence of 007 in goldeneye is the best- sorry i didn't knock
11,01They won't be useless when the DRM servers go down.
Nittany_Discord: Tribes: Ascend, a few dozen indie games, GTA, indie games, PlanetSide 2, indie games.
yifle1: i love tht one xd
Torchlight 2 will literally buy it, do what the fuck you want with it, they don't care
.............
11,01I know.
Vinyl, welcome.
11,01I'm being general.
Welcome Back Vinyl
cachi01: NOPE. the best game ever is.... yeah nevermind...
Ah
cachi01 i disagree i think its an amazing game and one of my favorites but i have to say CRONO TRIGGER is the best game ever
The queen of the changelings, Chrysalis, is the primary antagonist featured in A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1 and Part 2. She is a shapeshifter who took on the form of Princess Cadance in order to invade Canterlot by taking Cadance's place and render her husband-to-be, Shining Armor, unable to perform his duties as Captain of the Royal Guard.
ive had only hp games for the cpu
they are the my most memorable games i know
/me 's favorite game is Kingdom Hearts 1
i like ff3
Sounds (reads?) good.
11,01I like games. I just hate how my hobby has been strip-mined by a greedy few.
:O
11,01Also, the copyright BS.
Bronysith: i havent played chrono triger lol
Dat blending
My favorite RPG is Phantasy Star IV.
Oh come on movie night... hurry up.
R.I.P dio
Aw yeah <3 this song
Bronysith, how about Live-A-Live?
Is there going to be something in place of the usual new pony episode, like old episodes etc...?
The only thing me and my bro did at my grandparents house was play hp
11,01I still like games though.
mitamaking: brohoof (\ one of my fave games is the kingdom hearts series :D
11,01And play them frequently.
:D
Like the Ubisoft sign up online to play a singleplayer game yeah that sucks
cachio01 try it out its so much better than ff6 or 7 get a snes emulator
Are there any decent turn-based RPG's for the PC that are recent?
are we still streaming the hub at 1 pm EST
:P
AHH harry potter ps1 i miss you games
Anno 2070 looks good though...
mm
A11ectic no
HOLY DIVER
Don't forget the Ubisoft "If our servers are down you can't play" thing
BETTER THAN FF7??
That's really helpfull.
but no one has ever played it...
Ubisoft is going to be in trouble soon I think, Assassain's Creed is being milked to oblivion, and if the Rabbids show flops they will be in trouble
11,01Anno 2070 had bad DRM.
I've never liked Ubisoft
I still have Anno... something or other, the one before 2070
i really expected a december 21 release for AC3
There gonna be some sort of episode stream today?
Nittany_Discord Bad as in Easy to break?
arseassins creed is retardly unfair sometimes
cachi01 dont worry i still love ff7 but theres something about crono trigger
nick is really milking Fred O____O 2 movies? a series?
mitamaking: I never thought about that... But it's very true
They made a show about the Rabbids 0_0
11,01I didn't mind Ubisoft until they announced their DRM.
I've never been able to play it because my save got corrupted and now I can't log in. Ubisoft Support basically = "Buy the game again"
drm?
05pony_6841 there's BMN in a little while
duuuuuude
digital right management StarSwirlTheBearded
/me feels like a noob
Wrek
just wow
*rights
guys have you seen the trailer for KARA????
DRM = Digital (or Data by some odd people) Rights Managment.
11,01GarrettBrony: Bad as in "changing hardware counts as an activation."
lets not forget syphon filter ps1
kay
I hate how they just change the surroundings and add a few more weapons to the assassins creed series, and then it's a new game.
11,01Ubi DRM is very bad.
11,01And it doesn't work.
Ubisoft is bad
05steam DRM is tolerable
Acleps: it has an amazing stryline
Imo
out of curiousity is there a pony ep today?
05if they only workedo ut their issues >.>
Ubisoft hates PC gamers.
11,01I like Steam.
StarSwirlTheBearded: probably not, outside of BRM.
should be
Ubisoft puts horrid DRM in that screws all legit players over and rewards pirates. Then they wonder why their games get pirated.
11,01It's been slow for one times.
D:
Steam DRM works pretty well most of the time, slow, but yeah
11,01*time
05StarSwirlTheBearded: season 2 is over so... no new ep. but during BMN 2 user selected episodes will be shown
cahci01: Well...thats true, but every time I finish one of the games I feel like it was a ripoff of the previous one
What O_______________O
DRM = Dick Raping Madness in UBi's Case
NOOOOOOOOOO
HOW I MISS THAT
I had SO MUCH FUN with From Dust
Caps
TO TEH INTERNETZ
wat is euro movie night
BYE
Mind the caps
I'm looking at that map of the people who saw season 2's finale here, I'm not on it
Bought the game, couldn't play it and I had to pirate to play the game I just bought.
Things might be changing for Steam soon. First Ys: Oath (with Ys Origins on the way), and now, a one-woman developed visual novel.
11,01Let's not forget that Ubi has lied about DRM.
<Minimod apparently =P*
11,01And got away with it.
RankWinner: i love to kill my villagers XD
Magic: Same as friday movie night, but earlier
This makes me feel all warm and fluffy inside.

wat movies
Oh wait, that's just Sweetie Belle.
Yep Nittany_Discord, that's what they did with From Dust. "Only steam DRM." Nope......
shrek song?
That map :D BRONIES ARE CONQUERING THE WORLD
Magic is your other nick name Friendship?
Magic, they replay Friday, but for the Eurobronies who would otherwise be up at 1-6am in the morning.
CrimsonPhoenix sweet

RankWinner: Well at least you can feel that you did the right thing
You can still attend the Euroshow if you miss Friday. They don't care :).
oh
ok
14when I will move I swear I'm going to try to find all the Neo expansion sets :D
Yep, my -albeit quite warped- concience is the only thing stopping me from just pirating all Ubisoft games out of spite.
tamales oaxaqueñooooooooooooooos
Everlasting_Joy: I'm usually here for both :)
8 mintues?
The map proves we need an Asian movie night
Triple: and an hour
mitamaking: where do i find this map?
welp, I'm back.,
lyra lol
XD
Asian movie night? Like kungfu movies?
:(
Acleps :). I can't attend both, so I show up for Friday.
welcome back Litwick
It's a link on the newsletter or http://ponychat.net/2012-04-21_map.html
Welcome back Litwick
I think most bronies are in the west because of the more depressing lifestyle, places like Japan or Korea (*cough* ignoring China) are quite cheery.
11,01If you pirate, you'll just be part of the problem (and made-up statistics publishers use to justify bad business practices).
I still want disney movie night...
CCCP :)
i wonder what kind of episode there is in season 3
so is SAI paintTool any different from adobe Illustrator?
:( GarrettBrony
11,01Of course, the only way to own a game now is to pirate it.
Season 3 is all about cows
Garrett>my full nickname is magic blade
Problem? The Witcher 2 used litteraly no DRM and they did fine in sales.
SAI IS adobe illustraot
05Haeleus: yes very much on funtemental levels
RankWinner: being a brony means u are depressed? O_o
05Very_Silly_Filly: no.
Everlasting_Joy: I'm usually here on fridays because of the chat, and if I get too tired I'll just go to sleep. On saturdays I watch both movies fully
Oh really? :s
cachi01: No, it's just that most people (and you can see this in the brony survey) watch because it cheers them up
@Wrek here did you get this playlist?
i hope there will be a episode about big macintosh and doctor whooves
Wait, what...shockwave adobe illustrator... confuzzled*
ah ok, was wondering if I should try out SAI specifically
:C
ohh ok O_o
honestly I'm not touching any game that has DRM in it; I like to play offline sometimes. Reason I didn't buy Final Fight DLC from capcom, despite my desire for some mike haggar HUURRRAAGGH!
11,01Witcher 2 had piracy problems, but no different than DRM'ed titles.
RankWinner: For me it's just a side effect of the show :)
A Doctor Whooves episode would rock but the rights issues are too much I think
^
It would be difficult for them to do a Doctor Whooves, copyriht with Doctor Who and such
i hate copyright
One day Fluttershy beat up Big Mac, but then Mario threw his hat at Applejack but she fireed her lazer and explode Mario and luigi woz like "NOOOOOOO"
There is a rumor we might be getting a Derpy Episode
/me is sad
/me is a pirate yar har fiddle dee dee... but Ive bought a helluva lot more...
Exactly Nittany, it shows that DRM makes litteraly no difference. Well, it makes a difference in that you might get fewer sales because of it.
Even if The Dr. Who website as acknowledged us.
That rumour is most likely false
Maybe they could put a small teaser like "We know!!!" about him being the Doctor
11,01DRM is an investor confidence-booster.
/me glomps CCCP to cheer him up
I don't want a Derpy episode, unless it is about Dr. Whooves
yifle1: It would suck to be a maker of media if there was no copyright :S
chances are,thier false as hell
11,01It's also game companies not thinking differently.
I won't believe any rumors about the next season until I heard it from the pony's mouth.
Considering the controversy she generated, a Derpy episode sounds very unlikely.
GarrettBrony:
an derpy episode would rock she just have to me derped 6_9
:(
Mmm.
wait no episods
We've got months to go.
i know
11,01Still wanting to control their product.
GameTaco: I would believe ponies talking to me too
Nittany, arent you a cook?

WHY ARE PEOPLE CONNECTED IN THE MIDDLEOF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN O_o
11,01No.

cachi01: That's me. Nice to meet you.
I wonder how much people will join soon in anticipation for a new episode :D
Later Wrek|Observing
Oh heck yes, a Derpy origins episode. Maybe we can learn how she got her cutie mark XD
11,01Lemme link to a good read about copyrights.
lol Ninjazz how do u do that??
although season 2 has ended, will you still be streaming the episodes?
05so far so good
cachi01: Islands.
Copyright is not evil, DRM is
CopyRights sux
Acleps perhaps alot
what's the name of this song?
Argh I forgot the name of that anti-copyright/drm 'religion'....
11,01http://www.copyrightreform.eu/sites/copyrightreform.eu/files/The_Case_for_Copyright_Reform.pdf
can we survive?probably. we will be revived in a few months with season 3 anyhow...
05Rallinale: we stream episodes every BMN
cachi01 On the surface, some IP addresses will reroute someone to weird places for security purposes.
11,01Kopimism?
Creative Common ftw
oooooohhhhhh the red dots might make me not see it Ninjazz lol
That's the one
KONY 2012
Everlasting_Joy: ok
cachi01: :D
I wish we watched Return to Harmony though, it is my fav 2-parter
PONY 2012
Kony for president 2012
:D
lol
11,01I'll vote Kony in.
oh thats a good site, I had to go there to prove copying names from a published book was illegal >.> people can be so retarded
cachi01: So if you're using an ISP in Chicago, tracing it might put you in Japan.
PONY 2012
lol USA and mexico are filled with red dots xDDD
Lauren Faust for president 2012
Chat is gettingpolitical all of a suddeb
*Sudden
11,01I love how uploading a cover of a song is considered copyright infringement on Youtube.
GarrettBrony: Do you honestly think she would want that job?
cahi01 and Europe too :D
Kermit the frog for 2012
JIMMY RUSSELS 2013
Saying _____ for president is not political
Nittany, I still remember one of my test papers having a "Redacted due to copyright" thing on half of the images in it xD
11,01A cover of a song...
hi
no i dont think so
Obsidian: I hate politics
Litwick: lol
twilight sparkle 2012
really? a cover?
11,01Yeah.
AND NO. I do not mean 2012.
Nittany_Discord for president 2012
*sigh*
A'ight, I need to go. I'll be back in due time, this I promise.
hi
11,01A friend of mine couldn't upload song covers because they were shot down by YT's copyright system.
allo glennglog22
Luna for president 2012
Oh is the picture done?
gotta collect them all?
Did Dabu find out why his YouTube account was banned in the end? I forgot to check up on that
How about we just burn the White House AND Congress down> With tem inside.
Hi
Luna is already co-prez
wow
11,01And I've known of cases where videos of song covers were copyright-claimed.
pinkie pie for president 2012-end of time
Litwick: that's murder
ill vote for twilight
Hi Mario
and sortof... bad?
Nittany_Discord Creative Commons FTW
11,01Hell, videos under fair-use have been taken down.
Litwick: That can get you in trouble for just saying that.
thats very awesome
:D
hooray for treason
suuper awesome
11,01And the user has to go through a process to get them back up.
On YouTube most owners of copyrighted material decide to profit from other's postin their content: they add commercials and get half of the income :)
14YES :D
Hooray fro CC-BY
11,01More than what it takes to make the copyright claim in the first place.
I really like her mane
Screw the US and their low-as-hell taxes. Paying like 8% and I have to pay 20% -__-
11,01I can go spoof a copyright on any YT video right now and get away with it.
is this the Queen of "insert name here"???
??
Queen of the changlings
Love that hair.
Is it time for the interview yet?
^
right,forgot 6_9
interview???
Hard to believe that was done on a computer
MadSurge that at 4pm est
Queen Chrysalis
:O
...And Lyra.
cowvarkian: You mean go to jail for not paying he taxes? *is dumb O#O*
To be honest I wanted some of those bills to go through just to watch the US internet/infrastructure get destroyed. It would have been a interesting show of power.
Imagine if one of the big owners of copyrights decided to sue everyone who violated their coprights..._S
_S*
:SSS*
So no Hub stream right now?
I really can't write
So what now?
i know right? pretty good to do that! on PC
wrek is doin a beautiful job on her
When is this "interview" I keep hearing about?
No Return of Harmony?
Whos interviewing Who
No Lyra. That's not cheese.
ponychat know where i live :inglip:
She needs those to stand.
its neeew
dat GameTaco
<3
11,01I don't want these bills to go throught.
11,01*through
y'know, it would be a whole lot easier if the US government updated their laws, but no, republicans want to keep it that way cause our forefathers "wanted it this way"
11,01They'll create a corporate police state.
Don't worry, if they do then... :D
11,01Worse than now.
How about we start a revolution.
It would never get that far
i still want mayonnaise as an instrument...........
yes
Litwick: hunger games
CISPA: Craping Internet Strangling Pissing Act
0,5Revolutions are impossible these days in big countries like the US.
11,01And the US will get the right to police the internet for the entire world.
I'd love to see the creator making all the layers invisible, and then making them visible one by one :D
The DMC is good enough we dont need more bills for internet copyright *shrugs* :p
Later and remember no Hateing
lol
11,01The DMCA is bad enough.
You'd think that. The internet would help a lot
yes litwick
Love and tolerate
0,5Our army is too powerful. We wouldnt stand a chance (assuming we're on the revolutionary side)
No
11,01Then Pro-IP came.
why are we all here
LordCelestia true
Love and tolerate gets you nowhere: you must fight for what you beleive in.
CISPA is 21st century's Prohibiton and I am one of its bootlegers
I doubt most of the US army would actually turn against the citizens
0,5xXSpikeMLPXx Saturday pony streams aren't the only thing we do
11,01I don't know.
If it came to the point of revolution I think a lot of people in the Military wouldn't fight. They at LEAST respect people
RankWinner: ever heard of Martial Law?
No HUB stream?
0,5Well while they wouldnt want to turn on us
The USA is now officially turning into North Korea.
Martial Law? Who would enforce it?
0,5Im not sure they would have a choice
LordCelestia, you forget that in many revolutions in the past, part of the army joined the revolutionary cause
11,01The US army might easy turn against us, especially under orders.
0,5Lest they drop out and fight for us
Kandarihu: season's over
aren't we supposed to be watching Monty Python
0,5Oh, looks like you beat me to that point
?
AdamThePony: 1 hour.
oh yeah.
RankWinner: Actually it's proven that when someone with a high auctority tells someone to do something - even if it's wrong - they will likely do it.
Shit
I think it's pretty obivous there isn't it Kanadrihu
this sounds like the idea for a game plot; just revamp PIPA and SOPA into more mutual and emotional ideas
still have 55 mis
Yeah! I think we are suppose to me
(*be
So are you going to continue streaming Aquabats, or is it right that it was only shown today due to the hopes of catching the Brony Shoutout?
Martial Law= Homefront War
Just so I know if I should sleep in or not. ^_^;
i miss megaupload
so do i
'74, '75 :)
yifle1: megaupload........... ;_;
Am I the only one that would like to see more Dan Vs. on here?
Nittany_Discord: the military is sworn to uphold the constitution. To refuse an order that violates the constitutional rights of the people is part of the army's duty.
:(
no new episode?
Acleps: Not if it's totally wrong. There is a degree of propaganda/barin-washing going on in the army, as there should be, but not nearly enough to convince soldiers to shoot their neighbours.
season 2 finished
76
im feeling awfluy sad today
pony_1169 nope, but there's movies and pony episodes later
:P
RainbowAsh: No, I was positively impressed
05back
it was there i go most of my things from
76
RankWinner: you like the brainwashing?
11,01RainbowAsh: I can try and get Season 2 eps.
damn...
11,01front
Morals=/=orders
Nittany_Discord, that would be totally awesome. ^^
side-to-side
*morals~orders
Morals > Orders
I say 'brainwashing'... I just mean propaganda disguised as other things, such as "Wear makeup! It's good! You'll only be beautifull with makeup!"
Yes, I'll only be beautiful with makeup...
*sigh* Why does there have to be so much intolerance in our world :'(
have you seen me without makeup?
Ohh, can I get some makeup?!
11,01Psychological studies have shown that people will obey orders more easily than you think even if they aren't "moral."
So if the government ordered you to do something that you knew in your heart was the wrong thing to do, you'd do it?
we can´t do anything about it
that is i big thing there are alot of people who are wondering if the militay will follow obama if he where to go bad
Deae Lunae, right?
RankWinner: There was a psychological test, where people were told to give eachother electical shocks (not real) if the other one answers a question wrong. After a while the person recieving shocks pretended to die. Most of the people tested kept on giving shocks even though they knew that the shocks were lethal.
05so... what to do next...
....Draw you! :D
@Kandarihu: Remember, there's the punishment for refusal...
is that Pandora, he's using?
the wings?
wings
02*WB03(Rukario03)02WB* - <Umbreon> there really isn't anything hard about DOS <Umbreon> except making it do something useful
not me, but there are people who will follow orders with little or no question, Kandarihu
The Mane?
Wrek, are you using pandora?
@Acleps: Heya!
05nope
GilDash Hi :D!
spotify i think
And you know what people who are punished for making the right choice are known as? Martyrs.
what is the name of this song?
@Acleps: A decent movie tonight!
Acleps: i saw the show that highlighted that
Draw..... a fish.
A fish, draw a fish.
Freaking internet.
Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus
fish lyrics
fishy fish?
oh my celestia dat song O3O
lol, what if the dude who owns the computer that this is livestreaming off of forgets it's up, and we see him watching porn or somthing...
GilDash: Finally I see someone again, usually I only talk to certain people once here :S
This song sounds like a remix of Deae Lunae.
Hello!
GilDash: The first movie is awesome ! :)
HandCock: No.
Luna deos <3
Either way, what was I saying. Er... ah yes, those experiments were confined. Once people see other people being killed and speak up it can jog you back into being semi-normal.
This song...
@Acleps: I just jump right in. Never know what you'll find. :)
inb4 kick
HandCock: give Wrek more credit than that.
@Acleps: I know, right! Monty Python FTW!
Dear Luna?
allo Furry21!!
Furry21, welcome.
Killing a person because you were told to and having nobody tell you it's wrong is one thing, killing somebody and having a whole country condemn you for it is another.
GilDash: The second movie is not that great tho...
Hello Furry21
:)
Lol Lyra XD
when does IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT!!!?
@Acleps: I don't even know what it is. I'm here regardless. Need something to hold me over until season 3.

GilDash: what kind of people? Who would approve of destroying that which makes life good just in order to live a little longer.

Other than that music playing.

@Kandarihu: But it's the ability to get everyone to rise at once. That can be difficult...

You either have a omnipotent democracy that will be hated or a republic full of morons who will ruin a country.
Kandarihu, unless the tyrant gets his hands on poison gas. Then everyone dies in the worst possible way

lol
chrysalis is probably one of the coolest
xd joke
Okay
I'm acually REALLY happy that FiM doesn't talk about love relationships often, because that's basically what all the children's shows do
Equestria remix!
Self-respect can be corrupted into narccism and friendship can be corrupted into codependance. But love in it's true form cannot be corrupted. That's why love conquers all.
equestria girls?
fine then...
Chrysalis is best villain art wise
I have this on my Ipod
along with the living tombstone
Chrysalis is best Phony
Discord is best troll villain
Acleps: and that's why they eventually suck
11,01Pinkies4thWall: Agreed.
http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/our-staff/ Learn about the mods!
@Acleps: Love is overrated. FFTW. (Friendship for the win!)
Kandarihu, so, if love gets corrupted, it hadn't been true? That is somewhat idealistic
Pinkies4thWall: indeed

Looks like Chrysalis needs some love, she's gotten all skinny.
ACS13123: What's the next step after love?
Flutterguy!?
GameTaco: 5 million money
ACS13123, that makes much sense in world. Only problem is that love is so overdone.
GameTaco and then they made Chrysalis pink

GameTaco: I would buy it in a heartbeat

And when you press a button on her flank, she says, "I'm a queen. Are you a queen too? ...I didn't think so."
ummm

QUICK SHOWER TIME!
@Wrek what is this song called?
GilDash: Yeah, the physics were thought of before they even started planning on making the movie.
Dken2021: You watch MLP FiM.
uhmmmmmmmm can we say that season 1 first 2 episodes were a movie then first 2 season 2 episodes were another movie and the finale was another moviee?????????????
I personally still believe that Changelings are actually the descendants of Flutter Ponies.
@Acleps: I bet they've got tonnes of pages of paper with all the workings on.
/me is nom nomming on a pizza.
cachi01: ummmm maybe? lol
FlareChaser . . . lucky guess
showertiem
cachi01: if they ran at least 90 minutes in total, then yes.
I think if they ever got enough true love they would actually get their pretty looks and Butterfuly wings back.
what is the name of this song
cachi01: you can say it, but it wouldnt be true.
Back with lunch :)
wow my iternet is bein a bitch

cachi01: I meant if EACH of them ran for 90 minutes in total, sorry
What is it Flare?
ell everypony
If they bring the changelings back, they totally need to explain away the copy-paste background ponies as changelings that had been planted all throughout Equestria from the very beginning. :P

MahBoi777: thos do not exist
FlareChaser: are you joking or do you know what I know?
Shall I make the evidence?
Obsisdian what was the last song called

GilDash: That's why the movie should be used to teach physics.

cachi01: your right, how silly:P

How would i know?
I dk
Canada found it.
@Wrek wat was the last song called
...She actually looks kinda sexy with only half her hair. The Pinkamena effect.
OH SHIT CANADA THIS IS WHY I LOVE YA
looks a little too "punk" too me
@Acleps: No, that movie should just replace all lessons taught anywhere. Using only that movie would teach you to survive anything. Even the cold confines of space.
canada already found it
they wont cure it. more money in treating it.
Nittany_Discord: profit has nothing to do with it.
Maybe add a tattoo.
Litwick: we're too busy making iphones smaller to work on medicine, lol
cure for cancer, only $9999.99
WOW R34 PIC????
What the...
what?
11,01If we cure cancer, drug companies that make chemo drugs will lose a lot of money.
@Kandarihu: If they think they can get more money out of treatment over cure, they'll probably go with treatment...
Fluttershy: Known cure for cancer, side effects include heart attacks.
And of course, blood sugar elevation.
@GameTaco: And death?
Don't worry, I have the pills that cure the death.
11,01And those drug companies are either going to lobby or use patents to stop the cure.
@GameTaco: Oh, that's okay then.
GilDash: It should be the movie we send to travel through space, so that creatures less intelligent than us can survive in coffins
lm gonna leave damn internet is bein a bitch
11,01It's hyperbolic, but possible.
bye Magic
Nittany_Discord: The horrible truth
I SWEAR I SAW A PC OF SHE HAVING A DICK INFRONT OF HER O_o
bye all

I've cured your cancer! . . . but now you have aids.
I wish there was a cure for cancer

LunaTheBeloved, welcome.
Well, let them send their lobbyists. They have free speech. But so do we.

@Wrek|Observing what was the last song called?
hello
11,01Do you have stocks or money to buy politicians?
Fluttershy is the cure for cancer but you're likely to get something else in return...
My Little Pony's been butch﻿ since Friendship is Magic. :P
@Kandarihu: They also have money. And probably connections.
darn politics
Money isn't friggin' everything guys.
SpringWonder the cure for cancer gives you AIDS

@Kandarihu: So they could make a more underhanded deal that screws us over in the same way, but only a few of us will catch on whilst most will remain ignorent...

I really like her mane.

The problem with votes is that in most countries only two parties can be expected to be in power at any given point. If you are in one of those, you don't worry about losing an election, because you can be quite sure you will regain power in some years
05ive been searchign for the truth
11,01RIAA and MPAA are lobbying laws to help them maintain what makes money for them.
wat are we watching for Euronight?
05and i know i have to choose
PrincessDismo: You ok?:D
05been away for far too long...
05now im gone

GilDash: Yeah, I can see it in PrincessDismo's eyes.;)
not major, but more than one party is of importance in many copuntries
lol Lyra
GilDash: TheRainbowDash Yes, Extremely...... I'm trying not to start a fight in chat tbh
A pizza muffin... I just might wanna try one of those.
/me pokes everypony
@TheRainbowDash: But you gotta share, you gotta care. :D
germanys gouvernment = 3 parties AT THE MOMENT
I bet G5 will focus on Derpy, Octavia, Vinyl Scratch, Lyra, Carrot top, and BON Bon
pizza muffin? that sounds delicious
PrincessDismo: Naw, it's all for laughs and sillies!
It's too bad we can't get by without any political parties. Alas, we are a people of classifications and categorizations. And maybe just a few absolutes.
oh hey LunaTheBeloved...mind not doing that again
11,01Better than our two-party system.
EY everypony..just got skyrim and played it.
@PrincessDismo: Hey, there's enough Dash to go around. :)
Look. The cure for cancer is antibodies taking little gold particles to every single cancerous cell in the body, and using radiation to superheat the gold particle, killing the cancer cells and leaving the normal cells alone. No side-effects, and it works on all types of cancer.
Registered Intependent and proud of it.
Sorry...
GarrettBrony i wouldnt put money on it
GilDash: I share....some of the time.:D
smaller parties are important here
hey robotdragon7 awesome
Only a Sith deals in absolutes...
that pony he's drawing is awesome
GilDash: ._. I don'r want dash
@Kandarihu: I vote for a retro-virus!
robotdragon7: i guess u already have your pocket full of useless things like buckets right? xDD dont worry that happens to all after 15 mins of gameplay
yeah i also got the REALLY thick game guide
hi
Kandarihu: Sounds kinda painful.
11,01We have other parties, but they don't hold major political seats.
GilDash HIV is Also a RetroVirus
pony_4588, I know, in many countries you get coalitions between parties, but even there, you got two big parties and several smaller ones, that have no chance to claim positions like president or chancellor

@GameTaco: Best Chancellor ever.
no i hope shes healthy
Bronysith: Thats because your a brony as well.
GilDash, most competent I have ever seen
Who watches the Colbert Report besides me?
is wrek streaming
He was the Chancellor of Germany before he became the Furhur Rainbowash. ps Glomp Fight
@RainbowAsh: Without a shadow of a doubt.
Nittany_Discord: It is one of those thinhgs that you want to go away, but it never will.
Kipkat07_Mare: From time to time.
Kipkat07_Mare: Occasionally
robotdragon7: yes
oh cause hes a good artist
I just realized, it's pretty dark out. So cloudy~
Ninjazz: I watched it when I found out he was a brony
The thing is, you think the Pharmacutical companies will be lobbying to get this technique banned. It makes more sense if they jump on this as a bandwagon and start PRODUCING this cure themselves. THAT is what capitalism is about, not greed.
GarrettBrony, oh yes, I think I heard about it. Hitler gained power when Germany was a democracy and then made laws that turned it into a dictatorship, right?
11,01Well, hopefully the political winds blowing against me will change.
I hate hosptials.

@Ryanier128: Hooray for my laziness and less lazy people on this chatroom!
Cheese... do you mean vegan-friendly?
The thing is, if it weren't for someone without any connections taking a stab at this, this cure would've never happened. Governments are dumping loads of money into trying to cure cancer and got nothing for their expenditure.
Toss me one over here, That_British_Guy.
cheese is best vegetable
I think it is time to save your progress. that program looks ready to crash
nvm.
Cheese is a vegetable as far as I'm concerned.
