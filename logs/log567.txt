3yeah
13can you call dear esther a game? it is more like a text adventure
13played over 60s dialup
SlurryMoon: I heard it's more of a interactive movie than anything else. Hell, heavy rain has more "game" in it.
13at 6 baud
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbangerlabs/remee-the-rem-enhancing-lucid-dreaming-mask FUCK YES
I WORSHIPPED CHURCH WAY BEFORE IT WAS COOL TO WORSHIP HIM

/me hides under the chat
lunac1: Errr...

lunac1: YOu're way out of the loop, aren't you?

lunac1: Unfortunately, I cant remember the names - the computer we had them on burnded out when I was around 7 - also had Duck Tales game & a TMNT paint program
otakon: Shamroc: i dont know these things
So that trap card, Shizuka ...?
lunac1: yeah, Shizuka, DJNilla, LadyCanary off the top of my head.

Cypresswolf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_%28series%29 and http://spoonyexperiment.com/category/game-reviews/ultima-retrospective/
inb4

lunac1: you just darn incured shizus wrath! speaking bad about myst and its type

Aaand dat lag makse its prescense known
Woah!! How long as this been on the stream??? I was wondering how this game was! :o
Shramoc I dont; care I am entitled to my own opinion
lunac1: RUN YOU FOOL RUN! THE POOL NOODLE! BEWARE THE NOODLE!
RaveBrony: just came on.
amazing RaveBrony
RaveBrony: just started
otakon thanks but I;l be okay
otakon: lucid dreaming mask
best game ever RaveBrony
...okay, I have a major "dafuq" moment here...
Im curious about this game
lunac1: must have been the latter Ultima 5 or 6 - got me into Runes of Virtue :) still have 1 & 2 for game boy to this day
its the best
I saw it was only $2.50, and it looked Amazing! (the look of the game anyway) :P
so hey, do you need a good computer to run dear esther?
Bronysith: it won't work for me....I don't dream anymore.
because I was thinking about buying it
Ultima 1 for me purely for the blacksmith spaceshuttle :)
RaveBrony: but that is it! It just looks good.
I'm trying to buy a Minecraft gift code for a friend of mine, but when I go through the payment page, I get a message stating that they cannot currently accept registrations from Illinois...
otakon: but it lets your brain know you are dreaming.
otakon: so it will work
Everybody dun goof'd tonight.
hello good old buffer circle

evrypony , the sudio is the most important part of this whole game
Dear Escher... *buffer*
audio*
So what game is this then?
Darf14: yeah same here, SlurryMoon your stream is spitting on us it seems.
lunac1: Dear Esther
its amazing
back up on my end
/me watches the buffer circle
good mornin'
Hmm...
hello, Alchemist
good monring Alchemist
Hello, Alchemist
So no player interaction/gameplay just a narrative....
I hear things, but is anything suppose to happen on the screen?
Inb4 Slurry gets tired of the game :P
oh there we go :)
13myst minus myst
I can see a "dear esther" menu
Vordox I'm tired of it from it;s description
I can see the buffer channel
anypony know if you need a good computer to run this game?
...or not :(
13slurry should suddenly yell in a microphone to wake ponies up :3
Shizuka: is myst one of your fav games or something?
13it was only my first real game
13riven that is
Pudge you realy just need to be able to run hl2
which i cant
chugs on mine
Shizuka: nice. my first game was super mario 64 i think
Bronysith: same here
13never had a console
Batman Arkham Asylum was mi
its 5:25 am here. I couldnt sleep all night and eventually decided to get up...
ne
my first game ever was donkey kong country
13played a 360 once... hated it
Did you say something, Shizuka? http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/post/145372821 :3
First game was Spyro the Dragon
Shizuka: I think I broke my Uru game - got through Teledahn, teleported into the room with the 4 pillars - Relto book shows a grey void, is that normal?
13Cypresswolf: jump through the middle
PC gamers are so abused by the induxtry
Shizuka: well i loved my nintendo 64. only recently have i discovered the wonders of PC gaming
Is it buffereing for anyone here?
My first game was Super Mario World
^
Shizuka: game crashed when I did O_o
13might crash cause the bahro caves are notoriously crashy
13but as long as you grabbed or returned the pillar before you went, you're fine
05,15Dear Esther?
13that's a separate action which you'll catch when you log back in
00,03dem crashy caves~
so this game has no player interaction or choice making... how is this a game?
3huh, do any of you see anything on the screen?
SlurryMoon: only blinks of movement, not much else
11,01SlurryMoon streaming?
lol, i just lost connection to steam network..
05,15so...it's a visual novel?
SlurryMoon: i see your special folder
I see buffer
SlurryMoon: I just got something on the screen, no sound thoughh.
that a hard crashy game tehre :p
I see a strange wisp... it keeps going around and around and around...
And around
SlurryMoon: this is not a stream friendly game
fluttercry from what I can see yes
Polydunami: lol
13source usually isn't
yay
13takes some luck to get source to stream well
yay
And I just got buffer
/me 11,01sticks a stick in SlurryMoon and stirs him slowly.
13and since dear esther is haxing source engine to pieces to get its pretty visuals, probably heavier than usual
D
wth.. dat ninja YT link
ohai Tavros
3yeah, it's not actually showing up on the stream
How do you stream? I've half amind to stream for the ".U.K. shift".
3that's odd
3I'm playing it if you couldn't tell
it's worninkg on my end
I keep getting buffer
hI Dken2021
I see just the title and menu...
Completely frozen
Shizuka: also, the linking book in the wall outside the prison part, that links to the thing next to the gun - containing a Relto book and a scope - Is there someone in that room? saw what may have been a person holding a book, but stationary
dear esther screen for me
Did someone say Tavros ::::)
Lobster crates main menue
I can hear you playing but the stream video only shows the menu, very odd
/me noms on SlurryMoon s modems
11,01Dear Esther, you should fix your toilet. I feel it rain everytime it flushes. Sincerely, Nittany_Discord
3okay I was just spinning
3did you see me spinning?
Dear Esther screen and buffer with bits of sound for me
11,01I see a menu screen.
Nittany_Discord xD
13next to a telescope, that room had purpose in uru to d'ni singleplayer but not anymore
I think i'm behind

13now it's a way to get a sparklie and the DRC vest
/me noms on Nittany_Discord s rage over EA
All i see and hear is menu scren
I saw nothing... but the title screen changed pictures,,,
...
13and one of the prettier reltos, we need to be able to sunset like that
11,01Bronysith: Wut?
I saw a steam friend pop up
Nittany_Discord: i decided i wanted a huge meal
It's showing the Video menu for me right now

3well, I guess
Oh yeah, it's the HD version
SuperBrony64|AFK: oh right. it was "I loved my nintendo 64. only recently have i discovered the wonders of pc gaming"
8,6let's see if Slurry is better at this than Wrek
Polydunami HD?
Excuse me while I prepare for this scary/creepy game *shivers*

#vinylscratch?
Sorry

Darf14 this isn't creepy

Also, MahBoi777, I was here for about seven minutes already xD
MahBoi777: is best slowpoke
Also, dat controller setting :3
Polydunami: sorry, I'm trying to follow 3 chats at once >.<

11,01Yay Eversion.
Eversion is some kind of freaky platformer

11,01This is a fun game.
AttacktheAndalite: refresh
Like I said, this is the steam VERSION of Eversion. There's a free version out there somewhere.
AttacktheAndalite: it's working fine for me, though your ISP might be cutting you off
Polydunami: yeah, Newgrounds most likely
and now I got buffer
otakon: Nah, I still get internet. And the stream just came up, no sound though
Actually, no it was free first, then the stream.
music's nice and chippy
*steam

I WILL WIN!!!
Hilariously evil :3
I just need a perfect sneak headshot...
I'm still here. People have been bugging me. -_-
Dovah: you ALWAYS keep a seperate save from Dead Money since it's probably the toughest DLC of New Vegas even for a high level character.
Also, could I post the website for the free version?
otakon: oh dead money isnt that bad
kenne: yes yes it is
GODDAMMIT STREAM STOP LAGGIN!
what's dead money?

sudden mood change
NOW Comes the fun part of the game
Bue otak.... :(
What the hell was that!?
Nittany_Discord: well i dont have a gaming pc so it's kind of necessary if i wanna play some games
._.
DEMON HANDS
That hand scared the crap out of me
This game is all happy and cheery but...
You see
11,01Pudge: And pay twice to play online, or use Netflix?
11,01Xbox Live Gold is a rip-off.
Jump under it?
11,02stuck
The limb doesnt hurt you, the hand does
11,01I wish gaming consumers were smarter.
0,14=P
Nittany_Discord: actually funny story about netflix, i'm not using mine, i'm using the netflix of the guy i bought it off of :D
:P
Nittany_Discord: HAH implying intelligence?
Nittany_Discord: well. that is not happening most likely
11,01Stop paying publishers to rip them off.
11,02ded
and it's not really a rip off to me :S
troll hand

Ded
That hand really wants him
/me is a corporate sheep
00,03Baaaa~
/me noms on Scoot-Scootaloo s mutton
Nittany_Discord: it's all a matter of opinion, I like xbox live but i do recognize that steam is better
/me 11,01shears Scoot-Scootaloo and makes a coat out of his wool.
11,01It's not the quality of the service.
It's pretty good to me
cant sleep.... hands will get me :O
11,01It's having to pay for what you could get for free otherwise.
11,02This game scares me...
Nittany_Discord: paying for air?
^
11,01Because it doesn't cost that much to do P2P
This game really doesn't affect me that much anymore...
11,01Sony and Nintendo can offer it for free.
11,01Why not Microsoft?
Nittany_Discord: you have to understand, steam is very limited for me because I cant play most games
Because Microsoft
and nintendo's online service...TERRIBLE
What online service?
.....ok I can agree on that
THE CLAW :O
11,01Sony's is fine. Same architecture as XBL.
The CLAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW
11,01And Sony only charged premium for some things.
lol rage quit
Nittany_Discord: I'm not willing to pay 400 for a console
3:3
00,10dat super gift
... Umm, it's not supposed to close like that quite yet...
11,02:3
Slurry got a present. :3

Is your game glitched or something?
8,6that company does good translations of games
I heard sony's online doens't have that many people on it
:3
3welp, let's see...
3what should I play next...
also, creepy game is creepy
SlurryMoon: a dating sim?
Be back in a few. Shower yeah yeah. You know :P
11,01Pudge: You might spend more on the 360 than the PS3 in the end especially putting up with online fees that shouldn't be there.
SlurryMoon: did you only play womrs duin the free weekend? cause that would be coolf if we could play a game with ya
You mean The Sims: Dating?
WHY IS SAINTS ROW SUCH A BAD arse game that gets praise?
bucking IGN
3I know
Vordox IGN list?
Worms eh?
3I'd love to play worms, but it's only full screen as far as I know
Yeah.
Sadly.
8,6yeah, it is >.<
SlurryMoon...i got it to not goo full screen
I like that pony picture in the background lol
There's a way around it.
w00tl how Shamroc ?
3Worms: Reloaded
just alt tab out and resize your resolution...man instant non fullscreen
WAIT
But it's not a very good solution. >_>
You gonna play multiplayer Worms reloaded??!?! SlurryMoon !?
Did somepony ping me?
8,6that's a horrible solution actually
CeilingKirz: worked for me haha

Nittany_Discord: I know that, but as it is right now I cant afford a ps3
What Kirz said. It's a really bad way to do it.
we could at least try CeilingKirz god
Wait, never mind. My ping is the exact same as SlurryMoon's :$
/me sits on CeilingKirz
SlurryMoon: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1419479
The game minimizes when you click out of it.
Nittany_Discord: so at this point in time it's cheaper to have a 360, and it's only 10 bucks a month for live right now
So it'd be a bad solution.
11,01Still a rip-off.
Here, solution =P
Polydunami: That could be confusing
Vordox: Tried it.
It doesn't work.
Holy crap
It's been broken for months apparently.
xlive has been and still is $5 a month
... My ping only works when I click off the chat :(
And the guy who made the mod has been banned. >_>

SlurryMoon: YES
11,01Online play should be free. I don't care if they charge a premium for other stuff.
Sounds fine to me Slurry.
Nittany_Discord: what are you referin too?
11,01Xbox Live.
I love the cupacakes :P
oh

11,01How it's always charged for online play.
0,14gotta renew soon
Not like I'm doing anything else. I've been listening to "I'm Your Little Fluttershy" on loop for hours. :P
Nittany_Discord....yeah chargin MORE for the use of internet sounds like total BS dont it?

11,01Hunger is annoying me.
Nittany_Discord: hunger games?

@barbetos: hell no
they never bring a flashlight...
Where is this soundboard

Bronysith: /me nods
derp
sonicdude558 it's a ping when someone mention's a name or word
He's making good time for a guy who's been bed-ridden for that long
ok
in any given zombie setting , the concept of zombies is completely unknown , no zombie movies ever existed in those realities, the same aplies to common sense
oh dear...
CriticKitten he read the script. Its okay.
so many sleepy people
CriticKitten: ot to metion shot
Most people can't walk at all after that long of a timespan and....they're going to start getting up aren't they. XD
11,01That hospital went to hell.

take that .50cal
/me shuts up
um
I still like how his room went totally unattacked for that entire period
DAMN IT ZOEY you shot the pilot
Quick. Upload the helicopter lessons.
hey everypony, here's a question for you: if there were a zombie outbreak, and you knew that your chances of survival were slim pickins, would you fight to live, or would you just off yourself and spare the horrible pain of becoming undead?
Despite the only thing guarding it being a gurney
CriticKitten: there is an explanation for that later on.
Bronysith: he was a zombie francis I SHOT A AZOMBIE
Anyone know any words to ping to it?
Doctor_Whooves: I would live
CriticKitten: you find out why later
Doctor_Whooves, fight for my life
Doctor_Whooves: Fucking fight till the very end
....
Eqqq
Ewwwww
3LAAAWL
Not exactly dangerous zombies.....
3LAAAWL
Aaaand that is where I'd puke.
11,01Doctor_Whooves: Watch TV.
11,01:p
whoah
and slowly ride away on a bike
haha
Also this guy is really talented.
I got logic, reasonable, quick witted, situation handling, never panic personality
a zombie with no legs is gonna be dead slow
inb4 zombeh wife
Tagart!
He was in a hospital bed for weeks, got right up and starting walking, then poof, he can ride a bike too!
Shamroc: needs more explosive ammo
wut r we watching?
all live, nice. I dont know if I would put a bullet in my brain or continue on. depends on how bad the situation was
Q_Q
pony_9132 it would be dead weight
Vordox: they all say that
THE WALKING DEAD, AN AMC PRODUCTION
You are tearing me apart lisa!
AND THE FEELS
Stream, whyyyyy?
ALL THE FEELS
cratorkid: I AM that
depends on the kind of outbreak , if its the T-Virus , id dowhat wesker did
TrixieMuffins become a god?
is this real life?
yep
Denial
Depression
You know there's a distinct lack of walking dead in this show so far. Just the one girl who got headshot at the start, I think.
Acceptances
Courage
TrixieMuffins too bad you aren't immune to lava
Bronysith: when we can contain it and make a gameshow outa it?
Bronysith: We put together a chainsaw and a paddle and get a paddlesaw?
I wanna see this guy tote a shotgun and kick some undead ass.
CriticKitten: The one near the bicycle then?
Shamroc: well that too. but i mean just have em stumbling around, not fucking sprinting towards you
Doctor_Whooves: If I were trapped in a room with a single exit blocked by like 50 zombies with no one coming to help, I might take the bullet.
Vordox: That was more of a Crawling Dead.
well skinny dipping in a volcano would probably be way down on my to do list
OH CRAP
zombie in disquise

Oh shit

COMMON COURTESY
I fucking give up.
yay!
TheHoodyNinja probably pure coincidence, or maybe voice director wanted that way
/me 11,01hugs AttacktheAndalite

question: all this canned food is good for up to 3 year max. what happens when zeds are still around, and there's no one manufacturing the food? you either have to grow your own AMID ZOMBIES or die of hunger
CeilingKirz: yup
Tovler: brokeback mountain?
Kirz: You can't kill him with one shot. You'd have to doubletap, and he wouldn't give you a second shot.
Bronysith: nah, that movie is Bi. Also its A
TheHoodyNinja maybe the voice director heard of her last role
Tovler: but gay means homosexual. so what homosexual movie did you pick for B?
Tovler: Magic mike?
Tovler: Bi, huh? just like me! what about "I love you phillip morris?"
11,01Tovler: What are you on about?
Bronysith: I want to pick I <3 You Phillip Morris, but it's right smack in the middle of A and B.
a and b?

It's not nothing.
ab movie
It's NEVER nothing in a zombie flick, dude.

I've refreshed 20+ times on Chrome, restarted teh browser, cleared the cache and then it buffers for 10 minutes and when a piture does show up, it's a still and there's no sound.

VERY POWERFUL hard tool
Mine is a gun
What is..... dragoncon?
CriticKitten he's a big boy, he's armed with a shovel
or anything that can kill zombies
Firelight: biggest assembly of nerds on the planet
Guns requires ammo
You don't have enough bullets
Dken2021: He didn't look armed at the time.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M16a1m16a2m4m16a45wi.jpg my weapon of choice, only on semi-auto
bronysith: Lol then Fuck that.
not to mention the sound
Jspang1: you alerted the horde
HAHA, the Steel skewers can even CUT things
Take ALL the guns
Pierce brains, cut head, push, Blunt, Aoe swing, weight, force....<3
Bronysith: you stay away from crowded areas or find a silencer
My weapon of choice: Big purple Dildo From Saints row the third.
Firelight: lol
Firelight: id take that nocturen sword thank ya very much
Vordox: do you have a steel skewer?
Firelight: Happy brain hunting
TheHoodyNinja: Yes. But I can't use it :P
Lol
It's about 1.5 to 2 metres range
Spoiler alert...
Great for single target zombies.
melee weapon of choice- katana
aww, not separate ways, they weree just getting along
Jspang1: Too much blood, you get infected. :P
....
Vordox: ...true
Vordox: Alright, i guess im using the aluminum baseball bat next to my beed
gun Weapon of choice: The Grim Reaper from Call of Duty Black ops.
UNLESS Jspang1 ....You have a Hiroshi version

CeilingKirz: ...Fine. :P

CeilingKirz might need to feed her sugarcubes for more ammo
Actually id use a base cannon
Vordox: a banner?
a poster?
8,6I'd also have a flamethrower, but can't show that pic :3
Vordox: a poster?
Screamer in 3, 2............
You people... =P
seriously tho, if you have to use a gun, a semi-auto rifle would be the best way to go, you can pick them off at a distance or even close range, and theres no danger of wasting all your ammo going full-auto
05,15soooo. what's going on?

Vordox: to find and shoot his wife.
OH SHIT
Vordox: ventin steam man...gotta enjoy the little things
Waste of bullets.. And why would he do that? SEriou- thsi is why I dont watch this.
SOrry, didnt actually mean to spoil anything.
Jspang1: i prefer i pistol , extended magazines , lightweight , easy to run with , pistol ammo is easyer to find then rifle
Even though it's a good show.
Firelight: watch , youll see why soon enough
That poor zombie...
05,15crawler zombie is sad
Oh my god.......

fluttercry: I know right?
Trojan the Walking Dead, a series
i never saw this show, this is the first time ive seen it
Oh no. ._.
Just like a party college
oh thanks
it seems really good
Where's Laury?!
send glenn
Firelight: she is laury
I know.... XD
lol
:D
Just love saying it.
Seriously.. I mean.. We have guns...
isnt that the guys partner and wife?
^
FUCK
[SWAG]Haku: How come?
[SWAG]Haku: why?
damnit Firelight
If Zombies are eating everyone, why are there so many zombies?
:(
the zombies would rot
Thehoodninja: lul
FUS_RO_yay: because i kill all the zombies by then
Oh... well then..
There shouldnt be that many since evryone who would become a zombie would be zombie chow
May I join?
11,01They would decay within a year.
But hey Highschool of the Dead explains why they would never decompose.
get in the f*ckin house carl!!!!!
Lol
not to mention the actual weapons that are at our disposal
05,15Carl! Why aren't you inside!?
[SWAG]Haku: doont forget the fact that the zombies would rot away pretty quickly
sup everypony
how would they never decompose?
And then theres the weather
Chores? During a zombie invasion?!
Fuck you!
hey OohShiny
FUS_RO_yay: Wait, i never caught that part, when does they do that?
lali-h OohShiny
I would love to hear this.
hello OohShiny
In the Winter, Zombies will become stiff. In the Summer, theyll decompose faster
dat lack of gas
Goin' the the brony network... :'(
IIIII was born a ramblin man!
TheHoodyNinja: Its like episode 2 or 3, i believe they talk about something like that
damnit
I'm fine. I hope you may be fine too.
now i have to rewatch it
FUS_RO_yay: that show got cancelled, didnt it?
Zooooombiiiiies
dat magnum
her her ima cop give me stuff
also
its awesome how each episode of this is an hour long
zombies
beautiful gun
Anyone stoked for the Dick figures movie?
it's still human flesh, no matter what kind of virus is currently flowing through it. Flesh decays and rots.
i fucking love magnum revolvers
BUUG
also dat lag
walking dead?
A virus like the zombie one would only be able to effect more advanse brains
dead
TheHoodyNinja: I dont believe it was canceled, just had a very long break. Rumors are still flying though so no definite response yet.
*Random zombie popout in 3,2
dem flies
waste of a good carpet
is this walking dead?
Firelight: no spoilers
AMMO INSIDE
lul
05,15OohShiny yes
HE HAS A SHOTGUN
05,15Pills here!
GO GET IT DUMBASS
steal ALL the ammo
Cmon, go grab it man
Fus ro yay: season 3 of walking dead or my little pony?
05,15TheHoodyNinja he has a ton of ammo and guns.
or the cat
keys on the body?
05,15Ammo has weight
car*
APPLEJACK
Could never decide
fluttercry: never have too much ammo
Apple BLOOPLE
Dat Pony
Everypony excited for season 3?
fluttercry: Not in the video games!
also ammo has weight and not all ammo is good for any weapon (even shotgun shells)
11,01There's really zero prob of a real-life zombie outbreak.
A disease can only infect a certain number of creatures, because thats how it evolved. If it was created, then the amount of creatures it would infect would be even less
PONY!
:p
Deputy Fence Post!
that horse should have been eaten by now
05,15you can EASILY have too much ammo. Bullets weigh quite a bit
Nittany_Discord: damn
^
also, horse is not too good a zombie vehicle
it panics as soon as it smells one
ninjas*
leaves you to die
Horse is like "fuck dis shit, I was happy where I was"
horses are probobly the best way of mobility during an outbreak
life = Complete
There shouldnt even be a city any more; once the army got over run, the government would most likely just bomb the hell out of it
dem cars
Firelight but all the ISPs would be dead
I hope the horse has peoper horseshoes, trotting on concrete and stuff...
cratorkid: no theyre not they panic if they so much as catch a wiff of a zombie and leave you to die
.....not looking very safe there, bro
Dken2021: Oh... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
The forever traffic jam = the worst part of a zombie out break.
fluttercry: dont remind me.
05,15Because not only would there be zombies, but there would be total anarchy and looting
CLOP CLOP CLOP
How do I pm people?
Guys, Before we kill all of these zombies just reconsider that their is NO MORE Traffic jams!!!!
Jsut saying..
alerted the horde in 3... 2... 1...
TheHoodyNinja: right click their name on the chat bar on the right...then click open personal message
GET TO THA CHOPPA
click their names or type /msg "name" "message"
HoodyNinja, double click someone's name on the list on the right
zombie ponies confirmed!
There will always be traffic jams in huge things
Dat Buss
Highways arent made for the huge amount of people leaving
SHIT
fuuuu
idk why he doesnt steal that hummer, it was fucking armor plated
ok im here dude
Dumbass
is this the walking dead
yes
why yes it is
This is how I look like after waking up.
Jspang1: you dont know that , they could walk right past it and not notice, they dont need fuel like cars do , just let them graze by the side of the road , and there not as load as an engine
05,15Jspang1 probably doesn't have keys...or gas...
DAT TANK!
Oh yeah!
It's all comin' back
yea, horses not the best mobility, they're scared of everything
cratorkid: maybe...
He gets in dat tank..
....
but dosnt drive it..
oops..
cratorkid: i think a mountain bike might be better
>military has tanks and heavy weapons
>can't deal with zombie infestation
is there gona be a session 3
like river song says: "SPOILERS"
05,15...do you people have any idea how hard it is to drive tanks?
Firelight: for the love of god! stop tellin us what happens next!
I wonder if you can have zombie birds?
Jspang1: makes you use calories which mkes you eat more
05,15OH SHI_
dafuqa
Jspang1: it would be tiring
dat oh shit moment
FUUUUUUUUUUUU
I imagine it's very hot in those tanks
OH FUCK
05,15also, Firelight you spoil again and you're time banned
YOUVE ALERTED THE HORDE
BRAAAAAINS
holy shit
yikes. This is awkward
NOW the zombies starting running?
dat panic moment
Whatch.. he gets in tank
But dosn't drive it..
Firelight: dude...stop TELLIN US fore ya get banned
running zombies, it's always running zombies
god damnit, firelight
dead horse
this is when you use that magnum, and stick it in your mouth
A real badass would merely be pissed off at what's happening
aww poor horsey
horse is best distraction
No! Poor horse!
Horse is like "I HATE YOU"
Trap yourself... do that...
So long Rainbow Dahs
eaten pony is best pony
Firelight: because driving a tank is like riding a bike right? :D
dat crawl
It has oedals and everything
surrounded, crap
*pedals
That was a dumb place to go anyways.
/me puts the banhammer away

In a moment of panic, there is no such thing as a dumb place to go
ohai MakerDusk...back for more ircop stuff
DOUBLETAP THAT CORPSE NOW

since when is there a hatch on the underside of the tank?
TheHoodyNinja pretty quick, but meh
05,15oh god I'm trapped!

Shamroc: hopefully not
OH SHI-
And then that guy's a zombie
That is gona leave a mark

There shouldnt be that many!
because its a fuckin city
Anyone doing a playthrough of The Walking Dead Game?
But if everyone is getting eaten, then there shoudnt be any!
[SWAG]Haku: because friendship is viral :D
Starlight_Phoenix: someone, but i forgot who
Throw a humongus fucking rock and theyll go away long enough to run
see if the tank can move?

Made in Georgia, just like Archer
Wait
ohai SuperBrony64
And then there where no more episodes cause they hit the budget with that one episode!
Wow, how cruel.
Horses live to run. That horse must be grateful to that cop for the chance to run again.
i felt bad for the horse:(
What are they streaming?
i didnt
That horse is probably like "nope, was happier being alive"
but, zombie horsemen are badass
W8
YES PEISODE 2!
so there was game? odd
LET ME USE BATHROOM
Ep2
Let's go
3wait, are you all ready?

CriticKitten, the horse was tied up with nowhere to go. If that cop hadn't found it, it would've died of starvation all alone.
Wait
Yes
No
No.
Something's wrong with the screen capture, SlurryMoon
05,15ooo the walking dead game. is it any good?
I mean Yes
Ill watch this then go watch SSoHPKC's version after
fluttercry: It's VERY good
SlurryMoon: It's not centered
05,15I like point and click adventures
btw, what was that depressing platformer called?
To be honest, I didn't even want to get roped into this. I only watched because my mom got roped into it.
Dken2021: Eversion

Hello sonicdude558
There we go! Perfect SlurryMoon .^^
I logged into a ftp server at hp

Why even kill an attacking zombie? There's no need to actually kill it, especially since it's actually extremely hard to get a head shot IRL. It would be best just to immobolize one, like just break it's neck.
who be this?
wait was he here last time?
Nothing's playing on my end when I pressed the play button, and all I see is the loading screen
I'm massaging my body with an egg as a desperate attempt to get rid of my sadness.

The axe cut would have been jagged in real life anyways

WAT
WHEN DID HE TURN!
Whats with the video? Its kinda lags a bit.
PUNCH IT
dat scared me
in that world its not just bites that turn you
Ohgod
-_(\
What a moron!
and he FELL AGAIN
HE GOT SHOT!
Everyone in infected. You just got to die to turn.
wow they are horrible
MahBoi777: Stream buffers on my end and when I get a picture, it's a still and doesn't play at all. I deleted all my cookies, cleared my caches, and set the video storage to unlimited for Firefox and Chrome.
HE DID NOT GET BIT!
He didnt need to
WTF!
AttacktheAndalite: that sucks :S
The disease is air bourne now
Everyone is infected
They just have to die to turn
oh
...
MahBoi777: Tell me about it. It was working pefectly fine when Sumi was streaming DickJensen
....wooooah
PILLS HERE
AttacktheAndalite: that's strange
Yay, pills
She can't handle pills like Louis can
He has that conman look
lol
and sound
GRABBEN PILLZ
WalkerPony89: Louis is a pro
seems legit XD
seems legit
MahBoi777: Louis is a baws ^.^
i dont trust these people
dammit
I think ponies
You go anwyay
legit
But the real question is, does it seem MLG legit?
WalkerPony89: indeed XD
You know Slurrymoon.... There's one thing I'll say o you now...The comic is AMAZING, I took an interested in it after episode 1.... READ it if you want something good... :) And some characters in this video game ....wow... I'll just say that.
MahBoi777: It never started doing this until Slurry strarted straeming. Everyone in my apartment building/complex is more than likely sleeping so it's not full.
welp, kept looking at Eversion, consider me to be frightened to sleep
yaay
Vegan life
so the bite cant turn you
dying does
shoot em now , test that everyone comes back theory
AttacktheAndalite: Could be that your computer doesn't like mips.tv
lol
that means if you get bit you can survive
AttacktheAndalite: maybe it's just the stream
nice textures
like larry the asshole
Oh come on, Eversion isn't THAT scary... is it not? :S
Also, got sidetracked by the internet. Again.
Polydunami: Play it....
MahBoi777: I don't think so because the straem is working fine for everyone else. It seems to be doing this to just me.
and thhen a zombie jumps out of a bush
Polydunami: Trust me, it's BUCKING madness later parts.
yesh
dat flanking
STOP
I SEE YOU
Polydunami not that scary,, but still creepy when it devolved from happy and cute to depressing
AttacktheAndalite: It's choppy for me. I've also had a lot of problems with mips not working before
No, see, I've played the game. Not too scared by it...
Yeah it didn't matter if you chopped that guy's leg off or not. He would have been the zombie instead of that other guy
Polydunami: Then you don't have the right mindset
Hmm?
maneating rednecks ?
potential zombies?
AttacktheAndalite: hmmmm, could it be the embedded?
dem cuzzing
What do you mean, "right mindset"?
cussing
MARK
SHOOT HIM
he gonna get et
cel shaded game with the "F" word?Legit
MahBoi777: Not sure...
that's one way to deal with anger
loot!
Great shot if anything. :P

a tag
CrimsonPhoenix: are you a brony?
Well yeah, they made a FRICKING FORT

dafuq
13also is dawnguard on sale / even out?

I know, right? Why would you pick Skyrim for 50% off when you could get it already for 33% off, and it'll clearly be on sale later? >_>
13another dis
SuperBrony64: But...skyrim isn't a "game" =P
SuperBrony64: What's the price then, $30?
13Vordox: you're right, skyrim is a lifestyle
Deus Ex HR for 75% off was WAY better.
helo evry pony
11,02Xaiden: Yesh
Shizuka: Eyup
OH hai scottish-geeky
Shizuka: But I prefer my current lifestyle
hia OmegaMetroidBrony
SuperBrony64: Ehhh, I'd buy it, but my comp sucks so it would be pointless
i miss playing morrowind .. even if it was on xbox ..
Guess I'll just have to by a PS3 copy
wut
13hai trixie
11,02I already got Skyrim for 50% off when they originally had it at that price...I wanted MW3 for 50% off ;A;
hai Shizuka
You can get Morrowind on the comp. DOSbox emulator.... gotta ask my friend how
I'm legit disappointed by that. Would've bought HR at 75% off probably. But I HAVE Skyrim, so that sale means nothing. And I got it for cheaper than that, anyways. :/
/me is a sneky ninja and sneks up be hind Ponies47
i hate MW3
Oh i saw skyrim before, are they doing fifty percent off today?
In 30 minutes, yes.
yay
SuperBrony64: Get BF3:P
so how much is it?
> get new games from steam > keep playing LoL or doing other stuff
i'd much prefer skyrim at 50% off
At 50% off, it'd be....30 bucks.
MahBoi777: halo
hey scottish-geeky
11,02Is there a reason why Steam doesn't have Battlefield 3? O.O

SuperBrony64: ea doesnt like steam

Steam doesn't have BF3?
Damnit, we could've had Human Revolution for like 8 bucks. ;_;
Xaiden: its on origon...
MahBoi777: u here DeadPool is going to get his oune game
because ea is fucking retarted and they wanted to make a copy of steem and failed misribly
It's called Origin... it's like IE
Instead we get another meaningless Skyrim discount.

and I just can't hide it.
OmegaMetroidBrony, I don't really get it
O.O
Yeah, everything EA's made lately is Origin-only, SB. They want to force people to use it.
Tovlerone
Explorer has been around since forever
Which is precisely why I've just....not bought any EA games instead. Good marketing strategy, morons! :D

OmegaMetroidBrony, figured but that reason alone shouldn't really be the only cause for that picture to be relevent
starsong: Your face when the game was on sale earlier in the sale for the same price and probably would've been on sale on the last day too. :P
hi RainBowJack!
/me hugs RainBowJack
Bad Slurry!

I've never been able to play Skyrim. Don't have the PC requirements and I hear there's problems with the PS3 version
/me hugs MahBoi777

Wrek, ya here?
11,02I think I lost out on their super badge thingy on Steam...because I don't think I voted everyday on the Steam sale >>
Oh wait...he may be drunk
Not that it matters.
The badges are like points on Whose Line.
also guys
the best deals are always the packs
MahBoi777: blurrrg
Blargh
lol
gary's not a loser :(
Crimson: Assuming you want all those games. XD
when activision was actually relevent
lol
/me goes to bed "Zzzz"
and Square Enix pack is possibly the best
Crimson: Again, assuming you want all those games. XD
ohhh ouch
CriticKitten, Why wouldn't you?
A lot of 'em are games I'd never play.
good enough reason to open your mind and try them
My (squee) is a (squee) and (squee) with it's (squee) and (squee) (squee) I will (squee) (squee) (squee) with (squee) in the (squee) (squee) chocolate pudding (squee) (squee) so then it will have to process backwards (squee) -_-
Ponies47: raaaaw im a dino
I don't bother with packs unless they have at least two or three I really want.
*My computer
Since the packs are all full-priced game price tags.
Hitman is a VERY good series
as well as Deus EX
Thief is great ....as ...well
ok Square enix pack is for fans of stealth game
I've already made out with three games and a good amount of DLC for just over $20, I don't need twenty games (most of which I won't play). >.>
13video/audio is still good ja?
Did I miss the Rifftrax of Terminator 3 and 4?
and Sega pack is for nostalgic people
Yup.
13ja last week
both of them?
There's so many things going on in this movie... http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/4953/misaoobject.gif There There There There There There There There There There
13ja showed them thursday
:'(
CriticKitten, it's all in the money really
Crimson: Exactly, and I don't consider buying a twenty-game pack so I can have two of them a good deal. :p
whenever you would want to try something out of the blue BAM you got it and you didn't have to pay because you had a huge deal.
Skippy!
Must be Slippy's cousin.
like the price of one pack is the same price of one full game
you're saving shitton
....car in glove compartment....carception
Crimson: Only if you play all of those games.
it's an just in case reason
Crimson: Otherwise you're spending 40-50 extra bucks for one or two games you want and a bunch you don't. :P
never know maybe in the future someone would recommend it to you and then you'll sudenly have it
40 50 extra?
what?
no seriously what?
I miss WoW alittle bit...
The stuff in the packs that is the most desirable is usually on sale by itself for under 10 bucks.
>_>
You want small indie games?
what the fuck this isnt ponies
So if I want just that game, why spend 60 bucks when I can buy it for 10? :P
it's 50
50, then. 10 is still the better deal. :p
3just to let ya know, i'm getting a buffer, Shizu
I haven't touched WoW in a while, either. I'm pretty much just waiting for Mists of Pandaria. If my guess is correct, we have 62 days until it comes out.
13is still solid up here
I don't deny the packs are a good deal, but only if you like to play a wide variety of games and intend to play most or every game in the pack.
where are the fucking ponies
3okay, it's back
I guess I just love having a huge library just in case
If you're like me and only play a handful of games, once in a while, you buy what you want and that's it.
13i know that feel crimson~
Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5509/
13wish torchlight 2 would release .-.
why would you kick me:(
Shizu: Agreed.
oh yeah I gave you that right?
13jajaja <3
scottish-geeky: bad
I just noticed that this "wide-screen" movie is actually cropped
Ponies47: im sarry
13Tovler: it's a 640x480 viewport
134:3, the movie is more 16:10
pony_9695: Did you type 6 messages in 10 seconds?
scottish-geeky: IIt's kewl ^^
yay
Crimson: And that's cool, if you like playing a lot of games. I'm not that sort of guy though.
13Ponies47: he joined and immediately started complaining
Crimson: I like buying a handful of games and playing the everloving shit out of them for many many hours.
Shizuka: Pfffft. New comers sometimes *Rolls his eyes*
Amnesia, the Dark Descent?
13ikr
Or perhaps Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs?
CriticKitten, We're both in a different plane of opinion then
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5318/ the cute it burns
scottish-geeky, could've been worse
Crimson: Yar. For you, the packs are good. I'm just a different type of gamer. I'm perfectly happy with a smaller library of games I can juice for hours of fun at a time. Both are perfectly valid ways to game. There's never a wrong way. /)
scottish-geeky: did you see the rest of that set?
she could've had her actual color
Shizuka: eeeyup. When I first joined I didn't say anything about why there wasen't ponies on.
Alchemist: what u mean
Afternoon all.
....
Dat crescent wrench
Matt Damon is....the most bland man in the world.
What's going on around here?
13he is very square
scottish-geeky, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2869/
I just beat you in cuteness
13mike would make a good dj
Stay boring, my friends.
scottish-geeky: like this: http://derpy.me/gfh42
idunno, Matt Damon was pretty animated in Gerry
CrimsonPhoenix: dwaaa
Damon invented the bland acting face. Stewart is just failing to do it right.
scottish-geeky: and this: http://derpy.me/VzCYF
and the rest
XD
newbies general http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2961/
Alchemist: the Aj one look like shee chalingin me the Raity one eys are staring in to my soul
80 trillion Lyras *dies*
"You wanna come up and do an action scene or something?" Is that what they're calling it now?
13i liked damon in the ocean's series
Oceans Triliogy next week?
scottish-geeky: I think RD is more challenging than AJ http://derpy.me/m63DY
Oh don't get me wrong, Damon isn't too bad. My point was more that he's the only actor I know who manages to act with such a bland face and yet still does a decent job in the role. xD
Alchemist: lol
It's what I *think* Kristen Stewart is going for, and failing miserably at.
Alchemist: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2470/
Or she could just be stoned as hell every time a camera is focused on her. Hard to be sure.
CrimsonPhoenix: Them newcomers. Most of them are always whinning about wanting ponies. -_-
Yes they are
and i got lost in the internet
Tovler: Or just Twilight. Or the Snow White movie she singlehandedly ruined. :P
Dat number
Morning Bronystate! :$
hai MadSurge
Afternoon here.
RainBowJack: are you disturbed yet? http://derpy.me/XHZ-u
yep. She ruined Twilight, an otherwise good movie.
Shizuka stream, I see! <3
13ayup
Tovler: O u
Alxhemist : give me dat HUG!!!
Herman Cain?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3257/ Translator note: Keikaku means plan.
I wanta hug :(
CriticKitten: because that snow white movie wasn't doomed before she was cast :D
XD
CrimsonPhoenix: wait then why have the first 3 words in english?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5110/
MadSurge: They cast the queen well.
TheHoodyNenja, that's the joke
RainBowJack: sorry, all I have atm is this, but I give it with a discount :3 http://derpy.me/2UvXV
some translator of animes do that shit
like with kawaii
translator not: kawaii means cute
I would marrie this http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4615/
MadSurge: And the guy who plays Thor isn't too bad, either.
RainBowJack: What the Colledge kid hugging Pinkie Pie?
RainBowJack, not if I did it first
swag
Alchemist : i would like that hug too
I'll pirate Snow White eventually.
dat death cup
/me just hates grimdark revisitations
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3695/ just look at my swag
I mean, the original Snowhite was already dark enough :D
Dis sales pitch
That doesn't bother me since all white people look alike.
CrimsonPhoenix: swag is for boys class is for men
MadSurge: The normal Snow White story IS kind of dark, man. >_>
Who's Mark Wahlberg fighting?
CriticKitten: yep
lol
scottish-geeky, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/789/
HOW'D IT GET BURNED
CrimsonPhoenix: dat swag
CrimsonPhoenix: good

That WAS dumb.

Ponies47: u here that DedPool is geting a video game
13Vordox: Angel Beats!
13i haven't got that far in streaming it yet
MadSurge: Thats not how it works. They HAVE TO be badass.
13actually... no wait i did
No wait. Shizuka's right
Shizuka: THANK YOU! Oh youre streaming it? How far have you done?
MadSurge: its protocol
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5731/ <- Newcomers to #bronystate in a nutshell. They look at the stream for 5 seconds and then this is there reaction when there are no ponies on.
13ep 6 i think is where i left off a few weeks ago
Awesome Shizuka . I'll catch up on my freetime
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5499/ i would follow her

That's preposterous!
I need to finish Angel Beats and Mirai Nikki
Oooh...Angel Beats was good

Chrysalis: I never had any problem with mods streaming stuff that wasn't ponies :D
13more of a "about time they made one" amirite :3
:D
I've started watching Muv-Luv Alternative - Total Eclipse. Only 3 episodes are out so far, but it promises to be a great sci-fi mech series.
13Chrysalis: ja
yup
TheHoodyNenja: Ok then :P
13haibane is the purgatory one
Kammerjunk: :p
I still need to watch Haibane
poor Madeline
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3417/ agree on that AJ
Especially after watching Serial Experiments Lain. It looks like my kind of series.
13i couldn't get into lain
RainBowJack: lol

Ponies47: some crazy twi http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2850/

13wish they did 2 and 3... would be a fun week
Imperios: No really, go on.
and then its just another selfinsert clopfic
Nnnope
Bettah
silly TrixieMuffins. That's my job.
Dude sounds a bit like Bill Maher
The first part will be about Celestia's past.
=_=
Hey, Through the Eyes of Another Pony started as a self-insert.
13rawrity needs to bring me back to life in the next story :<
Ponies47: are you ded
so Celestia Past-fic #40058
13after heartlessly killing me off in my only scene :<
That is the first part
scottish-geeky: Nope.avi
what story?
Shizuka: Hey, i was originally not going to put you in at all.
but then everyone insisted I put shiz-vi in there somewhere.
There will be an enigmatic character called The Empress fighting against the random evil overlord (REO)
what story? :<
She gathers Elements of Harmony - THE ORIGINAL elements of harmony.
So who is this guy talking?
Ponies47: have you seen Gamer-Luna on latly
Celestia, Luna, Discord, Chrysalis and 2 other characters.
scottish-geeky: Not really
Ponies47: darn
They defeat him with pew friendship lalala
particularly, the three titled "Moderator"
ty
Imperios: Sure, I can buy that.
I have my own fic I'm slowly working on.
But then they realise elements are not safe, as the emrgies of the evil overlord tainted them...
cool
Celestia quickly hides hers, others... well...
Discord, NMM, Chrysalis.
It's about the "stars" that released Nightmare moon in the pilot.
13joooohn michael jingleheimer kane
hm , k , so alternate universe then
The second part is about ...
?
THE SAME THING HAPPENING TO THE MANE 6
Leee ta-daaaa
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE Queen Fluttershy of the changelings!
13they turned into redditors
13le
13lelelelelele
Imperios: nope
Discord Pie
Their plans for overthrowing Celestia having been thwarted, their leader, Nova, sends her servants to kidnap Celestia and imprison her, so as to take over Equestria herself and initiate the star that Nova controls into the new sun of equestria.
Ponies47: le hia
Nightmare Rarity
Who are the Patriots?
etc
this rifftrax isnt that good.
afk
And then new elements should be gathered
13so this is.... the assassin's creed identity then
needs more square head and smelly euro quips
if Trixie wont be in there to save the day , im not interested :P
Derpy, DJ, etc
Shizuka: is there templars involved?

Greetings from Italy
I got busted by my mom AGIAN. She told me to go to bed. BUCK THAT (Squee) :d
Ponies47: my mum dont give a buck
13sleep?
13was ist..
13sleep ist a myth..
im showing my cousin mlp
13sleep ist for ponies who do not already feel tired all the time
so, I'm loving having my own car.
lol attack poodles
Good news, people who enjoy bland EA FPS games! The new Medal of Honor will have a beta invite for Battlefield 4, so you'll get twice the mediocrity!
Soul: And what does he think? :3
I guess there is no rifftrax on The Hulk
/me isn't too fond of conspiracy/nonstop action movies
Ponies47 actually its a she, and she thinks its ok
13Tovler: you could look it up, i'm not sure if they have
lol, disembaudio
Soul: Oh ok then. :P
Like, today, I wanted to eat at Wendy's. So like, I just....DROVE there. No walking. No bus rides. Just...Point A - Point B
/me 13wonders if rain ist still awake
Shizu: I do feel tired all the time. I can never catch up on my sleep. So I just collapse when my body tells me to. :(
CriticKitten: Much as I hate to say it, maybe lay off the late night bronystating?
13i have been getting 8-10 hours for weeks but it is 4am-12pm so i still feel tired...
Neither Hulk has been riffed.
13stressful family gets home just as i am properly awake...
RAWRity: But, but, Shizustream. :(
13makes me go later und later until i start going to bed just before sunrise...
Wickerman reference
CriticKitten: sometimes, personal health takes precedence over rifftrax and nostalgic shows.
RAWRity: Blasphemy!
13health..?
13was ist..
It think its HP
Ponies47: if ur mom is mad you prob go to bed i dont want u in troble
ive always been a nightowl, my family always finds me on the couch with the TV on in the morning
Besides, I'm fine. I've been like this for as long as I can remember.
some times asleep, sometimes not :P
i have imsomnia :D
My body has this....thing where it insists on sleeping in, no matter when I go to bed.
I think that counts more as "functioning"
I work overnights, so this is my "daytime", despite it being dark out :P
Holy shit
/me 13ist just bipolar..
its late
i thought it was 10 O'clock
:p
scottish-geeky: She's all the way on the other side of the house! Plus I can't sleep at this time *Yawns* I really can't this early :p
RAWRity: Pft, I've never been healthy. :P
the only ttime i actually was affected was when i stayed up all night and all day when i was litte, i threw up
Im no better, Shizuka. dont feel bad :p

Ponies47: lols same here exept my mom dosent care rilly
/me 13pounces rain rain
RAWRity: But I'm not exactly sick or anything. I'm fine. Just perpetually sleepy, regardless of sleep cycle. :p
/me giggles and snuggles with Shizuka <3
Shizuka: So you're bipolar? :D
CriticKitten: Fairly certain that counts as chronic fatigue...
heh, bipolar bear
13as far as i know, never been officially diagnosed but there's a clear cycle that's been there for years now...
13and not THAT cycle... they sometimes line up sometimes now...
XD
RAWRity: Only if it's severe enough to hamper the body's function.
I know what you mean, Shizuka
13<3
RAWRity: I could still go outside and jog if I wanted, for example. I'm not actually sick. My body just likes to sleep.
my ex-gf was bipolar. Or at least, that was the diagnosis at the time. A little while after we broke up, her new doctor said she had Borderline Dissociative Identity Disorder.
Ponies47: i like pony
Me to :3
13i think DID is starting to get overdone...
Hell, I actually feel awake enough right now that I could do exercise. I really should be exercising more anyways. :P
CriticKitten: buy a treadmill for your house. Watch BS while jogging.
13i would ride around the neighborhood but it is far to hot und humid lately...
Body's just sleepy, is all. I've been this way since I was a kid. I'll go to sleep early, wake up mid-day. Go to sleep late, wake up mid-day. My body just KNOWS.
Shizuka, DID isnt getting overdone, people falsely claiming to have it is getting overdone
13ja that too
have you tried an alarm clock?
I use one when I need to go somewhere early in the morning. :P
Ponies47: u have enny pony stuf
13i use one when i need to be awake at a certain time... und even then i rely on my brain remembering OH I HAVE TO BE AWAKE RIGHT NOW when it goes off
13otherwise i just snooze it and go back to bed
ummm guys, does anyone knows Ian Corlett?
scottish-geeky: 2 pony T-shirts and a brony wristband :P
'sides, I'm apparently a lot like my mom. She's the same way. Odd sleep cycle, and achey. :P
I actually modded my alarm clock to disable the snooze button.
Ponies47: lukky i got a toy and thats it
So I'm already built like an old person, that'll make me the best old guy ever. I'll be beating kids up with my cane.
13CrimsonPhoenix: played cheetor and bob, forget if i heard him somewhere else

lol...woobat
scottish-geeky: get it yourself
RAWRity: Anyways, appreciate the concern, but I'm good. No need to worry. If I ever feel sick, believe me, I'll take it easy, I can be lazy like no one else. But I'm fine. Really.

Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4040/ if only MahBoi was here
Cats and dogs. They LOVE ME! :[
also, I have a friend whose dad has an Irish Wolfhound. That thing is nearly 4 feet tall
Although my kitty seems to be the exception usually. We're the best of buddies. He'll have conversations with me and snuggle and such. Only time he gets bossy is when it's time for food. XD
scottish-geeky: :P
Shizuka, i love your dogs >.<
I prefer smaller dogs, like Tibetan Terriers or Miniature Australian Shepherds (which my family has 2 of right now)
For referrence, this is your average Irish Wolfhound: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/IrishWolfhoundFrankBrendan.JPG

I hope to get a new computer this year ^^
I killed the chat :'(
I'm waiting until October to buy a new gaming laptop. This laptop will still be in use for drawing and general internet-y stuff, but I'm having a lot of problems trying to launch any Windows-based games on it.
:O
11,02Darn :/
My desktop is 9 years old. When I do get a new computer. Shoudl I get a Laptop or a Desktop?
BUNNY CLOSEUP
00,02SuperBrony64, need help
*should
11,02Nah, I got this :3
deskotp :P
00,02i see bunny
11,02It's time for my latest invention!
depends on what you plan on using it for Ponies47.
Internet, Steam, Stuff liek that :P
*like
I'd go for desktop then.
My dad says I should get a laptop so I can have it on the go. IDK if I shoudl or not. IDK if Steam and Steam games would work that good on a laptop :/
I've got a laptop, and so does Phase4.
00,02laptops are best
Mine plays TF2 and some other games quite well, especially since it's all stock parts.
Im on a lapp top atm but im not used to it it its very irretating
And since you can have them on the go, you can game anywhere when bored.
00,02i understand the 'it cant be upgraded' argument but in all practicality its more cost efficent to get a new machine every few years anyway
Intresting. Maybe I should go for a laptop then :p
There's some great laptops out there.
Although, you should carry a mouse you can plug into it.
00,02the portability is worth it
00,02and if the power ever drops, it has an intergrated ups :P
I'm actually looking at one right now that would rival my gaming desktop, and it costs about $600 less than my desktop did...lol
Yeah I'll have a mouse and mouse pad. Besides it's gonna be sitting on a desk as well and such. :p
But my parents are devorced so I could have my computer at either house whe nI wanted to :P
*when I
True, but what about when you go to the other house?
I love my laptops. My desktop can only be used when I'm in my room (which, granted, is fairly often with my current schedule), but whenever I'm out of the house or even my room, I have the laptop.
Microsoft Office 2013? Dear Microsoft, stop releasing more versions. It will only encourage pirating.
DashWithRainbows: Like right now or when I get my new computer?
Antipirating measures? More piracy.
Ponies47 The new one.
Why don't companies think.
Plus, the 3DS is already hacked.
DashWithRainbows: If it's laptop take it back over to the other parents house. If I get a desktop it stays at my moms whilw I use my dads desktop at his place. But then I don't have Steam and such
Then you see what I'm getting at. Look around for a good laptop if you plan on gaming with it.
Ponies47, I'd recommend the laptop. There's some real good ones that will last you a few years without needing any sort of upgrade (except for maybe RAM, which is still easy to upgrade on a laptop)
I was think laptop. And of coarse I'm gonna get a good one. It's not gonna be the cheapest one I see, It's got last. :)
If you're gonna be playing games through Steam, I personally suggest getting a gaming laptop from ASUS. I have one that has lasted me over 3 years (got it just before Windows 7 came out and got the free upgrade) and I'm just now starting to look for a new one.
11,02Stream is up :)
YAY
So.
Intresting
SuperBrony64: I see
What are you gonna play for us?

Ah.

YAY

Yea, I'm not good at those types of games, either.
Meanwhile: strategic? I suck too :D
None of my ideas ever seem to work.
Flank with a shotgun? Oh don't worry the enemy rocket launcher knew you'd do that and now your brains are scattered over the wall.
I swear the ai in this game is watching me plan.
is the music good at least? :D
Yea, give me any sort of mystery/puzzle solving game, instead :P

Good morning everybody

ohai Darkts3|Drawing|MLG!
MadSurge: Yeah, players don't need to stay in the game, you can make your turn send it and it'll hold it until your opponent is online, then they can do their move and so on.
hmm?
Like, I just played a move in a game but the guy I'm playing isn't online, so it'll let him know it's his move when he's around and I can come back to it later.
oo Crysis 2 has a sale :3
OOOH, it's like those guys who played chess through letters! :)
Yeah, exactly like that.
How many moves do you have per turn anyway?
As many as you have units.
Ah, okay! Like Tactics A2

Meh, I just turn the difficulty back down (unless you set it to that intentionally)
be a man... set the difficulty to max
alexxm: basic game starts at 2.0, if you do well you might be at 4.0 by the last level :D
/me flails wildly again, then bursts into flames
Sagittarius Bow is awesome for KI:U single player
ok MadSurge so whats kid icarus uprising about then
Midnight_Tempest: I'm trying to finish the levels at max :D
Yea, I'm pretty good at the game at the default difficulties, my default difficulty is getting up there on my first run.
Do any of you have the extra circle pad add-on?
alexxm: angel has to defeat a dark goddess and her army of ridiculous yet lethal monsters in a pseudo-greek pantheon :D
MadSurge is this the game eggplant wizards from?
Aight. I'm off the PC.
I'll be back on my iPod later, lol.
alexxm: Sure is
See ya'll later :>
thanks OtakuTom
bye XAX
alexxm: that was the first game, Kid Icarus :D
you people talk about odd games... <_< >_> im not a fan of anything Wii based... or nintendo anymore... not enough violence for me
alexxm: they're in Uprising too, but they're not as annoying as they used to be... try the Tempura Wizard :D
I'm too much of pussy. I like the lack of violent nintendo games.
Midnight_Tempest: not enough gore? :D
thanks MadSurge what do tempura wizards do?
MadSurge: exactly...
alexxm: if they hit you you become a defenseless fried shrimp, and then they try to catch you. Let them touch you, you're eaten, one hit kill.
nomnom tempura is delicious
sounds annoying
^
STREAM
:o
Tempura Attack is cheap in multiplayer
alexxm: they're a rare enemy though, and the spell wears off eventually
00,02not sure what do
I thought my game had randomly gained lyrics do it's soundtrack for a moment.
Meanwhile: :D
Phase4: Well, what /can/ you do?
00,02Meanwhile, anything realy
Phase4 is Jesus,
Well, can you stream games?
00,02XD

I guess you can keep the songs untranslated, but Jesus, can you at least translate the menus?
You'd think in a downloadable gaming world, we'd get more Japanese games.
the rocket from phase pony is crashing on the top of that box
Plus, things like CoD make people think that it won't sell well.
That's a lot of people in the Mikunopolis concert.
My computer isn't upgraded enough to play PSP games. UGH.
And that's like, a big failure. :I

Yay!
So, anyone mind telling me the point of this game/
:D DiCaprio pony
FUS_RO_yay: just follow the plot and do missions
MadSurge: Sounds semi-entertaining.
FUS_RO_yay: doing the standard FPS options is only one option
*routine
So it could be played completely stealth?
FUS_RO_yay: there's an achievement for no kills in the whole game
Kinda like MGS....
FUS_RO_yay: and a lot of non-lethal takedowns
Yup, sounds alot like MGS.
00,02what was takedown button?
00,02was Q
FUS_RO_yay: the original Deus Ex also had a lot of morality/faction options
MadSurge: What was its original console?
FUS_RO_yay: PC
Ah.
WOW
0.12 seaconds!?

Get breakfast where

Pfft, "If anyone's hiding there you better come out ?:I"

lol
ded
you'd think the cyborg would be able to take more damage
I imagine bullets are probably designed to compensate for augmentations.
good point there Meanwhile
Otherwise all the soldiers would be stuck in eternal fist-fights.
but you'd think the augmentions would learn to compensate for those special bullets then
FALCON PAWNCH
funicular
There's probably only so much armour padding you can put into cybernetic limbs before they stop being useful.
ded
hes a sneaky bastard we have to be on full allert (gets assasinated)

Could not tell.
Bollocks, I need to get to cleaning this place up.
Ohai Chocobunny :3
Brb, everyone.
RobertRevenge: Hai.

pretty interesting with all the conspiracies
this is...different
lolwut?

what a shame
dem shades
oooh

oh it is!
amnesia mlp xD
o_o
heavy's rapeface?
AdamTheDuck: my thoughts exactly
:D
THE EYES
I can't hear the stream.
thats just creepy
Who's streaming?
wrek i think
Dat heavy
Wrek: Get an emulator and play Super Mario Bros. It's bound to make you rage.
play DAY Z ARMODA
Wrek stream! <3
What the hell..
That guy..
Staring.
dat Michael Rosen
cs1888
The Twilight desktop seals the deal, it's Wrek
This must be Wrek. It's all in swedish.
Wrek: play Diablo 3 for teh lulz~ xD
Aww
Wrek... why were you looking up the world scout jamboree?
lol doom
Hey AttacktheAndalite!
Morning, MadSurge
Play Fallout.
did phase get fallout?
WAD
Error.
AttacktheAndalite: it's 3.40 PM for me, so good afternoon!
dat doom
I'm 12 and what is this????????
YAY DOOM2 :$
awwwwwwwwww yeahhhhhhhhhh
No, but seriously, what is this?
Holy crap, DOOM2!
Chocobunny: "You must be at least 13 years old to use PonyChat without parental supervision"
MadSurge: Well good evening for you~ It's 9:40 AM for me
Phase still streaming?
08,01does anyone here use rainbowdash.net?
Im singing the theme with nothing but loud "Doos".
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: nah wrek is
PonyNegZero: But it was a joke. ;_;
oh
Chocobunny: a dude in a forum got banned for a year for writing that for that exact reason
PonyNegZero: But this isn't a forum.
Chocobunny: what forum?
Chocobunny: the ToS of ponychat still requires you to be 13 or have parential supervision
Darkts3: Don't ask me, ask PonyNegZero.
/me 08,01sets mode +b on *!*@k546-17-06-988.bredband.comhem.se
08,01:P
is that a 1 year ban?
PonyNegZero: But I am not 12. It' a joke.
/me 08,01hugs Sylandest
BAN TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON
Chocobunny: I know, but that doesn't make it not funny still
08,01i didn't really ban him
08,01it was just a /me
of course
Which Doom is this? 1, 2 or Anthology?
im sorry, but what are you guys talking about?
RobertRevenge: 2, i believe
PonyNegZero: I thought it was funny. Now, let me ask you one thing: What the hell did you accomplish by being an ultimate buzzkill?
RobertRevenge: guessing it is Doom 2
Chocobunny: that was far from an ultimate buzzkill
I've never played the Doom games, but I've seen enough playthroughs...I'm about 99% sure that it's 2.
Back when you had to shoot the fuck out of anything that moved and you had to rely on medkits rather than hiding like a pansy :D
Yes, it's Doom 2
PonyNegZero: Whatever you are, you're a buzzkill. And the cure for buzzkills is the ignore button.
MadSurge: Back When FPS's were challenging
^
back when a man could carry more than 2 weapons :D
05and the cure for douchebags is bans
MadSurge: don't forget the running around like your pants are on fire to dodge 1001 fireballs
^
05both of you behave
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: exactly
MadSurge: I never hid in Doom 3, tbh. I played it the same way I played the first 3 games.
AdamTheDuck: ^
RobertRevenge: there was another way?
Wrek: It was him that got all serious about a small joke. -.-
dat water texture
so damn sexy
Dat Hell Knight death growl
08,01both of you, quit it
08,01end of.
MadSurge: My dad hid behind corners and tried to lure things to come out, rather than charging in somewhere and kicking ass while taking names.
Oh boy, time for mods!
dis music
08,01i need some eggs
su gud
08,01brb
I need to buy this. It looks really fun.
Dat pistol
RobertRevenge: well, clearly you don't run headfirst into enemies if you don't want to die.
Chocobunny: You can probably find an emulator of it.
Doom games did require some strategy
FPS + Strategy = Cool stuff
MadSurge: Well, I don't mean that I would just run up and chainsaw everything. But my father played a lot more cautiously than I did.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: as in, which enemy should I kill first?
Fuck that wall.
MadSurge: its more of, how should i kill these enemies
Chaingun = Love
RobertRevenge: exactly, only run into enemies with your BFG9000 :D
MadSurge: Exactly :D
hi everypony :)
RobertRevegne: Exactly. I just want to be a part of this conversation.
This is making me want to boot up DoomRL
Hey, Hrafn!
Hello
Night everypony, time to hit the hay.
Night AdamTheDuck
00,02and then i left my pc on all night to download
00,02gnight everyone
Night, Adam.
night Phase4!
Good Night Phase4 :)
teehee here its 4 pm
Chocobunny: If you want to try a Doom game, I recommend DoomRL if you like dungeon crawlers. It's pretty fun and the concept is the same.
Night, Phase.
'night Phase4.
Chocobunny: And it's free.
Night Phase4
Phase4: Good night :3
good night Phase4
08,01hahaha
Night Phase4.
08,01doomrl
Night Phase4!
08,01awesome
:)
08,01i wrote a roguelike in python
08,01RobertRevenge: ask whoever is streaming
Wrek: Do you mind if I link to the DoomRL website?
ELEMENTAL PAIN D:
there's just something about the graphics in old FPS games like this that makes me nauseous after a while :P
Hrafn: you should stick with ascii games, definitely
lol
08,01PonyNegZero: ha, no; i wrote it literally all in a weekend
08,01including a tile-based graphics engine
Hrafn: the continuous bobbing and strafing? :D
yeah, it's probably that
I remember when I was younger, and threw up after playing Duke Nukem 3D for too long :P
Duke Nukem 3D was a good Fps
Hrafn: Oh glob I loved DN3D
definitely
I wish they hadn't butchered the new Duke Nukem game :(
If Only Duke Nukem Forever was good
I haven't tried DN Forever, but I've heard it was sort of meh
RobertRevenge: the problem was they tried to make the perfect game, it cost them a good development
08,01my hands smell of lime still
08,01zomg
08,01i have to tell you why, actually
08,01this is the most amazing thing ever
08,01seriously
Do tell :)
08,01do this
08,01okay
08,01step 1: get yourself a pinapple
08,01step 2: get yourself a mango
In b4 gutter mind
08,01both these fruits must be ripe and sweet, or this won't work as well
08,01step 3: get yourself a lime
08,01step 4: cut up the pinapple and mango into chunks. slice the lime into wedges.
Silly Wrek, use the chaingun! :D
MadSurge: the Super Shotgun does more dmg faster
08,01step 5: squeeze th elime over the pinapple and mango
step 6: ??? step 7: profit!
08,01step 6: eat and ENJOY AN ORGASM OF FRUIT IN YOUR MOUTH
:D
08,01seriously, this is THE MOST AMAZING THIGN EVER
Okay, that sounds incredible
X3
this sounds amazing :o
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: but the chaingun is faster and stuns the enemies
You know what's also awesome
BARON OF HELL D:
08,01AttacktheAndalite: unfortunately, the choir of angels trumpeting in the background did not turn out on the photos
Whole lime, wedge, put in glass top with crushed ice, top off with rum, crush ice into lime and enjoy
Bye bye everypony.
I MUST TRY THIS...when I get some money, of course
Bye CrazyCherry
bye CrazyCherry

Morning, FairysHuff|Dizzy

I hate Barons of Hell, they waste too much ammo for their worth

Rage was fun, bit of a sudden ending but fun.
Sylandest *Snuggles*

/me strokes FairysHuff|Dizzy's mane to help with the dizzyness
There are 525 warnings in my code, should I be worried... nah....
Morning, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
Sylandest I wish you could do that for real ^_^
Rise of the traid
FairysHuff|Dizzy: If I was there, I would :)
Dumorimasoddaa: I hate this trend of games ending without a final boss :[
Bah
LOLDED
Lack of bosses isn't the issue
it is about the Gameplay silly
It's lack of closure. Rage kindo has a last boss any how
I've actually always disliked bosses :P
I dunno whats wrong with me. Maybe my meds backed up in my bodies system and just released at once.
I spy with my little eye... I can't see what that i.
*is
Chocobunny: Air?
No, that.
FairysHuff|Dizzy: maybe you should lie down
FairysHuff|Dizzy: are you resting or lying down? Don't want you stumbling about and possibly get hurt
Thing, right there.
A ninja?
*facepaw*
It's a ninja Chocobunny
I'm already in bed. Been in bed all day except to go to doctors.
/me fluffs FairysHuff|Dizzy's pillow and cuddles to keep them warm :)
What's with the cuddling.. o.o You guys cuddle everything.
Sylandest Heh ^_^ Thankyou

Chocobunny: that's nothing new for them
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG *Hugs*
Dat blue cardkey
i wonder if Wrek ever played Ghoul's Forest for Doom 2
I remember playing the original Quake back in 94 online. It was hard.
SO MANY PIG DEMONS
http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/video-game-memes-gaben-has-all-your-money.jpg
I'm pretty sure my mother is in this game.
UnFoundBug: that is so true
FairysHuff|Dizzy: I know for a fact that my father is >_>
FairysHuff|Dizzy: quake was fantastic
RobertRevenge heh
UnFoundBug: well played.
thanks
PonyNegZero That it was. I still have the demo disk from the PC Gamer magazine that came with a NineInchNails soundtrack
FairysHuff|Dizzy: I got a copy from my cousin.
And Type O Negative - Wolfmoon
05so yeh
05what to dooo
I like how DOOM gives you random messages begging you not to quit out. There's a charm to that.
00,10Rawwwr
Well Wrek, what do you want to do :)
Wrek, mind if I link the DoomRL website?
Hello Sumica
Wrek: have you ever tried to play nethack?
Kandarihu: I love games that do that "___ will be very sad if you go"s and "___ orders you to stay"
I think I shall pass out again for a while. Hopefully this dizziness will pass.
a Nethack stream , that would rock
FairysHuff|Dizzy: get better :)
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG Thanks
TrixieMuffins: but it would have to be narrated, or else nobody knows what's going on...
Take Care FairysHuff|AFK
FairysHuff|AFK: Don't die, dying is bad.
PonyNegZero: i know , hecould play the nethack song as well
TrixieMuffins: which one, there are a lot...
:O DOOM RPG?
MadSurge: YES <3
Even a fangame has more story than the real thing.
MadSurge: its been around for a while
PonyNegZero: Yet another stupid death
Good afternoon everypony :)
Good morning killerpony7733
This Doom Rpg was a very interesting concept
hi killerpony7733 :3
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I know, but I never saw it
TrixieMuffins: my favorite is "Yet Another Stupid Decade - NetHack Turns 20" by Rob Balder
Who's playing?
killerpony7733: Wrek
so, doom rpg? this is interesting. who made it?
Ah ty
00,10doom 2d?
Sumica: DoomRL
Doom: The Roguelike
Best part is, it's free <3
Is that staircase normally red or is it just stained with blood?
00,10red door is my bet
Kandarihu: It leads to either the Demon's Coliseum or the Demon's Court, special areas in the game.
Ah, I see.
well wedid have someone play Zork on here not too long ago , so .... yeah , we wannt nethack
05feck
Zork: You start at a house and have a critical decision. North? Or South?
Zork is the one where you can get eaten by a grue, right?
TrixieMuffins: when I get my magicbane, I scribble all over the floors~
Hrafn: you can also get killed in nethack by grues (instadeath)
PonyNegZero: Let me guess you played that game alot before?
i like to turn boulders ingo giant meatballs with stone to flesh and eat them
mornin' everypony

Rarity is better vs a lot of others, not just against the enemy hero
So it's a slapfight :D
WEEEEE
00,10cant even fall to death
^
nothing can kill the ponies
00,10Pyro can
alexxm: very not true statement if full of lies
^
00,10pyro damage is rather insane on the ponies
Sumica: so are heavys
00,10true but pyro tick is % based
Sumica: What about backburner pyros vs pony heroes?
Sumica: that's why pyro is awesome :D
brass beast has 600-650dps at point blank
assuming all the shots hit and whatnot
so are the ponies playable or just compeutor controled
whatever...not your problem
Silly Celestia :D
alexxm: playable

it keeps buffering for me too, but it's still there
05seems like my sounddriver died
00,10locked up wrek

and now it looks frozen
stupid 30 sec ads
:|||
adblock

use it then
it is good for you
I've been using it for ages, it's great :3
05yeh my sound driver died
00,10well then I recomend you learn to live with ads
yeah
00,10mips has alot of them.
but 30 second unskippable
is outrageous :(
you will not know what the latest product is anymore...but you might be able to live with that
btw, who made the bronystate banner?
00,10Personaly I am happy I dont have to see ads for midget dateing services
lol
never got one of those xD
00,10CSIMax did
they always try to sell my own products to me...or what I bought last week...maybe they classified me under dementia...
00,10She did a realy good job
yeah
05oi sumi
05any way i can reactivate my soudnriver?
the bronystate banner is so nice :3
00,10sup wrek
00,10oh was it VAC that died?
05no the whole driver
wrek....system control or whatever it is called in english
Hey everypony
00,10well you have two sound drivers now. VAC is one the other is what ever your computer sound ooutput is if you use stero mix or headset
start, control panel, system, hardware
00,10if it's vac you should have a controler in your start menu
Howdy y'all!
hi Everlasting_Joy
05ok
05got it wto work again
00,10ok cool

00,10yeah I wishe I knew about that restart option
00,10not when there was a power outage that caused every thing to spoil over night
05starting up again soon
you doing good Everlasting_Joy
hello Everlasting_Joy
i'd say make all new things.. but not if you guys have bad ingredients :/
Hi derpy_pony, and Darkts3|Drawing|MLG!
alexxm: Yeah, I'm doing good. I just woke up, so judgement of the day is not applicable yet.
05goan do liek this isntead
Wrek, what happened?
His sounddriver apparently died
i have no idea
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Ah.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG whats that mean?
alexxm: no sound im guessing
hmm?
what we watching?
oh brother where art thou?
00,10new things are already made but have to proff over night
ooooooh
Lawl. "Cuddly brony/nerd seeks female for companionship and good times, please apply within."
great movie
but i have to go to work :(
the mel brooks movie started like this
hmm Musicals for Prisons?
what is this?
They should never have gotten rid of chain gangs.
derpy_pony: :D That's a good point.
ponibas: could you tell me what this movie is before you leave?
this movie is interesting T^T
i guessed it was Oh Broter, where art thou
This movie is "O Brother, Where Art Thou"
I watched this in my college english class - I wrote an awesome essay regarding the music of this.
as it says on screen
I love this movie :D
k...some attempt at humour
00,10funy thing about movies that just start. they tend to say the title when they start
I gotta get me some Dapper Dan monies :P
Oh god, I remember this song from my childhood <3
i guessed by the pick axe sounds :D
spoiler rules, Sumica
this seems enjoyable :)
chicken thieves
poor chicken
looks like I missed the title
derpy_pony: O Brother where art thou
erm...
you are eaten by a manticore
Didn't expect to see this, but I'm o.k. with it.
lol, gunna watch this part before i go
I'm always amused when movies try to put the title somewhere inside the dialogue (doesn't count in some cases, such as most superhero movies or ones where the title is from where the movie takes place, like The Matrix)

i have a very odd feeling AgentKalim might be dead or missing
Quick_Thinker:Why do you think that?
Quick_Thinker: Or he has encountered life problems
I guess I have some time to mull things other about the GTA pack. The reason why I'm thinking twice about it is because I'm not the sort of person to play games as the bad guy. I probably won't enjoy it as much as others do.
red spy is in the base
don't buy Stronghold 3 on Steam today, its the most horrible and broken game I have ever played... (just warning because its on sale on steam)
Lil_B: Older stronghold games were better :)

T^T
Hi everypony :)

O-o
hei ^-^
Man, this is the third time I've seen that one scene
Lil_B: appearantly, you werent one of the unlucky bastard who pre-ordered sword of the stars 2
RAWRity: That's awesome
i still wanna murder paradox for that
killerpony7733 I played the hell out of Stronghold 1 as a kid, but 3... its so god awfully broken... and that "GOLD" in the title is an trick its just like before
The door is augmented
Lil_B: Stronghold 1 and crusader was the best of them
/me hugs AttacktheAndalite Waffles and valoreins|Drawing
Dark_Horst I heard that was broken too, but at least it got fixed... Stronghold 3 is still awful
Hey guys
RAWRity: That's so many levels of awesome
Im just going to say, Derpy is best pony :P
oooooooh surgery
hey
what are we watching?
hey derpy_pony!
Lil_B: fixed is a great word
did you guys here about the OUYA console being funded on Kickstarter in 8 hours
hugs to u too (>^3^)> MegaMoonShine
11,01Quick_Thinker: Think quickly!
DeadMau5: All ponies are equal, But people have preferences
FIRe
no questions about this, DeadMau5
whitesinnix: deas ex
Lil_B: it's still not done
GarrettBrony yes... but I doubt its usefullness
Thanks :D
some ponies are more equal than others, killerpony7733
np
Dark_Horst oh, what are the issues with it?
11,01Good job Quick_Thinker!
Lil_B its the chance for Ponie Fan games to get a console release
It was a hard choice
what game is this
what do i win :D
11,01Me!
yAY
derpy_pony: I see all ponies as equal due to unique traits, Everything comes down to preference and if you see yourself in them
11,01For 10 seconds.
what game is this
except rarity
tigher1001: Deus Ex
bug
Lil_B: the best thing is how the actual system requirements are at least three times as high as what'S written on the package. my system should have no trouble running it at all, but itÄs anything else than fluid. and it doesnt even have anti aliasing
05you can seel waht you dont need at the gastation sumi
big
just kidding
T^T
CHUG
who is recording?
Use kit fingy?
Lil_B: also, i've triied lowering the graphics, but do so much as touch a single slider, and it looks like crap
Hey Eulshy!
Hmm, so now I've seen this played by wrek, phase and now sumica
tigher1001: Streaming, But it's sumica
well Nittany_Discord for my only act self implode
HEy GarrettBrony

you can't deny the truth. not even in the name of tolerance, killerpony7733.
thx
Lil_B: oh, and they release patches like very other week. i still see no prgoress
last time these fuckers got any money from me
they make ea look like saints with that stunt
who in here wants to mess with future archeologist?
Twilight: Most likely to succeed
Dark_Horst same with Stronghold 3, but the Grafics are even at highest settings awful (it just isn't well deigned) the music are reused songs from Stronghold 1
Illegal stuff
Fluttershy: Most
now Dark anger is not needed just say you want be buying thier products and make a firm clam collective comment and it works much better
Hey ponies
I'm back
Friendly
hey Very_Silly_Filly
So many tramps
sup Very_Silly_Filly
derpy_pony: Uhuh? can't change my mind on that, All ponies are equal no one is the best. It always comes down to if you can relate to certain ponies :P
Rainbow Dash: Most popular
Ohai Very_Silly_Filly :)
Very_Silly_Filly correction Cyborg Tramps. ya know cause its Deus Ex
punk sent me
i can relate to Twi and apparently in Fluttershys well shyness
Dark_Horst it takes forever to load, nothing is balanced, its slow, but only because they made the animation and generally movment slow... they patched it so everything is faster now...
Quick_Thinker: same here
killerpony7733: and who can relate to background ponies like rainbow dash?
AppleJack: Most dependable, Most athletic
hehehe
Dogmentation
your plan is genuis
Screw Copyright I have Creative Commons
I'd kill him for that
Lil_B: and the people who sell us that garbage suddenly wonder why their games get downloaded
must copy right my name before its too late
Rarity: Most beautiful
derpy_pony: RD is loyalty in her element and she values friendship and never wants to fail her friends?
Pinkie Pie : Most Outgoing
/me writes down a cop write for his name and is told to wait a month until approval
/me a month passes
CHANGE YA GOT CHANGE-
aj does this job better anyway, killerpony7733
I recognise that VA
WOOT! I bred a good Woobat. Now to train it.
^ waht?
derpy_pony: If you look deep enough, You can always figure out the weakness by knowing their element
wait this is Detroit? Where the Heck is Robocop?
Dark_Horst I paid 45€ for that and all I got was a broken game and a copy of Stronghold 1 in english (not cruseiders, only the regular version)
^ waht?
My element is blowing the living shit out of people with lots of guns :3
Hi
not a very kind elemnent is it?
Very_Silly_Filly in da hood?
Tovler: Your woobat can say hello to my leipard
Adam Jensen sounds kinda like Rorschach
Hi Lunaiscute :)
mine is intellect apparently
Lil_B: Noe, in mah hows!
so thats a plus
At some point in the show the mane6's characteristics got blurry and I think its a good thing. It gives them more complexity and depth.
Very_Silly_Filly is in da house tonight
:) this is great already even though i dont know what it is
hello everypony
hello
hey BronyInstrumental
Lunaiscute: You mean the game? It's Deus Ex :)
Eulshy: It's already lv18. Watch out
hey Eulshy doesn't Adam Jensen kinda sound like RorsShach
hi BronyInstrumental
i'm trying to make a desktop pony of my OC but idk what program to use to make sprites....any ideas?
derpy_pony: What? seriously? AJ is honesty which makes her blunt and a good person of advice, Her weakness is if she is forced to lie
Oh its a game lol 6_9
Oh, hey xxMoopyxx and BronyInstrumental
Tovler: mines level 48
eeyup
oh my Celestia there is a game called DEFCON everypony DESTROY WOPR
Alchemist: Exactly, Every mane six and some background pony has unique traits and usually a way to relate to them
mmm Whopper
GarrettBrony: WOPR?
aw fuck, A Tangrowth! Fly away!!!
yep
MMM Double Whoppa
get to the WOPR!
well killer there is one element almost no normal human can relate to Twilights Magic
true story
i wish i could but well its near impossible to use it
*raises glass*
however we cant acess all of our brains so who knows
Quick_Thinker: except Friendship is Magic. so if A human expresses friendship to his fellow man. he is magical
Quick_Thinker: Actually, If you noticed what it's meant to relate to is a friend who clues a group of friends together rather then just *magic*
08,01Quick_Thinker: if we can't use all of our brains, would you be happy for part of yours to be cut out?
no
friendship= magic
woah! no violence!
we may unlock it one day
08,01then i think maybe you don't believe that we don't use all of our brains.
DERPYS DERPYS EVERYWHERE ON EBAY
lolol. My Woobat is evolving
^ what are you talking about
Woobat evolved into Quagsire
killerpony7733: well Im not really talking about unique traits but that the traits they have are not absolute. If they had traits they'd adhere to no matter what the show would get 100% predictable quite fast.
CrimsonPhoenix: they popped up on taobao a while ago
Your phone loves you
man your popular Sumica i never get this many calls i only get death threat and hate messages from school
Sumica being Arsehole Jensen?
Use a nuck

banana phone is calling
Ähm
Phones don't care GarrettBrony, they have no souls
derpy_pony, do they still sell them?
of course i have three of them!!!
Alchemist: Yeah sure, I mean i for one can relate to RD due to loyalty. Gah i really wish i was in my discussion mood today,
Eulshy except the Police Box Telephones.

GarrettBrony, they also have no souls, they are jsut less private

-.-
I saw 1 second of that new song
Stop pinging sumica guys hes gonna get mad if he does just saying though
Considering he''s been doing it over the course of the last 30 mins
Ping him in a message about not pinging him.
xxMoopyxx: >.>
xxMoopyxx: Hypocrite
Not sure if trolling or dim.
to see if it was live
Moopy is a troll
Not really
spoiling a non-serial series. *shrugs*
what is the main object of this game 6_9
i am not a troll be quite
Jensen
Is
HACKA
so Sumica what kind of build is your character like a stealth like hacker or something?
/me quites
Quick_Thinker: Strait up fighter
thats the password to my luggages
straight*
Meanwhile: moopy never tabs nicks so dim would be the answer
1: Rob people. 2: Get their credits. 3: Spend credits on aug kits. 4: Profit
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Makes sense.
run and gun huh i like it
Sumica: Take the stun gun and sell it
Quick_Thinker, he hasn't been ranking his hacking skill.
stun gun
How does one "ping"?
*Cans.wave*
TORB:
take stun gun and sell it
TORB like this
TORB: when you say their name
TORB
Ah.
TORB: Type enough of their name and tab then it auto completes
Dance pony dance
So... Sumica.
Und dann TORB got all the pings.
How do you make your inventory bigger?
...Und dann he was dim.
TORB: only talk with him if you have something to say
sleeping woona reminds me that i should sleep now...
nice
Meanwhile: ze pings
Just seeing if I did it right.
Torgo Jensen ish best Jensen
really
Meanwhile: Heyup, Meanwhile
baii everypony :)
bai
Um... that failed
Bye.
that excuse has been used alreasy
Bye valoreins|Drawing
GarrettBrony when was jenson torgo
by meeee
It ish Jensen,
Not Jenson Button
Eulshy, I didn't do it 1000 times, though.
is Sumi still doing Dick Jensen?
Sumica does Jensen Like wearing sunglasses at night so he can keep track of the visions in his eyes?
i think so
rockytoppie85, it's more of a story-based game. The main object isn't clear until the end. And even then, it can vary widely based on how you play.
hey everypony i have some strange news i got my dad to watch an episode of MLP FIM while played games and he said he hated it but when i went to sleep i heard the theme play again down stair so i think he like is :D
At night.
Quick_Thinker: good for you
LAWL Quick_Thinker XD
At niiiight!
lol
Sell stun gun, get money
Quick_Thinker: The conversion has begun!
Kandarihu: So basicly its very comfusing?
Disregard machine pistol, aquire credits.
i know just have to do the steps right
I never found this guy. Where is he?
A shotgun is always handy sumi
Quick_Thinker: That was actually kinda how I felt when first watching it
05its crap
Sumica: Nah SMG is eh tbh AR gets further then SMG
i'd try to make my dad into a brony, but so far he's sorta a troll and i try not to bring him to pony stuff
Sumica, where is that guy on the map?
Lets go rob more people!!!
GTA is 75% off today :d
Dark my dad made fun of me for watching it and now i think i got him to like it just power through the hate and it will pay off
No. It's just something where the story dictates where you go and what you do. And how you handle the dialog trees affects the story.
I'll have to look next time I play.
Hey sumica need a dispencer here!
Since when do stun guns shoot darts?
-_(\
Sumica: But as wrek told you upgrade the AR as much as possible get laser pointer for pin point accuracy and everything else to make it a walking death cannon
PIlls here!
Eulshy in the future
Kandarihu dont you mean Dialog Fluttershys Dictate the Story line
I'm out. Bye, peeps.
bye TORB
Bye, TORB :)
bye TORB
GarrettBrony, lol.
Sumica: Trust me laser pointer makes 1 shot headshots super easy

Angel

eeyup
Oohhh, Angel
00,03That's why my ping is too annoying~
I found a game called rapelay. How creative
Scoot-Scootaloo: Word.

aww yeah its bacon time
Sumica: Uh as i can't remember which try checking those you can
Scoot-Scootaloo: but it is always bacon time...
hey sumica whats that dudes name when he was changing his name?
Not even trash in those cans
00,03Yes... yes it is.
rockytoppie85, he doesn't use the same IRC client as the one on the site.
okay
Sumica In Soveit Equestria Pings Kick You
Say what you want about the city but thet certainly empty their trash cans
Sumica: I know the 2nd trader is in one of the alleyway apartments
mIRC supports custom ping sounds. Oh, how I abused that when I used that program.

Quick_Thinker: has your palm passed through your head yet?
Nuke?
Quick_Thinker: It's that bad?
yep
Quick_Thinker: I fasedesked so hard it went through the floor
Why you no nuke them?
they are so uneducated and look at the strange thing of the fanbase like cloppers and people who live at home
is Sumica trying to acsess the WOPR?
dat phone ring
Pennsylvania? Was howard stern interviewing bronies at Anthrocon?
TLDR
who is streaming
sumica is
cow334: Sumi
they say we need a celebratiy front when we have Tara and others
ahh okay thanks ponibas
Nuke them
question Sumica , is the slight jumpyness everynow and then cause of game resource intensity while streaming
cow334: Tab fail. :P

Ponies47: I know i just failed

hello cratorkid

Sumica Were we complaining I'm Sorry :(
he and Robin came off as an old racist grandparents. I was just like "aw, they don't know any better"
Build a barracade if cardboard
otakon has a really poor connection. I have a really good connection.
Sumica: The 6 messages in under 10 seconds thing?, I just start waiting to type when i know i'm around 3 or 4
Wall safe
Rob it
pay me no mind Sumica my router must need to be reset
Oh god...
Slow worm plus nukes?
If thats a level two, i would hate to see a level 5
Eulshy: He has no stop worms
how hard is this puzzle
Interestingly, both otakon and I are in the USA. I tried using a website to trace the location of mips.tv and it says it's in the Netherlands. But not in any city that speedtest.net has nodes in.
okay does any one know the adress of howard stern cause im gonna go love and tolerate him to the moon
I'm bored. I'm gonna test the kick thingy
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels,
door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles.
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings.
these are a few of my favorite things.
Woooh

. . . .
cow334, he's bigoted against augs, I guess.
Spam 100% detection
Sumica: Could try blitz gacking it like fortifying things quick and capturing just as quick
and howard stern is love tolerated to not just the moon but to jupiters moon
Kandarihu: aah okay then thanks
Hey sumica you should ask the person to get kicked ask him say hey whats the shape of italty a kick
Tovler: I think it kicks you as soon as you press "enter" to send your 6th message
hacking-*
Box full of playboy.
you got 1 nuke
Quick_Thinker: Which one?
all of them
Quick_Thinker: Great idea, we cut him up into pieces and send those pieces!
Howard has never tolerated anything ever

Nice hack

The guy that runs the landmine museum?
people who realy wanna keep something hidden
Pretty

Chocobunny, someone who probably expects enemies to come to their apartment more than he himself would.
Unnr|Work: I heard that the landmine museum is really blowing up in the media.

landmine musuem is best musuem

Shotgun shells sweet
Chocobunny: Ba dum tshh :D
We need a pony museum.

MegaMoonShine: the controls feel strange on pc. cant wait to start warrior within
i final beat Mario 64 after 11 years when i had it as a kid
Bronysith: Of course it was, not everyone pirated it
Bronysith: and? did you like it?
Bronysith: i have a physical copy of it on PS2 but it's old now (the PS2 not the game) so it goes really slowly
Alchemist: it was one of my fav games of all time
:P
BronyInstrumental: it was nostalgia playing it man
I still haven't beat SM64 and I owned the original and DS version
Quick_Thinker was it as good as it was back then
I have rogue galaxy as physical, and Robot wars, both pretty amazing games
when i was 9 i played it for the first time
Also Dragon quest 8
when i was 11 i first played it
I played Mario 64 at 2 years old
I was older than that (maybe 16-17) but i loved the story and the gameplay as well.
I played Quake 3 at the age of 4 :3
yes alexxm i had one great memory of the underwater level and had a flashback to my childhood i cried nostalic tears
Quick_Thinker: Burn. That. Underwater. Level.
100 coins was a rape victim to do
why
It's been like 5 years since I last played a 2D mario game
at 2 years old i was in Belgium, the most underdeveloped country existing
BronyInstrumental: More undeveloped than Africa?
palyed a 2d mario game 3 weeks ago
Very_Silly_Filly: perhaps, idk never been to africa :P
Hookers, no one understands em
Tabitha St. Germaine made Swaziland sound pretty cool.

Stack More Boxes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MadSurge: Are you sliding out of your chair?
/me realizes that Crysis hates my Computer

MegaMoonShine: nope, just sliding all over the place :D

Alchemist yeah
Eulshy:^
alexxm: have you tried Mirror's Edge? :)
Go to manhole!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
two crates
good point Alchemist
check that manhole
Eulshy: best plan :D
alexxm: though I think it's the only game in that style.
Might be some crates in that manhole
ಠ_ಠ
How would they get cube crates through a circle?
Eulshy: They just can
Eulshy: f*ck logic, brute force ftw.
brute force solves everything
veen realtionship issues

05sumi: all you need are 2 squre boxes and you can stack high enough to jump over the fence between the electrofloor buildign and the police station
Sumica u can go there through manhole!!

Chocolate cheese with bacon bits sounds awesome!

Sumica: What did I tell you about smoking that gange?
I have a weird imagination when it comes to food :)
Cypresswolf: When you are really hungry, I can agree
Sumica: Honestly just remove the energy jar thing
Cypresswolf make that happen
Cypresswolf: Deep fried chocolate cheese with bacon bits sounds ever more delicious:P
Sumica: You get more energy bars to make up for it later
SirGanjalf: Yes! ^_^
alexxm: you got it!
SirGanjalf: That needs to be made!
Chocolate and cheese would conflict
And taste of pootis
Very_Silly_Filly: I make experimental recipes all the time :)
Sumica: Rearrange room
thats what she said
eat all the drugs
Cypresswolf: Have you ever mixed Melon juice, blackcurrent juice and orange juce?
Very_Silly_Filly: What about cheesecake?
SirGanjalf: Depends, I can stand plain
Maybe a cross bow gun?
One bolt, use it wisely
Sumica: To avoid having it around all the time, Give it to that girl
If you're gonna say it contains choccy and cheese
You'll end up never using it xD
I like every type of cheesecake:)
I bet the cheese is flavoured, and made sweet
Yeah, but Abra's already sitting here, Eulshy
I don't really like food
why can't you use a normal gun for this again
Just cake and pizza. I hate my stomach
Very_Silly_Filly: no, havent thought of that - I have mixed peanut butter, that canned cheese whiz, chocolate syrup, and Blue Bell vanilla ice cream before - :) Turned out tasty - to me anyways
Tovler: You obviously don't understand the complexity of dunsparce
Sumica: Darn
"I didn't ask for this"
Cypresswolf: It tastes really wierd, but taste buds are different
:[Dammit, this discussion makes me hungry
I don't eat much all day at all
Very_Silly_Filly: turns out some people (brother) wont eat it if you tell them whats in it
brb, gonna get some noms
Cypresswolf: I was dared to eat a whole jar of bathsalts, I didn't know they were bathsalts
They were like "Eat this"
Eulshy: Isn't that why I'm going for Abra first?
Where is everypony from? :3
Tovler: Just remember Dunsparce

Everyone's face looked really wierd for the rest of that day
HerpDerp: Denmark, Though born in greenland

I remember when Best Buy made a point to show that to employees to tell them of what NOT to do.
did they really do that
Kinda. They only showed a short clip of it
They tried to make big news interesting with gimmicks that are supposed to be funny.
But I digress, it was better than most other jobs I have had.
did it pay well
It reminds of me trying to sell my parents on getting me a Super Nintendo
