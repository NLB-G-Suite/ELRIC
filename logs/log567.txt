Hey Saturn!
Hai Saturn~ *huggles*
/me hugs dat Saturn back "How are you, hubby?" <3
08,01it was just a /me
of course
Which Doom is this? 1, 2 or Anthology?
I've never played the Doom games, but I've seen enough playthroughs...I'm about 99% sure that it's 2.
Back when you had to shoot the fuck out of anything that moved and you had to rely on medkits rather than hiding like a pansy :D
Yes, it's Doom 2
^
back when a man could carry more than 2 weapons :D
05and the cure for douchebags is bans
^
05both of you behave
08,01both of you, quit it
08,01end of.
Oh boy, time for mods!
dis music
08,01i need some eggs
su gud
08,01brb
I need to buy this. It looks really fun.
Dat pistol
Doom games did require some strategy
Fuck that wall.
hi everypony :)
RobertRevegne: Exactly. I just want to be a part of this conversation.
This is making me want to boot up DoomRL
Hello
Night everypony, time to hit the hay.
00,02gnight everyone
teehee here its 4 pm
08,01hahaha
08,01doomrl
08,01awesome
:)
Saturn: Can I link to the website?
08,01i wrote a roguelike in python
08,01RobertRevenge: ask whoever is streaming
Saturn: does it come anywhere close to Nethack?
ELEMENTAL PAIN D:
there's just something about the graphics in old FPS games like this that makes me nauseous after a while :P
lol
08,01PonyNegZero: ha, no; i wrote it literally all in a weekend
08,01including a tile-based graphics engine
Saturn: I guessed as much
yeah, it's probably that
definitely
08,01zomg
08,01i have to tell you why, actually
08,01this is the most amazing thing ever
08,01seriously
Do tell :)
08,01do this
08,01okay
08,01step 1: get yourself a pinapple
08,01step 2: get yourself a mango
In b4 gutter mind
08,01step 5: squeeze th elime over the pinapple and mango
:D
08,01seriously, this is THE MOST AMAZING THIGN EVER
X3
You know what's also awesome
08,01AttacktheAndalite: unfortunately, the choir of angels trumpeting in the background did not turn out on the photos
Saturn: Awww
Bye bye everypony.
I MUST TRY THIS...when I get some money, of course
Saturn hallo
Saturn How are you?
08,01limey
Say, did anyone find Rage to be fun at all?
/me strokes FairysHuff|Dizzy's mane to help with the dizzyness
There are 525 warnings in my code, should I be worried... nah....
Rise of the traid
Bah
LOLDED
Lack of bosses isn't the issue
it is about the Gameplay silly
It's lack of closure. Rage kindo has a last boss any how
I've actually always disliked bosses :P
I dunno whats wrong with me. Maybe my meds backed up in my bodies system and just released at once.
*is
No, that.
Thing, right there.
*facepaw*
What's with the cuddling.. o.o You guys cuddle everything.

I like how DOOM gives you random messages begging you not to quit out. There's a charm to that.
00,10Rawwwr

Even a fangame has more story than the real thing.
Good afternoon everypony :)

Lawl. "Cuddly brony/nerd seeks female for companionship and good times, please apply within."
great movie

hmm Musicals for Prisons?
They should never have gotten rid of chain gangs.
this movie is interesting T^T
as it says on screen
k...some attempt at humour
00,10funy thing about movies that just start. they tend to say the title when they start
this seems enjoyable :)
looks like I missed the title
erm...
you are eaten by a manticore
Didn't expect to see this, but I'm o.k. with it.
lol, gunna watch this part before i go
I'm always amused when movies try to put the title somewhere inside the dialogue (doesn't count in some cases, such as most superhero movies or ones where the title is from where the movie takes place, like The Matrix)
What's this movie about? I've never seen it?
rofl
cya!
:D
lol
idiot xD
that went well :P
I know the leader...had a main role before
And they say democracy works.
