From "Not the bees!" to "Not the gold!".
Atlantis did it just sucked

W-Whaoh, they have the credits going for each character and animator XP
Bye CrazyHippie :)
Even though I missed the half unfortunatly.
11,01Not a paradox.
what now?
Nittany_Discord: still, at least it kept us more entertained than "The Wrath of God"
11,01Irish_Pony: Yep.
11,01That's true.
I started a new char in SW:TOR and the voice actress sounded familiar. It was Jenifer Hale (Female Shepard) very happy
And the Spainiards killed them all
robin hood next
/me 08,01came from a poor family
yes plz
Nittany_Discord: plus it had some good jokes :P
To be honest, I had a problem with the way Chell's eyes and eyebrows kept going in a perpindicular manner.
I give this movie.......... ROCK/10
we were such bastards back then
And since when was El Dorado an A movie!?
Does any one maybe know Estonia?
11,01And it had Chief Manboob.

WindWhistler also, 'cause Chief Manboobs
Nittany_Discord: yes it was
^
bye everypony
Now we need to make a fanfic sequel
SirGanjalf: You know that animation sequels are really bad most of the time ey
What would even happen in the sequel?
chellol bye
Nittany_discord it was really more of a abbot and costello homage :P
It was fun enought for a sequel i thought
11,01Yeah.
they wander around for an hour then die of starvation
Could've had a sequel easy enough, but I prefer it as is.
Lyon: That's what they said about Atlantis and look what happened.
It was a very beautiful movie, one of the most underrated classics IMO
Wait, this movie had a sequel? When?
never really though this movie would be enough for a sequel
AttacktheAndalite: Never.
But it was disney
WindWhistler and look at that, That was so GREATTT!
they would fight the epic battle to keep rarity, cause there was people that wanted her. You see, the golden horseshouse were engraved
im still waiting.
11,01It didn't have a sequel. It was supposed to.
AttacktheAndalite: Hypothetical.
they LOVE making sequels
so you couldn't get them off!
I agree with Dark92Enigma, although almost everypony knows this movie
AttacktheAndalite: they are saying it should have had a sequel lol
thank goodness it wasn't made,
Now Kronk's New Groove, THAT was a sequel
Twilights gonna speak to ya'll in my account now.

I wonder if Shrek is eligible to be part of the trilogy event
Lyon: If this had its own series I SO would've watched it
lyon: dont forget a whole set of action figures

If it had a sequel, it'd be harder to let go.

DAVE CHAPPEL
PONY say it isnt so! I never heard of this 'BUCK'
DerpStar: Umm... That might be a bad idea. :D
This film, by the way, is a very tangled attempt toparody both Kevin Costner in "Robin Hood: Prince of Theives" AND the famous Errol Flynn "Adventures of RObin Hood" at the SAME TIME-- and pulls it off rather well.
GOD DAMN YOU FOR CANNING YOUR SHOW
the sun is rising here
Contex: Holla! :)
Chef used to be best pony.

Science twilight is best twilight
okie dokie lokie
Where is the numbers station, Pinkie!
which is odd since SCIENCE =/= Magic
Stand back I'm going to try Science!
And apparently Twilight is the ONLY PONY EVER to have designed such equipment.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1518/
Magic ain't science. The ability to learn and sue magic is science.
otakon: in our world yes
Nopey dopey!
Kencolt: she's the Egon Spangler of Ponyville
Pinkie Pie is best troll
Elondras: you dont say
and yet Discord
does it have to?
holy mother of celestia 6_9
Rligion vs Science in cartoon form
so twilight doesn't believe in pinkie pie
Its gas! =D
:D
NOT THE GAS!
:D
take cover
It would help if Pinkie Pie wasn't sequestered in a safe location.
Damn I hate the moral of this episode
I need salsa im hungry too
needs more unlicensed nuclear accelarators
Twilight is sooooooooooooooooo Nostalgia Critic in this ep <3
Not the bees! Not the gold! Not the gas!

But of course!
Spike YOU LUCKY BASTARD!
when I heard rainbow dash say "careful derpy" I exploded twice
Sounds like a Chinese dish. Like Twice Exploded Chicken.
Canadian_Brony o.o
he got to hug Shy
Nothing would quite match the moment Derpy was named and then talked - THEN we exploded twice.
Spike X Fluttershy
Look at those tail extentions!

In Tribes: Ascend, the Juggernaut's MIRV Launcher shoots shells that really DO explode twice.

Damn beat me to it Canadian_Brony
Dammit, Twilight!
Twilight, you are just stupid as hell
I'V GOT A GODDAMN PLAN
At least she has magic
No:'(
that must hurt
Pinkie can IGNORE the laws of reality whenever the GODDAMN TIME she wants to
Twilight use Teleport!
also she needs to be able to concentrate to teleport
head butt
poor head:(
Canadian_Brony: too far, too scared
You arent honesty, Pinkie
:p
tbh
otakon aww, dammit
and right now her mind is unstable
jump you silly filly
because of Panic
she teleports from the dragon place to ponyville
Twilight doesn't really get the hang of teleporting at will until Season 2.
no hay carts at the bottom
synchronize!
But there's no pile of hay below to land in!
TWILIGHT, NO!
NONONONONONONONO :'(
Twillight y n use teleport?
Canadian_Brony: plus, not sure it teleporting over AIR is the same as teleporting over solid ground
ya that too
NO!
NO MAL! THIS IS REAL! IT'S NOT A DREAM!
SQUEE!
FUCKING BUBBLES!°!!!!!!!!!
dat bubble
also maybe it's like the earlier generations
bojoing
SQUEE
this can't end well
SQUEE
Or levitate herself on a rock or something
otakon true, true
Kencolt: eeyup, by then she's doing it like walking

*squeee*
11,01Teleport, Y U no use Twilight?

SQUEE <3 I love you Twi!
Twilight is so cute when she squees :)
DigitalChampion: she can't levitate herself.
otakon Canterlot Wedding
dat squee
CrimsonPhoenix: that's the end of season 2, this is season 1
otakon: I mean like levitating a rock and sitting on that.
I will name my ponyta twilight if I catch another one
Twillight goes mad in 5
Robin_Discord: Twilight hasn*t learned teleport yet, she still needs 135xp before next level
Dat squee

There were no rocks

Darn right. Our knowledge and understanding will always be limited.
lalala
Dat Pinkie Laugh
would it actually be possible for someone to just catch fire from anger if the conditions are all normal (like spontanious combustion but anger combustion)
i always thought a better moral for this episode would have been respect your friends beliefs
SirGanjalf: explains the stetching and bounceyness.
SpeedyBolt logic is made of estimated hypothesis'
fun thing is a lot of people got pissed because that was about religion apparently
Quick_Thinker: no
I never liked the moral of this episode.
Conyst i know im hot but still.......
Fucks given from Pinkie: -4
alexxm: yeah, but that's lesson Zero

Before my brain gets any more broken...
I GO
any pony hear about the whole higons matter and that if we can harness it WE CAN FIND ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS
When Wrek gets back, we need to find out why otakon keeps getting kicked so much.

Ah the higgs boson! researched that in school, very interesting stuff!
Elondras: They have not found Higgs yet....
http://evo2012.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/ssf4_g1.html Welp Daigo is getting his title back
thanks SuperBrony64
:D
11,02Starflash drew it for me for my Birthday ^-^
Vordox they are very sure that they found it
Its about as fast as you can get a reasonable explination of the Higgs Boson
?????????????????????????
Well... I see everypony tomorrow, i need some rest.....
Also, my firefox has decided to screw me over
Elondras: I call bullcrap due to that the higgs in our universe is instantaneous eradicated...
How do they find it? Elondras
:D
I totally forgot about Evo this year
Thanks Ponies
Anyways, I'm off to bed.
CERN here in Switzerland has found it Vordox...
who wants some beer money
Elondras: Like the previous 2 "mistaken" Higgs findings?
alexxm ME!1

Night Starflash.
bye Starflash
DigitalChampion: I know what CERN is, I know what the Higgs is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1qFhZo8-vw
Vordox think what you will but they are pretty sure they found it
On 4 July 2012, the CMS and the ATLAS experimental collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider announced that they observed a new boson that is consistent with the Higgs boson, noting that further data and analysis were needed before the particle could be positively identified.
Vordox
Vordox: The higgs Boson would have been found years earlier in the United States, because we were building a partical accelerator that was more powerful than the LHC. But the funding got cut and the project shut down
Last piece of news I heard.
NO
SO MUCH BORINGS
I need to take off, but I'm hoping to be back on later.
YOUR STUFF NEEDS TO BE ABOUT 120% COOLER
Twilight: How can you call it boring when it turns our world upside down?
bye Everlasting_Joy
i meant the video isn't on
Vordox
i coulg give you an article from a swiss newspaper but i don't know if you can read german Vordox.....
Science is fascinating.
Twilight yeah, the stream is off for now
Vordox: it doesn't so much turn the world upside down as show us why it stays right side up
WHYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DigitalChampion: Shoulda coulda woulda, but didn't.
adasdad: And if the Higgs doesn't exist then?
Meanwhile: Yeah, and that's what sucks
WHY IS THE STREAM OFF!!!!!!!!!!!
OH NO
Twilight they need to take a break every-
OH NOOO
STREAM!!!!
What.
wut?
Imagine the scientific possibilities if more funds were allocated to Science.
Elondras: I see no single what so ever certain proof it has been validated.
tHE AD.
Barbetos what did you think of the song then
SuperBrony64 be streeaming
alexxm I really could not understand it very well. =P
@digitalchampion Hoverboards 0.o
oh bob'sburgers
is the sream supposed to be this narrow
Vordox: then we make a new theory, and begin the search again.
Vordox: They found a particle that was consistent of what a Higgs BOSON would be. It's not 100% confirmed yet. But it's pretty darn close..
how come Barbetos
adasdad: That's all we can atm :P
*sneezes*
What is this
no idea
BLESSS U SparklyWaffles
DigitalChampion: That's the problem. instantenous eradication
it's a little...off
is the stream narrow for anyone else
Thank you, Twilight :)
Also know as scientist covering their arse incase of the .00001% chance it isn´t what its suppose to be
alexxm eeyup
alexxm I couldn't make the lyrics really, I suppose I should say, and I lost interest.
Vordox look i give you the article http://www.20min.ch/wissen/news/story/22848934
Vordox: It could very well be a mistake and we would have to call it off.

I DON'T WANT BOBS BURGERS
Twilight: but it's GOOD
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3317/
i want mlp
i like this show
I WANT MLP
Twilight: ogod what have you done
Twilight stop while your ahead.
08,01it's odd, i had this notion when i was at school of something similar to the Higgs Field
I WANT MLP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Twilight: you don't get that 24/7 here, it's bronystate NOT ponystate and please do NOT demand ponies
Okay.
/me sacks Twilight
Twlight it gets shown during Movie Night, unless you want a previous generation
Twilight: EHY did you do that?
DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM
You DARE request for ponies?!
Twilight: stop asking, it wont do any good
Time to send in the hounds.
08,01i was thinking about the problem of mass in that way when i was 16, 17
/me suffocates Twilight
08,01obviously, knowing nothign about particle physics
Twilight: Fun fact, demanding MLP will not get you it.
good point
the
why yall gotta be haters
yeah i learned the hard way twi dont demand ponies
:D
so time to go for mee i wish you all a peacfull night :)
Aw fran.
this show's lack of chins disturbs me.
night Elondras
08,01sagas: aye; i'd never heard of it, thoguh
korean butt specialist?
08,01i just overthought things at school
butt braile
i just really ask for link to some cool things like the hadron collider i would love to work with that thing
08,01because i had no friends
08,01so imagine how talkative i am
dang ads
Finding a Higgs is like finding a needle in a field of Hay stacks
08,01and now imagine that channlled in
XD
08,01*internally
that little girl is hilarious
Don't be frightened, I have a gun!
speaking of links no stream soooo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct_3_ZB3ohw&feature=related
Elondras: It looks...kinda "we MAY have found it" :P
Quick_Thinker: there IS a stream
yes don't be frightened of the man with a gun
huh
Quick_Thinker: refresh
oh heh :l
Quick_Thinker I'm not watching the stream and I know there's a stream
sagas exactly
The skidooch.
sorry guys did not know the stream was on
Canadian_Brony: damn particle physics
can you forgives me?
particle pyhsics seems like a hard battle to win
sagas there's a reason why I'm taking Mechanical Engineering: I know what the hell I'm talking about
Okay please everyone listen. I came to BRONYstate for PONIES. this is my first time her eos like if I don't understand don't do that stuff. and also that new show on disney has the same girl as the rabboit on this show I think.
We came to bronystate for BRONIES heheh
Canadian_Brony: Theres still physics classes in every engineering major
Then if I came for bronies why am I getting bobs' brigers?
Canadian_Brony: and those usually have particle/quantum physics
Da heeeeeeeell is this?
Twilight welcome! I would send you a link to the Welcome Song, but there are no vid links during stream
the bronies are in the chat
it's Bob's Burgers
Twilight: Protip, more than ponies happen here. If you come here purely for ponies you're gonna have a bad time.
twilight: to be fair, you just also watched two non-pony movies
cause we bronies have many different interest if you come on at a certan time im sure you could find a stream of Spelunky
Meanwhile: hiya man, and yes.
Welcome welcome welcome, a fine welcome to you
Allo otakon.
Twilight: Okay please listen ne person. While this is BRONYstate, that does not mean we stream nothing but ponies. We show movies, anime, other TV shows, and even silly internet videos. Deal with it and stop bitching, or get the buck out.
welcome welcome welcome how do you do?
ohey there
Oh sorry, I just want ponies. bye bye!

/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
Fluttershy should never cry...

Honey Badger actually does give a fuck this time.
MONTAGE
/me hugs acs26
This monologue is kind of creepy.
does anypony know cpr. cause fluttershys cuteness is giving me a heart attack!
if ponies were oz, twilight would be dorthy, fluttershy would be the lion
it could also represent some other value, such as the minimum to maintain flight.
MONTAGE!!!!
You're the best.... AROUND!!!!
although in that case, Flutters breaks it
wait...
EYE OF THE PONY!
HERE I AM
DocSane, why you tease Fluttershy in a foreign language!

I think it's now canon that Derpy's name is Derpy Doo.
hen3ry: but wasn't dropping altitude
You are now picturing Fluttershy wearing glasses.
flitter?
DocSane: no it's not
Oh Tara
its what they Planned on calling her
forever a troll
HERE I AM
It is in the original script
11,01This ep helped me get a pony toy.
No, they planned to call her Ditzy Doo
:(
hen3ry: also 2.3 seems to be rather fast still
Oh here she goes again
11,01BTW, this is me looking for jobs right now.
lol
11,01I'm Fluttershy.
In the original Smile, Smile, Smile lyrics, Amy Keating Rogers had her in the script as Derpy Doo.
2.3 is more than enough to barely fly, if my asspull theory is the case :D
Spike!! Stfu! :[
Nittany_Discord, I believe a lot could relate to Fluttershy in that situation
Nittany_Discord = Nittany_Fluttershy
still better than Scooterloo

My headcanon name for Derpy is Ditzy Derpy Doo Hooves

once again, she's only there for moral support

Fuck, Fluttershy is uselesss
11,01Was the original 21 Jump Street a comedy?
the gauge is not exact, Fluttershy, get your flank out there.
plus rainbow said they didn't need the wonderbolts
i am alduin!
I know people like Fluttershy.
it was a t.v series
/me caps a bullet in Alduin s skull
Alduin: i win
00,02Nittany_Discord, i thought the new one was suposed to be a comedy
One of the few episodes in which Angel isn't an ass.
Alduin: btw, crackle is best dragon
11,01Fun fact: Air actually goes towards a tornado.
I like Rainbowdash more.
I'm taking into the sky

Fluttershy can actually outrun Rainbow Dash when she's stressed enough
The aim can't be that fucking good.
00,02Spectrum_Rush, XD
CountDoofus: and I added the second episode for the list of few
flutterspin
Alternatively maybe Derpy turned around and started flying in the right direction...
And then Fluttershy got into the wonderbolt
11,01Supercell-borne tornadoes operate off of stretched rotation and cyclostrophic flow.
Fluttershy
and flootershai gets into the wonderbolts
good job not helping at all Spitfire
Spike, master of the pan flute
And then fluttershy made a shed,

And in that shed everybody died.

11,01The game has terrible draw distance for one.
otakon: you're the one who said that though. I just thought it was some neat art.
oh this game
and it is
Thanks for streaming this LP. I love the documentary aspect of it. ProtonJonSA put a LOT of care into it.
11,01And the controls were pretty crap.
I like the developer's excuse for poor draw distance is " it's kryptonite fog"

yeah, If I bought this game I would DEMAND my money back
AVGN told me all about it.
11,01One of the complaints of Nintendo Power before release was the draw distance.
protonjonsa is a pro at this game XD
Is it the game lagging, or the stream?
though there was gonna be one for the playstation, but it was canceled
Maze? Its a series of rings in order
clearly the amount of fucks the gave is equal to −273.15°C.
Corai: the game
and it was soo much better

Somehow that pedestrian getting hit somehow Lex wins?
notice how this game and sonic 06 has missions that involve going through rings

The only two games I have on my N64 is Zelda TOoT and Star Wars Rogue Squadron

whats the health bar on the left for? seems pointless

aquaman is the worst game ever. :U
i believe that :3

00,02Nittany_Discord, you're the scientist, whats freezing a tornado do?
11,01Nothing.
sagas: well, in the movie game that came out a few years ago instead there was a city meter, city takes too much damage then you get a game over otherwise your mostly invincible
So... Rainbow Dash is being irresponsible in Metropolis.
11,01It does nothing.
sonicrainboomer259|b: too many sonics
00,02:P
Kencolt: eeyup
brb need a drink
What if the tornado has loads of water in it?
Nittany_Discord: Aww. It doesn't turn rain into ice and fling giant ice spikes everywhere? Cause that would be cool.
11,01Unless you hope to cut off the tornado's updraft.
11,01dari, it becomes a snow tornado.

Alister: Its no big deal :)
And the 3DO was... amazingly unsuccessful. FOr which we are all grateful.

WG: no, we're not. They CALL them horror games but no.
Meanwhile: the first one at least TRIED.
Meanwhile: dead space was horror?
/me cries
360 has been around since 2003! :O
Meanwhile: i thought it was funny
holy shit!
otakon : They should make fighting games instead, and invent virtual reality interface
sagas it's been that long?
WG: NO!
otakon: Tried about as hard as a 3 dollar hooker.
Wow, that broken promise.
The more he complains about this, the more I wish they actually made Banjo-Threeie...
:D
Nuts and Bolts is worst Banjo Threeie
copy cat
Dken2021: yep aparently 9 years
XD
lol
otakon : why not
:D
AHAHAHA
Meanwhile: no it was geniunely scary at times when you were low on air and ammo and suddenly NECROMORPH
LoZ Modern Warfare
QUIT BITCHING ABOUT A FUN GAME!
Best LoZ
The only close to Banjo-Threeie is Nuts and Bolts is if you run around Showdown Town
otakon: Oh so when you suck at the game it's scary.
WHY DID RARE SELL ITSELF OUT TO MICROSOFT?!
I liked Dead Space
:P
i made a cart just like that you copy cat
11,01I wonder if Rare had a choice.
I played Dead Space 1 and 2
Dead Space 1 sucked
you could melee like a weak guy
most likely not
That's the only thing close to traditonal Banjo platforming in that
WindWhistler: some their games are fun
:D
11,01Dead Space 1 was fine.
waving around a 100kg stick
This sequal was so wrong
Meanwhile: dude, I beat it with only like 2 deaths. And those were the On Rails shooter bets
bits
Well...you could walk around a giant wasteland in the other BK games...
8 year difference between fallout and this...
WindWhistler: there wer only TWO
otakon: Ok, so you're a pansy. I get it.
Meanwhile: Resident Evil ...DOGS. that is all
night guys
sagas: why are you complaining?
otakon: Meh.
bye
Night alexxm
night alexxm sleep well
Night alexxm
goodnight alexxm
SOmebody tell me how CoD gets game of the year every year
WG: bc idiots
Even though the franchise is already boring as hell
yah
WITCHER 2 FOR GAME OF THE YEAR!
WG: Because stupid people still buy it.
11,01CoD is actually fun.
Spitfire: What? Hes comparing a game from like 2010 to one from 2003
how many banjooze are there out htere?
11,01It's just milked to infinity.
11,02I love CoD ^-^
WG: the reviewers are either bribed or reviewed by 10 year olds
WG Supply and demand, activision supplies, and people demand it
Somebody tell me how the GOOD games never get their time in the limelight...
kick her ees
Nittany_Discord: it is, but it gets WAY too hyped and MP overshadows EVERYTHING
kick her in the eees!
11,01otakon: Yep.
11,01Hype sold Black Ops TBH.
WindWhistler: Because thinking inside the chimney doesn't sell.
Wow
I NEED TO GET WITCHER 2 EE!
CoD fans
otakon: That's exactly what happens.
Same killstreaks, same weapons
ITS A FUN GAME! QUIT BITCHING ALREADY!
I would buy Tiptup Nuts&bolts actually
11,02I actually like Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Blots
11,02Bolts*
nothing new is in their new games
sagas: you can like it, there is ntohing wrong with that
SuperBrony64 you like a lot of things that suck.
I didn't mind Nuts and Bolts
11,02;~;
WG: preaching to the choir mate
Just sayin
SuperBrony64, Do you understand why it's an insult to gaming industry though?
SuperBrony64: then you probably didn't have any feeling for the original
But this guy complaining about it makes me wish they stuck with Nintendo...
SuperBrony64: I dont blame you
I tought Nuts and Bolts was a penis joke
SuperBrony64: But you also like Skylanders
Bronysith : I guess nobody cares...
So fuck you. :D
EPIC HAMMERTOSS!
XD
What dari said.
Birdemic! yay!
11,02;A;
SuperBrony64: Well, it's your opinion I suppose.
DIDYOU JUST SAY
BIRDS!
o-o
/me gets out a chainsaw
Nobody cares WindWhistler.
THAT BIRDEMIC!
IMMA KEEL YOU
wow
LOL!
Nobody cares.
look what i found at my visit to the beach! :D
SuperBrony64: I didnt think it was all that bad :P
dat Birdemic ending
11,01I >.(\ when a game thinks it knows what gamers want.
ohai Meanwhile...
whats next?
kinect
SuperBrony64: moar please?
Nobody cares that nobody cares.
Alister: No, the penis joke was in Banjo-Tooie (Literaly)
At least they didn't have to bury thousands of copies in the desert.... Yet.
Well, that's just, like, your opinion, maaaaan.
Its a video game1
Allo Shamroc.
SuperBrony64, Do you, at least, understand why it's an insult to gaming ndustry?
Hi all! :D
Inb4 goddamnit.
otakon: no it was inherintly a fun game and this guy feels entitled to have his nostalgia fantasies of a new banjo kazooie game fullfiled
Hello Kurra
>.(\
do starwars kinect episode
Meanwhile : I doN't care that I don't care that you don't care tha I don't care
JESmith71: When Tooie said she coud stick a key somewhere ?
11,01But they are right.
CrimsonPhoenix: We ALL know why, but it's too hard to resist.
Did I miss moviess agaaaaain?
yes
sagas: okay, comparing it to the old games is what he was doing. just get over it
Alister: *gags*
WG: at what point did I talk to you?
lame
11,02PONY: WHat?! I LOVED the original and was dissapointed that this game wasn't like the original, but I praised it for being a good game nevertheless.
WindWhistler, that question was for SuperBrony64 not for nothing
Did you just call her Tooie!?
WG: it seems if a game has good graphics nowadays, it gets high ratings
No, in the dinosaur stage. There was a rock formation of platforms that looked like a penis
Star Wars... Kinect? Is a dancing game? Be still, my beating spleen.
sagas: he has an opinion differing from yours. quit raging over it you fucking qumquat
WindWhistler: I never played the games
Kencolt: it has one in it
Bronysith : YOu forgot high system requirements.. :D
SuperBrony64: Ya like how I praise BC2 despite its problems :P
otakon: his view is distorted. He has the nostalgia glasses from childhood on
SuperBrony64: MOAR please
11,01WG: Seen EA in a Nutshell?
hey click the starfox the middle left
Kencolt: Star Wars Kinect has a dance mini-game, yes.
Kencolt, Star Wars Kinect is a collection of crappy games
OMG THERE'S BUBSY
I FRIGGIN' LOVE BUBSY
RAWRity: hey!qumquats are good! :)
Bronysith : OF course consoles can run everything, but the PC users MAGICALLY need to upgrade
Do horrible boss battles!
Insultingly enough, the dance game is supposed the best mini-game in the entire collection.
CK|Basara: it also stops the light saber duel between Luke and Vader so the emperor can do a break dance.
00,02SuperBrony64, can you put "EA in a Nutshell" on?
sagas: dude, it's okay if you like the game for what it is. It's just as if you made Mario an ACTUAL PLUMBER in the next mario game. Do you see where I'm going?
Horrible boss battles!
SuperBrony64, okay then. I only dislike using a franchise to make sequel different than expected (when you could actually have made two separate games, and probably even make better profit with that)
SuperBrony64: please moar JonTron, Birdemic specifically it's so damn FUNNY!
11,01I don't stream EA in a Nutshell because of the flamewar it could cause in chat.
Mlp censored!
otakon : Mario the Plumber simulator
11,01The video is a bit hyperbolic.
Do horrible bawss battles!
awwwh.
YES!
Eh, do it anyway
SuperBrony64: thank you
Hungarian Fluttershy: aaa-aaa-aaaaaa
Dude come on not the EA
00,02my little chat, flamewars are magic
First game he actually plumbs stuff!
NO FLAMEWARS
WindWhistler, do you know Ulilillia?
EA is meaner than Satan himself!
you get hot about it
YOU TAKE IT TO PM
Wait
otakon: Well, everyone has different likes and dislikes. I like Matt Smith in the Doctor's shoes. But I heartily dislike shooters. Because I suck at them.
In4 goddamnit.
We got Hungarians here?
11,01EA is everything wrong with gaming today.
lwi?
otakon: I wouldnt try to compare it, but determine its quality based on it own merits as a game. Not compare it to classic mario. But thats just how I view things :)
WG: Half. :3
Nittany_Discord: you dont say
Except me of course
SPARKLE
Shing SPARKLE SPARKLE
XD
Lens Flare Dubstep? XD
Nittany_Discord no worries, isn't their stock in a record low as of now?
Eh
XD
hooray!
lol
XD
=_(\
THAT'S YOU Nittany_Discord!
I thought I couldn't find othe Hungarians except me
11,01They are losing money and stock value.
that how i feel
Nittany_Discord=Sane Individual
This shoud more be called Mass Effect 3 in a nutshell
LOL
like the only sane
I have demos of EA games that were going to release in *2004.*
the horror!
ahahaha
Da Horrer!
Nittany_Discord: if they're everything wrong with gaming, how come they didn't make CoD
?
11,02Haha
Here, this is that penis joke that is in Tooie: http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb133/nuclear_muffin/speaksforitself.jpg
God this is hilarious
nothing could beat Unreal Tournamen
t
So true
HOORAY
You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It’s just...
ONLY 9.9?!
Shiny.
...common sense.
horrible! But its shiney...
11,01Unreal Tournament 2004.
hiya RX-78-SweetieBot
String_Shredder: Actvision is on par with them
Hi RX-78-SweetieBot
poor Halo 2
ACTUAL GOOD GAMES
Bam
Nittany_Discord: Fuck yeah!
WHY NO 10!!11*fanboy bitching*
otakon: With the exception of Halo.
this video is so accurate :D
yes, I'm saying Halo 2 was good
GilDash: Buck yeah!
Oh great, I join in on bitching about videogames.
Nittany_Discord: find me at String_Shredder~
Meanwhile: You just don't like FPS
UT04 was fun, and I only ever had the demo :>
*!
XD
Nitthany_Discord : I played that for long years
lol
seems legit
THIS IS HILARIOUS
/leave
anything with dubstep is bad
UT 2004 is my no. 2 game of all time. :)
looks fun on the back :)
that game sucks
AO? Never
LOL
in a videogame
otakon: Untrue. I don't like today's copypasta spacemarine grey brown fps. I have over a thousand hours on TF2.
oh God, dat~. I'm turining into Nyria
GilDash : I think UT2004 community died ? :(
ORIGIN
11,01Activision is bad for milking. Ubisoft is terrible for DRM. THQ invented online passes. Sony is an IP freak. EA is copying the bad ideas from these publishers. EA really needs a change of leadership.
*turning
UT03 the demo 4ever!
RUUUNNN
WG: I never knew. I never played online. :D
Meanwhile: HALO was the FIRST one so you can't say it's copy paste
JESUS
GilDash: I remember all the time i spend playing on custom made campaign like maps etc
FUCK YOU ORIGIN, STEAM FOR LIFE
:D
steam ;A;
XD
DAT ORIGIN
11,02What's Origin?
otakon: I blame Halo for startin the trend.
origin lol
alas, poor sane consumer.
Meanwhile: okay, that is faair
yeah, like origin is gonn plow through Steam :D
SuperBrony64: EA's version of Steam. It blows.
SuperBrony64, Origin is Ea's own Steam
Ea steam.
otakon: Halo was the first ? They were FPS before that
:D
Alister: first one that translated well to consoles
Xd
Nittany_Discord: i'm sure they'll change leadership after the game industry crashes like the hindenburg
So.....EA games are just forced memes?
LOL
:D
hiya Steam!
Nittany_Discord: what do you think of valve?
11,02Oh O.O
Pfft.
Gabe!
and the boat drops off the face of the earth
WOOOO
YAY VALVE!
Dice is ea.
11,01Valve does forceful marketing with Steam.
Morning all.
Bombs.
GilDash : Multiplayer was really fun. There were tons of new maps, vehicles, and other fan made stuff. Even though 99% of my PC is pirated lol
XD
Rainbow: they bought them from Valve
:D
evening XAX
dat horror story
11,01Except Valve doesn't ban your Steam account at the drop of a hat.
whoes the orngane guy?
Nittany_Discord: But their games are actually GOOD, right?
Evening XAX
Nittany_Discord: At least they make good games
Gabe... Oh you
11,02Half-Life was the first FPS that really milked the community.
SuperBrony64: on PC
WG ever heard of the C&C maps?
http://derpy.me/r7UY6
Hahaha
never!
F is for Fat Jokes that delay ep3
SuperBrony64: the console ports were..mediocre at best
I NEED TO FAVORITE THIS VIDEO
LOL
11,01I heard horror stories of Origin bans for dumb things, so I avoid Origin.
suck
This is a large nutshell...
U is for User Friendlyyyyy
WindWhistler: Coconut.
=_=
SirGanjalf: implying there wil be an ep3 and not HL3
SirGanjalf: U is for unmade. games
and the sane guy is dead
Nittany_Discord: same...but my mass effect 2 wont run unless i run origin... FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
oh god
00,02"Why does this keep happening to me"
And that's how Ultima IX: Ascension was made!
00,02yay~
Phase4: cause you have money
00,02aj video
N is for No Conclusion, for the HL series
Nittany_Discord: The problem is if you're banned on their forums, you're banned on Origin. Try to let customer service know they've screwed up on their forums...
SuperBrony64 alley right there
so catchy

RAWRity: What's a paladin?
CK|Basara: Holy Warrior
What. -.-
11,01GilDash: That's why I don't like Origin.

Applejack is made of torque, and that's hawt.
11,01Banning you from a game you bought full-price.
Nittany_Discord: lovely
more MLP Rythm heaven!
Meanwhile/otakon: I know what they are. I was referring to the fact that the hero of Ultima IX utters the words "what's a paladin?" during the game, when he should know damn well what a paladin is. :P

8,6spent half the day at a pony con, the other half with my meetup group, happy day ^_^
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL
XAX: Yahtzee didn't like Kid Icarus Uprising, he's jumped the shark
Sounds like fun kirz.
11,01Been watching a lot of WTF Is videos lately. That's been my gaming fix since most of my gaming machines are dead.
I loved kid icarus!
8,6got a custom pegasus, triforce cutie mark, will get a pic up in a few :)
Hades is best villain
SO AWESOME
11,02Well think about this 'dude', saying 'Next' and 'borrring' isn't exactly giving off positive vibes.
Egbert is BULLSHIT
11,02And I'm talking to you xxMoopyxx.
"Games are not art" MY ASS
11,01Yahtzee didn't like Saints Row 3. I loved Saints Row 3 despite the dev laziness.
hurry with the pics :p
+m?
This video lacks ponies :(
SuperBrony64 posted a message without using any smilies?
O_O
DJ: it's BRONYstate NOT ponystate
hiya Deceptive_Cadence
Yahtzee doesn't like a lot of things. And frankly I agree with him.
Fine im sorry guys jeese cool your jets man
welp, I think I'm off for tonight, thank's again BS, you guuys are great.
00,02otakon, lol he quit
Meanwhile: you are him, even got the mustache
08,01PONY: <3
00,02ninja complaint
Phase4: the hell?
Good Night
Deceptive_Cadence: Stop Startin.
00,02ohai DJDerp ,formaly known as DJ
it always amuses me when people come on here and beg for us to show ponies.
Lolz
Meanwhile Yahtzee is my favourite video game reviewer. He doesn't sugar coat things and is actually quite funny to watch.

00,02formerly'
00,02i cannot spell
DWR: Ikr.
THIS SONG
It's not as if they can't just fucking go on YT and watche the episodes as they please.
Lul
Nittany_Discord: True. Saints Row 3 was a good few hours of Out-there gaming awesomeness. Wasn't that bad.
Socially Awkward Nyria.
11,01I put 100+ hours into SR3 and beat it.
I still need to play that
11,01But it was the last THQ game I agreed to buy.
K this is getting boring -.-
Phase4: And that's what I love about you >_>
I beat Saints Row by just shooting everything out of the cannon car.
11,01Before I found out it has on-disc DLC, I planned on buying the DLC.
DJDerp: who cares
/me 00,02hugs XAX
DJDerp, you diss on Orchestra?
11,01And I don't buy DLC often.
Lol
00,02orchestral music is underrated
00,02this is nice
DJDerp: Then mute the goddamn stream and go listen to some dubshit or whatever the fuck it is you kids listen to nowadays.
God.
Some people...
Phase4, way underrated
Phase4: True dat /)
00,02Deceptive_Cadence, little much there
11,02These guys are awesome especially since they have no official affiliation with Nintendo ^-^
00,02(\ ZappyTheUnicorn
I've bought many games for the music alone; i enjoy this
Dafuq. I was just saying this is getting boring. No need to get all pissy.
Nittany_Discord: A mate of mine actually torrented it, so all the DLC unlocked itself at the start of the game, which made it kind of easy(I tried my best not to used the OP guns D:)
neil is like 16 iirc ?
8,6actually Deceptive_Cadence, there's a channel with that name already :P
Didn't they do a Chrono Cross/Trigger piece?
SuperBrony64: agreed
11,01I do have the pre-order stuff. I found the cannon very useful.
DJDerp: your not making it better for yourself
kirzstryfe: Nyria linked it last night by accident
Much lulz was had
11,01The other stuff I didn't use much.
Nittany_Discord: what game?
Gusty Garden is overrated
And TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I'm 15
11,01Saints Row 3.
Nittany_Discord: honestly, I found 2 moar fun
3 just felt ...bland in comparison
11,01SR2 is more frustrating.
like it was trying TOO hard
11,01But it's bigger.
Having spent over a year reading various forms of "derp can u show sumtin else?" comments I've got to say they never get any better.
Deceptive_Cadence kk then saying "whatever you kidz listen nowdays" makes no impact ._.
Meanwhile: they never do, and THIS was great
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pmo1h/
11,02Thanks for tuning in all :D
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: He doesn't need to know my age.
Tata SB
Alister, I do agree with you
/me 00,02hugs SuperBrony64
11,01I'd like to be able to finish all of the activities in 2, but some are pretty difficult.
No prob. Thanks SuperBrony64
PsycoticDoc: Again, I only said that this was getting boring, then I get a wave of hate. Arent bronies supposed to tolerate?
night SuperBrony64
but Gusty Gardens is still very excellent
otakon: The orchestra right? Eh. Not really my tune.
11,01Yay.
/me glomps SuperBrony64
11,01Aww.
but yea overrated
00,02:D
Deceptive_Cadence True but my point it's still valid
Aww, night SuperBrony64! Moo all the way!
CrimsonPhoenix: But not the best
Meanwhile: still awesome
/me glomps Deceptive_Cadence ontop of SuperBrony64
00,02LA LA LA LA
and then GHIS
LALLALALAALALALALAL
00,02its been too long
/me hugs Deceptive_Cadence back :3

I blame DJDerp for this.
Fair enough :P
AAAAAAAAAAAA X_X;
Our national anthem! :D
night SuperBrony64 thanks for the stream mate!
Eurgh, this again?
Phase4: You mean 4 hours?
I blame SaxyPretender.
Alister, what would be the best for you?
/me is back with egg-roles! :)
LA LA LA LA AL ALA!
sagas: run!
LALALALALALA <3
00,02Meanwhile, i wasnt here 4 hours ago
bum bum
otakon: why?
Phase4: Shame on you then.
Wb sagas.
sagas: SPACE IS 20% COOLER!
kirzstryfe they think posting about the channel orgy is awkward ...
dammit now I'm hungry
Phase4: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pmrxz/
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't remember the name , but that song that plays on the level where you climb a giant tower or something. Give me a minute I'll try to find it
Synchtube then?
otakon: But its already close to absolute zero...
It is fairly awkward
sagas: -________-
11,02Oh, and one last one :3
what the hell was taht from?
here it comes
sagas: something
Nyria failed to do a /join
And caused much lulz
00,02suddenly dx:hr
Bronysith: can you please stop with the stupid quickmemes?
otakon: -________-
CrimsonPhoenix: This one the floating fortress ost
spiderman.mp4
:D
DEUS EX HUMAN REVOLUTION
you forgot who has them.... -_-
PsychoticDoc: spiderman.mp4
Phase4: Consider spoilers it's the extremely backstory important quest
:D
Alister pm me it
Excuse meh please.
That was appropriate
8,6I've lurked in there before to see what they did, was a bit sad tbh
wat.
00,02killerpony7733, i've seen this bit
Phase4: Ah i see
Bronysith: laughingbitches.gif
I giggled like a schoolgirl.
11,01I see "WTF Is..."
Orgy lurking. What a horrible term.
PsychoticDoc: "insert rage lol guy here"
FillyFlam: We all did
Totalbiscuit!
:P
kirzstryfe remember the Shamroc one That was awkward :p
11,01Thank you for streaming SuperBrony64.
/me is easting his egg-roles
night SuperBrony64 thanks again
:)
brb guys
Didn't know it was an actual channel until yesterday XD
eating
The Shamroc one?
11,02Np ^-^
/me hugs SuperBrony64 "thank you very much"
11,01TotalBiscuit is the only person to make a good argument for online passes.
/me hugs Bronysith back :3
What happened with Shamroc?
8,6lol, pretty sure Shizuka still has the picture from l4d2 that came out of that one
SuperBrony64: thanks for the stream.
What is the name of that song with AJ Bucking with the punchbag?
PsychoticDoc: "Step 1, get this guy butthurt, Step 2... Step 3 PROFITS"
11,01I still hate them, but he made a good argument in a video about ME3's DLC.
i do have my own ::p
Nittany_Discord: and what was that argument?
Share.
Meanwhile Deceptive_Cadence can't tell you, i promised not to :p
Ah bullshit.
so nope i can't
g
"We're allowed to laugh about this but you aren't."
Livestream, Y U BUFFER?
11,01He talked about how other forms of media make back their money in more ways and how game shops are pushing used sales.
Bronysith: "we need a new idea for this guy to stop implying rage" "imply not rage... AND keep backtrolling"
nooooo did i miss friday movie night :(
Yes
11,01Honestly, I think the used games argument needs to be taken up with the shops and not the consumers.
AppleJackTheOneAndOn: yea
D:
11,01Consumers are saving money.
well it endup with us shipping shamroc with caramel
Nittany_Discord: but then wouldn't a better way of dealing with that just be to start distributing the games themselves?
Whats with the debate -.-
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3prmtl/
Hehehe
RAWRity: and thus the goddamn wreck that is Origin
11,01I think publishers will start pushing digital distribution as a way to do that.
Hey guys I'm back :D
wb EmmettBrown
Wb EmmettBrown
11,01No used games on digital platforms.
Bronysith: >implying this memes are good enough to keep posting
guys it would be AWESOME if you could check out my youtube channel: cookiemaster7 i make some skits and ysterday i made a fus roh party cannon video thanks everypony :3
hey EmmettBrown
I remember back when otakon was our main FedEx employee
Anyone remember me?

Und dann he got mad about it.

That was fun until the idiots started taking it too far.

seems familier
11,01I remember you

11,01AppleJackTheOneAndOn: No channel advertising please.

and then i went on the route of the brony not using a cure word and being kind and helpful
The part of Super Mario will be played by Meanwhile today.
And be fair, how many other ways am I supposed to spin that quote? :P
Phase4: Wanna play some CSS soon?

11,01Hi.
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details but i am doing this
-.-
Oh, it's maid hour?
11,01Aww, I was about to dust him.
Oh, stream must be over eh?
You two play LoL?
13on the third attempt to make it work..
11,01There he is *dusts Kurra*
11,01Yes, it's over.
13and i don't play lol.. too confusing
okie, thanks for streamins. :>
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3598g3/
and dust? what for?
i play LoL but only with friends
11,01Just for fun.
13watching videos of it looks like too much micromanagement... don't get to do what i do with, say, pyro where i can focus on one thing at a time
13this life i will capture the point, that life i will smack someone with an ax combo
Bronysith: So stealing from who you work for is good ?
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/4hm2/
why not do all of those in the same life ?
Bronysith: Ok that one was funny
Bronysith: what a nice guy
13sometimes i do but usually don't live long enough to make it
Big_Macintosh_1992: ikr
8,6so this video is going to take 6 hours to upload >.<
wow... the chat's a bit quiet...
I wouldn't call LoL /that/ micromanagery.
Big_Macintosh_1992: that is why i post stuff mon
13at least looking at videos it's just throwing focus everywhere
You need to be aware of your role, your team, and your build. In a nutshell.
13camera looks at some thing in the corner, then bounces to the middle and then somewhere else in the middle oh and let's look at the other side too
Big_Macintosh_1992: Good.
Reminds me of the good ol' days.
night everypony
13it evokes the same problem i have with something like magic the gathering, way way too many combinations to think through
ScootaChicken: I love that song
night dashee
13i try to build a deck of x cards, inevitably everyone i play will have a deck of brand new cards that make all mine useless
What song?
Oh wait
That one
lol
13or just get mana screwed, there's that too
well in LoL you mostly take care of your char
I don't LoL has ever had an item update outside of new game modes.
don't think*
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/4mjv/
good guy greg is such a good guy
and a few new chars
so... you don't like when the chat is busy ScootaChicken?
but they get nerfed quickly
And even if you don't quite understand the shop has a set of recommended items for your champion anyway.
11,01Slow chat is slow.
^
11,01Though I've been in dead chat rooms before.
/me is waiting patiently for a stream....
and you can use only one champion until you learn to play it
Big_Macintosh_1992: It feels nostalgic.
/me looks at Maid_Discord
or try several until you found one you like
/me 11,01dusts sagas
/me is dusted
11,01I can't stream.
awwww
11,01My gaming PC is dead.
11,01I'd love to stream, though.
double awwwww
Hell if you wanted to try I'm sure me and T could help you through some bot games.
Maybe just stream some youtube videos Maid_Discord?
Oh poo.
Not gaming
11,01If the motherboard would magically work, I would turn it on now.
Regions Meanwhile think you would have to make a us account
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35ppi3/
To the solder!
also i like bots
Bronysith, stop it!
11,01Or whatever's messing my computer up.
teams in bot matchs are more friendly
Agreed.
Ded chat? ;3;
Maid_Discord: go steal a PC from your neighbors.
ITS SO SILENT!
WHERE IS EVERYBODY!
I'm here. :>
/me is here
/me feels like he wandered into Silent Hill
/me is here.
I'm just whiling away some time as I wait for Digimon Zero Two to download.

For some reason playing against other people makes everyone like, 200% tetchier.
139 people, yet only 5 people chatting
/me goes zombie and trys to kill sagas (because he's in silent hill)
Rain: ewwww Didgemon

sagas: you go to hell and you die.
:(
/me hugs SadCanary tighter
SadCanary: are you any better? :(
RAWRity: Well then...
To be honest, Im not.

RAWRity: in that order?
/me 13grabs canary und snuggles
OH MY GOD ITS Shizuka!
i hate summer in general
Because it's the time of year that everyone is away in other countries.
Except for me ;_;
So I'm stuck at home being bored.
I prefer winter.
Watching paint dry.
What Meanwhile said
Summer is too hot and buzzy.
:O
Although at least I don't get sunburnt because Asian genes do that or something.
/me comes back to life
/me snuggles Canary. :(
No, really?
SadCanary: I'd love to say something, but I don't want to be a moron and ruin your week even further :|
dunno if it'll help any, but I recently discovered this exists: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IPVhjIdAOY
WHY THE FUCK IS IT SO QUIET!?
Because no one wants to talk to caps lock.
sagas: because you touch yourself at night
RAWRity: Pokemon poser
/me hugs SadCanary tightly
sagas: Agumon>>>>>>>>>>>>Pikachu

Big_Macintosh_1992: well shows what i know i just got on
CrimsonPhoenix, There we go. Good stuff.
Suddenly Rain
Rain: I dont care about the show...
Can the mic swivel 180?

13sonicandmario85: yes it is a shortener
cyber_pony13: you didn't miss much. it's been quiet
Rain: But you do gotta admit that the Pokemon show is still around and popular as ever while Digemon not so much
Personally I like Pokemon more. Never got too much into Digimon
CrimsonPhoenix: Can't access youtube links, long story, what is it?
/me 13brings rain into the snuggle pile

Shizuka: fine, I'll just settle for taking pictures and selling them to the kids in the Rarity room.
And I'm talking 180 like, as you're wearing it. Is it one of those 'either direction' ones?
Rain: Were discussing Pokemon and Digemon in an MLP chat room. I dont think we can exactly talk about the age of the audience. -_-
oh we can
and we are
I found a silver egg on sonic adventure. What do I do with it
WE ARE TRAVELLING BACK IN THE 90s

RAWRity: The 2 for 1 deal is still happening, right?
No no no
Fry it. Then eat it.
EmmettBrown: I WILL FREEZE YOU TODAY
Pokemon stayed around because it was more marketable, and the merchandise was sold EVERYWHERE for EVERYTHING.

CrimsonPhoenix: i wager 2 bits

http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35hzv2/
Also for yugioh
hai there SadCanary, ok there?
I'm inclined to believe you should just try the angle thing, given that it seems to be a recurring problem with every form of 'either side headset'.
first season was the only good one
Goddamn Maximillion Pegasus
/me snuggles Dken2021
I'm back everypony
!
hey Dark92Enigma

08,01SadCanary: that is a sad
Hello Twilight_S !
welcome back Dark92Enigma
SadCanary, I hope with all my heart you sort it all out, because I can't have happy fun times when even someone I barely know is so sad. :'(

ScootaChicken: N*Sync

RAWRity, that's the joke
Fair enough.
UNLESS
Ugh.
N*Sync>>>>>>>>>BSB
90s was a good decade for music.
Hi bronies are the movies cancelled or is there bad reception?
http://youtu.be/ZyhrYis509A
HAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
lol
The 00s hasn't been as terrible as some people claim
Still can't believe I have to beat the campaign one more time to unlock Nobunaga. I dun wanna.... ;_;
ScootaChicken: not particularly, actually. 90's gave us post-grunge, and that shit was terrible.
MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
11,01Movies played already.
RAWRity: Eh, I like the Foo Fighters.
But I'll agree with you that most post grunge sucks horribly.
Creed and Nickelback can go die.
CK|Basara:Jump through ALL the hoops.
Distortion which movies?
00s were okay, but today if you dont look at the hiphop/rap songs, we have some pretty good songs
no stream?
superretroworld: and thus you show you are teh dumbs
11,01No stream.
No movies to stream?
superretroworld, it's ike you have to dig in shit to find golds
00s gave us Arctic Monkeys and all those John Frusciante era Red Hot Chili Peppers albums
GUYS TARA STRONG WAS ON TWITCH SHE JUST SAID THANKS FOR helping kik
No stream :(
Among other things.
Quick_Thinker, I saw it on twitter
RAWRity: why are you calling me that?
/me is back, sexy and he knows it
Anyone wanna play MW2 private match with me, add me on steam ; masterboss43
people who say that music today sucks obviously don't know what the fuck they're talking about, or obviously don't pay attention to music.
CrimsonPhoenix: eh, true
What RAWRity said
RAWRity, what do you mean?
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3569fo/
There's plenty of good music out there.
they focus on the bad music and not the good music
The chat is still relatively dead I see
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvbSiQZfACQ how does gotye come up with their music videos?
not mainstream but yeah I could agree on that
CrimsonPhoenix: there's is an unbelieveable amount of fantastic music being produced every day, if you bother to do anything more than press play on radio.
Maidwhile: Nobunaga is worth it. Dude wields a full-sized sword and a sawed-off shotgun....AT THE SAME TIME.
yeah like I said not on the media
Big_Macintosh_1992: www.9gag.com and shut the buck up.
i highly doubt this is good guy greg but whatever http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/49ka/
CK|Basara: Idek what game you're talking about.
Big_Macintosh_1992: exactly, gotyes a prefect example of good music and what ppl shouldbe focusing on
Maidwhile: Sengoku Basara. The third game, for Wii.
CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: what did i do?
Y'know
CK|Basara: Never head of it.
heard*
I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Knebworth 2 weeks ago.
They were pretty good.
ScootaChicken: IN THE BATHROOM
just putting this out here for Digimon: Tamers>Adventure>Frontier>Zero Two>Data Squad
Acoustics were shit mind you.
Maidwhile: Most people haven't. It's basically what would happen if you took Dynasty Warriors and turned it into the most absurd anime style you could think of.
But it was outside and raining, so what can ya do.
Big_Macintosh_1992: It is a comic place that is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than le old sh#tty www.quickmeme.com.
CK|Basara:Dynasty what?
I've been having some IRL problems lately.
It was a lot better than I thought it would be, mind you, although the mixing was really weird.
The bass was waaaaaaaaaay up in the mix whilst the vocals and guitar were surprisingly quiet.
not now EmmettBrown we're having silly arguments
Maidwhile: Quite fun surprisingly, and there's an anime based on it which I think DCD would like. 'tis very manly.
CK|Basara:Well, you have fun.
Actually I enjoyed this video just today http://youtu.be/wMhL_QIyD1k
I'll wait,they aren't that bad :)

Hey, anyone in here like the Arctic Monkeys?

only bad part about the CNN post: that damn Rarity re-color
13http://i.imgur.com/Ir3wJ.jpg so apparently this is happening in DC from the heat
o wow
Woah.
Shizuka: I figured that happened in DC regularly
That's toasty.
wut
8,6got a look at the new Zecora toy and the 7 pack with Nightmare Moon, they looked good
paint is melting off?
melting asphalt? oh dear
Rain: the wheels

Rain: ASPHALT IS MELTING
Shizuka: i believe it
lawl
11,01Wow.
Rain look at the wheels
11,01Tires are sinking.
Anyone wanna hear about my problem?
Heya mods!
so everypony, im going to sit with my mom and show her a full episode of MLP to see if she sees why i like the show, so any episode suggestions?
Y'know, it's at times like these that I love living in England.
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka!
Inb4 they never appear in the UK.
13you always hear the blah blah blah weighs blah blah tons as much as blah blah blahs
yeah. Anderson Cooper should have been the Rarity recolor...
:-P
return of harmany would be good for her
13not really until you see a pic like that that you realize how much it is
*harmony
Hmm the last roundup
Can someone give me a good, relaxing PMV that focus on the artistic aspect?
8,6drum up support and get the word out to hasbro that you guys want it, that's basically what got the blindbags to the US
RETURN OF HARMONY
Hey did the bronycon doc come out yet?
8,6Hasbro rep basically said the same thing
11,01I'd think plane asphalt is softer.
13i know i have a headache when 4% system volume sounds too much louder than 2% to listen to music at
don't think so, think they still have sstuff to do icybeauti
icybeauti, they still have to do the UK conventions
Shizuka, I know what you mean
Dken2021: CrimsonPhoenix Okay. I can
it think i might show here the season 2 finale :$
t eait to see myself in it. It's gonna kick ass.
Great, I'll put out a memo to be read during tea time.
sometimes my computer can not be quiet enough unless I mute it >_<
8,6:P
I have this friend who keep changing her mind and its really annoying me >:(
uk still gets better things than mexico :p
CrimsonPhoenix: >implying there's more than one UK convention
Hey, costa rica isn't in that orbit. They don
ScootaChicken, I believe they'll do one but I'm not sure which one
EmmettBrown about going out with you or something else?
They don't even have an army here. Not kidding.
and I know there's two Galacon and Buck
Dken2021: yay, she thanked us for passioning the show
CrimsonPhoenix: Galacon's in Germany.
Oh....I should've mention Europe
Well,she's supposed to be my best friend,and lately she keeps changing her mind about whether its awkward when she's alone with me
Is Mexico hot all the time?
EmmettBrown: Unless you actually had a crush on her, there shouldn't be any awkwardness.
Nah,we're both very socially awkward though
God, spanish translations on TV sound horrible here. I'm watchign futurama and everyone sounds the same.
nope depends where you live
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6t94bepe61qkvbwso1_500.png
what is Hot for you ?
icybeauti: why are you watching it in spanish?
RAWRity: really?
RAWRity, dang
superretroworld: I'm in costa rica.
that's why all those shows a great
oh
For instance,she had broken up with her boyfriend on friday and wanted to go on a walk alone with me,yet today she seems not to want to be alone with me. Its really confusing me D:
No idea. When it's not cold.
RAWRity nice info
EmmettBrown: Does she seem like she has a crush on you?
EmmettBrown: if she's just broken up with somebody, she's probably not in the best spot emotionally, and might not be sure what she wants.
Erin burnette, welcome to the herd!
http://youtu.be/nCKEwvaiptg
G'night everypony! :)
Hey im back im sorry i was really mean about few minutes ago i was being boared thats all guys but im sorry bronystate
EmmettBrown she probably still trying to settle how to handle things, since she did just break up with somebody
Well,she seemed like she knew exactly what she wanted. She never wants to speak to him again.
ok I HAVE A CRUSH ON FLUTTERSHY RAINBOW DASH AND TWILIGHT SPARKLE!
I even have spanish ads on the computer lol
kidzrul434: it happens
yeah i was being board
well i'll put it like this here where i live 25°c is around normal cold is 20°c and hot is around 31°c
meh, could be worse. Three-timing isn't that bad
Yeah,I suppose. I needed to went really
so do you guys for give me for old time sake
EmmettBrown: it's difficult after a relationship ends, especially one that apparently ended on as bad terms as that implies, and often times a person may think they want something when they really want something else.
^^^
Dken2021: so is erin burnett a pegsister then?
This is some really good advice. Thanks guys :D
and humidity is almost always over 50%
superretroworld: If she supports us.....And if she said I love rarity....THEN YES!
superretroworld I suppose, she even made her own OC
EmmettBrown: ultimately, if she's your friend, let her know that you're there for her, in whatever capacity you're willing to, to help her get through this.
or someone on her staff did
if i get mean again i'll keep it to my self ok
news is entertainment for the most part, after all.
Eurgh, humid.
thats another famous brony on the list, welcome to the herd erin
hen3ry: No, one does not simply make an Oc.
It's not too bad if there are fans and AC everywhere, like Jamaica.
Seriously, hotel rooms in Jamaica are bloody freezing.
you're confusing pony creator flash with mordor again.
I know, common mistake, but xD
Im going to play some fortresscraft for a little bit but i'll stay in the chatroom if you guys need anything just say my name and i'll come back to the computer screen ok

xxMoopyxx: what did youdo?
i was being mean about few minutes ago
Just don't hurt Tom. He's sensitive.
And then you open the door and it's like being hit by a literal heat wave.
I haven't been here since thursday, and I was flying all day ysterday, so I have no idea.
xxMoopyxx: bronies always forgives /)

She does invite me to stuff but she changes her mind if no-one else wants to go,and gets annoyed when I ask why. Its confusing

Dammit PC just shat itself and turned off instantly

You need to uninstall LowerIntestine.dll

hen3ry: Lol'd
PCs aren't supposed to be able to shit.
he probally meant it lagged
XD
In all seriousness, if it turned itself off instantly? Might be a power supply issue
8,6Fluttershy joined the empire btw http://i.imgur.com/8Toxm.jpg?1
or a board fault
kirzstryfe: i approve
This labtop is buffering to death.
thats alot of mods...
a lot of em are idle.
Surrender rebel scum. Um..if that's ok with you anyway...
11,01kirzstryfe's candy text!
its normal
where do i get one of those suits ...
so is any of the mods gonna stream anything?
http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26418627916/ptqig4i5
I love the colored text/
the ones that arent AFK
ah, yes. Every stormtrooper needs a cutie mark
good thing none of em ever get one in, you know, aim.
8,6they have a supplier somewhere I think, there's a whole group that does star wars cosplay
it would help differentiate them easily
You could probably google it easy enough
8,6there was a speeder bike trooper, pilot, imperial officer, bridge officer, and a jawa
hiccups http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26398348028/X2kShTI4
unless all of them are the same cutiemark 0_0
for some reason my cutie mark turned into a mlp logo..
8,6http://www.501st.com/
lol
hen3ry: I presume its just because it's heating up from being on too long, because I open the outside door behind it and it doesent do it again. That's still a problem though :$
ah, probably a dead fan then
The 501st. Vader's fist from Battlefront 2.
or blocked airflow
ouch, I know that feeling, happens everytime I plug in magijack
and yes, it's a problem, but not an insoluble one. Replacement fans are pretty cheap really
00,02why is there no stream
00,02dis is abnormal
Aliens Phase4
because... you know, I don't have a good snark here. Ack, it's spreading.
KER-BALS! KER-BALS! KER-BALS!

odd thing, my laptop can't handle being on for so long with so much stuff in the background, but my cousin's 3 year old laptop with a broken screen can last for days, odd
/me 00,02is dusted
i have a precision M20 but i dropped it now when i start it up it just shows the dell logo and loading bar and it wont move
all laptops are not created equal. With laptops I find it's critical to allow airflow underneath the base.
Welcome to Twinkle Park

kirzstryfe: what?

sonicandmario85: Until recently I was running off a PC that could only run Win 2k. I win.
Is it just me,or are the bots on TF2 retarded?
EmmettBrown: Yes.
Meanwhile: Dat mathematician's answer.
hey Reikim
i using windows XP too xps faster than 7 but the reason this ones slow is because it has poor ram and a poor graphics card
I can't even practise support,because they don't stand on the capture point!
You have to do it for them
Oh great there's a giant spider on my floor.
EmmettBrown: Unfortunately, they're programmed to do that.
8,6the florida chapters show up to most of the cons in the state, it's cool to see and they have REALLY good costumes

11,01I have an almost-identical one with a broken plugin.
icybeauti: I LOVE THAT BAND
11,01So I can't charge batteries with it.
Because they kind of look like them...
superretroworld: I want them to come to the states!
wut is wolfmother?
sonicandmario85: click the link and you will see
Nittany_Discord: Ahaha! I can relate. The plug on mine got broken in such a way that my cable is, I believe, the only cable in existence capable of charging it.
icybeauti: im sure they tour around the states all the time
EAR WORM ALERT
superretroworld: They did before I found out about them :(
and chat died
Phase4:are you in the mood for slaughtering some kerbals? :3

00,02sonicandmario85, have to do math
icybeauti: dont beleive that wolfmother is gone and last forever and its all within my mind
00,02partial fraction decomposition
otakon: You don't just say "Whelp, she's dead". That's just insensitive.
00,02why the crap would i ever need to do something this tedious and useless
superretroworld: Haha. After this song, my fave is please to meet you, then apple tree
Reikim: it's CHAT
otakon: So? Next you'll be saying that ponies aren't real!
icybeauti: mines far away, white unicorn and colossal
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ozeaz/
they arent real but horses are no offence but its true bro :/
superretroworld: The first song I heard from them is backround, then I actually heard white unicorn.
sonicandmario85: Ponies are real. I once knew a girl who lived on a farm and owned a pony. She enjoyed riding it.
Ponies are real.I have one! ll it does is eat andshit!
EmmettBrown: You forgot the farting bit.
why isnt paintchat working?
That comes with the shitting
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ppmnc/
there's a guy that rides a horse arund my neighborhood
He is clearly a boss.
icybeauti: back rounds a good one too, i just hope they have a new album soon
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oyo2z/
I wish I had a horse. I'd name it Epona and we'd ride around town having adventures and shenanigans
Look at my horse.My horse is amazing.Give it a lick
Why would I lick a horse, exactly? That can't be sanitary.
That feel when you see your reading later list but have no drive to read the stories...
its from a video XD
I realize that, but the comment still stands.

This here is a chatroom, no RP room
13^
there should be a rp room
Chat time, then.
:3
...What do we chat about?
sonicandmario85: If you go looking you'll find one.
anime
we chat about anime
Pass on the anime for now.
anime
Anime? Where?!
Meanwhile:how do i find them?
where?
We chat about how awesome this is http://fav.me/d4xdrzz
8,6sonicandmario85, there are plenty of RP rooms on the network
Did anything big happen in the world recently? Because I probably didn't notice.
8,6sonicandmario85, type /list
CrimsonPhoenix: my face is full of wat
8,6the full list of channels pops up, then just look for ones that say they are RP channels
13bored and tired what do
Rekim, Andy Griffith died if that counts
Sleep?
1310pm
I love the wat reactions from my weird liked stuff <3
8,6pony pony your pony
13too early
I'd suggest TF2, but tired isn't a good way to play TF2.
Tired isn't a good way to play anything.
Oh, and it's never too early to sleep.
Not true.
Tired is a good way to play any one of those acid-trip games.
13thought of doing myst 4 but then i remember i haven't installed yet
CrimsonPhoenix: I dunno what they're going on about. Seems perfectly normal to me :/
13too tired to go find my archives and pull out the cds
Bipedal woona head is par for course
I tried Myst 4. Couldn't get into it. I felt like I was missing out on some important stuff, which of course I was.
13it builds on myst and myst 3 mostly
Figures. I still need to play those games.
13does some major retcons to myst though..
Andy Griffith's hayday was before even my time. But I still remember watching reruns of his show on TV when I was young.
Well is there anything you watch besides pony? Could you just go lie down?
Good or bad retcons?
Petrified_Discord, also this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
13they make sense in universe but contradict how myst played out
not only am i sad that andy griffins dead, but im also sad that he never got a chance to watch mlp :(
http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-2254.png
13namely that the red and blue books weren't themselves prisons, they linked to ages with no exit
Did it get fixed in RealMyst?
|Actually Andy Griffith's death was sort of a big deal around here in NC of course
13which is fine and all, but then how do sirrus and achenar see and talk to you to motivate myst's plot...
13realmyst added Rime and the crystal age viewer, which is also in myst 4
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu7Fx1LFb8Q
But didn't fix that one little plothole?
13but the red blue and green books are still out of alignment with how books work in the series
I live pretty close to Mt. Airy, so all this week we had more stuff going on. One of the local stations in this area never took the reruns off the air, so it did a marathon every afternoon and they had a big piece on his death that preempted 48 Hours the night that he died
Petrified_Discord, That wasn't weird
That's what really got me interested in Myst in the first place. Writing yourself a new world...entering the world of a book...pretty much my biggest childhood dream come true.
Who's Andy Griffith?
Clearly I am not trying hard enough. Although pony weird is more difficult to come by :/
13Book of Atrus and Book of Ti'ana are good, get more into that side of the universe
http://youtu.be/93kBPeH1w8c
The army is rising
11,01Reikim: A comedian.
Those are the novels, right? I think I saw those around. Am I able to read those as stand-alones?
13yup
Sweet. Thanks, I'll take a look into it.
nittany are you gonna air something? :3
11,01I can't :<
11,01Unless you want to help me fix my PC.
http://youtu.be/WF9CS3L_ezw
13the timeline of everything goes Book of Ti'ana, Book of Atrus, Myst, Riven, Book of D'ni, Exile, Revelation, then jump forward 200 years ish to the present for Uru and Myst 5
Hey, I'll give it a go.
whats wrong with your pc Nittany_Discord ?
any other mods that arent AFK and they can stream?
11,01It's not starting up properly.
11,01It's not doing the POST beeps.
how far does it get?
CrimsonPhoenix: Allrighty then, nonponyweird it is! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPbhhqlFERk
Should I read them in order chronologically by timeline or by publishing?
11,01It spins up the HD for a couple of seconds, and then everything quits.
Hell yeah sexual lobster
13publishing wise it went Atrus, Ti'ana, D'ni
awesome
13Book of Atrus does a good job introducing the world
Good place to start, then.
11,01The computer stays on, but nothing happens.
13since it's basically the story of Atrus from kid in the desert to omg I can write worlds this is serious responsibility
11,01That's as far as it gets.
nittany cant you use the one your using right now? not your gaming one? you can put videos on :3
just happened out of thwe blue, no recent changes?
11,01I never tried streaming from my laptop.
11,01I don't trust my laptop for streaming.
Nittany_Discord, how old is your laptop?
I guess it was kind of inevitable that someone would abuse that power. An unfortunate side trait of humanity.
13eeyup
I trust my laptop with my car keys. But only if it's back by 11.
/me just saw the link to the Bronycon rave.... and now haz all the sad :'(
The more I learn of this Myst thing the more I decide "Eh, too much stuff."
Nittany_Discord: Do you ahve recovery disks, and have you tried them? Also sorry if I know jack all about computing beyond the basics.
11,016+ years old.
O_o
MODS ARE YOU THERE?
This? This is nothing, Meanwhile.
Nittany_Discord, well you're doing good to not trust it to stream
11,01I haven't tried recovery disks.
have you tried running from live cd?
Nice variation on the traditional "abusing power" plot.
wouldnt that kind of error indicate more of a hardware error though Nittany_Discord ?
Nittany_Discord:try reloading the windows verison on it by using the same disk
on your gaming pc
sonicandmario85: So yeah, recovery disk.
it might fix it
13exile filled in some nice backstory with sirrus and achenar but still feels a little out of place
Try punching it?
11,01I'm 99% sure I have a hardware error.
checked all connections are secure i assume?
11,01They're secure.
i tried reloading windows on it and it was broken and it fixed everything
Maybe they'll take RealMyst and do the same thing to the later Myst games. That would probably work very nicely.
:3
11,01I even pulled my RAM and video card out ant turned the PC on without those parts.
11,01No POST beeps.
13there's a fan project doing a real riven kind of thing
Mod or standalone?
11,01There should have been POST beeps even then.
thats not good
13saw a post on their dev blog, they're starting out by taking the actual game shots and building 3d models from them
Petrified_Discord, that's still a better story than twilight
GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH you all and pierce the heavens with your drill!
still might be something small but,,,
computers cant run without ram
:3
13standalone thing, apparently something happened at cyan ages ago and the original riven files no longer exist ><
Wow. Now that takes dedication.
13ikr
Nittany_Discord, You can try reading this that I found. Maybe there's a faulty wire or something? http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbysymptom/ht/pconthenoff.htm
I've run my computers off sheep for years. Rams are not necessary.
13http://www.starryexpanse.com/2012/04/12/camera_matching/
ram makes your computer faster if its a regular one i think
13fascinating to me cause you can see the camera positions they've worked out, and how detailed riven was
http://youtu.be/oBe4KAZhyC8
GNIGHT everypony
im using a dell Optiplex right now
bye Bronysith
That's an intense amount of work.
night Bronysith
Maybe you should try downloadmoreram.com ?
And amazing results.
different bits can be the bottleneck. sometimes its ram, sometimes it's CPU, sometimes it's HD read speed...
on here for some reason firefox uses LOTS of KB
sounds like a hard drive failure Nittany_Discord
sonicandmario85: It's Flash. Probably.
8,6Bronystate exclusive video of a Hasbro Q&A panel from earlier today, link and embed is on the front page :)
But yeah, Meanwhile, Myst isn't nearly the most intense universe I've seen. that honour goes to Wheel of Time, which I had to give up on because I couldn't keep track of the 100+ plot-relevant characters.
\m/
Exclusive? really?
What?
and I AM OFF
8,6love WoT, but you have to read them all at the same time or you lose track of it all
S'what I do with my hand when I'm listening but having to contribute.
I tried once. I got as far as about book eight before I had to quit.
Make spiderman web hands.
8,6exclusive as in I shot and uploaded the video, and nobody else has it yet
13go web go
oh wow, a rarity
13no it's an applejack
Path of Daggers. Too many side characters suddenly being important that really don't add much to the overall plot.
13nice try though
8,6it's a pony
DUNGEON 13 HOURS
it has 3 diamonds and a purple mane.
i can see how i got confused
8,6still waiting for the last book, author died and his son is finishing it >.<
or do you mean an ashleigh
is anyone streaming anything?
His son?
yes, but nobody here is
Not what I heard. They hired some third writer.
8,6was his son and another author that's a friend of the family
Brendan something or other. He was so overwhelmed by the original notes that he had to cut the last book in three.
I am the lovable Prick :) and you shall LOVE ME!!! :[
11,01Ryunosuke: If it was a HD failure, there would be noises from the HD. There are no odd noises coming out.
8,6yeah, and even then it's huge
I really want to finish the series, but I just can't get past Path of Daggers. Am I missing anything if I skip ahead a bit?
Fan failure?
no, that's too soon
cpu?
11,01All of the fans work.
prick:i dont love you :3
8,6yes, but I can't remember what
11,01And a bad fan wouldn't cause a POST fail.
8,6it's been a few years since I've read them
It doesn't sound like a hardware failure, from what you're saying.
corrupt boot sector?
8,6when the last ones come out I'll have to reread them all >.<
11,01What else would cause the computer not to beep when it starts up?
i don't know enough there anyway
Oof. I couldn't imagine doing that.
broken beeping thing?
8,6busted speaker?
YAY
11,01Also, I tried a Linux boot disk. Didn't work.
XD
00,10Nitt are you geting power at all?
11,01Yes.
graphics card? hardrive?
lol
11,01The computer turns on.
It wouldn't be graphics. HD problem is possible.
did you read the hard drive from another computer?
00,10I had a ide control blow out on a drive and it caused a short
Sumica:WE NEED A STREAM HERE
because im a little board
:3
sonicandmario85: Hush, don't pester mods when they're trying to resolve something.
00,10basicly the pc refused to power up due to the short protection built in to the powersupply
/me 13is sad there doesn't seem to be a kindle version of the Chronicles of Amber series
hey
Chronicles of Amber?
11,01My PC is powering up.
11,01It's just not reaching the Power On Self-Test.
11,01Or performing it.
13if i could find my bread camera i would pic the book on my shelf
How is everypony tonight?
Bread camera?
reikim:if he dosent want too ill leave him alone im just asking god -_- im not trying to pester anybody
You lost the bread camera? DL
00,10power geting to drives?
D:*
13the terrible camera i use for bread
8,6she makes bread
hey guys, whats going on?
11,01Yes.
8,6with cameras
13yes
You didn't bake it did you?
11,01The drives are operating.
13i point at the pan
13push the button
13POOF
13bread
11,01The only other possible failure is power supply.
00,10and I just finised an epic long game of Sins so let me grab a drink and I will see about streaming.
00,10It came down to a huge 3way battle royal
13probably on a shelf somewhere else..
13it is a bad enough camera i do not keep track of it, unlike my other tech
11,01TBH, if I had the money, I would just buy new parts for a new build.
is it going to be a pony video movie or kerbals?
00,10Drone swarm ftw
11,01New MB, new HD, new RAM, new processor.
Something about physics tells me that that is either one very dangerous camera or your batter is incredibly sensitive to light.
you've probably already do you know anyone you could borrow parts off to test Nittany_Discord ?
11,01I have another tower, but no working HD and it's even older.
Anyone wanna play MW2 private match with me?
Sumica: hmm?
:P derp
11,01Yeah. My uncle. He thinks the motherboard is bad, and he has no spare motherboard.
00,10I won cause I had almost noting but light carriers
00,10Fighter spam
Nittany_Discord: Rip it out of your laptop if you're feeling really enterprising and willing to sacrifice it. Not recommending though.
lol i think it may have a diff chipset for the cpu
motherboards for the motherboard god!
11,01My motherboard?
speakers for the speaker god!
Nittany_Discord:it might be the motherboard
11,01That will not work.
People in the picture aren't there after the flash goes off.
Remember what I said about not knowing much about computer tech? Yeah.
also speakers dont affect anything they just make sound from the computer thats their only use
mmmhmmm
Yeah, I think Shizuka's camera could possibly count as a lethal armament.
im using wireless headphones right now :3
by SONY
:3
senheiser > all headphones
11,01And I don't think a broken speaker will cause a POST fail.
11,01And the PC to not continue to boot up.
The computer has built-in speakers for that.
8,6"Yeah, I think Shizuka could possibly count as a lethal armament."
So it just sits there with power, not booting up?
8,6fix'd it for you :3
^
Nah, Shizuka herself counts as a potential weapon of mass destruction.
11,01It reaches HD spin-up, then goes idle.
if you could use my spare pentium 4 motherboard i would send that to you Nittany_Discord ....but i dont tyhink that would be of any use :P
11,01No beeps and no boot screen.
*brohoofs everypony*/)
11,01And DDR2 1066 RAM.
Shizuka is like a large volume of hydrogen
oh god when was Mundo added to the bots .....
The "no beeps" bit is the most worrying. It implies that literally nothing else is working, or getting reached.
well if i could spare the one im using right now i would
If I understand anything.
Who?
Nittany_Discord, is your hard drive making a noise when it boots up?
11,01Yes.
Oh wait you on LoL
?
Dr.Mundo big purple guy
Yeah yeah
11,01Wait.
dude, are you using my motherboard or something, sounds just like mine
11,01You mean does it click? No.
A large volume of hydrogen isn't all that scary. Now, if you were to compress the hydrogen into one big hydrogen bomb, then you'd have Shizu.
clicks, whirs, etc
don't forget to add D'aaaaws
11,01http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM2Plus/M3A32MVP_DeluxeWiFiAP/ <- My gaming PC's motherboard.
Hmmmm...mm-hmmmmm...that does indeed look like a computer thingy.
mines similar era but gigabyte
*grabs bucket of water and pours it on Sumica*
I can certify that it's probably a computer part.
:3
sonicandmario85: ...You're aware of the "don't harass mods" rule, right?
11,01Either way, it's something I can't afford to fix.
i was joking
11,01I can't afford a replacement MB.
/me winces
cant you guys take a freaking joke?
11,01Likely can't afford a replacement power supply.
this doesnt really help you at the moment but if you do have to buy a new one i would avoid asus, their after sales support is a joke
Shizu isn't that volatile.
11,01Reikim: We know he's joking.
13depends on the day
11,01Don't backseat mod.
k
I was just afraid of something bad happening, that's all. Like when we bug Val for ponies.
Well, I'd say everyone has their moments but you just don't strike me as the explosive sort.
But sorry, yeah.
When we bug Val for ponies, we get ponies
Don't see the problem
G3 is best G
11,01You get ponies. Just not G4.
I thought this was common knowledge
11,01Lol.
That's the problem.
what if you beg for G4 ponies? XD
@ValTheJean: g3.6 tea party ponies Now?
The most explosive chemical compunds don't react easily.
*compounds
we get best raindow ash, stylish rainbow dash :3
@ValTheJean: spiderman now?
he's not here
13i can blow up.. i just try hard not to..
But when they do, they release the most energy.
i know. If he was here, i wouldn't ask him
bonjoue
*r
Allo RAWRity. Ça va?
Genki desu ka?
Reikim: tres bien, et toi?
VAL IS NOT HERE
Hehe
otakon: k
Not always true there
otakon: i know, and i'm relieved
RAWRity: Fatigué, mais heureux.
Some unstable things are quite boomy
otherwise we'd be getting G3.5 LIVE show right now probably while he laughs maniacially
But the most explosive are actually quite stable.
it's sad that I spent 3 years of highschool learning french, and this is the most I've used it since graduation.
Is it not nicer to just think "Stable and nice" Instead of "Potentially hazardous to your health"?
That's why there are tiers of explosives.
We just as a civilisation prefer to use the stable ones cause the unstable tend to be very
RDADIS RDADIS
Start with a highly-reactive but less potent explosive. Use that to trigger a reaction in a second tier explosive, and use that to start a reaction in a third, extremely potent explosive.
hoooo
RAWRity: Only three? Huh.
Reikim: yep, French I, French II, and Honors French III
The Internet is extremely useful when you're bored.
RAWRity: Ah, so that's how they organize it in the US.
RAWRity: Here I got the option to do an immersive program from Grade 5.
Suddenly Stargate
STREAM
GOD THAT SCARED ME
Reikim: well, depends on the school. My school ran on a "Traditional" schedule. 6 classes that you took for the entire school year. Others had "Block" scheduling. 4 classes for 1/2 the year, 4 other classes the second half
omg the buffer destroyed the stream
you could also opt to take French or Spanish I over 2 years in middle school, to get one of your credits out of the way.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SUMICA
Just about to go to bed
Then SG1
RAWRity: The latter is predominant in the high school system up here. I think it works rather well, and was dismayed when I found out they changed it for middle-school students.
00,10oh hi dari
Ohai
no sleep fgor you
00,10not sure why so buffer
livestram
dat dari
Eeyup.
Reikim: for 2 years, we had a hybrid schedule. 5 classes on "Traditional", while 1 class was block, so we had 7 credits at the end of the year.
hey there everypony! How's everypony doing?
thus, of the 22 credits required for graduation, i had 20 of them at the start of senior year. I just needed English 12 and a 4th math credit.
RAWRity: Even that makes sense. What the board chose for middle school was completely nonsensical. The students get six periods a day, and each day of the week what they have per period is different.
00,10You can not "fix" a woman
IKR
Can't be fun to schedule, isn't fun for the students to keep track of, and yet they claim it's the most effective way to run things.
You can fix her sink?
whats this?
Reikim: well taht's just silly. Though I believe franch has something like that, though it's more comporable to the university schedule setup.
oh stargate?
/me 11,01fixes
yep stargate
i loved this show :)
Reikim: well, in some states over here, they're considering eliminated summer vacation. Instead, it would just be a 3 weeks break during the summer, and they'd attend school 4 days a week rather than 5.
lol
I never watched much stargate :(
R.I.P. Don Davis
Mon francais est mauvais. Apres 5 ans, je seulement peux dire "Je me rends"
owlicious: I graduated HS only a year ago, and I only understand part of that sentence.
Thank you, public education.
to be fair, i misspelled a lot of that
Doesn't help that bits of it are maybe wrong, but don't quote me on that.
Actually you spelled it all correctly.
Just without the accents.
lol
i mean the grammar and conjugation
11,01It shoots poo.
She speaks, she dies.
I'm guessing the jist is: "My french is rather bad, after 5 years I only remember...."
Make me a sammich
...how to say "I surrender"
ah.
Grammar is very close, as far as I can tell. Congrats with that.
I wonder exactly what their ways are.
what are we watching?
ewww
RAWRity :I
:D
lol
et quoi je dire "J'avais peloter son mere"
"My french is bad. After five years, I can only say 'blurg'"
blurg
:p
I say blurg because phrases like "Je me rends" are a pain in the ass to translate.
Blaurgh
owlicious: You...shovelled your mom?
oh lookie it's Stargate
pfff
oops
basically I just remember "Je T'aime" = "I Love You"
So how about that Stargate?
The one I can't watch?
Good for impressing the ladies, that.
not the best availability back then
You can't? Why not?
what is this?
Yay Stargate :)
Dovah: your mother's sex tape
Stream isn't playing nice with my connection, unfortunately. And theoretically I should be finishing my editing, or maybe playing a bit of Bioshock.
Cocain is hell of a drug
RAWRity: uhhhmmm
that's my new answer to peopel who ask "what's on stream" from now on.
Finish what you should be doing. :P
RAWRity: Is this everyone's mother's sex tape?
Same for anybody who asks what the movies for BMN are.
00,10Surly this wont come back to bite you in the ass at all RAWRity
Behold, bronies: the wonders of a good work ethic.
Someone that isnt RAWRity what is this?
it's really RAWRity's mothers sex tape, he's just trying to defelct shame
tasty tasty head-dress
Dat ominously specific denial.
okay then...
13work ethic? you mean that thing where you just do work?
ponibas: sadly my mother passed away before she was able to complete her sex tape. Sad really, as I've read the script for it and it seemed a fantastic project.
That guy looks like ScootaChicken.
13you crazy
00,10I could also be less lazy and make simple tags with desktopponies for each show. Like some people have recomended
Oddly, it's far easier to write 13 000 words than it is to read through the same making edits.
Looks middle eastern/Arabic
Meanwhile: dafuq
11,01I completed RAWRity's sex tapes in private.
ScootaChicken: Have you seen the guy I mean?
I mean you'd think that the latter would be easier, requiring far less writing, but on average it tends to be more strenuous.
Which one Meanwhile?
I wonder what the feminists think of this episode?
Meanwhile: Not watching stream >:
11,01Or his mom's.
Fine, do work, then do Bioshock. :P
And can't watch it for various reasons.
Nittany_Discord: good work! But we want his mother's sex tapes
11,01I did his mom's sex tapes.
Eeeeeeh, fine.
11,01I'll be the next Kim Kardashan when I release them.
11,01:p
00,10any thing to get in a dress eh nitt?
don't have intercourse with tapes belonging to his mother
or did you produce them?
What is with talk of a sex tape? Dafuq?
WHAT
11,01I don't know how to respond to that Sumica.
it's on the stream. It's very well produced
this is normal conversation AttacktheAndalite
Rape
d3rb: Normal?
13do not know what men have against dresses
Alister: Look, it's not as bad as it seems. It's just RAWRity being silly.
-_-
very normal
Welp
Or just kidnap
Shizuka: the hairy legs?
Oh...kay....
13shave silly
11,01Shizuka: *shrug*
Shizuka: I happen to look splendid in a gown.
what Nittany_Discord is referring to is the B-roles and test footage they managed to get before my mother's untimely passing. Sadly, while the film can be spliced together a bit to get the skeleton plot of it, it doesn't hold up to m mother's vision.
Shizuka: It's the draught. Gets chilly.
Shizuka: With wearing them?
Shizuka: We have reasons for keeping those regions warm, thank you very much.
Shizuka: they are girlish. Real men wear kilts
11,01I don't mind wearing dresses though it's actually against my religion.
11,01It's more of a role thing.
Shizuka: I just don't have the right proportions to pull off a dress. The heels though? I can fucking stroll in those things.
Oooh, religion. Let's jump on that wagon.
So now the chat has turned to dresses.
Reikim: ok
11,01It's complicated.
I love religion. Interesting gateway into the human psyche.
religion dress chat
MY BROTHER TRIED TO INDOCTRINATE ME USING MY FEAR OF DEATH
Oh God no
do you mean drugs?
Let's not bring religious talk into chat.
Let's not get into religion
how about we combine religion and dresses and criticise the pope's fashion sense.
Abandon thread
11,01But I personally don't mind wearing dresses. I'd just look terrible.
8,6I hate having a work ethic sometimes
Small world dari.
But religion is fun!
Nittany_Discord: o_O
Ridin on cars!
Pfft, I wish I had something to have a work ethic for.
I wear dresses....
13jumpnshoot man
Well, the pope's outfit is sort of a uniform. It's a robe anyway.
No you don't. You really don't.
Shizuka: egoraptor too?
betrayal
Shizuka: you have good taste
13you don't.. people start taking advantage of you if you do
anyway I'm back
kind of bummed out
11,01There's a line in the old testament against crossdressing.
hi otakon
wb otakon
You start off working on it and you're like "Hey, this is fun!" But then it gets kind of tedious and it stops being fun and starts being, yknow, work.
I'd rather be doing something than sitting around wishing for a meteorite to crash into my house.
11,01But women do it anyway.
what, the Cain and Abel part?
Hi otakon
Nittany_Discord: ?
But you get this weird itching feeling at the back of your mind all the time. Like you should be doing something.
theres alot of lines in that book probably worth ignoring
no wait, that was identity theft
And then you can't let it go even though you know you should.
molest face
You want some pound cake?
RAEP
Still.
IDLIKESOMEPOUNDCAKE!
Dude, close your fucking legs.
All of this talk of homosexuality and crossdressing in this brony community. Aren't we proving the anti-bronies right like this?
I hate being bored all damn day.
I prefer the viewpoint that the old testament should be taken not literally but allegorically.
OnDaCountOfKandarihu: Who cares.
11,01A lot of my views weren't changed by becoming a brony.
wow, these fuckers are NOT kidding around
OnDaCountOfKandarihu: I'd say it's better to discuss what we feel we want to, rather than letting the whims of people only interested in hating and deriding us control what we say and do so as to appease them.
I can't wait until she kicks their asses
Reminds me of my first date.
lol
OnDaCountOfKandarihu, who cares hat others think
13build an enigma machine

Mmm. I found that becoming a brony reinforced my pre-existing views.
Sumica: ballroom blitz?
GODDAMN YOU LAG!
What others think about us defines how we are treated.

Challenge accepted.
otakon: blitzkreig Bop?
Gold Weapon Horses!

Challenge accepted in the second one.

tough choice
11,01I know! Maid Discord should show up at Shizuka's house :p
13http://mckoss.com/Crypto/Enigma.htm
Yeah, Meanwhile, best thing to do is teach yourself something completely irrelevant to your life but still interesting.
OnDaCountOfKandarihu: what others think of us defines THEM, not us. we define ourselves through our own perceptions and observations. If we were to modify how we acted so as to fit what brony-haters consider "normal" we would ultimately be letting them dictate our actions, rather than being our own selves.
for the saxy time !
You got any ideas that a stupid can do?
11,01And then I blow everything.
