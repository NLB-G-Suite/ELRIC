Could've had a sequel easy enough, but I prefer it as is.
It was a very beautiful movie, one of the most underrated classics IMO
Wait, this movie had a sequel? When?
never really though this movie would be enough for a sequel
11,01It didn't have a sequel. It was supposed to.
thank goodness it wasn't made,
Twilights gonna speak to ya'll in my account now.
I think they should of stopped the Shrek franchise after Shrek 2.

SHE DID EXPLODE TWICE
/me tries to explode
I WOULD IMPLODE TWICE
dat spike face
/me fails
But of course!
when I heard rainbow dash say "careful derpy" I exploded twice
he got to hug Shy
Nothing would quite match the moment Derpy was named and then talked - THEN we exploded twice.
Look at those tail extentions!
Dat FOG

In Tribes: Ascend, the Juggernaut's MIRV Launcher shoots shells that really DO explode twice.
...sort of

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3317/

Okay.
/me sacks Twilight
Twilight: EHY did you do that?
DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM
You DARE request for ponies?!
Twilight: stop asking, it wont do any good
Time to send in the hounds.
08,01i was thinking about the problem of mass in that way when i was 16, 17
/me suffocates Twilight
08,01obviously, knowing nothign about particle physics
Saturn: well t idea/theory has been around for a while
good point
the
why yall gotta be haters

Aw fran.
this show's lack of chins disturbs me.
08,01sagas: aye; i'd never heard of it, thoguh
korean butt specialist?
08,01i just overthought things at school
butt braile
08,01because i had no friends
Saturn: I'll get the trombone...
08,01so imagine how talkative i am
Finding a Higgs is like finding a needle in a field of Hay stacks
08,01and now imagine that channlled in
XD

that little girl is hilarious
Don't be frightened, I have a gun!
speaking of links no stream soooo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct_3_ZB3ohw&feature=related
Saturn: They part that confuses me is that they have a weight for it.
yes don't be frightened of the man with a gun
huh
Saturn: How does the particle that gives mass to particles has mass
The skidooch.
sorry guys did not know the stream was on
can you forgives me?
particle pyhsics seems like a hard battle to win
Da heeeeeeeell is this?
Twilight welcome! I would send you a link to the Welcome Song, but there are no vid links during stream

But didn't fix that one little plothole?
Clearly I am not trying hard enough. Although pony weird is more difficult to come by :/

Those are the novels, right? I think I saw those around. Am I able to read those as stand-alones?

11,01I can't :<
http://youtu.be/WF9CS3L_ezw
Hey, I'll give it a go.
any other mods that arent AFK and they can stream?
11,01It's not starting up properly.
11,01It's not doing the POST beeps.
how far does it get?
Should I read them in order chronologically by timeline or by publishing?
11,01It spins up the HD for a couple of seconds, and then everything quits.
13publishing wise it went Atrus, Ti'ana, D'ni
awesome
13Book of Atrus does a good job introducing the world
Good place to start, then.
11,01The computer stays on, but nothing happens.
just happened out of thwe blue, no recent changes?
11,01I never tried streaming from my laptop.
11,01I don't trust my laptop for streaming.
I guess it was kind of inevitable that someone would abuse that power. An unfortunate side trait of humanity.
13eeyup
The more I learn of this Myst thing the more I decide "Eh, too much stuff."
11,016+ years old.
O_o
MODS ARE YOU THERE?
11,01I haven't tried recovery disks.
have you tried running from live cd?
Nice variation on the traditional "abusing power" plot.
it might fix it
Try punching it?
checked all connections are secure i assume?
11,01They're secure.
Maybe they'll take RealMyst and do the same thing to the later Myst games. That would probably work very nicely.
:3
11,01No POST beeps.
Mod or standalone?
11,01There should have been POST beeps even then.
thats not good
computers cant run without ram

Wow. Now that takes dedication.

GNIGHT everypony
That's an intense amount of work.
Maybe you should try downloadmoreram.com ?
And amazing results.
different bits can be the bottleneck. sometimes its ram, sometimes it's CPU, sometimes it's HD read speed...
\m/
Exclusive? really?
and I AM OFF
8,6love WoT, but you have to read them all at the same time or you lose track of it all
S'what I do with my hand when I'm listening but having to contribute.
Make spiderman web hands.

Path of Daggers. Too many side characters suddenly being important that really don't add much to the overall plot.
13nice try though
8,6it's a pony
DUNGEON 13 HOURS
it has 3 diamonds and a purple mane.
8,6still waiting for the last book, author died and his son is finishing it >.<
or do you mean an ashleigh
is anyone streaming anything?
His son?
8,6was his son and another author that's a friend of the family
11,01Ryunosuke: If it was a HD failure, there would be noises from the HD. There are no odd noises coming out.
8,6yeah, and even then it's huge
I really want to finish the series, but I just can't get past Path of Daggers. Am I missing anything if I skip ahead a bit?
no, that's too soon
cpu?
11,01All of the fans work.
8,6it's been a few years since I've read them
8,6when the last ones come out I'll have to reread them all >.<
11,01What else would cause the computer not to beep when it starts up?
i don't know enough there anyway
Oof. I couldn't imagine doing that.
8,6busted speaker?

00,10Nitt are you geting power at all?
11,01Yes.
graphics card? hardrive?

It wouldn't be graphics. HD problem is possible.
did you read the hard drive from another computer?

also speakers dont affect anything they just make sound from the computer thats their only use
mmmhmmm

senheiser > all headphones
The computer has built-in speakers for that.

11,01It reaches HD spin-up, then goes idle.
11,01No beeps and no boot screen.
*brohoofs everypony*/)
11,01No. I need something that fits a AMD Phenom.
11,01And DDR2 1066 RAM.
The "no beeps" bit is the most worrying. It implies that literally nothing else is working, or getting reached.
If I understand anything.
11,01Yes.
Oh wait you on LoL

Yeah yeah
11,01Wait.

Some unstable things are quite boomy
otherwise we'd be getting G3.5 LIVE show right now probably while he laughs maniacially
But the most explosive are actually quite stable.
it's sad that I spent 3 years of highschool learning french, and this is the most I've used it since graduation.
That's why there are tiers of explosives.
We just as a civilisation prefer to use the stable ones cause the unstable tend to be very
RDADIS RDADIS
Start with a highly-reactive but less potent explosive. Use that to trigger a reaction in a second tier explosive, and use that to start a reaction in a third, extremely potent explosive.

i mean the grammar and conjugation

I'm guessing the jist is: "My french is rather bad, after 5 years I only remember...."
