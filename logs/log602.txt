05nope
05casue the coma isnt casued genetically
05mhm
or just die from old age to be more realistic
neither are memories like the ones hes getting , but the way thisis presented hes gonna get coma memories, and might psychosomaticly be affected
05i dunno
smoochyboochy
05i guess the memories are inprinted in a way some how and were copied over when they took the sample to grow him in the first place
/me slaps t'pal upside the head

hes pretty much at his own funeral
odd
erm...
this is song...
*this song...
ok wtf ? xixis on earth ?
05i dunno
hookers 0.0
whores in my star trek
i can see why this had some low ratings
:$
ok i suspect timetravel , cause this looks way too shitty to be post warp earth , even early post warp earth
0.0
are we sure this is star trek
first time watching star trek, VERY bad impression
me too
although i saw the other episodes but with out the into ho would i even know this is star trek
dat whore
RAPE
did it really need a suitcase?
there was barely any money!
was that someones holodeck fantasy
logic : D
05fyi
05thats basically the timelord
how are the aliens even having any money ? and a warehouse ? on earth !
OH, can we watch dr.who later?
some star trek thing
yes take the alien to pre warp earth
i don't see how anything could go wrong
and then the silence shows up
still...
and pushed back development at warp by at least 100 years
you should think that they would be able to use technology which is totally outdated from their own :P
they've like...never seen a car...thus they don't know how to drive one
hmm
supply nearing depletion with 60 years left of supplies and a growing consumpion rate ? hardly makes sense
i have a problem with the stream showing up
you don't say
it says sorry the requesed channel cant embedded on this domain name
Reason: Domain protection enabled by broadcaster.
no
strange
that happens when you have referers disabled
no. i have only 2 browsers.
the worst one
and the good one

hi everypony!
hello
Greetings
been awhile since I woke up this early. What's streaming?
wait.... how'D he do that
good
unless it IS Enterprise and therefore...why are you streaming that?
Needles. Ugh
I've never seen it
i got a iphone 4 today!
looks like someone had their first run-in with meatspin recently
now i'm curious
/me wakes up at the hospitle
i didnt know something like that existed
I thought "Fluttershy" and "Sonic Spinball"
I still cannot listen to that song anymore.
you spin me right round?
And no I don't
and nothing even remotely horrifying
why don't you just try adding a .com to it
you sure? i find alot of things terrifying
I don't
or that
I still have 0 intentions of spreading such horrifying material
its not that bad
I've ignored more people that way
there are worse things out there.
how horrifying
Its fluttershy though.
its a weird sort of yellow
Fluttershy should NOT have a penis
but maybe thats just bad resolution
there we go
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4040/ this should change the subject
doesnt work
I tried it, it was the first link
made me laugh
:P
lol okay
Well I got to do something to help
*sigh*
COuld someone PM it to him already. I dont wanna
05stop talking about meatspin already
could you have this conversation in a p.m That would be much appreciated
In other news, my fanfiction is still waiting approval. Roughly 3,000 words completed.
whats it about?
Like I said: "Not this again"
no worries, it already ended
oh... found it
it's not THAT scary
Good. Now we shall never speak of this again.
0512
05i run 1 dvd around this time
...
aw. I have like an hour before I gotta' go.
after this*
I've heard Enterprise was the worst, but I wouldn't know. I moved across country while it aired. I think Voyager was the last I saw.
05the first 2 seasons were meh
05the second 2 were actually good
ahh
Everytime I hear pilgrimage, I think Mass Effect
I like valve
whats he have against valve?
I mean, maybe it makes sense to be mad over their recent change to the EULA
oh no. It's one of those episodes
He hates L4D too
I dislike Battlefield
05then i ask
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, personally. TF2 is cartoony on purpose.
05why should his oppinion matter.
battlefield isn't really all that much more realistic then anything else
Unreal Tournament 2003. GET SOME!
if he wants to get mad over bad realism he should focus on strategy games
how shamweful
He liked RDR.
05if he still thinks BF3 is more realistic
Though don't show him Mod Z
05then you can officially call him out on bullshitting
Day Z
Dat unrealistick
:O
thats why you play multiplayer
05i dont like playing tf2 the boits are dumb
05bots*
05its a simmilar argument
As sppn as I got TF2 i put pony mods into it
soon
00,02quiet in here

But the enemy would have saw the weapons were offline earlier

I would like to haev photoshop, but when I got my own bank account I stopped pirating things
Did I start something o.0?
Yarr harr fiddle do dee.

/me awkwardly hugs
is that SAI tool thing free or do you have to pay for it like i had to with photostop
:3
SAI costs-- 67 dollars at the current rate
goddamn
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2581/
i could buy food with that much
hehe
05then again sai does give you a 30 day trial
:D
http://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/ pretty cool
lolipad
I tried Corel Painter first- but I bought sai instead, since I liked it more-
bah, i'll just stick with paper drawn scan traces
interesting species, those denobulans
:P
Great I learned how to draw with my finger. Now I must learn to draw with a mouse. 6_9
^
Hey, does anyone here own a Intuos tablet?
05yeah intous 4
i got a wamboo bamboo tablet
I'm considering buying one- and was wondering if it was- rougher? Like the pen had more friction, like paper?
lolwamboo
bad cgi
It was a pain learning to draw with my finger because of the sensor in an\ ipad
My current tablet is very much like drawing with a felt pen or something- very slick
INSEEEECTS
05the one i ues is a bit softer to casue firction
Hehehe
What're you doing?
You were trying SAI?
Forget it I got it
Okay, good good
she's a hallucination. wnna bet?

I think I remember this episode
I think they did something similar with Voyager
Except it was the ex-Borg chick
helping illusions are a popular thing... they apear in a lot of series
i remember one in Bones
i doubt this illusion is helpful
it's calming to know you're not alone
or is it
or to think for that matter

I HATE ENTERPRISE
05why?
Haters gonna hate.
BECAUSE IT'S A STAR WARS RIPOFF
This was my star trek, I've never seen the other ones
05oh

not too bad
05you mean you hate star trek

Wrekrage
If one wants to turn off the stream, you hit popout and close the window.
05Eli
05you are mistaken
Capiche
Capeesh. If i was you,i would stream zombi 3 (1988)
star wars is fantasy anyway. not really ground for comparison here
no i totally understand you
05seeing me rage is something entirely different
I don't want to know-
D:
well now i'm afraid
Compare this with Texas Chainsaw Massacre
wut are we watching? :3
i smell slight residue of trollium
comparing star trek to texas chainsaw massacre is idiotic though
I know
08,01hmm
08,01you're playing from doovde?
:O woah
i see you changed the stream source xD
08,01you have mulp?

Well I just completely kicked everyone's arse in MK7, *Feels bad that he went MLG on 'dem randomers*
08,01maybe later i'll stream doovde of mulpfim
Sorry for all this rage.But i don't really like Star Trek
05noo need to be a total twat about it
08,01Dark_Horst: doovde! play in doovde player!

08,01i have 48 inch lucudutv
LCD TV?
you're drunk, arent you?
08,01yes, lucudutuv

i have a crt tv
Go clop to porn somewhere else dark_horst-
08,01yes, but i also have mulpfim in the huud

It's abo respecting the stream, not blindly liking it. Which is easy to do- I think
^
I RESPECT THE STREAM
05no allcaps
Sorry
Sometimes, every step you take is into a rake
I know
I like rakes.
tribbles?
08,01*not
Cool
Eew
05Saturn: i dont worke like that
Or sometimes you take a step into a rake but catch the rake before it hit you in the face
05takes moer to make me dislike someone
05im more indifferent
stuttering for anyone?
That's a good mod attitude, though. Some --sites have really angry mods that start more flames than they put out
For me it is
*couch*4chan*couch*
it is for me too- but I'm on a 0.6mbps line
I'm just random but mostly quiet
I tend to write a lot-
I like to read alot.

THAT PHASER WASNT SET TO HUG!:o

Set that phaser hug boy
A phaser set to hug could potentially be used for self stimulation of an erotic nature.
or- a platonic nature
ie. "I want a hug."

Renegade Archer
Saturn , didn't you study Adio Engineering?
I think I'm going to start getting into Star Wars. Good/bad idea, and any recommendations?
/me shines light in Alien's face
Star Wars < Star Trek
05i find both enjoyable
^
But still I enjoy trek more
STAR GATE
STAR WARS
STAR TREK
http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/295/c/7/little_pip_by_kooner01-d4dl915.png
also, star wars isnt even remotely similar to star trek. just saying
05STAR SHIP TROOPERS

Oh how could I forget that one
Battlestar galatica
Star fox
Doesn't start with star, but it has star in it
^
^ no
Yes

Doesn't start with star
05pelase explain
isn't there a Movie that has both Star Wars and Star Trek Parodys in it?

Saturn , didn't you study Adio Engineering?
05heh
08,01Lil_B: i know about it; i do it as a hobby
she's emotional?
Vulcan emotions>
trellium is getting to her
08,01Serenity: drawing
08,01i can't draw
Saturn oh, I was going to buy some Studio Headphones and I search for some advice :)
I see
Yeah, but that takes alien knowledge
And crayons
She broke his iPad
:D
this is wy T'pol is going crazy http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Trellium
Saturn just Studio Headphones for making music at home (an accasionly listeing to music or movies with it)
/me backs up slowly
lol
FUN FACT: Android runs on Lunix
I've always wondered, why isn't the trouch screen on the 3DS not 3d?
Saturn I narrowed it down to 3 models based on reccomendations and the little eadphones FAQ I read
I was told never to get headphones for mixing
comprimised*
hi
woot! my fanfic finally got approved like an hour ago
:)
Well I'm more comfortable with moon rocks personally
dat Hyppocratic oath
Shouldn't she already be able to access emotions (I thought Volcans just suppressed their emotions and that they actually have stronger emotions than humans)
I'm assuming the touchscreen isn't 3D as a cost-benefit thing
I'm actually quite surprised my first comment was "it is over-descriptive"
das dum
cardassians?
das relly relly dum
I must be doing a good job.
sure, they could hack together another 3D screen and make it work with touch, but you don't gain much from it
damn, they evil
desperate more like it
05Sundaysmile: i thoguth that first too, but no

I hope they find Luna up there
Power Rangers are best pony.

that bastard had some style
/me is pillowed.
/me nuzzles back
umm..
I have come to a realization about the shows I thought were stupid when I was a kid :3
HIS PHASER ISNT SET TO HUG!!
LOL
it was a sign :D
hehe yeaah
I still have it, under my screen
Always destined to be one of us!
Hehe, it was fun to refind it when we moved, yeah
and dexter's lab and powerpuff girls
Oh I loved those shows-
Me too
05she used to have a daycare
*rehearsing, plays LOW. About 1 note every 3 seconds*
>_>
05msut have been
05atlaest more than 10 years ago
I used to hit two rocks together and say "now kiss"
08,01must have been a G1
Never even watched the show. Too busy watching Digimon
I recall watching some G1 when I was a kid and thinking "huh, this ain't half bad" :D
Inb4 those people don't get home.
05msut have been longer than that
05fuc ki cant recall off hand when she died... but it was 2 or 3 years before that
I arrive just in time to see the end credits, lol. XD
Must. Resist. Enterprise and work on story
08,01G1 cartoons are nothing special, but they're not bad at all
05last ep on the disk
05then we'll seew hat i do
Saturn: well, at least they were dealing with baddies
08,01Wrek: more scifi
We need some sea ponies
Saturn: enjoying yourself? :)
coooooool
hi
Now I must see 1st episode
I went to Five Guys a few months ago and I noticed that one of the cashier guys had a Deathly Hallows tattoo on his left wrist. We high-fived
They cut America's wang
/me holds his arm around Saturn. time to stop RPing
denied.
08,01fluffle_puff: they devolved florida?
the A team?
Now I want a deathly hallows tattoo...but I don't like needles.
for the a team
lol
Oh, this -is- Star Trek.
A team? Where?
she was like "HOLD ME DOWN!"
08,01hahaha
LOL
Why the ribs?
08,01what did she get tattooed?
she has many on her arms and upper chest too
a local performer that has inspired her a lot
just colours and a silhouette
05jsut played with the thought though
it is
08,01[Alpha]: i'm never drunk! i don't drink!
2:41AM. Damn time flew.
08,01well, i do
08,01but not often
05seth macfarlane worked on this
good on ya, saturn
05bet you didnt know that
Well then you just contradicted yourself there
I'm probably going to get tatto of the triforce on my hand :3
can I Link to a Song on Dropbox I'm working on to get some opinions?
08,01i'm actually seriously considering getting a tattoo of Britannia somewhere
:3
I would like a tattoo but it goes against my moral code
^
*Which one?
05Saturn if it wont look good, dont do it
05no matter how nice it would be
Not sure
05and i fail to see a moral dilemma behind tattoos
05MegaMoonShine: no its just enterprise
05not TNG
Not when you are me
she's becoming a Romulan!
08,01Wrek: aye; i'm still trying to work out whether i like the idea
I see :$
awwww, she sad
or anywhere that'd be seen by a job interviewr
yes you can
Saturn: Riiiight
:O
you can Staurn
but it's not recommended
it's painful
Saturn: I believe it's possible but it hurts
Saturn: As a matter of fact you can.
but possible
Tattooing is painful full stop
08,01just a thought... i can't think of any tattoo that'd look good there
excuse the language
I bet it burns when he pees.
EW
not because of the pain, but because of the skin stretching, it disfigures the tattoo
a submarine
08,01and it'd mean i'd have to wave my genitals about in public for people to see
Wait a second, is that startrek....BTW, Hi everypony :)
Saturn: Seems normal
yeah, it's--a pretty bad idea, EXPENSIVE and bad
:D
08,01and though i've not got any qualms about doing that myself, i doubt the police would agree
facial tattoos are also a no no, since as you age, the tattoo's disfigure because of the skin changes
Oh yeah BUCK....You guys doing well with that?
05Daygon: its tated on the front page ^_^
08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: aye, stuff's going well
i see
HAI GUYS

Pony dreams are best dreams

They have similar cheeks....
My mum was like "Right, you're 15, and you are watching a fucking 10 year old girl show?" My reaciton: "Shut yer fucking mouth. "
They'd probably be cool about it though
I never told them though, it was just like "hey you guys sshould check this show out, it's great"
The second oldest. I'm the first and he doesn't care much for it.
A bomb.
WARPFIRE

There's always something fucked up with someone

Hello everypony

05btw saturn
Saturn ikr

05not yet
08,01Wrek: we're sharing a room; i think i'll be able to recognise you at the event

08,01also, what's Brotherhood of Steel?
05fallout related
you dont know? blasphemy!
hehe
Brotherhood of Steel was an organization of agressive technology horders in F1-2 and 3 and NV
Saturn: whatever it is, it's now brotherhoof of steel
and their logo is awsm
05if you ask me the "PonificatioN" of brotherhood of steel is completly uneccesary
Apple Jack's Rangers
dammit Saturn, you know unsettingly little about awesome franchises
india?
05i mean really
though in NV and 3 they are less hostile I think- and in 2 they're not so..agressive
BACK
I don't they're ponified in any FoE fics
08,01Dark_Horst: i don't play computer games
you're mssing out
05fuck now i got the urge to play some NV
playyyyyy
Well, not the name. Right?
05Dark_Horst
05i mean the name
ohkay then
05brotherhood
05they use the same term
05in the pony universe
/me is away: DOOM
they call them steelrangers
not the brotherhood of steel?
/me suddenly unsure
oh right-
but I swear No one dubbed them Brotherhood of steel
but steelranger is the common term used for one of the group
oh right, yes
05still
05brotehrhoof of steel makes no logical sense
yeah-
05otehr ponificatiosn of names thsu far has made sense
I have yet to try the unofficial patch for fallou 2, that puts in a lot of cut material and removes bugs-
I own all of the fallouts
except the playstation one-
crikey
it WAS
is there one that removes the time limit?
yesterday
!
Sale over?
pretty fuckin cheap, i might add
the time limit in f2 is like 200 years?
I can't remember being hit by the time limit- let me check on the wiki
=.=
its 13 years
not 3
dem ponies be multiplying
I've actually reached that 13 years on some occasions because I was just wandering around try to get the special encounters
oh 13 years-
Aquatics speak...sonar, for past tense.
I've already looked over 2000 t-shirts
after that I had no time left to wipe everyone out in every settlement :D
GTG LATER EVERYPONY :)
Bye capslock.
well, I'm trying ot find a complete changelog for the restoration project
but- only found individual patch logs yet
well I had the ammo and the guns, just not the time (I wanted to make sure I've done every quest)
Well there was a lot for the other characters but not much for twilight =.=
http://derpy.me/Vgc8K this is the closest I could find and yes I am frankly irritated by that.
then again... Fluttershy's cutenes, Rainbow's coolnes and Pinkies crazynes steal the spotlight
punched
Fluttershy is a background pony.
And a very bad one.
I can't find anythign about the time limit- but there's probably a way to break it
08,01t'pol likes messing with them
Fluttershy is not an interesting pony.
oh, this is going to escalate
Nah-
Lagging for me
05Dark_Horst: dont count on it
and that's--the end of that
have fun. i'll be back in 10
hello ppl
I do enjoy them all, in different ways
Helloo
hmm star trek me thinks ?
uni is ew
They are all being played for fools.
Manipulation at its finest.
Finest? She doesn't sound believable at all.
I'm going to look through the entire archive of t-shirts and then I'm done.
or not
Oh shit! :O
Ooh, I remember this
No.
I've finished looking through the whole archive of shirts
05yes
damnit
He really was?
never send redshirts on awake missions
05well
05he was the equivalent
are we discussing foe?
Gege
yeah
man i loved that
read it in like a couple weeks
me too
ever played metro 2033?
read it as it came out. the cliffhangers were agonizing
Took me quite a while to read
ahh that sucks
I read
something special about this post apocalypse things
I kinda read it as it came out too
oh yea
many times over
http://derpy.me/pxg3Q this one is nice
I haven't restarted metro yet- but I have to finish it
much fangasmw as had
I was gonna read Project Horizons but never really got around to it
05i enjoyed NV more than i enjoyed FO3
05it was a nice adition
And I'm done no more shirts for me =.=
I liked the GAMEplay and --atmosphere more, but the main story not as much
sitting on heroes now too. bit too depressing at times, but interesting none the less
definately worth playing
05but both games lacked features from eachother
agreed
i like the concept of having a dumb fuckup as the maincharacter
hehe
F2 has the most fun dumbfuck mainchar option
Ooooh shit
if you have under 2 in int you can't speak properly
lol
thats hilarious
I remember screaming "Grr!! Me hungry!" to people
thats pure genious
I looved that
Well shit.
I think same happens in fallou 1
Later, gonna go get food
ded
I lsot most of my int in a mentats..overdose
I'm skeptical about atking a nap at this moment because last time I went to sleep for 6 hours having several different dreams
Brb
taking
Oh wow, that corner got crouded XD
star trek enterprise
hmm
tapeworm. why not
Derpy is secretly half bat :D
awesome charachter
08,01hehehe
Rofl. Dat medical procedure.
08,01the ol' tapeworm diet
:D
just saying it
if it ever comes
i doubt that
i think nv is supposed to be f4
I live in hope-
in a way
well NV was different company and all- but maybe
same mechanics as 3
oh god- I hope htey don't die the way Blizzard did
one could argue that a 4 wouldnt be out of place
traditional
?
I wasn't aware Blizzard died.
whatnow?
well, not really
but after wow they've only made like 3 games
one failed paratrooper drop meansup to 70%
nv had awesome content itemwisew
Kinda- I hope they avoid horrible tings like that optimus prime
but the whole cowboy-thing just didnt fit
lol i just came back after an afk break for 10 minutes and the first thing i see are talking fish people with arms
nuff said
you could get cars in f2 O.o
yeah
HAAAAAAAAAAAX
not to blow it up I think, not sure
i just loved how the wrecks in 3 and NV blow up
yeahh
oh yea that is epic
This is surprisingly reminiscent of the ME3 Crucible.
this fights alot less epic
if you mute it
hehe
it's based on how it was viewed from the 50s
apparently nuca cola was radioactive before the bombs
08,01DUN DUN DUUUN
*GASP*
08,01</rainbow dash>
i think i just missed the entire episode because of this conversation
hehehe
how do i ping people
yes, palyed it
just write their name
08,01time for some food!
did it work?
the ME3 scenario was completely different
no you have to write it exactly as it is
lol
You have to have all the characetrs in order for it to work
i got stolen
08,01hahahaha
<Vivix>
Saturn, no stealing random ponies
ho you dont need the <
but yes it worked!
yep, there you go
/me 08,01sighs
I step away from my computer and then suddenly I hear rainbow dash
08,01fine
yes i am totally fine with being stolen if i get ice cream
he got disentergated
ill eat it anyway :D
08,01stabbity stab stab
It's "Homemade"
/me is stolen
Nuuuuuue
Hello every pony =D
:D
Waaaait
Is this... enterprise?
yes
yea
allo y'all
Hi dken!
maybe I should just pin the Headphoes I want on a Dart Plate and pick which one I'll by like that -.-
08,01those reptilians are quite hot
Saturn you have some odd tastes
Their "hair" is offputting.
Saturn: you find anything with dacial plates hot
My friends keep telling me to buy headphones--
*faciakl
**facial
DAMMIT
Saturn has some weird fetish
08,01i'm just open minded
THis music just ruins the mood of the scene
but--I don't find THOSE attractive
lol
especially about facial plates
yyeah... this Intro doesn't say "Star Trek" for me XD
/me googles
dat giggle
Pinkie please go
Saturn: A bit too long head for me- but like..you know like.almost like the ones in Alien
they can be--attractive
I cry when kerbals deserve to die :(
NO
Wat iz dis
asari are hot
hot
"im sure"
They want her to decode a missing key to the weapon.
Good thing I shortened my name it used to be 17 characters long
thanks
I heard there is a kickstarter thing for building the enterprise replica
Thanks!
I am going to need speakers before then- but yeah
I'm planning m-Audio speakers
http://derpy.me/aN7xP dww
dawww*
08,01m-audio are quite good
my friends all use m-audio
mmm, glob ice cream <3
so--I figured maybe I should give them a go, I currently use cheap Empire speakers
that scares me a little
oh you mean headphones? hm-
08,01aye
Well, if I buy M-Audio monitors I might aswell look at m-audio headphones too
i like how they did the sphere map
08,01i'm rockin' a pair of Etymotic ER-4Ps
08,01they're *wonderful*
/me googles
lol
The only thing I don't agree with that guide is that that Skullcandy lowest end buds aren't bad for the price point
RE4 vibes anyone?
Oo- those look good Saturn- noise suppression too
Well they are overated and fall apart easily
that had to hurt
I was talking about Skullcandy
08,01Vivix: they cost me about £130, but they usually got for between £200 and £300
I used to use Koss padded earplugs when playing drums, but I can't set up the kithere
08,01Lil_B: professional reference monitors
they should have a painless procedure for the injection
makes it creepier
hm well- if they're good enough for reference monitoring I might consider them for mixing
once you get above 30$ pricepoint, their drivers start becoming shit for the pricepoint
but I've always been told to get monitors for that-
Saturn is Saturn is that similar too Studio work?
08,01for cheap and cheerful, i have a pair of Sennheiser MX470s
08,01they cost me £15, and they're good
08,01not fantastic, but great for the price
hmm-
I was looking aat-
Excuse my slow net
My back >.<
hello?
Hello!
mmyes?
I just scared the crap ouit of my mothyer and she attacked me :D
lol
I'm looking at Audio-Technica ATH-M50, Shure SRH840 and 2 Sennheiser HD Models but I just can't decide
space*
From Sennheiser I'm looking to buy e906 and a betamic-
are their speakers good?
Damn- the shop I frequent no longer carries m-audio
Sennheiser is usually good quality :/ I once had In-Ear Headphones from them at 20€, they were good
but I was looking at the 500 dollar range
ok, 500$ Range isn't my ligue XD
Hehe, well these are speakers and not headphones
so- it's not that bad concidering the competition
t'pol is going crazy
eww star trek?
no srry SLX*
they broke their vulcan
I hate it XD, all 4 Headphones have good Revies and have similar specs >.<

http://www.sound1.com/portal/asp/produktdetalj1.asp?Produkt_ID=4839 I was looking at these
KILL HIM KILL HIM
hai everypony, how you doing? :)
let the bass cannon kick it!
nnot that one- but you can find it on thomann
..right?
05aye
:D
05why thank you
you smoke?
These were the ones I looked at originally: http://www.thomann.de/gb/m_audio_bx8_d2.htm
have you considered buying used speakers?
Nno- not really, but I might look at the usedmarket if I decide on something specific
lol skyla?
wtf
That toy...
O_______________________________________-
Is creepy
dat dari-bot post...
nu please
how can a monitor be made for low sound?
did somebody say more executive meddling?
well, they're not made to play loud, but to play correctly at a comfortable level
whats with the star trek enterprise
i see
makes more sense now:)
oh shit they made another abort-failed abomination?
Depends on his views on premarital boink
aw sheet more lights are flashing
O_O… *goes back to lurking*

AAAAW YEAH
USE ALL THE SHIPS!!!

:D
the Hu-mans

amazed that the enterprise is still in one piece
shoot everything!
They should make a show named Enterprise, the early years. Just all abot building it
Construction workers hanging out
its a tough little ship, the NX-01
It would probably onl run half a season-
05i even have the cap with the NX-01 on it
hehehe
cap?
nice
Allow me to scream nerd
no, that's prety cool
why does no one in the star trek universe has automated defense systems on his ship?
Nerds!
*nerd*
i once had a urge to get a enterprise pizza cutter. that urge passed quickly
I find it ironic that the fish people have the strongest military.
hehehe
lol
`ded
I'm gonna buy a ps/2 keyboard and throw this one out

I feel like someone is about to die
stormtroopers are supposed to be highly trained clones. kind of ironic how easy they die
all he had to do was wait behind a wall
Hehehe
yea
did he die
but they are clones
I never knew they were clones-
maybe
wait, i was right
Oh..right, yes

I think you can order heart many places
05Dark_Horst i wouldnt know
Up north here you can probably eat deer heart-
i guess it is
dear hearts are common eating

Blood pancake

Klingons never surrender
ewwww
No not the mousies! :'(
Yum!
those poor mice
well that's disturbing
tasty
ominous music while eating mice
juicy!
and mood breaking music
http://derpy.me/X61Z-
that's racist!
http://derpy.me/AH812
it seems somwehat logical
and klingons are scared of tribbles
Mice eat klingon for breakfas
tribbles must be some hardass motherfuckers
in soviet russia
/me is back (gone 01:18:12)
derpy is best pony
Tribbles. Tribbles everywhere.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW, i just got flippin killed in skyrim... by an arrow in the knee from a flippin falmer elf
no!
derpy + TTGL : win
Haha
But then he took an arrow to the knee
hey guys :3
But it HAS to be light armor
Hi under!
people should learn to thicken their knee armour if they want to keep their adventuring career
er.... under
most of my armor has no pants
05i prefered the "RP" as the lone sniper
my smithing is like 0..
or 13
I has daedric armor.buck yeah
05MadSurge: umad?
hehe yeah-
/me is now eating a hotdog
I'm an archer using leather armor, but I need something stronger and yet light
yyees- but I haven't found either
the highest in light is dragonscales
oh really? Hmm..
Ohh
?
but I can't heav hevy armor, I'm a hoarder
k makes sense
Boo!
05heh
I didn't die that often-
the only thing that bugs me in Skyrim atm is dragons
Bitch please
i hope this arc finishes sooon, gotta get up early tomorrow
most of them refuse to land- just--they're eeverywhere
Just use some arrows
why are you guys talking about Skyrim?
but then I can carry less
I've always played light characcters in my games, cause I pick up Eeeverything
dwemer ruins are awesome. full of dwarven emtal. good for smiting skil
it negates that too?
i always go light as well more fun
Hm..
yep
if you choose the havy branch, that is
ah-
I've lplayed on and off since release, I'm still level 25
Ha
okay brb my food is a calling
05well thats how you came out
Everypony has
05"please no star trek tomorrow"
05maybe rewording would be in order
Smithing and Enchanting
Okay, I'll do that- I needed something more to do anyway, stopped main questline
good ones to use
80 level ups
yep, smithing and enchanting is a must
I also suggest Sneak
05i was sad to hear the DLC would be console only
05i hope that has changed now though
But only like 50 skill points
Dawnguard?
05would loooove crossbows
05nice
it came out--last week
05ill pic kthat up once i get some cash
I would buy it, but with my current net--
0.6mbps boys- it's horrible
sneak attacks are best attacks
Magicka FTW
We used to have 16mbps, but then we moved
am i the only one here with master.destruction spells?
/me has master spells
I have 99 Archery, i only use my bow
it's fun to jsut hack everything to pieces, but it can get dull sometimes
quite challenging to take out dragons with a sword
erm... thats a lot of desktop ponies...
Yol Tol?
the most fun i had was when i discovered that you can slit throats when you sneakattack someone with a one-handed sword from behind
Or when surrounded also
ohh, I have to try that
man lol all this talk of skyrim makes me want it >.< though i have to get my ps3 repaired first sigh 100$ down the drain for that :$
Aww
Goat noise in the background.
even when I buff the damage
any1 here is gonna buy GW2?
05almost purely casue of modding
and yeah, the mods make it worth it
GW2?
I need horse mods, the ai and animations are--not to my liking
that and the third person
I payed..
in*
oh
zoom and enhance
old gcard, but it works
gb?
16mb ranm
thats tiny
08,01inb4 ded
well- In norway that's cheap
lol
I`m going to get a gaming laptop after I move out of my apartment
Oh, I don't know man- how do I check easily?
You asked for it
of*
if*
It looked huge lol
dem wasps
08,01and ded
:(
but 2600 and not 2600K
08,01i like hornets
08,01they're like huge, docile wasps
it was full of explosives
what's wrong with them?
lol http://derpy.me/uAz5e
no bee/wasp discussion
:D
2600K is clocked, 2600 is underclocked? Ic an't remember
REMEMBER THE BIRDS AND THE BEES?
I never overclock and pay extra to have it not factory clocked
I MADE YOU
Hornets can kiss my as
WELCOME
but today intel seems to be obsessed with utterly confusing their customers
ded
*squee*
Sorry for that spam earlier, Xchat crashed. Not my fault.
i7 2600 3.4 was the top of the line back when I bought it, it'll last me a good..while
fluttersquee is bad timing
08,01otakon: have you ever handled one?
usually never pay a lot since I buy part by part
Saturn: I've been stung by the bastards enough times for not doing anything
arent parts just as expensive as factory?
I`m going to get an Alienware
well kinda, but they're not charging for putting them together
yeah, parts
Shran
then wait 2-3 years before I upgrade again
Thats why I`m going to get one a year after I move
Datakjeden
:D
norwegian store
thx
hey it's papa smurf
08,01otakon: hornets or wasps?
yeah, you get all the individual warranties
which is very nice
Saturn: both
STAR WARS ALL OF THE SUDDEN
yellowjackets sucks
08,01otakon: well you must be really annoying to them, then
Is there a bee fetish?
yesss
Saturn: by walking by them?
oh
that's interesting
Vwomp!
08,01otakon: i've handled hornets, and have not been stung
hmmm... i might have a slight language problem ther
08,01wouldn't even consider doing it with a wasp, thoguh
Saturn: bees don't bother me though
08,01i've been stung by bees >.>
probably
reverse the polarity!
i like bees
05i was bitten by a bumble bee once
i know of alternate, but they arent the cheapest
05poor thing
Ouch... :(
goddamn bees are scary
05stuck*
i once stomped their hive into pulp when i was a little kid
bumblebees sting, they dont bite
about 40ish of them stung me
uh oh
that must have been painfull
05Dark_Horst
little bastards
05wahtever
DAMN NATURE YOU SCARY!!
bye bye dylithium
it was jidden in a rotting stump
hidden
08,01heh
those little bastards shouln't build their homes in stumps
they're bees, not monkeys
Does NO ONE have any type of armor in this show?
08,01the first time i tended a beehive, i was really surprised by the warmth they generate
ded
Armour is for pansies.
08,01i don't use gloves when working hives
dont need armor when you have lasers that can cut thtough metal
And i misread that to armor is for penises
that wierd dude is wearing shoulder pads
Saturn: you are a braver man then me
inb4 it's not the last of them
well he is a wierd dude
they have crackly faces
They did it?
08,01so they don't generally sting you anyway
i see
YEEEEES! :O
lol, that was a planet?
boom
05no
05a sphere
aaah
Hehe
thx
Do people farm wasps?
I'm not sure wht wasps do-
05wasps dont produce anythign we use
they really only scavenge
they eat meat
05not like bees
wasps just fuck you up
they live to fuck you up
05they act like food for some birds if anythign i guess
i hate wasps
yeah-
wasps are assholes
^
they arent really beneficial to anyone other than birds though
Bees to wasps
I like birds , though..
they bit me one time when i was driving :(
Bee's are good
Wasps/Hornets are lousy
birds are pretty cool
Birds can be messy.
some tribals eat wasp larvae
Be back later, doing things.
Clop?
wtf is dis shiz
The drama in this makes me go http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m190/SerenityInDeath/GIFs/Bravosir.gif
nvm
Boot to the head.
08,01Striker: bees would win
claw to the head
Roblox Lol
08,01Striker: the bees would make a "beeball" around the wasp, and it would overheat
is this...star trek?
I used to have good times with it
Swarm insects are surprisingly good at fdighting anything
Oh, just a link
like how ants take out huge spiders
Oh well
i heard of the beball thing
