00,02this is wrong
brbrbr
00,02this equation is quite simply wrong
00,02Sylandest, problem is i dont know the correct equation
hm, even though people claim to have seen it, i never actually witnessed wikipedia being wrong
00,02and dont know enough to derive it myself
episode 1
angel attacks
00,02twilight_sprinkle, yeah
preferrable a lagann
dix
00,02this requires further study
^ To the Phaselab! *Batman outtro music*
00,02twilight_sprinkle, thats... actually a good idea
00,02i should have thought of that
/me 00,02blames tiredness
00,02it would actually be that simple yeah
00,02Bronysith, Nuuuu, not into one of my ships!
00,02you've doomed us both!
idk if half, youd have to pick a position yourself and calculate for that, and launch accordingly
although spoilers
ill see for myself
only 26 episodes
hm
maybe i should watch it
k
I think like 20 minutes an episode
i liked the movies i saw
maybe ill check out the series too
fur ellipse
u starting?
oy stop startin
^ SPIOLERS
DON'T READ

yeah sorry
but its the movie tho
not the series
00,02rainbow factory feels apropriate for this misson
i like how purple that planet is
reminds me of milka
thats totally the Milka planet!
00,02the oceans disapeared
Don't worry about it.
00,02uh oh
00,02lost my chute
wat was it about
uh oh
o.o
Well shit
00,02this atmosphere is very dense
00,02jebs not coming home from this one
i g2g bye everypony
00,02using the radar
00,02theres the groind
hey guys!
Or it might be out now, I haven't checked in a while
he lived!
Haha, he lives
yesh!
00,02hmm
00,02gravity is higher than kerbin
That's going to make return missions challenging.
00,02Sylandest, probably
Wow. That's an ironic name.
00,02this lander was designed for mun landings
00,02getting it from eve orbit to landing isnt easy
then we need a stronger lander...or something
00,02would not have made it without the chute
Instruments going nuts there
lol
Shouldn't the thick atmosphere help you slowing down though?
00,02have fun there jeb
00,02Nyst, only if you have a chute
gmod?
00,02brb
*atmosphere
derpy`s eyes are normal <-<
Derpy's eyes are normal lots of times.
naaaaat goooooood
00,02a real chalenge would be landing on jool
no shit
Jool?
00,02yup
I have to say that they're not the names I expected, but they're still good.
00,02its 10 times kerbin in diameter
bejeesus, thats massive
00,02it is
...is that a gas planet?
00,02i fell to it earlier today
00,02Nyst, no, has a surface
Oh.
00,02got to like 40KM off the surface
For a moment there I thought it was.
00,02and the capsule, JUST the capsule, had slowed to 20m/s
00,02chute snapped off ages before
00,02Nyst, huge
Slingshotting!
see, he's already terrified of the idea
00,02wonder if i can land on one of the moons
*gundom
oh, his name is Orton? my mistake
00,02Princess_Cadence, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0

00,02MadSurge, uhhhhhhhhh
00,02MadSurge, you dont NEED math
00,02but i'ma use it anyway
00,02goddamnit wolfram is down
I hate math.
00,02wait
Don't have to like it
00,02twilight_sprinkle, down here
00,02HoodyNinja|School, i like it :(
00,02you guys are just jelly you cant math together rockets

00,02firefox seems to have died
Math is fun.
Especially algebra.
meh
bye guys
And nothing of value was lost.
00,02Meanwhile, i am but for completely unrelated reasons >_>
i enjoyed algebra and trig a lot, but calculus turned out to be even more fun. except the trigonometric integrals, those are a b*tch <.<
00,02MadSurge, fair enough
00,02but math is much more powerfull than it seems
I preferred playing poker behind upright books.
00,02wolfram is still down here
I don't even play poker, to be honest.
Soneone help me!
D:
:'(
Hah, no.
I mean.
Sure, what's the matter?
I'm sorry guys. :/
00,02nope
00,02still down
hmm
well that sucks

Yaaaaaaaaay.
00,02DEEEEERRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP
00,02the standard gravitational parameter wants meters
00,02the parameter suplied by the ksp wiki is kilometers
Divide by 1000
00,02more than that
00,02its MK^2/S^2
00,02KM'
the full formula is that yeah
I think :p
00,02actually yeah maybe its just X1000
Wow
Mabye I could nab a laptop from school...
dat binary
lol
:D
that is awesome
you are all welcome
lawl
00,02the ksp fourms are down

/me pulls out a ghostbusters vacuum
00,02youtubes been doing that
00,02fullscreen inexplicably breaks
Same here.
00,02twilight_sprinkle, the problem with that is the ammount of time it takes
00,02at full time warp, a single orbit still takes a few minutes
00,02server has downloads
I just tried to check out the wikipedia site about binary... they suck at explaining it :(

Hi everypony

I like how there is still a lot of people even when nothing is being streamed.
You're not accounting lurkers and idlers.
brb guys, gotta wash some dishes
"Idlers"
i never ever leave
>mentallyeffedguy
I wish I could play Borderlands 2 on a laptop :(
I'm a lurker/idler
I tend to leave the stream on in a separate tab because you never know when someone is going to start streaming.
Oh, I thought it was Saturday.
lol
Penny Arcade seems to disagree.
Well since no stream is showing, anyone want to play some tf2, l4d2, or something
?
Eh, hang on
I was typing it in but I'll just link it.It's quicker and I don't risk misquoting.

point is, most people thought that when you adsorb a positively charged polymer onto an oppositely charged surface it would form a homogenous layer, but it turns out it does not and we are looking into that.

INCOMING CLIFFHANGER
There's always an incoming cliffhanger.
Aaaaaaaaannnd...
Bam.
Dun dun duuuun
the whole point of a series is to have cliffhangers
...
I haven't seen that in ages
Hat: flew out a window, talked to police, got him some diamonds
can we get a 5 min break?
And then everypony cliffhangered.

Dat Skype.
Doesn't he die?
Everyone dies @_@
^
;A;
ugh
Nah, he absorbed Clare's ability
Hat: main character of course
HEELZ HERE!
There is no main character
I have seen that kind of Crazy a 100 times before
Sylar is probably coolest though
one pistol
Sylar is hax.
Agreed.
um k
of COURSE
Spacetime manipulation
No he isn't
The best
Technically a parasite has to keep it's host alive.
Sylar's ability is to understand how things work
Sylar is a tidus
Sylar is capable of integration.
1 million dollar for a bunch of little rocks
No...
He understands how everything works
Clocks, mechanisms
Including the powers.
which is kinda bs tbh..
*=
I don't think we found out
I think he eats the brain or something like that
What's this?
i think he copies powers. becasue he can understand them. however, in order to understand them, he has to take them apart. like a clock
*be
Hat: unfortunatly not
Bozman Montanta !!!! thats the place where the First Warp Capable Ship was built in Star Trek First Contact
Oh hello fugly.

Mine's been buffering for 10 minutes
I want no part of this, I've been taking no part of this, stop assuming just because someone is on a hate binge that I'm somehow involved.
08,01FlareChaser: then why mention that you've stopped? why not just stay stopped?
Becuase people need to say shit and seem like they matter.
Saturn: Because maybe I secretly didn't stopped about starting about being stopped? :3
Cool!:O
I heard it takes ages though
