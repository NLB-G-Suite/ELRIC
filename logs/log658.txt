dat sciance
00,02my brains failing
00,02getting a little late here
00,02Ankano_BrOnyxia, thats e as in the 'natural number' or something liek that
Yeah, I was going to head off to bed soon too
00,02its a constant
00,02base for natural logs
e is one asesome number
00,02ok
*awesome
Phase4: hmm ye i remember that.. but dunno.. i know log but not ln.. is it the same thing?
00,02so the major axis
00,02of a circle
00,02is its radius
00,02THANK YOU WIKIPEDIA
fur ellipse
00,02for not telling me that
00,02fortunately the wiki has the gravitational parameters listed
00,02sp Pi(sqrt((r1+r2)^3 /8u))
me jelly
:D
...buck trying to understand that
I totally know what is happening in that equation >_>
Is that Applejack face? I can't remember.
AdamTheDuck: yes
Ooh steampunk MLP music :3
morning everypony
Morning Princess_Cadence
er
Princess_Cadence:
its just square root but many shitz inside
00,021.167922e9
00,02big numbers
e?
oh god lol
00,02*10^9
Damn an e, shit just got real
00,02'e' meens 'engineering'
ye derp
00,02in that context anyway
derp
I think my brother in-law would love this game. He's a HUGE NASA geek and he loves math.
Phase4: e as an exponent stands for engineering?
00,0265793583872.75537370697625404685 seconds
00,02twilight_sprinkle, it doesnt have a matmatic meening in that context
nowadays ppl only like games with shooting and such things though
oh, i wasnt looking, nvm :P
00,02it meens its an engineering value
00,02the number before multiplyed by 10 to the power of the number after
Ankano_BrOnyxia, lieeees, I like games with a good story :3
Try "The Path" for example :P
Phase4: i know it means 10^x, i just didnt know it standed for engineering
00,02ok that number is wrong
00,02way to many seconds
00,02twilight_sprinkle, ah
AdamTheDuck: well most ppl.
:P
00,02other people here want to know about rugby for some reason
rugby is math!
00,03who sings this song?
00,02cant imagine why people want to know about rugby
Phase4: so ex 2,354e6 would be 2,356 * 10^6?
00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqsl3SDUr0&feature=BFa&list=PL1A1A787F29F8790C
00,02mandopony
354*
00,02Ankano_BrOnyxia, yup
Had a feeling it was mando
a cool
i could make a good mlp song i think.. if only i had more time
guys, sorry to interrupt, what's the correct movie category for Blues Brothers? A or B?
do movies have a correct category? idk :O
00,02these numbers are too big
00,02why are they too big
Ankano_BrOnyxia in the lottery i mean
A different number from last result? :<
00,02AdamTheDuck, same number
00,02infact i forgot to multiply by pi so its smaller than it "should" be
lol
Ulthane: i know. but do we need to categorize the movies or just put one to A and the other one to B
The lovable 3.14
00,02it says its gona take 2392322 days to do an orbital transfer
pi is π
Ankano_BrOnyxia, categorise actually
π is a letter of my language
п
yes, the correct category is important
oh ic
Ankano_BrOnyxia: what language, if not secret?
ok ask phase coz i wanna put 2 movies
twilight_sprinkle: Greek :p
Check the FAQ's
Ankano_BrOnyxia: ah, cool
thx :3
welp time for me to start NGE
goddamnit, maybe listening to mlp ost while playing skyrim wasnt such a good idea, now i keep imagining skyrim when i hear the pet song
d
Genesis*
AdamTheDuck: yup
Awwwwwsome
Prepare your mind to get fucked
Bronysith: Good series. Very confusing. But good.
is that the one with oceans of blood?
Gold_Demona: i know it is very fucking popular in japan
NO SPOILERS
twilight_sprinkle, eeyup
Bronysith: its not a spoiler
Bronysith: It's pretty popular in the anime circles, too. :P
Bronysith: its from ep 1
Gold_Demona: i know they have Evangelion land in japan
Thank you!Your survey responses have been recorded.
ok
00,02hmmm
does this bug you does this bug you does this bug you does this bug you
999
Bronysith: dark souls is a skyrim ripoff. does this bug you?
999
the NGE one shot for charity was hilarious
00,02this is wrong
brbrbr
00,02this equation is quite simply wrong
Steampunk again yay
aeiou?
Phase4 im dying my hair green to match my oc mane
John Madden
Phase4: then correct it, methinks?
00,02Sylandest, problem is i dont know the correct equation
hm, even though people claim to have seen it, i never actually witnessed wikipedia being wrong
00,02and dont know enough to derive it myself
episode 1
angel attacks
Phase4: hmm...got me, hehe. I can't even decipher half of this. Maybe try working it from the basics of the equation?
Phase4: are you trying to calculate something time-related for the interception of two orbits?
guys i will dye my hair green to match my oc mane
00,02Sylandest, the basics are normal orbital motion
00,02i dont know how to go from that to time, and too tired to figure it
man i want a giant fighting robot
00,02twilight_sprinkle, yeah
...buck it, I got nothing then, Phase4 :D
preferrable a lagann
00,02twilight_sprinkle, i need to know how long the transfer will take, so i can time my launch
dix
00,02this requires further study
Phase4: altho i dont know much about orbital motion, if you can find the formula for period of rotation along elliptical orbits, you could try to derive from that
00,02for now i will try land on the purple planet
^ To the Phaselab! *Batman outtro music*
Phase4: thats where i live...
00,02twilight_sprinkle, thats... actually a good idea
AdamTheDuck: nanananana Phase4 !
00,02i should have thought of that
/me 00,02blames tiredness
/me hugs Phase4
/me 00,02hugs twilight_sprinkle back
00,02it would actually be that simple yeah
/me glomps Phase4 into a ship
Yay it's now Saturday morning
00,02half the orbital period of the eliptic orbit
00,02Bronysith, Nuuuu, not into one of my ships!
00,02you've doomed us both!
idk if half, youd have to pick a position yourself and calculate for that, and launch accordingly
why is this giant fucker called an Angel?
Bronysith, many interpretations, I can meddle into it if you wish
although spoilers
ill see for myself
I suggest you watch the whole thing then ask questions Bronysith
AdamTheDuck: how long is NGE?
only 26 episodes
hm
maybe i should watch it
twilight_sprinkle, umm 26 or 28 episodes long
k
I think like 20 minutes an episode
i liked the movies i saw
maybe ill check out the series too
twilight_sprinkle, Rebuild of Evangelion or End of Evangelion?
fur ellipse
u starting?
oy stop startin
AdamTheDuck: idk, i think it was the three parter where the kid (shinji i think) went nuts at the end f the second one and caused the third impact
^ SPIOLERS
DON'T READ
^
yeah sorry
but its the movie tho
not the series
00,02rainbow factory feels apropriate for this misson
i like how purple that planet is
i would dl this game but dk
reminds me of milka
Phase4, pfft, waltz version is so much awesomer
thats totally the Milka planet!
00,02the oceans disapeared
twilight_sprinkle, still, movie is a remake and keeps parts of the original series
AdamTheDuck: ok, sorry, i forgot about spoilers, i just didnt remember the name
Don't worry about it.
AdamTheDuck: i hope bronysith didnt read it, or i'll feel bad :(
i shall set all the fakes on fire
00,02uh oh
00,02lost my chute
wat was it about
uh oh
o.o
Well shit
Bronysith: so yeah dont read that message, that was spoilers
Phase4: dis gun be good. cue the stock footage of the Kerbals back in the Mission room
00,02this atmosphere is very dense
twilight_sprinkle: i already called in an airstrike on your location
AdamTheDuck: so youre saying theat the movies have the same story as the series NGE?
Bronysith: ok, i deserve it :'(
00,02jebs not coming home from this one
twilight_sprinkle, the first movie was pretty much the first few episodes abridged
Bronysith: as i die an a fiery explosion, know, that i still love you...
Phase4: NOOOOOO, not jeb!
i g2g bye everypony
Oh noooo, Jeb! D:
laters, Ankano_BrOnyxia
twilight_sprinkle, but the second has a similar story, does touch some parts of the original but is very different at the end
Bye Ankano_BrOnyxia
00,02using the radar
NYAH i want a giant robot
00,02theres the groind
Bronysith, what part are you up to?
AdamTheDuck: i thought it was a three-parter tho. which one am i talking about?
hey guys!
twilight_sprinkle, third movie is coming out sometime this year
Hello mentallyeffedguy
Or it might be out now, I haven't checked in a while
he lived!
AdamTheDuck: oh cool, i liked the previou stwo movies, whats the third one called?
Haha, he lives
yesh!
00,02hmm
00,02gravity is higher than kerbin
Heavy gravity
xboc live trolling
That's going to make return missions challenging.
Phase4: perhaps thats why we lost the chute before? stronger gravity pull from the planet?
twilight_sprinkle, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo coming November 17
AdamTheDuck: ah cool, thanks
00,02Sylandest, probably
Wow. That's an ironic name.
00,02this lander was designed for mun landings
00,02getting it from eve orbit to landing isnt easy
then we need a stronger lander...or something
00,02would not have made it without the chute
Instruments going nuts there
Gold_Demona: its realizing Phase is still piloting
00,02Sylandest, thats what my new landers for, has chutes for landing on planets with atmosphere
lol
Shouldn't the thick atmosphere help you slowing down though?
00,02have fun there jeb
00,02Nyst, only if you have a chute
Nyst: thick atmosphere, maybe, but higher gravity is stronger
gmod?
00,02otherwise it just makes your rockets less efficent
At least it's not a high gravity planet without an athmosphere.
00,02brb
*atmosphere
Nyst: we'd be dead then :D or jeb would be
derpy`s eyes are normal <-<
Derpy's eyes are normal lots of times.
naaaaat goooooood
Their rotation means that every so often they'll end up normal.
00,02a real chalenge would be landing on jool
no shit
Jool?
That one of the new planets?
00,02yup
well, now we know where to send Phase4 - I mean Jeb, next
I have to say that they're not the names I expected, but they're still good.
00,02its 10 times kerbin in diameter
bejeesus, thats massive
00,02it is
...is that a gas planet?
00,02i fell to it earlier today
00,02Nyst, no, has a surface
Oh.
00,02got to like 40KM off the surface
For a moment there I thought it was.
00,02and the capsule, JUST the capsule, had slowed to 20m/s
Big gravity well?
00,02chute snapped off ages before
00,02Nyst, huge
...you know what this means right?
Slingshotting!
lol, Nyst
we'd be sending Jeb into oblivion
see, he's already terrified of the idea
00,02wonder if i can land on one of the moons
can sombody pass me the link for the cundom star music video thats always played here please
00,02orton is fraid of space
*gundom
oh, his name is Orton? my mistake
00,02Princess_Cadence, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
Princess_Cadence: you mean the gundam gaygnam style?
nvm
00,02or you meen the gundam one
thank you
yes
00,02Princess_Cadence, the remix of that one or that one?
00,02i dont have the remix
yes
ok, so this is my 2nd time seeing something about gangam today
aww x
lol
ill see it at least once more on bmn
Greetings, all :D
so thats about my 15th time seeing something gayngam-related in the last three days
Hello Ethereal
dat NGE opening song
00,02landing on tylo it seems
hoi Ethereal
Bronysith, sotto furro mono :P
00,02max time warp
00,02still takes ages
Bayonetta ost...goddamn it is made of so much awesome
weeeeee
or was it furero? >.<
final fantasy always has awesome music
Bitch please, Digimon ost FTW :P
Bronysith: well one-winged angel and that song were great, but i think bayonetta might be a tiny bit better
Final fantasy was on the NES SNES PS1, and PS2
Bronysith: *that song you linked
twilight_sprinkle: oh, final fantasy 8 opening theme
yah
PS3 too
Extended version! :D
Bronysith: one sec imma link you the bayonetta one
<twilight_sprinkle> so thats about my 15th time seeing something gayngam-related in the last three days <- you're going to hear it on the stream after or even DURING BMN
Kandarihu|OldComp: nope
00,02this will take a while
Kandarihu|OldComp: yeah, i said that earlier
Kandarihu|OldComp: there are only 10 final fantasies
00,02super efficent, super slow atomic engines
This will take a thousand years.
Bronysith, FFXIII is on the PS3, right?
Kandarihu|OldComp: [10:17:52] ill see it at least once more on bmn :P
Kandarihu|OldComp: there are only 10 final fantasies
Kandarihu|OldComp: 10:17:52] ill see it at least once more on bmn
By the time you arrive a whole new propulsion system will have been invented and beaten you to it.
Kandarihu|OldComp: hmm, its not copying the time i said it
Kandarihu|OldComp: point is, im sick of it <.<
Ah, so we're invoking discontinuity then?
Fraaaaaaaaaaance.
00,02you can see the other moons from here
dat Meanwhile
what are we watching?
Why is Quasimodo singing?
mentallyeffedguy: phase4 conquering the galaxy
00,02well the solar system
mentallyeffedguy, Phase torturing a poor Kerbal soul in space
00,02only thing in the galaxy right now
cool, what is it about?
Baby steps Phase.
00,02Meanwhile, indeed
chat lacks Hellfire
Yeah. The Kerbin system is the entire galaxy, right?
and reboot
00,02this thing gets a delta-v of like 1500 per row of tank
reboot is friggin awesomeness
Today the solar system, tomorrow the universe!
00,02Bronysith, : D
mentallyeffedguy: basically the game is a simulation of rocket stuff
A Fiiiiiiiiirewaaaaaaaaaall.
00,02oh
Hello everyone :)
00,02out of fuel in that stage
simulation of rocket stuff..... sounds less cool now.
howdy MLP_Brovakiin
Hello MLP_Brovakiin
mentallyeffedguy, it's amusing when he does silly designs that can't make it into space. And he's done that enough that seeing him actually go back into space is a nice change of pace.
Kandarihu|OldComp: sounds more interesting now.
/me sigh
can't sleep
again
00,02inb4 really high mountians
Confound these ponies?
00,02those mountians look quite high
lemme check
Anyone here on Steam?
You here?
00,02think i'm gona crash
How old are you?
00,02this thing has a lot of gravity
Damn you Newton.
12:28 AM
00,02yeah, running ouy of fuel too fast
00,02wait
00,02i might just
i got kicked XD
00,02nope
and banned.....
00,02eyup
00,02too much gravity
Dat music timing.
Kerbal jetpack ftw~
annnnd ded
00,02i think this thing is bigger than kerbin
:<
Erryday ahm kerbin
00,02http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/Tylo lol
00,02no info
Hello bronystate
Heya HoodyNinja|School
My computer is broken :(
00,02ohai HoodyNinja|School
Hello HoodyNinja|School
00,02:(
Well, switching back
00,02good thing it wasnt jool
heehee, dat wolfram alpha, gotta love that site....
00,02jool doesnt kill you
00,02it just holds you in its atmosphere
Good thing you don't need math to play Kerbal Space Program, right?
00,02forever
Forever?!?! :<
00,02MadSurge, uhhhhhhhhh
Good thing fire burns
00,02MadSurge, you dont NEED math
00,02but i'ma use it anyway
00,02goddamnit wolfram is down
math makes everything better
I hate math.
00,02wait
00,02i wonder
math makes teh world go round
Phase4: wolfram works for me
Don't have to like it
00,02twilight_sprinkle, down here
Meanwhile: me too buddy :D
00,02HoodyNinja|School, i like it :(
00,02Meanwhile, MadSurge: D:
Phase4, it's up for me
00,02you guys are just jelly you cant math together rockets
math is meh
Phase4: ^
00,02firefox seems to have died
Math is fun.
U mad Phase?
Especially algebra.
NO NOT TEH FIREFOX
meh
ima go
bye guys
And nothing of value was lost.
00,02Meanwhile, i am but for completely unrelated reasons >_>
Phase4: I'm just not cut for math, ok? I always prefered literature :D
i enjoyed algebra and trig a lot, but calculus turned out to be even more fun. except the trigonometric integrals, those are a b*tch <.<
00,02MadSurge, fair enough
00,02but math is much more powerfull than it seems
twilight_sprinkle: NERD!
I preferred playing poker behind upright books.
HoodyNinja|School: nerds make the world go round
No doubt Phase4
twilight_sprinkle: No, gravity does
Phase4: it seems very powerful as it is o.o
Meanwhile: In this time and day, though, the school gives computers to all the students. So yeah, poker.
So tired.
00,02wolfram is still down here
HoodyNinja|School: actually nerds do, but thats a secret, dont tell anyone
I don't even play poker, to be honest.
dat rocket
But so depressed.
Phase4: try this http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative
D:
:'(
twilight_sprinkle: If its a secret, then why are you saying this in manechat?
Hah, no.
I mean.
Kammerjunk: Poker games were where half my lunch money came from.
Sure, what's the matter?
I'm sorry guys. :/
HoodyNinja|School: cause sometimes secrets are exposed
/me puts twilight_sprinkle in the nerd bucket
00,02nope
00,02still down
hmm
well that sucks
wolfram ftw
I dunno, works for me.
HoodyNinja|School: am i a lyra then?
Kammerjunk: me too
twilight_sprinkle: You can't breath water
so no
00,02must be an online calc
00,02there we go http://www.calctool.org/CALC/phys/astronomy/planet_orbit
Phase4: are you using college internet? if so, it might not be allowed
00,02oh nvm
00,02that ones useless
00,02twilight_sprinkle, home internet
HoodyNinja|School: i can actually
Do it
So much maths at this ungodly hour... :D
D: *
SCIENCE
I have direct tv, an xbox, a ps3, and a garage full of sports equipment, and i'm still bored without my computer :|
And to think by now he probably could've just crashed a wild guess into the moon.
00,02hmmmmmm
He has the funds
Well I'm heading to sleep now, goodnight everyone. :)
Night AdamTheDuck.
he could if he wanted too
Have fun with your maths Phase4 :P
night AdamTheDuck
00,02AdamTheDuck, i will
00,02night
howdy guys
Heya Eli
Eli: I'm not on fire >_>
hiya Eli
Yes, you are.
/me throws a campfire at HoodyNinja|School.
Damn! *jumps out window*
/me throws a bucket of full of water at HoodyNinja|School
/me takes his shirt off
00,02STUPID THING
:'(
00,02i got the same number as the other equation
00,02which is a: cool, meens i probably figured it right
00,02b: sucks cause this cant work in kerbal physics
/me takes of the miad outfit and runs around naked
Yaaaaaaaaay.
/me puts Maid_RainBow in the same bucket as twilight_sprinkle
Maid_RainBow: :D
00,02DEEEEERRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP
00,02the standard gravitational parameter wants meters
derp so loud
00,02the parameter suplied by the ksp wiki is kilometers
Phase4: sooo X1000?
Eli: reverse
00,02Eli, nope
twilight_sprinkle: depends what number you take
Eli: well actually no youre right
Divide by 1000
00,02more than that
00,02its MK^2/S^2
00,02KM'
Eli: it does depend on what you take, but i think its x1000
the full formula is that yeah
I think :p
00,02actually yeah maybe its just X1000
IDk this im in english right now
00,02because the number i've got is still useless
00,0275651.871100341104419435618804001 days
thats what, 250 years?
Wow
HoodyNinja|School: way more
twilight_sprinkle: actually i think i was over
HoodyNinja|School: nvm
HoodyNinja|School: im half afk so i misread
/me takes twilight_sprinkle out of the nerd bucket
HoodyNinja|School: aw, i liked the bucket...
Mabye I could nab a laptop from school...
dat binary
Wilhelm scream
lol
:D
that is awesome
you are all welcome
LOL Sweetiebot
shit, I gotta go, next class starts. Later guys
00,02"Sweetie belle wants to congratulate you on your skills of reading binary. Hopefully one day we will be able to take over the filthy pony race and let robots take their rightful place in Equestria"
bye HoodyNinja|School
lawl
bye HoodyNinja|School
00,02the ksp fourms are down
00,02i'ma just tf2 for a bit then sleep
now for episode 3 of NGE
Bronysith: DUMBLEDORE DIES <_<
twilight_sprinkle: now you shall as well
Bronysith: im still dead from the last time you killed me, you cant kill me again
00,02youtubes been doing that
00,02fullscreen inexplicably breaks
Phase4: i would think you would intercept the other orbit eventually in almost any case, unles the perios are in such a way that ti doesnt, but theres only 1 narrow case for that
Same here.
00,02twilight_sprinkle, the problem with that is the ammount of time it takes
00,02at full time warp, a single orbit still takes a few minutes
00,02server has downloads
I just tried to check out the wikipedia site about binary... they suck at explaining it :(
Phase4: that long huh, that is kinda bad
00,02Eli, base 2 number system
Eli: i can try to explain it
or phase
Phase4: i know binary :)
00,02XD
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hOcc5DpzIs&feature=autoplay&list=PL1A1A787F29F8790C&playnext=1 << have an unlisted youtube vid
DAT TWILIGHT PICTURE :D
Is stream up?
Phase4: i just wanted to know how you "read" binary. i mean, i know how to read it, but only numbers, not like A B C
hello Ninjazz! Yes it is
00,02Eli, ascii
Good morning everypony! :)
Then no posting youtube links, Phase. :T
00,02Eli, its a standard character set, maps numbers to leters
Hey, Rave.
00,02ohai Ninjazz
Hi Ninjazz :$
Hello RaveBrony!
Ohey.
G'day MadSurge!
Phase4: nice thx
hai Ninjazz and RaveBrony
Hiya twilight_sprinkle :)
Ohai, twilight_sprinkle.
00,03off to ze schoozles~ BRB <3
Oh lawl yes
00,02hmm

Ewww, one of the melee weapons is a Spy's arm? D:
eeyup
Yep
Phase4 I think they should use that model on the PF2 hero server for Pinkie on Halloween.
:D
Looks much better than the creepy looking Mane 6 heroes.
GO PINKIE
DashWithRainbows: apparently the skins are getting much better
Who's the boss?
big mac
So many bosses :D
hi cades^^
hey
whats up
Celestia?
Phase, do you mind sending me the IP for this server so I can play it when PF2 hero is lacking players?
I'm fiddling with a Spyro game I started making some time ago. Trying to make some progress on it.
Yeah I wouldn't mind trying this server.
cool :D
hello
hi
It's a 2d platformer. And I'm trying to make it simple, in hope that I don't get stuck with difficulties like with more complex game projects:P
Hi Malk!
Heya Malk
Gotta take my bro to the station
Train station, brb
Havent been here in a few days
You program games?
yes
thats cool
Or... I try to make games, but it becomes only partial game engines or things that could be used in games. I haven't made many completed games.
oh lol
Im in hospital they have wifi
Malk :what happend?
I tried programming once, and I liked it for a bit, but it eventually got kinda boring. Maybe I should give it another chance :p
I think it is a lot of fun, though can be very difficult or frustrating to solve bugs:P
yeah haha
yes, hello
00,02WHY IS SO SILENT
we ded
yh
im back o.o
and hi all
I don't know Phase4, maybe the kids are in school?
ded
kool im joining this XD
One of the guys ob that server sound like tourettes guy.
hi Master-Derps
00,02" incog has quit (K-Lined)" ololololo
00,02K-Line meens banned from the network
I was undead this morning. Now I'm just ded. :P
wait. wut Phase4 ?
o.o
On the ponychat network?
00,02Barbetos|AtWork, incog was baned from ponychat
He keeps coming back though.
00,02he does
looooolll
00,02and keeps getting klined
That's the second time I've seen him klined.
what happend?
00,02third time i've seen it
What does he do?
00,02Gold_Demona, not a clue
00,02but its probably less than nice
He has like 30 chans up.
probably the one who breaks da rules
the download takes 4ever to join this server
XD
afk
I /think/ it's for phishing.
lol
I think.
I'm back...........
goomba stomp im so gonna go scout now
Hi Kurra!
later
Probably. That would get a network ban real quick, and it would make sense with all the warnings about "don't click stranger links"
w b Dark92Enigma
Hm. I need to get that RD model for my copy of tf2.
I've seen someone /try/ to phish attempt. k-lined always immediately.
Bufferrr
Oh, good
How does anyone even win this?
and vinyl looks really masculine.
kill hale which is atm vinyl
Ohai :)
Ninjazz Yeah i remember that one time and the so called bot or person actually got into a channel i ''mod'' and he sen't a message to my BF and all but i didn't know til the guy left but luckily my BF knew due to the message and all
hi maxTheBrony
who's ready for Movie Night?
ded
so ded
Heya Master-Derps :)
I dont know what the movies are , let me check :)
Im alive Barbetos
heya:$
Dark92Enigma: i got class tonight so i wont be on till BMN is over :(
A request to anypony streaming the movies: Please......stream the NC review of the B movie: Space Jam
killerpony7733, Hmmm. Similar experience.
still downloading modles and stuff....
00,02i like this server
I dont know any of the movies
Also, dat "mod". :p
BladedWings: Oh, it's ok, there's always Euro Night
That would of ended a lot sooner with bunny hopping
MaxTheBrony: Galaxy Quest and SPACE JAM
Dark92Enigma: true
never heard of them
i probably gtg soon
:D
D:
MaxTheBrony: For pony episodes we got Birdle Gossip and Family Appreciation Day
nice :)
00,02one excelent movie and one i cant remember
Ninjazz Yeah >.> but it was one of thoes days where the message popped up everywhere and i as i said the person or bot entered the channel but i didn't again realise till he left though he did no damage
MaxTheBrony: i haven't seen Galaxy Quest, so it's gonna be my 1st time i see it........as for Space Jam.....time to relive the Nostalgia
Woah i got like 15 secs delay on stream :s
MaxTheBrony This is what happens with messages streams and some others
killerpony7733, funny the lengths some people would go just for kicks and giggles.
Request for anypony streaming the movies: stream NC's review of Space Jam, as a dedicatory to him
Ninjazz Yeah what point is there to try and lure someone into giving their IRC account here?
Ninjazz Theres no actual value to them
brb, gonna pick up my lunch
killerpony7733, the only thing I can think of is the e-mail or IP address. But other than that, it's just silly.
Hey Sergio_Scriptor
.
ded?
I think the red team is actually on a quest to give saxton a shirt and proper pants
Ninjazz Else the worst we endure is the netsplits but that's about it trolls are just bad and all so nothing that makes a dent in anything
suddenly slow mo
trololol
follow dat medic
almost done downloading XD
killerpony7733, netsplits and lag more so. I can just ignore "trolls" and bots. Takes a true troll to get me to /ignore or rustle my jimmies.
Ninjazz It's even more fun to make a troll bored cause it shows how bad they are and you humiliate them too
Hey guys
hi SafariMonkey
killerpony7733, meh. I get bored of them too easy too fast. Just tend to ignore instead.
hey SafariMo:)nkey
whoops
XD
Ninjazz Usually do but that day i just really felt like it and i won
close enough
Master-Derps: That *was* a pretty masterful derp. :P
yup
killerpony7733, lol nice. Was this an actual troll or just a hater who thought he knew something we didn't?
meh i could never beat derpy so i changed my name from Master-derpy so Master-Derps XD
ʸᵃʸ i can join in a min :)
Is this a mod?
Ninjazz Troll in some way he had a very random way of asking stuff and all and it was directed at soft spots that usually is asked by a ''bad'' troll and he several times spammed cause he was getting bored but i eventually reported him and alot later he did it to someone else and he got banned
ʸᵃʸ im in
killerpony7733, ah. So still had no class. Even got himself banned. "Nothing of value was lost".
k cya
Morning everypony hows it going?
00,02i got stuck on wall
killerpony7733, I don't even give them the courtesy of being called a troll. Trolling truely is an art. If someone gets upset from petty insults, they're almost as bad as the person throwing them.
Ninjazz True true :P
morning moobull69
tab fail i mean Moopy
Sup dude

You're not accounting lurkers and idlers.
brb guys, gotta wash some dishes
"Idlers"
i live here DerpyWhooves
i never ever leave
>mentallyeffedguy
alexxm: Good, I just bought Borderlands 2 and Saints Row: The Thrid. How about you?
This doesn't really surprise me.
Lucky.
I wish I could play Borderlands 2 on a laptop :(
I'm a lurker/idler
I tend to leave the stream on in a separate tab because you never know when someone is going to start streaming.
Friday Movie Night in 6 hours... wat
Oh, I thought it was Saturday.
lol
MadSurge I was playing Borderland 2 on my laptop :P
What does that have to do with anything?
LightTrooper105: is it really awesome? :)
well for me movie night is at midnight but presumbly for them it's early evening DerpyWhooves
MadSurge awesome to the max
Penny Arcade seems to disagree.
or should I say Badass awesome
Well since no stream is showing, anyone want to play some tf2, l4d2, or something
Nyst: what do they have to whine about?
?
Eh, hang on
I was typing it in but I'll just link it.It's quicker and I don't risk misquoting.
http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/09/21
The blurb goes into more detail then the comic does.
this is an awesome drawing made by the person that is going to be reviewed here! :D
No stream?
Mods are asleep. :(
:P

Thank god for friday
twilight_sprinkle: It's ok because Mods aren't here!
Nyst: I mean the whole tangent about arrows
MASF123: eeeeyup

You get a new gun? Well it'll have three green arrows and two red arrows, meaning increase and decrease in stats.
Brace for ban!
So you spend a few minutes figuring out which is the better gun.
/me puts on his ban cap.
Phase4 said to be on your best behavior. :(
you get bans for rainbows? i hope its not too long
And then five minutes later repeat it again.
but hey, at least i brought colors to this black-white chat. arent you happy?
That's a pretty sad rainbow. You could have color coordinated it.
hmmm
Nyst: PFFFTTT, that's it?! Assholes.
I don't use mIRC, the effect is lost on me. :c
coordinate it you say
LightIRC*
PONIEZ.
Ninjazz: aww :(
Well their complaint is that it takes up most of the game.
nah, coordinating is going to take too much effort
/me kicks over Sumica's trashcan
MASF123: nuuuu dont alert the horde
/me makes some noise
/me kicks MASF in the shin and tosses him in a dumpster

So...cold outside hein ?
Sergio_Scriptor ja, damn cold >.< have to wear jackets again
i dont know why it does that :/
I wish it was cold over here. :D
AJIsAwesome where do you live?
USA. :D
Lil_B: i started to hear a scarf :P i leave my house to catch the train at 06:30,and it's freaking 4 degrees celcius :(
aaaaand im back
woah6_9
it happens also on school website, which uses javascript havily
so maybe javascript takes its focus
i live in a mountain so :P
Sergio_Scriptor wow, it's not THAT cold here yet, although I will porbably start to free my cars windows in the next few weeks >.<
Welcome back, BladedWings :)
afternoon, everypony! :)
hi Sylandest :P
hi AJIsAwesome and Sylandest
Hellu everypony, nobody streaming? D:
hia BladedWings and Sylandest and Dragonmatte
Lil_B: also i got an excuse cause i live on the side of a mountain,so of course it's cold XD
howdy Sergio_Scriptor, BladedWings, Lil_B
ohai Dragonmatte
how are things Sylandest
alexxm: things are good! Just finished exams, now i can relax for awhile
good evening guys!
Sergio_Scriptor are you a tiberian monk in the Himalayas?
hia Alchemist :)
Someone should stream typing of the dead xD
hi Alchemist
Hi, Alchemist :)
Hia Alchemist
Heya Alchemist
how are thingd Alchemist
Lil_B: :D nope...portuguese imigrant in the swiss alps :P
Sylandest: finished exams? in september?
Alchemist: tests, really. Not actual end of term exams :$
hi Alchemist :P
Sergio_Scriptor oh XD
alexxm: great, thank you :)
had a discussion with my project leader about our research and its gonna be awesome, though I will have to travel a lot
Alchemist: can you tell us what is it ? :P
Alchemist yeah, would like to know that too :)
maybe
Sergio_Scriptor: its about the layer structure/properites of preadsorbed poly(ethyleneamine) on silica surface at given pHs if that explains anything :D
Alchemist: dont worry i understand some of it XD
08,01i have a pair of nuts in my mouth
Alchemist kinda understandable XD
Sergio_Scriptor do you do something chemistry releated too?
08,01one's a cashew, one's a pistachio
:D
Lil_B: i understand some basic chemistry :P but im more of an exeprt with history and a few Theoretical Physics theories and formulas :P
point is, most people thought that when you adsorb a positively charged polymer onto an oppositely charged surface it would form a homogenous layer, but it turns out it does not and we are looking into that.
Sergio_Scriptor I love histroy, but I'm lerning chemistry :)
Lil_B: cool :) good luck with that :P
Alchemist can I ask you how old you are?
Lil_B: 26
Lil_B: But i only started uni 3 years ago
geez that took forever
does ur school use ff too?
Alchemist hopefully I'll make it to an University too after this school year, if not.... most people from my current school got good jobs, it's a rather mercyless school XD
or should I say Mercuryless school? ... Sorry, I guess that was my worst pun yet
Lil_B: do you want to make it into an university?
yes firefox
Lil_B: because I think at some point you said that you would settle for a technical job.
Alchemist yes, don't want to end up in a repeditive laboratory for the rest of my life, I would like to do research
handling instruments and testing samples
thats amazing
hi
oh it is you :D
yeah :p
Alchemist yeah, currently I'm ... erm... (there isn't an actual english term for that) chemical technical assistand
usually schools use ie
dont worry i know what you are talking about :)
+ If I do well I get a collage dagree in the field of chemistry (and microbiology) and in these fields I'm able to study later
Hi guys
will you have to do an entry exam for the uni or just good grades/recommendation from you previous school?
hi ToasterRepairPony
Hey everypony!!
Hi ToasterRepairPony :)
I think at basic school there was ie
Just gunna test something guys
My other name is Dasher
I just finished fallout equestria
long Fanfic
how are things ToasterRepairPony
yeah maybe
Alchemist good grades mostly, as far as I know most Universitys in germany don't do entry exams anymore, but they require really good grades sometimes
hi ToasterRepairPony
Pretty good just tired stayed up all night reading fanfics
Hi ToasterRepairPony
Lil_B: oooh, microbiology is good. Pays well and it usually has hot topics, especially now.
Hmm
I think our school uses ff because it has only avast antivirus, so it will be safer
I used to go by Dasher but since I finished F.E fanfic i decided to use this one
working like you want it to dari?
Lil_B and Alchemist ,this will probably sound dumb but...why do you guys like to study and work at chemistry ? :P sorry to ask this,is that im more of a Astrophisics guy :P
Not sure
Probably not
Any of you guys have any tips for someone who is looking to master the Soldier in TF2
*?
oh
We'll see what happens when I try and run a game
08,01AJIsAwesome: yeah, read a book instead
It'll probably die
:P
Anyone now any good new fanfics
AJIsAwesome: not realy,just learn how to rocket jump
08,01ToasterRepairPony: plenty
what be this game
God I hate Pony Pervs
Sergio_Scriptor: Okay.
08,01ToasterRepairPony: cloppers?
I need a long one no pun intended
Yeah
Sergio_Scriptor: originally I wanted to know what stuff we were made out of and what can they do.
08,01ToasterRepairPony: so i take it you only want clean fics?
/me 08,01closes the pm window
I dont mind
Alchemist: interesting :)
1 fps xD
Alchemist I don't actually know if I will be able to study in this field, but my school does enough Microbiology to allow us to work in these kind of jobs, I'm thinking about these too
08,01fair enough
Ive read plents of clopfics
but there is some special mechanism that clears all hdds after some time and loads the OS and everything there frome some central hdd, which cannot be written to
ToasterRepairPony: you know,im a clopper :|
F.E Has a few parts that are not for imature reading
so they don't have to deal with viruses so much
Sergio_Scriptor: nothing fancy really. Other thing that is important for me is that I actually contribute to something.
Lawl
Screw this
I'll set up to stream something good instead
Alchemist I always liked Chemistry, to be totally honest, I would have rather done something wioth Computers, but there is just nothing like this here
lol dari
Alchemist sry, I ment Sergio_Scriptor XD
Alchemist: i feel the same thing about theoretical phisics :P i always have been so interested in the universe and how it works and what secrets it holds :) i never realy had that big interest in chemestry :P
Also thanks for sharing Lil_B :)
Sergio_Scriptor: dont worry, most people dont care about chemistry.., I blame it mostly on poor middle school science classes.
Less then a month to go.
Alchemist: i know that feel :D
Sergio_Scriptor Physics arew fun too, I even habe Stefen Hawkinds in my Bookshelf XD but after 1 year of Phsysics in the first year in the chemistry education I know that I will not go though there -.-
physics are awshum
When will the series 3 episodes be streamed? The same day?
Lil_B: it can be boring i know :D you realy need to be fully dedicated to phisics in order to pulçl it out and not get bored to death :D just saying :P
So anyone here read all of Fallout Equestria and Past sins
Sergio_Scriptor: while we are at that, I dont know much about astrophysics except from what I saw in some Neil DeGrasse Tyson/Michio Kaku/Lawrence Krauss videos on youtube :D
?So anyone here read all of Fallout Equestria and Past sins
Alchemist: maybe i can help you :P is there something you want to know in particular ? :)
ive never heard of anything like that being done before :p
i guess its better than blocking all the websites :p
FO:E is pretty long...
or do they still block them?
Sergio_Scriptor: nothing in particular. what would come close but is maybe the conditions of the earth in it1s early years, about when life appeared.
Sergio_Scriptor: your major is astrophysics?
ToasterRepairPony: I'm not one to read fanfics, but how about Keeping Your Hooves on the Ground?
Alchemist: well what can i say ? :D lava,fire dust,meteors and gene pools :P
SUDDEN STREAM
Yay dabi
BUFFA
an enbodyied voice :O
twilight_sprinkle: i know my share of astropshicis yes :P
Hooray!
Sergio_Scriptor: abiogenesis is one of chemistry's holy grails. if we knew exactly what were the contents of oceans/atmosphere we could produce life from no life.
no
i'm scared
lol
xD
:D
you can acces all websites I think
is that valNOOOO?
BOOPILY BOOPILY BOOPILY!
INCOMING AWESOME
hahahaha
NOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOO
NOOOOOO
NOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Alchemist: that would be cool :) but if i remebered didnt someone discovered how to do it,bi mixing Eletrecity,and some of the content of the early gene pools or something like that ? :P
theres a lot of good sites blocked at my school :/
:D
My ears are bleeding
Wtf is this :D
i had headphones on
:P
<:
Sergio_Scriptor: thats cool, i was actually thinking of going into astrophysics, but chose to have a more engineering-oriented major. what year of college are you on?
Sergio_Scriptor yes, and I sasw a documentory about it
NOOOOOOO
ofna01: i feel sorry for you :D
BOOPILY!
NO
NOOO
boobily
Sergio_Scriptor: they came close, they didnt produce life per say, I think they produced either an amino acid or a cell membrane Im not sure.
NOOO
Yes
twilight_sprinkle: so far i will start university in 1 year :P
hahaha :D
That is the ValNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
:D
what

Sergio_Scriptor: ah cool
Dragon
AJIsAwesome: i love you Game grumps reference :)
Alchemist theyx already did an experiment fot it, they put all the elements that would have been on earth in a pig pod, together with the gas compounds of that time
Rubberfruit is best gmodder
Sergio_Scriptor: Thanks. :$
oh guys, who requested ponies?
ofna01: Indeed!
/me takes hat
but a funny thing is that they removed the default microsoft games from those comouters (or somehow hidden them), but you can still go on some website where you can play flash games :D
MINE
No one did.
ofna01: AAAAAAAAAAH!
NOOOOOOOOOOO
so I wonder why did they did it
/me NOOOOOO
Lil_B: can you tell me some tags/terms I could search for to find an article about it?
ofna01: Im dead...

Alchemist Trust me this guy really makes Tara uncomfortable in this she may be good at hiding it but you can see it in her eyes
ToasterRepairPony: it's like the 4th time you say that :|
Why is ToasterRepairPony spamming that mini-text wall?
Alchemist: me too, but my counter-troll skill will give me some strength
Oh sorry guys just making a point

Bleh.
Flare.
ScootaChicken: Class Presentation?

Hi FlareChaser
ScootaChicken: that physics one? that wasnt spaghetti, it was win
nope
08,01LadyCanary! <333
HEY KIDS, Flare is here.
Not the physics one...
Yaaaay.
twilight_sprinkle: The physics one inspired lots and lots of similar ones.
Of varying quality.
Poor Tara having to deal with the guy
Well, restarting, BRB
The physics one was pretty cool, dari.
hey FlareChaser geuss what
Oh, the physics one. I didn't mind that one.
He was god damn creepy
hia FlareChaser and ekips :)
ok
Bronysith, Yes? .-.
Yeah, the original
And by that I mean they ranged from shit to dear god spaghetti falling out of my pockets.
But this isn't that one
:P
AJIsAwesome: apparently its a differnet one
ohai Lil_B :3
Anyway BRB
Is that a picture of Luna?
i'm good kempa helped my grandparents move some stuff out

Everlasting_Joy: Bronies assemble. :S
ekips probably, I was just asking who was interested, I wasn't even planning one yet XD
/me would assemble
Bronysith and AJIsAwesome thank you.

Stallion_of_War: So would I
:D
so much lag
hey look patch adams :P
DAT CLOWN NOSE
Lagging sucks
Wait why is the related video Patch Adams.
Framerate iz bad :(
Sergio_Scriptor: :3
/me 's surname is Adams
audio is playing fine its the framerate
Two best Sisters play :S
*:D
It's not nice to crush people's stomachs, Fluttershy. :D
My first name isn't Patch though
Stallion_of_War: nice name :P
AJIsAwesome: I don't think he died from a crushed stomach.
I'm usually an introvert too Lil_B so I know what I'm speaking of ;)
SWEET CELESTRIA OF EQUESTRIA (/Hermes Conrad) TREADMILLS ARE EXPENSIVE
I love Treadmills. They're one of my favorite exercise machines next to exercise bikes.
ekips I used to be an introvert, than I took some good people to my side, now I'm just "not very talkactive"
This stream is incredibly laggy :(
I could just make one out of an old pool cover and some rolling pins
^
one just have to find the right friends Lil_B ^^
Lil_B: Ignoring the Skyrim joke, at least you are making some strides.
I'm pretty sure my Grandma has an old pool cover too
I ate a Chicken.
FlareChaser: :O
It was good.
I got a Rock.
Sergio_Scriptor: :O
FlareChaser: we donts cares

Lagtacular!

Still lagy :'(
ekips yeah, it mostly changed when I got into a class that wasn't full of assholes and who had the same nertdy interrests as me, before that I was the only big gamer and "Nerd" (nobody even know the word...)
Well I ahve to reinstall it then
It's not an issue with the stream service
Brb gotta watch my noodles.. >.>

Lil_B ouch... finding people who accept you as you are, are hard to find these days, sadly
Guys, guess what?
FlareChaser: What?
I found a nickle on the ground.
YAY!
ekips: Yeah, no kidding.
LOUDER!
FlareChaser: What's its name?
Stallion_of_War: we once agreed it in here when the brony fandom get's money to buy mercs and conquer antartica and make it Equestria,and the first bronys country in the world :D
Oi, its a bit cold down there
Everlasting_Joy: Lucky :3
ekips yeah, and am actually not anymore with these poeple :/ my new class also don't really have kind of people, but at least they are good poeple :)
can we tow it off the coast of Florida?
Wouldn´t it be easier to buy some under populated bit of russia?
FlareChaser: Good name :).
Stallion_of_War: well it's the only one available,and with global warming it will get better :)
FlareChaser: Though just for poops and giggles, http://youtu.be/07TuMef3JnI
Unnr: it could :)
I suppose. Penguin's will be a bonus.
Lil_B thankfully, I could stay in touch with the people I knew after I finished school
Pinkie Penguin :)
Have some Pinkie Pie Style. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JbApgSKNgbw

Metal Gear Rising man i cant wait to get it :$ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mc0M2MXMf8&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLIWobWFql_3X0c2sKFQCW1Q
Ohh, and if anyone does know Russian, what sound does the letter 3 make?
Stallion_of_War: hum...not sure it would be a good idea :D
butbutbut abandoned towns :'(
Stallion_of_War: and it makes the sound tree
Ahh, I suppose it was the USSR back then so...
Stallion_of_War: it makes the voiced alvelora fricative z
so think the z sound in the english word zoo
Stallion_of_War: you mean number 3 right?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Derpy Cover at Midtown Comics
I'm pretty sure 3 is a letter in the Russian alphabet
Stallion_of_War: O_O realy ?
oh
Well I tested in a new channel
And it worked
:D
So if it doesn't work on our current mips
I have no idea
yup

Stallion_of_War: wow

Sergio_Scriptor: its not the number 3, it just looks like it
The letter 3
twilight_sprinkle: ah ok :D

/me surrenders and goes to food
Stallion_of_War: the sound is ze
twilight_sprinkle: in my native language (portuguese) Ze is a persons name :P

Dark92Enigma: Pretty good. How about you?
Aye, stream's centred now. :)

Kawaii_icybeauti: NIce!
Hahaha
AJIsAwesome: getting ready FOR MOVIE NIGHT
Kawaii_icybeauti: you met with the guys in the picture?
He's right, the sun screen on back piece.
Alright. I've been working on some things and if, for some reason, there are some streamer-related problems with BMN, I'm almost completely ready to fill in.
Dark92Enigma: Me too. So many snacks to get. :D
MadSurge: It was at random, they just happened to be there when I was there.
Kawaii_icybeauti: cool :P
AJIsAwesome: And hopefully, a Nostalgia Critic review in honor to him
I'm more amused by the fact that he knows the lines that well.
Is he doing The Pope?
Kawaii_icybeauti: do you have any pictures of yours?
Meanwhile: Dara's actually quite geeky. Loves science and maths.
GilDash: Oh I know, he's brilliant.
:D
>Shawoddywoddy
Do you like the music?
i feel funny....
Woddeh woddeeeeeh
MadSurge: There's one more on the centrail brony meetup page. It's me, RainbroDash (not the one here, the one on youtube) and this other guy. It was a rainbow dash themed pic.
mentallyeffedguy: i know that feel...
Meanwhile: I thoroughly agree. If Dara leaves the show I don't know if I could be bothered with it. :S
Shawoddywoddy?! That's Hugh's line! XD
OMG, i just got an idea!
who is streaming?
No one
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Welcome to Ponyville Act 1 Released!
There's not stream right now
no*
GilDash: If Dara left then Hugh and Andy would probably only hold it together for a while.
08,01hehehehe
well who is picking the videos then?
08,01my boyfriend is being incredibly cute right now
2,14 it's a ghost
Meanwhile: Yeah, but it'd rpbably be cancelled that season. :S
GilDash: Most likely.
mentallyeffedguy: the streamer is *censored by almighty mod power*
Ohai Caramel!
hi there Caramel how are you today?
well dammit, i had an idea for a video
hello :)
If requests are being taken chat will be informed, if you are not informed assume requests are being ignored.
well fuck
hi applejack` :P
i wanted to share the video :(
Is it just me, or is Andy Parsons usually not that funny?
He's a very particular localised brand of humour.
Are these guys professional comedians?
I think much the same.
MadSurge: professional "british" comedians :P
>The internet
Sergio_Scriptor: of course :P
They're talking about us
I'd watch it if it was Luna
Oh boy here we go
This'll be fun...
amazen?
Amazn
A great big cucumber.
That just reminded me
:D
Next video
Must be Gilbert Gottfreid
i hate 50 shades of gray...there are so many clopfics that are 10 times beter :|
Can you actually buy cucumbers over Amazon?
Gilbert Goddfried? :O
Yes! :D
GilDash: I was just wondering that.
GilDash: Yes you can.
probably not GilDash
>Elsie
dari: Aristocrats joke?
Everlasting_Joy: I thought they'd started a gorcery section, but couldn't be sure. :S
Nah, reading 50 shades of gray
Rose?
Rose Tyler?
Oh boy.
Schadenfreüde?
GilDash: Out of curiosity, I searched some food on Amazon. Sure enough, there is a grocery section.
Everlasting_Joy: You thought I was making it up? XD
I bought Moon Pies off of Amazon
Schadenfreude?
GilDash: No no no! I knew you weren't. I was just telling you my story.
Stallion_of_War: "Moon pie ? what a time to be alive"
Uncle Peter
Everlasting_Joy: Fair does. I wasn't accusing you or anything. :)
Uncle Peter is your god now.
If it were Frankie, that joke would have gone so much further
XD
uncle peter is best god
Everlasting_Joy: I worked at a company that sold via Amazon, so that's why I know as much as I do. :S
I do rather like the british pronounciation of ass
Stallion_of_War: *arse
Arse.
today our english Teacher said "It's a Pain in the Arse" and nobody else knew that he just said Ass in school XD
"le googles"
Lil_B: :D
ohh, Arse is the British version of ass
OK
Oi!
I'm Yorkish. -_-
Hah.
This guy must be a fan of Star Wars.
/me something something darkside
Meanwhile: I live in the same county you do. :p
Meanwhile: I'm what they would call "smart" for leaving. XD
but our TEacher is actually schottich, but he's sounds like a british guy... at least to me XD
GilDash: Think of the scenery!
scottish*
Meanwhile: Hey, the Yorkshire Moors are pretty nice you know.

It's a British satire on the news of the week. Enjoy. ^_^
Half of it's hilarious, half of it I don't get because I'm not British

Everlasting_Joy: As long as you treat it as a comedy you can't go far wrong. :D

Howdy Ponyloverforever!
hey poni

Paspie, alt+tab is your friend then
how are things Ponyloverforever
XD
would that work for Linux?
Duelling faps
yesh im fine
oh god XD
lol
Haaaaaaaaah.

Usually same, but you usually can use Ctr+alt+ left or right arrow to toggle between workspaces
oh my god XD
xD
XD
lol
All right. I must take off. I'll be back for the movie.
bye for now Everlasting_Joy :)
Seeya later Everlasting_Joy.
:D
XD masturbation saved the day
08,01masturbation?
I'd love to see MLP somehow morphed into a more 'adult' version, that would fill a huge void
08,01Paspie: xfce brohoof /)
/me clapclapclapclapclap
I'm glad I save the day every 6 hours then.
Meh, why would you want to change something that's already good?
If it 'aint broke don't fix it.
08,01that's why
Make it better. Its called innovation
WHo is this
There would be virtually no market for it
It's a bad idea
ToasterRepairPony: Russel Howard.
Maybe I'm just sad
Well get over it, because Hasbro wouldn't be stupid enough to change something that has had roughly the same formula for about 20 years
Why would it mean that?
i just love messing with you Dari :)
>_>
<_<
MFW in some countries they put sugar and snow and eat it
So...

Sergio_Scriptor: Naaaaaaaaah.

^

^
YOU FORGET EVERY TIME
Heroes is alright
Yo I'm back
have i missed any heroes?
Wazzon
what is doing the stream thingy??
i will punch a baby!!!!!!!! if you dare do
twilight_sprinkle, it's just starting, maybe
welcome back SafariMonkey :)
Kandarihu: ok, i hope i didnt miss any
wb
I GOT THE BABY~!
What did i started :'(
do you do dare?
Do lots of heroes!
Hehehe.
I'm still hoping for Battlestar Galactica to be streamed >.>
Scoot_Scootaloo is going to be doing an interview. Not sure if you have time for 3 episodes.
ekips: new or original series ?
Kandarihu: It was exaggeration
IAM GONNS PUNCH THIS BABY!
Sergio_Scriptor both?^^
at least its not a puppy
We're on like...the last one had Sylar in Regenaladies house and he got shot.
since I haven't seen the original sadlay
What is heros?
ekips: i prefer the original series :P but ok
idk
Oh and MPD lady was let out of prison.
ekips: well let me tell you the original series is awesome :)
Oh Heroes? I'm gonna start from the beginning if I get enough recs. Anyone?
Oh!
I remember we were past the point where Hiro confronted his father and got out of his duty to run the company
AAGH Spoilers!
Sergio_Scriptor Don't know if I could get into the original series after seeing the new
Oh yeah her biological father turned out to be fly guy
OK I'm leaving before you ruin the show for me
Sergio_Scriptor but if I have the opportunity to watch it, I'll give it a try
Heroes? :D
Yay~
ekips: yes you could :) the new one is just a revival,the same exact story,exept the original is only 1 season long :P so it's sort of short,but awesome :)
Lindahman
ekips: also in the original there is no "cyclons look like humans" crap :|
Bye guys I might or might not be back for euro movie night
*cylons
Sergio_Scriptor I always liked the side plots in the new one
SafariMonkey: bye for now :)
why did he get suspended?
bye
bye SafariMonkey
Which season is this?
1
GilDash: 1
twilight_sprinkle: He went to horn rimmed glasses man's workplace
Really? Don't remember this. :S
And tried to arrest him for some crazy evil scheme
Sergio_Scriptor the series became some sort of too supernatural sometimes but that's okay imo
ekips: i think they are both interesting and boring at the same time,the original focused more on comedy and action and the main story,and it was prety cool straight forward and interesting :P
Sergio_Scriptor and Applejack2011 and twilight_sprinkle: See you! *hugs to all*
hug
Legit
But no one believes him
same as always, nobody believes the good guy
Sergio_Scriptor let's not discuss which series is better, not before I've seen both of them (I hope to do so on bronystate sometime)^^
biiitch bitch bitch
stab her
with a knife
n stuff
ekips: i dont realy enjoy the news series,i think they get a little to side-tracked with the side stories :P just my opinion,but yes when you have time try and see some of the episodes :)
PHEONIX IS BACK MUDABUCKAS! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFfHiLDlais&feature=youtube_gdata_player

Dark_Horst he's been talking about people gettign super powers
oh right, he went public with the superpower theory, right?
I wanna see a baby Fluttershy!

So isnt' Hiro breaching security by being on the backstage or whatever that is right now ? :|

Who has the best power in this show
ugh
Nah, he absorbed Clare's ability
Hat: hiro
So he can heal
Hat: main character of course
HEELZ HERE!
There is no main character
I have seen that kind of Crazy a 100 times before
Hiro on Heroes lol
Sylar is probably coolest though

Sylar is hax.
save the world
Cheesy
Agreed.
um k
So save the cheerleader save the world ?
of COURSE
but what about hiro?
Meanwhile: sylar is a parasite
Sylar is ultimate badass.
Spacetime manipulation
No he isn't
The best
Technically a parasite has to keep it's host alive.
FlareChaser: nope
Sylar's ability is to understand how things work
Sylar is a tidus
Sylar is capable of integration.
hey honey, i found some diamonds on the street
1 million dollar for a bunch of little rocks
No...
He understands how everything works
Clocks, mechanisms
Including the powers.

Sergio_Scriptor: Good @_@
What's this?
he dead

Stan "The Man" Lee was that? :S
Does Ecclestone play the Doctor in this
i think he copies powers. becasue he can understand them. however, in order to understand them, he has to take them apart. like a clock
Hat: that would bee TOO sweet :)

So, I'm with a internet so slow, because my brother is playing multyplayer tf2, and my sister is watching youtube videos, that it doesn't stop buffering
such as Major, his OC was in the Bad Pony OC tumblr
hilarity
Confound Ze morons?
test
geez Meanwhile and Bronysith are todays Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon :D jk :P
Meanwhile: dat is a cute spider
how do I change my name without relogging
Sergio_Scriptor: I take offense to that.
Diamond tiara is my favorite pony
Sergio_Scriptor: Ha...Ha...HAHAHAHA.
Sergio_Scriptor: today?
Meanwhile dat piece of art
Meanwhile: wanna see if he blends?
tonight, sometimes i just won't do anything for the whole day, and then just do a bunch of stuff before i go to bed
Soooooo, U hear a rumor that season three airs tomorrow, is it true?
*I, not U
dr-whooves: no
Oh my god people are still asking that?
twilight_sprinkle: most of the time :d
i didn't
Nah, it isn't true Dr-whooves
STILL?
Sergio_Scriptor: all the time.
Thats what i thought, although I hoped it was true
Meanwhile: i shall blend Sergio_Scriptor
/me chainsaws Sergio_Scriptor
Sith don't try to move in on my corner of hate in here, you don't belong in it.
Meanwhile: hedgehog dilemma
/me eats nachos
:D
I've stopped with my OC and the shippings, it was pretty stupid I must admit, I'm keeping the name though.
Meanwwhile: Your death will be slow and painfull
*uses the death note to save sergio from daeth by killing his assaltaint*
FlareChaser: Pretty stupid? It was depressingly sad.
FlareChaser: you just commissioned jennidash like 10 times in the past month
And involve lots of turtles
Thanks Yagamilightisderpy :)
Ive got this speech assignment that I need to work out >.>
Yagamilightisderpy: But the death note requires you to be able to spell
xD
Sergio_Scriptor: No problem
facepwned
Bronysith Well you can't entirely blame him but she makes good art man :P
dr-whooves: That's one hell of a story, but I have more important things to do right now, like clip my nails.
>.<
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #572
killerpony7733: this is true, but his statement just contradicted himself
Meanwhile: YOU SHALL FEAR MY TURTLE ARMY
Ath|chatderp6: I can spell, what's the problem? he died of a heart attack
Bronysith: Past month? No, I think you got that part wrong, I think I only commisioned her once this month, for a picture of my OC with SB64's...
guys refresh the stream :D
Meanwhile: im hungry for soup
I fear no reptile.
turtle soup
Its not hard, its just a matter of...putting all the information together

BlackGryph0n: hi, who are you?
FlareChaser: and now you attempt to hit below the belt
Yagamilightisderpy: lol.
twilight_sprinkle: don't group them... let's ship them :)
XAX: sorry
Meanwhile: ill leave the constant hating to you, since since all you can do apparently
twilight_sprinkle: I...don't even know what you're actually talking about now but it seems you're on your high horse again so have fun.
Yagamilightisderpy: Nah, it's aight.

Oh boy
Meanwhile: yeah, cuz its not like youre always rude or anything, its probably jsut me and a high horse

Yagamilightisderpy: I'm the guy hwo did Twilightlicious and Proud to be a brony among other things.
twilight_sprinkle: Probably, yeah.
twilight_sprinkle: don't join the fight you called childish 3 min ago please :S

yes
Thanks! :D
*animations
08,01Meanwhile, Bronysith, and FlareChaser: take it outside please. this is not the place.
People who hit below the belt are the lowest form of life besides people who actually make these "OCs"
Hey I stopped ages ago.
did anyone else just ntoice him black out, or was that jsut my stream?
Eli: i do want to knock some sense into him and explain that hating everything doesnt make you cool or anything of the sort, i try not ignore things, but yeah, im not in the mood for this right now
Meanwhile: we best start stoppin
Piss off Sith!
Hey everyone, what's up :)
Mine's been buffering for 10 minutes
00,03Ah BlackGryph0n! It's been a while~
I want no part of this, I've been taking no part of this, stop assuming just because someone is on a hate binge that I'm somehow involved.
Hey Benickerson
08,01FlareChaser: then why mention that you've stopped? why not just stay stopped?
ohai Benickerson
Yagamilightisderpy: have you tried refreshing
hi Benickerson :)

Becuase people need to say shit and seem like they matter.
Hat: eeeyup, it doesn't work, I'll wait till my brothers stop this game of tf2 manvsmachine
Cool!:O
inb4 ban
Tbh Buytoast I find people have a way of making others feel like they matter because they need something to look at.
I heard it takes ages though
Oh
00,03I want to ship Buytoast and Meanwhile, just because.
its you
Yagamilightisderpy the past interviews can be downloaded from Youtube so you can't really miss it
Scoot-Scootaloo: Genius.
Hmm, less angst on Reddit that I would have suspected.
Urge to fangasm....rising
Scoot-Scootaloo: olololol
hi tsitra, finished your derpy magnet?
Scoot: I approve your troll pairing.
Hilariiiious.

Scoot-Scootaloo: Did we ever do that thing on bonystate? I don't think so, but I'm not sure...
I actually didn't care much for lesson zero
That thing?

hello everypony
ohai yifle1

(Question): What is your five underlooked ponies of the series?
BlackGryph0n Hey! Nice to see you! I'm a huge fan of your animations and fan art!
So everyone here is a shipper
hows going
Oh boy, here come the fanboys.
as long as you don't ship me with L I'm alright with that
Oh god, i'm not a shipper!
he's not the real blackgryphon
yifle1: your name sounds familiar...have we meet ?
08,01Unnr|Puppies: i'm too predictable
Yagamilightisderpy: dude, everyone and their mother have shipped Light and L
Implying the fanboys weren't already most of the audience.
wait, is this going to result in the five million Meanwhile x Trixie ship posts again?
don´t know
Unnr|Puppies: That doesn't happen anymore.
Bronysith: No! that's impossible, it can't be true! (referenec joke)
yifle1: hum,ok :\ thanks anyway

So, what movies are we watching tonight?
Dark_Horst - when you consider that Gir is basically a baby Pinkie...
I wonder if you could slurp spaghetti noodles out of someone's ass.
nah, they only had fans for gir
Would probably be difficult.
I'm a GOD! I can't be shipped with L, I mean, he's...Maybe you got that idea from the english dub?
Well at least some of them are having peoples heart and soul put into them
08,01String_Shredder: any time, dear
Dark_Horst what do you mean :S
Hai everypony ^-^
There is no way I can possibly hit myself in the face with my palm hard enough to express the level of disappointment I currently feel.

ohai Kurra (\
11,02DashWithRainbows: I'll go back once the Wii U comes out ;^;
If you're born in a cave maybe?

Shizuka: assimilate...
ASSIMILATE
I liked it as a kid but I@m not sure why

Shizuka: I guess some people are just lucky like that
ah space jam
DashWithRainbows: you'll probably like. very much so
entertaining movie
terrible micheal jordan acting
DashWithRainbows: Its what happned when Warner bros made a commercial deal with NBA.... and decided to make a movie because HEY WHY NOT?
Oh hi Fl00t4hSh41 :)

COME ON AND SLAM! AND WELCOME TO THE JAM!

If Space Jam is on, then I may just skip that for now, get mah teeyuff two on.
Tonight we're going FULL CGI
alexxm: math... ugh.... all that number crunching just gets me, I just hate it.
Paspie: Have you been on during a new episode night? .-.
this song is wrong.
Kurra, Space Jam isn't now
Remember in thouse days when anything that had a basketball/famous players was automaticaly cool- so people made movies with no effort/ games/ endourcements
it's later in the night
00,03why was Space Jam a B movie? It was lie... my childhood :'(
what is now then? The newsletter isn't updated.
Scoot-Scootaloo, cause the movie was based on a commercial
it's a good movie
but definately a B
Scoot-Scootaloo: look on the bright side, you get a good movie as B
and it was poor quality
because the A/B thing makes no sense
lol jordan
0,14Space Jam is best movie
but it was high budget
space jam is more B movie, I loved it but space jam is B movie.
B== best
GONNA FLY LIKE AN EAGLE

I registered my username
do I have to confirm it?
Scoot-Scootaloo: did your childhood include that cartoon with all the charters togather..... to talk about drugs?
jinxing song of sky captains everywhere. :v
what happens if you register your username?
Yagamilightisderpy Nope.

Someone say something stupid, I need to focus my thoughts.
00,03.. yes
This song sucks.
8v biet.
00,03Meanwhile: The floor wasSNAKES
bonjour all
I guess Space Jam is more of a cult hit. I guess critics didn't like it much.
what year was that drug special thingy?
TIME KEEPS ON SLIPPIN-SLIppin-slippin
hiya guys what's up?
\ V8 / BIET!

OH GOD

minimal research time expenditure fail
with the terrible just say no song?
/me hedperch on Sumica v|
yes
Shizuka: i love you...i really really really love you
Scoot-Scootaloo: you know what, i bet kids at that age liked that special anyway....because they were busy laughing at the drugs being mentioned :P
Freefall29 it means people can not use that nick without the password you put. To use the nick, you'll need to identify yourself using /ns identify <your password>
the hell is that?
Of course, that's what I have to do with mIRC.
/me 13may or may not be responsible for compiling this playlist
otakon quick, tell me how your day was.
ok. I'll register my name
0,14*ahem*
If I had stream running I'm sure it'd be lovely.
all I gotta do is say /register.... right
the worse part was the president stalling the start of the cartoon, or so I've been told
00,03It's alrught, Shizu, I blame SaxyPretender anyway!
.-.
00,03alright*
Wat.
wait for it
Movies on tonight please?
Always blame SaxyPretender, that is the rule.
So.... i bought garrys mod without counter strike source....
Kurra: galaxy quest and space jam
:O
Mishia: Multiplayer is worthless.
Mishia: ya really should have bought ccs as well
THANK YOUUUUU d-C8-b
13Mishia: not a problem, a few of the custom maps need it for textures though
FlareChaser: I've been paying dearly with the blinding texture errors
Freefall29: You a CS-Source player?
not sure if it's my internet or the image are just sloppy
00,03No chance, do your dance!
god dammit barkley
Mishia: Same, I don't even own CSS and that is why I don't play Gmod 24/7 ;~;
Shizuka: just like with me playing with no mouse, i manage.....
00,03Cause it's a space JAM!
Unnr: yeah. I got ccs and cs 1.6. play it pretty casually, but its fun.
13only reason to buy CS:S with gmod is so there's no dependency issues with maps
Songs are repetitive...
Shizuka: And it's an alright game .-.
13some really nice ones need CS:S textures and models, like the desktop computer
13now that it loads l4d natively it might pull from there though
/me is still amazed by the numbers of 1.6 players
dat katamari in the background
Shizuka: if you dont.... well many a texture online will become puruple checkers and items glowing error signs.
hiya Shizuka how's Torchlight 2 so far?
13yup
Names so I can put it in my death note please, of the terrible actors who made the horrible movies you watch
Unnr: Still have >4k servers.
WAit a second...
13water sometimes bugs too
13otakon: fun
Unnr: its a very balanced game
cs 1.6 has reached the point only veterans play it. its in a similar position to quake.
otakon!
Shizuka: yay
hiya Lyra`
Nah I'm joking, they didn't commit any crimes
0,14wait, what remix am I missing?
:3
ah, love the katamari song
Shizuka: less of the water, more of the backrounds. they all looked like the maps, upside down, and lagged the fuck out
^^
twilight_sprinkle: Yes, but for the age it still has an amazing userbase
Fish
kinda like UT2k4
Oh lawd..
Cipher, ive had enough of your shit talking :3
Mists of Pandaria comes out in 4 days..
/me prepares.
Shizuka: you can only imagine my reaction once my mutiplayer started working....
/me only shit talks in fighting game club
well, definitely gonna TF2 for a while then. cx
Lyra`: hum sorry to ask,but do i know you ? :\
rule one of fighting game club is that you dont talk about fighting game club
Cipher: rule one of FIGHTing game CLUB, dont talk about FIGHT CLUB
0,14but then how will I get new members to body?
Guess that autokick script got removed.
Meanwhile: Came in the door and did a u-turn straight back out? :|
Mishia: but youre talking about it!
Lyra`: damnit beat meh to it

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene when Tim Allen is in a mens room overhearing how the cast of Galaxy Quest are nobodies and all the co-stars can't stand him mirrors an actual event in William Shatner's life. He discovered the exact same things about himself when he attended a Star Trek convention.
15 Bucks a pop, that's cheap!

Silverscreen: wow just wow
Silverscreen I only got that once from an anime con most of the time the other fans were great
Silverscreen: I only know one con where they dont mind teens/tweens and people dont care how much you know... i go to the Nor'wes con in Washington.... at least....i used to ;(
I don't know, this feel pretty insulting to a lot of people.
I feel gross.
:'(

And too all over the place to be worth it.

He's lefthanded?
no wonder he plays this roll so well
and then his bravado is shattered

same size clothes, but a smaller bra size :(
why os the hat still on?
spacejam: HEATHEN!!!
he's in a crummy apartment
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Alan Rickman never takes off his headpiece throughout the entire movie. Even in the scene when he and Gwen (Sigourney Weaver) are both at home talking to each other on the phone, Rickman still has his headpiece on, even though he is not in costume.
He still is in makeup.
for something he failed to do earlier
Ponies47: come sit with me, just avoid the gaurds (if your not a earthpony that is)
he's still in the makeup?
oh hey it is Marvin the paranoid android
0,14Remember kids, if you go to a convention, be nice and courteous to the guests, try not to get nitpicky with your questions

You want to talk about her boobs then go to private chat or Brony, don't bring it in here.

once there was a pony named lyra, she was a very silly filly. at the age of 16 troubles in her home caused her to leave. she was cast out of her house and forced to join the equestrian army to keep from starving to death on the streets of manehatten. they signed her up as a medical professional, because she so loved to palpate patients

Biglaw: I'm bored of being good at TF2 D:
has anypony here seen Dredd yet?
ALL the missiles!
Lobster head is lobsters :p
FlareChaser: Play as a different class?
then she went to war and fought the griffins in a big waterballon fight, almost every pony and griffin there caught a cold from the water they were trowing around.

Yes Guy, this is what filming an episode is like, exactly.
It may come true.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director Dean Parisot and star Tim Allen have revealed in interviews that the original tone of the film was much darker, with more scenes of violence. After test screenings the film was re-cut to emphasize the comedy and obtain a PG rating.

Silverscreen "You are our LAST hooope"
This is a fun movie, when it's not constantly making fun of trekkies and is actually about characters trying not to be assholes.

This movie is like Enterprise but actually good!

01,11TOM TOM TOM
05,15Since 1971 it has been illegal to import haggis into the US from the UK due to a ban on food containing sheep lung, which constitutes 10 to 15% of the traditional recipe. The situation was further complicated in 1989 when all UK beef and lamb was banned from importation to the US due to the BSE crisis.

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The design for Sarris' starship is a crossover between the designs for the planet-killing "Doomsday Machine" from Star Trek: The Doomsday Machine (notably the massive, glowing maw in the front of the ship) and a D'deridex-class Romulan warbird from Star Trek: The Next Generation (the open design of the rear nacelles).
0,14Wasn't referring to mane, RX
/me puts Dark92Enigma back together :)

Shizuka The aliens from Signs were more stupid
Lyra': Does John die in the end?
oh, youve heard of it?
you can use the triangle mines to build a pyramid house. They're magnets so they'll hold together.
one of them, yes.
Shizuka at least THEY <----- have guns
NOW ATTACK!
those are some crappy mines, htey're just bouncing off the ship
I saw it on every one of his articles when it came out.
I loved that Romulan warbird. Still have the giant ship on my dresser.
Dark92Enigma: Die from water. Go to planet with 75% of water.
It's Minefield!
