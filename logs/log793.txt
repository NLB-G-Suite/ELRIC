Bernie Mac gets me too.
did gary coleman even contribute anything to society?
dat 60 dollar sign. IF dey get dat, dey be RECH
Well, I know black people who are nothing like this.
Bronysith he defied gravity and other conventions of stardom
Kandarihu: I'm not buying that
gak:P
purdy
KrazyNoobs, I really do.
That girl is hot.
I miss gak.
shut up
I just realized..
Kandarihu: Yeah, now it's easy, but back in the 70s, this is what dey fahnd funneh
That is goign to be a thing now. I wonder if I will be able to not rage at the next pony convention I go to.
BarbetosMilkshake: they are going to have fur suits of it
or should i say slime suits
Scoot-Scootaloo: could we watch boondocks again sometime?

NOOOOOOOOOOO
black show offends chrysalis
the best scene... has been ruined
Oh you mean gak
I know, the kick has been lifted, but still, I would be careful.
That's you.
easily the most overrated episode of the series
ok :) sorry im new
And then celestia never recovered.
Hi everypony. It's been a while.

Huge white horse. ded.

/me slaps Scoot-Scootaloo around a bit with a large trout
home improvement <3
how've you been Skool_icybeauti
and celestia just racist
Normally, they pay for a month-long session for their commercial to air, in this case, the Gak company paid for 2 months, and soon, they'll be back with more funding, so gak is not gone forever.
good alexxm
Alright! A sitcom back from the time that I could enjoy sitcoms.
WET
Oh look the Hanson bros!
woo i used to love this show
used too?
its still amazing
Ugh, I hate the ads. Stupid school internet.
inb4 Wilson
Tim Allen
Skool_icybeauti Use chrome or firefox, and install ad block
My school uses internet explorer..Ikr.
Oh wat
and THATS why Chrysalis beats celestia first time :D I mean really how it shows than white horse beats black horse?
Ad Block and Google are your best friends
They are mine, anyway
/me is forever alone
Google is best pony
Skool_icybeauti I bet there is a way around it... But i would not want to get you in trouble.
http://imgur.com/JEwaN
Skool_icybeauti, I see. I don't think there's any way around it if you're not in control of the computer.
No, instead of having a serch engine, the school's website is the homepage
And then Al quit over sexual harassment. Tim never came back to the show, as he could never pay the fees and damages.
Best show ever.
Ads help to fund a site, so the more you block ads, the less profit the site earns. I honesly don't care about that, adblock is my friend.
Yep....Well, I'm actually having a free instead of orchestra, wqhich is a clas I actually enjoy.
i want that drill
...
Sexual.
is it the drill that will pierce the heavens ?
/me murders TrixieMuffin

Everlasting_Joy: Sad?

MadSurge, any. It doesn't matter.
Kammerjunk: :D ypu're awesome
Because Cthulhu is MLG.
Scoot-Scootaloo, he's a really old thing. Old things are cool.
oh yeah...
Scoot-Scootaloo: I dunno, I just thought saw garbage text and thought of Cthulhu.
Ninjazz: Your mum must be the coolest.
Kammerjunk: Sad over what?
Everlasting_Joy: You said that Dr. Who fans got scared.
Meanwhile, your face must look real cool.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Marathons Today - December 7th
lol snowman
Not as cool as your mum's face.
Kammerjunk: Yeah, the angel statue would scare them.
Meanwhile, I'm ending it here. Your mother is a slag.
Now gimme your milky milk.

I can't wait for us to be flooded with even more stupid than usual.
Oh happy day.
^
IKR?!?
Happy happy joy joy.
Kammerjunk: Yeeeees?
Great. You made my feeling of indifference go straight to misery.
Everlasting_Joy: Not you, silly filly.
Ninjazz: Such is the power of Meanwhile.
Truly the influx of new idiocy will liven up the stagnant pool of stupid that this place has become.
Kammerjunk: ;) I know, I just couldn't resist.
Joyous joyous occasion.
Woohoo.
bbl
I'm being sarcastic, by the way.
I never noticed.
I couldn't tell.
I figured you wouldn't.
It's just so hard to detect sarcasm ont he internet.
lol:D
on the*
Hence why I felt the need to clarify.
You just can't imagine.
what movie are we watching toniht?
Check the front page.
omg putting your hoof down!
Wut. This I got to see.
Sooooo CLIFFHANGER!
Gotta go to class :/ I'll resume this show after I get back, that is if nopony is up by then
Take care Scoot-Scootaloo!
Later Scoot-Scootaloo!
Bai Rarihater.
No-one wants to see your non-mlg Stream
gawd
Jmo, so they want to see an MLG one?
Because I can deliver...
;)
You really wish you could, but in reality you never could.
Keep dreamin' boy.
I bet I can~
Bet all you want, in the end you'll lose the pot.
When I get back, I'll play an MLG game on stream!
Something that even the pros can't handle..
Bye Scoot-Scootaloo. Thanks for the stream
O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum, wie treu sind deine Blätter.
Uh-huh
Kammerjunk: Sorry I don't listen to rap...
Anyways, I'm OUT!
/me slaps Scoot-Scootaloo around a bit with a large trout
Scoot-Scootaloo: Have fun.
nooooooo!!!!
Thanks for streaming, Scoot-Scootaloo
o well
thanks for the stream Scoot-Scootaloo
thx you
...I thought I just heard something
Oh well.
What you heard was the sound of no one caring.
But someone caring enough to post about no one caring.
it was the sound of how many fucks i give
Guess we won't be hearing anything ever.
I only cared about making sure it was understood that no one cared.
It's a meta state of non-caring-ness.
..fine, I'll just never talk again
bye guys!!!!!!

You and your meta-physical realms of state.
Why couldn't the other 90% of mane chat be that easy to shut up.

Dude,there is no Brony in Turkey.And I hate that :[ :D.

How can you hate Turkey? Turkey is the best poultry.
Especially if you're Hungary.
My mother is from Hungary.
Sounds so made up.
Oh really? That's cool.
Did she keep the accent?
I'm hungry for someone from Hungary
She did not, she moved over here when she was little.
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH
Meanwhile: so your father is the britishman of the family?
ı don't hate Turkey,ı hate that there is no brony in Turkey.
My father's from London.
da fak?
/me eats Meanwhile "get in mah belly
Aw man. Eastern European accents are fun.
I was going to complain about the weirdness here, but that really would be the pot callking the kettle black.

I think a brain cell dies everytime that word is said, written, texted, etc.
RIP brain cells
Barbetos|AtWork: we need a high class counterpart
Eh. It would get ruined too.
The internet was made to ruin everything.

YOLO is worse
Barbetos|AtWork: no you silly, it was made for military purposes. Ergo, ruin the world :D
You only YOLO once.
Just.
Ninjazz: 6_9
No.
/me melts
/me mops up Barbetos|AtWork.
O_o
What prize do I win?
I still like that guy who died while driving drunk after tweeting YOLO.
:D
Ahahahaha.
Wow
Whoever that guy was was an example to the rest of the world.
Meanwhile: karma much? :D
Ninjazz surprise buttsex is your prize
I never liked that song.
good morn
>.>
Meanwhile: it's stupidity for those guys that can't write "you live only once" :|
YOLO, so I think I'll attempt to eat this python.
anyone know who the mummy OC is btw?
Really it's just a shame these people didn't do more insanely stupid things, that way we'd be rid of them faster.
Ghosties, I believe.
Isnt that Ghosties?
:P
kay, what about the guy with the spear thing?
Val.
Val
where was Tom?
It's a trident
Meanwhile: that wouldn't be surprising
Hmm, i think ill go look at the Darwin awards, lmao

Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :3
He did?
It's nice that these things are well circulated.
^
^^
Well I think we left it up to him to make a post about it
Key word being 'think'
Leaving any one of you up to doing anything is doomed from the start...
Wouldn't really be fair to say it for him
it was posted on the front page a while ago
^
See
and it was on a newsletter
You guys just don't read shit
Get out
I don't read the front page or newsletter.
Ditto.
....
You don't send the newsletters fast enough.
^
Then fuck off when you don't know anything
Ohai :)
You wanna fucking start dabi?
DO YOU?

Oi, man. Some of us like Val. Just wonderin' is all.

Really? He's no longer a mod?
swag
BRO DOWN!
Jappleack: No
what?
I would of expected people to at least of been talking about it.
I use the newsletter for my lottery link and my link to the site goes directly to the movie page.
Kandarihu: nope :( he's still around
Seems like Val didn't mean that much then.
<insert obligatory 'cock slapped yo nan' comment>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcfyqO-8JoI
Fuck off Jmo
Huh?
What for?
s**g
What'd I do dabi?
[16:37] <Jmo> Seems like Val didn't mean that much then.
He meant about as much as dari does now.
Which is approximately five raw oysters.
Then why didn't people talk about him leaving?
He was a good guy.
:C
I'm sure they did around the time he left
Would of expected it to at least circulate into the discussion.
Which is ages ago.
How many ages is ages.
swag
oh geez what have I started XD
How many weeks? I'm trying to find the newsletter.
Half of the regs from the Skype group barely talk in here naymore anyway
anymore*
Or bother to read the site
Gigabit and Allegro left too and I didn't hear of that for ages.
So I'm not surprised you don't hear about things.
he still turns up during pony ep streams though no?
D:
I miss Giga
Ffs.
And allegr0
Can you blame us? Look what you let mane chat turn into.
Ditto Meanwhile.
I miss when otakon got shipped with EVERYTHING
lol
What do you want me to do? Set up an IQ test on the front page?
Yes!
Ban anyone who doesn't type in full sentences?
That would help.
or use proper eloquence
You're acting like it's not possible to fix, which is how it sunk this low in the first place.
How do you sentence?
Hey everypony...last night was...really horrible with the new layout, but then it got really horrible...
Well that would kill the site.
Implying it wouldn't be better off dead at this point.
Jesus what is with the darkness Max?
If you feel that way, please kindly leave, because there's no point in you being here.
Nah its just cause it was too bright at night
:P
i just used a random dark paint
I lost a piece of my oldest tooth recently, and I trowed up on the bathroom's stink...intruging, I know.
Seriously man, it's hard to see that.
Looks good thought.
though*
Jmo: Il repost with out dark bg :)
You got whipped something fierce didn't you dari.
swag
What are you talking about?
I believe they are discussing BDSM
what are we watching?
the screensaver 100ificati
oh
Once upon a time you were all for keeping the stupid out, now you've just flopped over like a two-bit kite.
we're watching something?
I've never been for instituting stupid rules that would harm the site.
whatabout the one that prevented us shipping otakon with inanimate objects?
or animate objects
s**g thelonecubone
or forces of nature and physics
>implying I had any part or say in that
Implying you have a part or say in anything.

If you don't enjoy being here, why do you still turn up Meanwhile?
thanks tom
Can't we all just enjoy each others company as we watch Ponies?
Dark_Horst: Meanwhile being too mean and not enough while.
thelonecubone swag
Jappleack: Stop it pls
ah
please*
dear geeks, 01100111 01100001 01101011
Hah
ok ok ill stop thelonecubone
The ponies don't mean much to me here. I come here for the people I've known.
^
To pick on the new meat, and because sometimes the stream is actually entertaining. I can enjoy movie night because it's, well, movies and chat is easy enough to blank out. Besides, I was here first, the stupid moved in after, as far as I'm concerned it can leave.
well that seems childish
"oh i was here first" :I
and?
Wouldn't you feel the same if you've been here as long?
you want a medal of honor
Therefore you can eat a dick, guy I've never heard of.
Lmao
67 61 6b
If you don't enjoy the chat, leave. There's no point sitting here being bitter.
You don't have to be in here to watch the stream.
Ive been here wuite a while now, but I know Meanwhile has been here far longer :D
*quite
I'll never get you guys. Some days you're all bros, next you're telling each other to leave.
:L
time of the month I guess
Love and hate
You're right, I don't. But I am anyway, in the vain hope that it'll pick up in quality.
Ninjazz: you are my bro forever :D
/me True friends are the ones that beat the crap out of each other...
Besides, if I wasn't, who'd you have this conversation with
MadSurge, I certainly hope so.
Ninjazz: Just because I like him doesn't mean I want him here if he's just going to bitch and be miserable.
hm
Who will keep all grammar in check if he leaves though? D:
dat jaymoo here?
/me pokes aniderp_work :3
You like me dabi? I'm touched. <3
Even his grave stone will be egotistical.
Allo aniderp
I can talk to him on Skype where his bitching doesn't annoy other members of BronyState.
:D I can see that Barbetos|AtWork
-wishes he had brony friends- ;-; foreveralone
I am one to talk, MadSurge
If that's how you guys work...
I guess that's fine.
Lol
I am an egomaniac
Barbetos|AtWork: I am more concerned about others instead :D
swag
Swag got old though :|
s**g
MadSurge: and annoying
:I
Jappleack: About your past 20 messages have just been 'swag'.
s**g
Please stop.
lol
Shouldn't that be "pls go"?
alright ill stop saying swag
pls go is reserved for things that are so dumbfounding no other words can be found
100 0111 100 0001 100 1011
alexxm: he did?
How about we use "groovy", "gnarly" and "funkatronic"? They're ridiculous but still not as old :D
damn
Fair enough.
MadSurge: How about Coarl
:P
I like groovy
Groovy.
derrrrrrp
whatcha all up to?
if only for the Bruce campbell reference
thelonepony yeah a couple of weeks back if japleack is swagestria
Radical
alexxm i stopped spaming it
Capital! :D
I like using a dictionary. Lots more words to use from one of them things. Makes conversations more interesting.
entirely
cept that one..
Barbetos|AtWork: indeed :)
Jappleack you still did it
How about we do that?
alexxm: He is Swagectia
alexxm: didnt he get banned sometime ago?
ya but the ban ended
i don't know thelonepony
hey all
Hi weccojecco
how are things weccojecco
If that's what you were banne for before, you clearly haven't learnt much of a lesson.
banned*
im fine
From now on if some one is to use the word "swag" they will be smacked with the biggest dictionary available in the immediate vicinity.
Barbetos|AtWork: or a thesaurus
Jappleack is the kind of person that likes snapbacks
Pls decode pls decode dis : 100 0111 100 0001 100 1011
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/oUwB2.jpg

No
If a dictionary can not be found, apprehend the offender and cart them off to the nearest library to get a proper smacking.

Barbetos|AtWork, smack him
Now. Who wants to be on my grammar police force?
Good afternoon everypony :)
/me noms on BladedWings :3
Meanwhile: I know you have a habit of saying that
swag hooks are tricky
Mostly because people don't believe me.
Can't imagine why.
I believe everything you say Meanwhile
Barbetos|AtWork: not me, I'm a foreigner! :D
Because you're supposed to hate everything.
s**g

Hiya! :)
Hey Pegasister!
I'm probablly not going to be here long, i'm gonna go try for my driver's licence and i'm real nervous...just thought you guys could help with that :$
Jappleack: you keep using that word, he told you to stop
well i stopped
Jappleack: Why do you feel the need to make utterly useless posts like that?
I bet you anything that Meanwhile has an online persona that he uses. In real life he is probably the sweetest soul you ever met. He teaches young handicap girls how to be ballerinas in his spare time.
also hi Pegasister
So. Cute.
I wouldn't have minded if you just did it once or twice
In real life I once mocked a handicapped girl from the top of some stairs.
BET YOU WISH YOU COULD CLIMB THESE.
Barbetos|AtWork: actually that wouldn't surprise me. :D
Or that.
But it is all you've done for the past 20 minutes.
Meanwhile: did you do jumping jacks too?
I would have.
Meanwhile: Everybody loves schadenfreude.
bai everyone ;_;

Ohai Sumi.
More Monkey Island? Score.
So, any news on when the next movie night's movies are getting picked?
hi sumi
probably tonight
I think it was done on the euro night last week
00,10Saterday is next lotto
Excellent. I wanna get the B-movie selection.
ah well
what did you choose?
I actually figured out how to vote for movies, so I did.
my little pony
wait...
I chose Karate-Robo Zaborgar as B-movie.
How many obligatory "rigged" comments were there this time?
are the old MLP movies technically B movies?
PONIEZ
We've had an old MLP movie for B before, so yes.
Sundaysmile: Smooze, that is all.
ah
00,10Many Ninjazz
Gonna get some pudding. AFK
So how about that new youtube layout...
As expected. :D
it sucks
I hate change
00,10have you looked at the winners names Ninjazz?
Yes. It feels like a tablet interface.
it frightens me
Sumica, yes, I have. Could you guess the first words that came to my head when I saw them?
One thing I don't get is why it leaves an entire third half of the screen blank, while at the same time smooshing text together.
00,10was it "fucking windows 98"?
so they can squeeze in more ads
Lol. Close.
dat aqua teen ref
But that's the thing, there are no ads in that space. There's nothing at all.
there will be....
there will be................
00,10um no, came way before aqua teen
/me sicks a german shephard on Sumica s shins
Nyst: And the fact that there is absolutely nothing there rustling the hell out of my jimmies.
It's upsetting me even more than if the space was filled with ads.
Yeah, it feels like I should turn my monitor sideways, like you'd do with your phone.
Back now. Mmm, pudding.
I also miss the uploader video bar.
Hunts Snack Pack makes really good vanilla pudding.
Good gracious yes.
I looked for that thing for around 10 minutes before realising it wasn't there at all.
Want to go to part two? well now you have to visit their page.
00,10gonna grab a drink then will set up
Yesterday's GTAIV stream was fantastic.
You can't even use the 'recommended' sidebar, because now instead of videos related to the one you just watched, it's showing videos related to your entire history.
The Shizubus just went bats:(t.
hello?
Hi, CrazyMuffin
shoo shoo be doo doo
Heya CrazyMuffin !
everyone here are so nice :3
Call upon the sea ponies when you're in distress
Eww ponies.
im hoping for a sea pony episode
CrazyMuffin: We always try to be as nice as possible.
wait for S4
Nyst: Well, I rarely visit the homepage anyway.
yeah. thats why i love you guys. every brony are so nice <3
:3
Or just wait for that junior novel coming out. One of the upcoming MLP junior novels has sea ponies.
CrazyMuffin: ...And then you meet Meanwhile.
Well, i just liked that it showed all the videos I missed.
If you are nice to us we are nice to you :)
CrazyMuffin: I hope you get hit by a helicopter.
^^
There's a reason why he's called Meeaaanwhile.
Cause he's meeeaaan.
i got that
Kammerjunk: Meanwhile is a particular case I'm afraid :D
What's weird is that there are no new features or anything to youtube. Why do a redesign if you're not adding anything new?
i hope meanwhile gets involved in the sequel of cupcakes :3
Cupcakes, what a shitty piece of writing.
Ew sequels to terrible fanfiction.
I dont approve with the new layout of youtube
overrated
overrated piece of shit
not scary, just a gore blood orgy fest
O.o
No lie, here's the cover for the seapony novel: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LWVtWgFe7Is/UKv65YAWnmI/AAAAAAABDJA/Cokip8luIHw/s1600/1.jpg
Nyst: Good news, they'll probably change it again in a few weeks. Bad news, it's probably going to be even worse.
now wait a second, the genre whas horror and that, and it whas excellent writing, ofcourse it is going to be scary
Nyst: they even got rid of that nice button that pulled out the chronological list of the uploader from the video you were watching :(
Because of it, most grimdark has been dumbed down by pure gore.
And I actually found Cupcakes to be a very interesting deconstruction of Pinkie Pie's character.
Seriously? Well that explains a lot.
Ok guys, g2g...see yall later ^_^
bye
Cupcakes inspired Party of One!
Ooh, we're live!!
Oh, hi Sumica
Right now the dates on all those youtube vids are seemingly random
OH SHI-
More Monkey Island! <3
oh gods
monkey island!
MODS ARE HERE! HIDE THE PONIES!
Recommending me videos from a month or weeks ago over actually recent videos.
Well if it isn't a good ol' classic point n' click.
Monkey Island!!
MONKEY ISLAAAAAAAAAAAAND!!!
hi
Sumica
Heya, wipergone2
and yet... no monkets
Monkey Island (TM)
monkeys*
good day
What am I watching?
Monkey Island is best island.
CrazyMuffin if you actually think Cupcakes was well written you should tie one end of a rope around your neck, the other end to a big heavy object, and leap from your window.
Anyone else thinks that Peter Jackson would make a Monkey Island movie?
Sundaysmile: not yet
Meanwhile: While on fire?
Hell, he remaked King Kong, which ALSO had an island setting.
is this a Sumica stream?
Ah, the remastered version.
wut
lemme get my wrenches
SpadeKyurem[School]: That seems a little redundant.
your face is redundant
I don;t think Peter Jackson would be a good pick for this type of thing
NEEEVER MIIIIIIND
:D
Born from an egg on a mountaintop, the punkiest monkey that ever popped. He knew every magic trick under the sun, to tease the gods and everyone and have some fun. Monkey magic, monkey magic. Monkey magic, monkey magic. Monkey magic, monkey magic. Monkey magic, monkey magic.
Sundaysmile: How's Michael Bay sound, then?
needs 20% more explosions
michael bay needs to die of irony
FROM POISON
Guybrush Threepwood's voice sounds like the voice of someone I used to know in middle school.
If Michael Bay directed Monkey Island then Guybrush's hair would explode.

What about M. Night Shyamalan?
dat spam
The humor he wrote for his own cartoons would be perfect for the Monkey Island film.
The twist is he was a ghost the whole time.
...If there IS one.
Meanwhile: Everything would explode
CrazyMuffin no emote spam
...And that it DOESN'T sucks...unlike other video game licensed films.
FUN FACT: Pirates of the Caribbean is actually compiled from a failed Monkey Island script.
So you like hmmmmbananas guybrush ?
We got bananas! :D
As such, Jack Sparrow and William Turner are Guybrush Threepwood split into two characters.
Oh lel.
BUSTED
Tm
And Barbossa is LeChuck.
Oooh, bananas!
>le
go back to 9gag
Theres one thing I hate about Rubix cubes, you have no chance of solving it if you forgot how you turned it
Is it me or are these guys really camp?
Shouldn't had made that choice, Sumica...
Now you're screwed.
VenHur: Im pretty sure this how you're supposed to get on with the plot
^
You know, when I'm not paying attention Sumi and Guybrush sound /similar/.
Ikr?
Ohhh myyy
Well, sad news, but I never owned The Secret of Monkey Island.
Oh lawdy.
I love their voices
This game is so silly.
Isnt health concious cannables a oxymoron or something?
camp cannibals
an*
Ninjazz: that's why it's so nice to play :D
who's playing monkey
Sumi is.
Derpy_at_work: Sumica is
i loved that game
MadSurge, I've always been turned off by the fact it's a point and click, but this humor is changing my mind.
00,10afk
Speaking of point and click, who else remember the Scooby Doo Genesis game?
Have fun.
Ninjazz: pick also Day of the Tentacle. It's made by Tim Schaefer and it;s really funny to play :D
I luved Full Throttle and The Dig also
oh i remmber that
MadSurge, I've heard of that one too.
A winner is you
Are you a bad enough dude to escape the island?
Ninjazz: it's a sequel, but you don't need to play the previous game (Maniac Mansion) to understand things. Just read about it or watch an LP
You're winner
I'm probably going to watch an LP, if I get interest, MadSurge.
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
Ninjazz: You should try playing DotT though, it's much funnier that way :D
Jmo: The fuck is with you and trout?
00,10Sorry for delay, work shortted me a day
Lel.
Yippee, Jaymeow. That ouch.
SpadeKyurem[School]: it is all his kangaroo mistress feeds him
Ninjazz: and I don't remember lots of "moonlogic" puzzles
MadSurge, I'll see if my eye patch still fits.
Moon...logic?
Just the way you like it Ninjazz
Ninjazz: Rediculace puzzles
U so gud to me.
;D
SpadeKyurem[School], ah.
Ninjazz: In basics its puzzles that require..odd thinking to solve them
SpadeKyurem[School], Ogod. I'm definately going to need an FAQ for that one.
the fu-?
Ninjazz: Hell, you ever played or heard of Kingdom of Loathing?
SpadeKyurem[School], haven't even heard of it.
Its ocean puzzle took the player base MONTHS to figure it out
Was it funny at least?...
/me shrugs
.-.
Wb Sumi.
WB Sumi!
Ninjazz: It had 43 islands that when plotted out on a grind and connected with lines it Spelt out the tiki god's name you needed to summon
*grid
Oh stream is on
Well, it's ages till movie night. I kind of want to pick a movie but I don't know how.
Thank you who is streaming this, saved me day right now
I thought you meant grid. Was there a map of the entire game or they had to plot it all out?
im so bored
this game taught me more english than primary school as a kid.
ty
Ninjazz: Im guessing they had to do it themselves
AND THEY DO THIS FOR FUN?!
DID*
Greedy monkey
The man can RUN
Oh you're hilarious.
push/pull the pole Sumi
The hell was the first?
whats the biggest monkey head he's seen
oh my :P
alexxm: Ikr
What is this?
the nose on the pole Sumi
The biggest monkey head he ever seen must of been King Kong.
DarianStephens: Secret of Monkey Island
try make the monky open the gate
monkey"
Evening: it's not interactive
oh.
second nose on the pole
Is this live?
Can you climb it?
DarianStephens: Yep
it took ages for me to do this :D
excellent! :D
hey its the alien from day of the tentacle
^^^^^
Who is the main character?
you mean the tentacle? :P
can you do something with the giant head?
Purple Tentacle :D
Evening: you eventually have to enter it
DarianStephens: Guybrush Threepwood
check the ear
^
hmm
does he have the key?
Alchemist: nope :D
Hello!

maybe if u place it somewhere it will open the mounth so u can enter
oh I remembver
bannana picker
not lemon
How long has this been going on for? Also, has this been going on since the start of the game?
is this a stream greenlight?
steam"
nope it has been on steam for a while
DarianStephens: I think it started yesterday, and yes they began from the beginning :D
The character sounds like Captain Sparkles
i like the tm symbol
Captain Sparkles speaks too slow.
thats everybody
lol ^^
Who is playing the game?
If Sumi would be perky and on a island full of monkies, him and Guybrush would sound the same I swer.
™
rocket boosters are turned on suddenly on the boat?
That's the thing.
further away you are from the shore the slower
big ocean u know
go out of the hut and in again and you will see some fun things
oh, the vegetarian cannibals :D

Evening: balanced diet.
Evening: its Monkey Island, everything is possible :D
still...
if i met a vegetarian cannibal in RL i whold laugh so hard

Not very bright are they?
dafaq is that
I think they're only cannibals for the lifestyle.

Does the game player have a youtube channel?
oh this is a fun part

lol
you need to get a head in cartographic
dont go too far in Sumi, you'll get lost
It's a silly labyrinth
where you get it i cant remember
DarianStephens That's sumi your talking about and he has but he isn't a LP'er anything he like many other mods streams games and all that for our entertainment
how do you do pings on the stream?
like yay or oh my sound
Evening That's mica's pings
I think the cannibals will you give you the head
Evening: it's Sumica's pings. don't spam them please.
The secret was to keep them a secret.
i mean do i gotta write something? lol
Which game is this one? I've only played curse of monkey island and the one after that.
You just have to believe.
Evening Using a client such as mIRC, you're capable of customizing your own ping sound to whatever you want.
As long as you have the MP3 file of it.
Shadows: this is the first part
Shadows: this is the first
wtf is this?
Himself. At night.
monkey island?
i think
ah
was it called that?
its a labyrint saumi do NOT get lost in there you need a cartographers head
or navigator's head
its a living breathing head
you need to get out and meet the cannibals
so guybrushes adventures in hell
:)
XD
meet the vegetarians
You got it wrong Sumi :D
dafuq?
lol
Back to the beginning for you!

I rest my case. Gay cannibals.
Can't you just steal the head?
and it tells me i reapeted a message :I
Stealing is bad and we all pay for it.
I don't mind the small ads at the bottom but I do dislike the fullscreen ones that block the entire screen for 12+ seconds.
TheSwift0704: gay vegetarian cannibals

Bronysmith: Yeah me too

Bronysith: me too, but we dont have much choice...
Bronysith: Same here
There are plugins to put it back
Bronysith: the lack of uploader videos, the massive chunk of empty space, the stupid 'what to watch' idea...
Give them the skull :D

Hope so, becuase last time you woken up afet 4 episodes of NewDCD was showing

Doh
like late 90's or early 2000's?
The head is trolling
It's a remake of the old game.
Head is trolling you
TheSwift0704: it's Secret of Monkey Island, early nineties
TheSwift0704: this is the remade version, the original one is from around 1992 maybe
ty
Ah point and clicks.
original game is from 1990, remake is from 2009.
^
No sense of direction, just walk everywhere, use everything on everything/one to see if it does anything.
I loved Loom
guessing this is the old version?
http://www.dorkly.com/comic/47055/the-most-dangerous-gamer
Loom was fun, but you kinda needed speakers for that game.
pony_2763: nope this is the new one
Alchemist you serious?
i think i may be falling in love with someone.
what does the old one look like? lol
My favorite adventure game was Indiana Jones & The Fate of Atlantis, followed closely by Sam & Max Hit the Road.
AJIsAwesome: awww :3
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/4f5c84a190321aeeead2d0a3ee736abb.jpg and she does evil dances!

(Old joke is old)
DrawingStar: ah, but when that happens, try to stay calmed
headless horseless chicken
Scootaloo.
thelonepony: I know but I'm no good at drawing plants ><
You know you're in a game when you start thinking the most basic things out loud
think you can grab what that sleeping guy was holding now
he rolled over
Heya
If being dead means all the lights get converted to calming blue I want to be dead.
so when is the next show airing, i need to know when to jack the streams
Tfw when the player and the protagonist of the game sound similar.
DrawingStar: But at least you can draw well ;3;
thelonepony: >.> kinda
:D
Shouldn't a bottle of ghost grog be empty?
if it was open, then yeah
TheGentleManBrony: logic? in these games? :D
ectoplasm should be spilling by now
TheGentleManBrony, no. why? the grog isn't dead, is it?
The liquid itself must be ghost liquid

Congratulations Sumica! You beat a game from Nostalgic Lane...
YAY

Inside a crystal salami?
KHAAANNNN
Who else wants a flugelhorn? :3
They were bough out by disney
Nope.
bought*
They still exists, nowadays, they made Star Wars The Old Republic and some LEGO games.
The remakes were done by telltale games.
They only make star wars games these days, and most of them are pretty mediocre.
You of the past 10 seconds doesnt exist anymoire
Or..
Good old Telltale
Same game that made the Homestar Runner game, Sam and Max, and Wallace and Gromit?
*guys
Ah credits.
You're still boring.
Have Telltale games ever made something other than a point and click?
How much longer?
Sumica: wait to see the credits of Monkey Island 2 :D
I remember the monty python and the holy grail game. Even the credits trolled you.
Sumica: Play the next Monkey Island!
Sumica, did you finish Rock of Ages?

stream stopped, engage panic mode
00,10I just stream here
And stream died :D
Well, what is the channel?

I am seeing a slide show
The strange thing is that the bundle of the first two games is more expensive than each of them separately.
Logan are you here?

Alchemist: I'll admit, I have no clue what I'm looking at.
He needs a life...
Kammerjunk: it's scat. :|
MadSurge: Oh, okay.
:(
fuck bots
:|
Alchemist: what is that? Explain :D
:o
Fluffy: no anime yet, sorry
prob its a gnaa attack
what is this game?
or somthing
Kammerjunk: its the surface of a silica wafer, measured by atomic force microscopy. The dots are polyelectrolite molcules which are about 3-4 nanometers "high"
MadSurge: It's okay
I love how most of these craft look like the least spaceworthy thing yet they fly
VenHur, did they launch me? .-.
wipergone2: "attack"? More like "waa I want attention" :D
^
Kammerjunk: the whole picture is an area of 2 micrometers by 2 micrometers
MadSurge: i am not seeking attention
AdamTheDuck: Nope...
MadSurge: it just wht i think
wipergone2: but the troll is
It's almost like you're admitting something.
Alchemist: Oh, it's something you took?
lol
Kammerjunk: eeyup :)
I hate rubix cubes
fluttershy is best pony
I always forget how I turned it so it becomes unsolvable
Oooh kerbal?
must be phase
Yay, cancan! :D
or not...
Chrysalis: nope, Sumi
Alchemist: Neat!
i am so confused
Whats this song?
but phase kills kerbals
Can can
Chrysalis: So does Sumica
Evening: a Can Can PMV
Liking the look
Kerbals live for only one thing, space slaughter
SpadeKyurem[School]: I have one of those. I sat and looked at it for 30 seconds, then threw it on my shelf.
FOR SCIENCE
whoever put that spam link in the chat, killurself
That is my response when I am asked why I'm doing something weird
For Science
...you monster.
Chrysalis: actually Phase is very proficient now. Sumica still wants to kill kerbals :D
this music is in tht server
What's this song?
but killins the fun part
i go look in the file
MadSurge: Wait, this game has another point to it than killing kerbals?
TheSwift0704: it's from Fighting Is Magic
MadSurge: Ty
When will you fly this spaceship?
Kammerjunk: shocking, isn't it?
what is the name of this game?
Rustyheadphones: Kerbal Space Program
Good Luck flying it! :D
idk wht it is called
:)
MadSurge: Absolutely astonishing.
Kammerjunk: how's it going my man? :)
8bit
yay 8bit! :D
:)
Hah, when I heard the few first tones, I thought of Lavender Town for some reason.
NEVER ENOUGH WING
more like a jet
Because you've been listening it far too many times, Kammer.
Ninjazz: But it's so relaxing!
That's what it wants you to think, Kammerjunk. .-.
/me hums the DuckTales moon level song
I got distracted by the Omen, what did I miss?
Meanwhile: Nothing extraordinary.
Meanwhile: End of the world. Nothing big.
i gotta go
be one when i get home
Fair enough.
bye aniderp_work
Meanwhile: Sumica beating Monkey Island and starting killing kerbals.
So whats everyone going to be doing during "The End"
This song is oddly appropriate.
Same as always.
SpadeKyurem[School]: I'm still betting on DayZ coming out that day.
Probably wasting some time here. XD
Im going to be playing Wow, watching ponies, laughing my ass off at the idiots who buy that shit
I't wont be "The End"....
Evening: I have it in quotes because its not gonna happens its a load of bullshit
ikr
nice
needs more wing
the end comes for us all
Pretty.
you cannot escape it
Can it drob bombs?
dat jet
Brace yourselfs, the stil lalive posts on december 21.
Can I ask why when they saw the calendar end, they automaticly assumed it was a doomsday propechy?
'Cause it totally looks like a bomber jet.
Couldent the Myans just have..I dont know...STOPPED MAKING THE CALENDAR
hush now quite now
what game?
SpadeKyurem[School]: Naw, man. It's the end.
No its doomsday!...God I hate humanity
hell the bible predicted a giant meteor would come and destroy earth or something a few years ago
but then again, the mayans are pretty smart
Plagued with morons
SpadeKyurem[School]: they said "when it's time we will do another calendar" :D
it's not even when the mayan calander ends...
Doesnt the Myan calendar loop?
at the gala
it doesn't loop then either, there are stuff after it still XD
Buytoast: That was probably the Pope. But if he was to be believed, the world would end every few years.
what that game?
WHo was that idiot who said the Rapture was going to happen?
hasn't the maya calendar ended some time ago because of "feb 29th" years?
no, there was some history channel thing years ago where they were analyzing the bible and stuff
Rustyheadphones: Eeyup.
and they're like "a metoer will come within a few years and end it al" or some shit
If the world was supposed to end via the calendar, it would have happened years ago
I'm not saying it's aliens...
jcelios: ...but it's aliens.
but it's ponies.
all that's going to happen is that the planets will align
Buytoast: And everything went better than expected.
no, its muffins
and the titans will be freed
Yo wassup suckas?
Buytoast: Why does that sound familiar...
I'm still counting on the Old Ones to awaken the 21st.
Cthulu for President 2016
well, the titans and some random ass giant cyclops
Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fh'tagn!
kia ora every pony
blast off
I'm waiting for teleporter tech on Mars first, so we've got a way to go yet.
here goes nothing
What would Cthulu's Campaign platform be?
Rocket ships!
KILL THEM
Or his policy?
SDFWQRVRQWVAWV
therainbowvortex: Valedico!
someone lost all the bits
SpadeKyurem[School]: KILL ALL HUMANS
SpadeKyurem[School]: Tentacles in every household?
SACRIFICE BABIES
HERE WE GO GUISE
huh double xp on PS2
...
/me facepalm
just reading it would set your eyes on fire
Chrysalis: Ps2?
Best timing ever with the song
Your space plane has a parking brake?
PlanetSide 2
Oh ._.

Meanwhile: They made it espesially for people like Sumica

Need more lift dude.
SAVE US AQUA MAN
OOPS

DAMN SCIENCE
Well. That could have gone better.
Meanwhile: Well, of course. How else would you park in space?
Get some air under those wings

Death count: 1
Reduce Reuse Recycle!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
"Don't want to leave wreckage..." Destroy the evidence! XD
Mermaid Man save us!
SRBs under the wing
Numa numa?

such is the price of failure
and over the wing
numa numa yay
on the end of wing
yo dawg
If at first you don't succeed, more goddamn thrusters.
i hear you love rokets
what version of this song is this?
the thrust has been trippled!
good bye fuel economy
just piano?
You know what this rocket needs?
Needs more thrusters
SpadeKyurem[School]: A coffee dispenser.
oh god
numa numa piano
this is really good
FOR SCIENCE
And then space
died
the end
This can only end well.
dont fly
oops

Science isnt about why
Woops.
... Whoops?
That kerbal looks terribly excited for this.

HE GONAN BE A SPESS MAHREEN IN SPESS
Its about whynot
ded

lolwat?
You need to get more clearance between the tail and the ground
Your parachutes did not work as intended.
it just..
Next Kerbal, please.
Sumica: it's the 40th annivesry of Apollo 17 today, DO THEM PROUD
and more lift
dissapeared
What the fuck is the water made of that it INSTANTLY DISINTIGRATES THE CRAFT
ELLO
scootaloothechicken: Sup sucka?
what are we watching?
Gotta go fast
SpadeKyurem[School]: You mean what is the craft made of to instantly disintegrate in water, right?
Hello
Gotta go fast
SpadeKyurem[School]: Chocolate milk?
Kerbal Space Program
those are the aliens from Signs. Water= Death
lol i come in. see a jet next to the ocean. it skipps some frames and the next thing i see is a bunch of bubbles in the ocean
Faster Faster
Speed isn't the problem! it's lift and clearance!
:O
Who is that?
it must be made of some strong alkali metal right
TheSwift0704: Naw, it's speed.
so much engeneering
It's always speed.
SpadeKyurem[School]: it's made of pirahnas :D
DEATH WATER
More power solves all space travel problems
I guess you may be right. Real life stuff must not apply to this
here we go again
alkali metal + water = boom
Who be streaming?
In real life those would be the issues
Sumica is streaming
did you just blow out your engines?
yay
Damn, shoulda guessed
Huh
Sumica: I hope you don't do this for a living
I'd believe this game is secretly NASA looking for shuttle designs, but I know what it looks like when NASA makes a game.
So many people would die
isn't it usualy phase4 that is blowing up/crashing rockets?
Hoody|Skool: he cooks for a living, so no :D
HE WILL BE A SPESS MAHREEN IN SPESS
taoumi: we changing it up D:

Derpin: There is no goal in this game.
Ninjazz: Okay, fine
Sumica: Why d oes the SAS freak the fuck out in atmosphere?

SpadeKyurem[School]: It just looks that way.

The game is still beta, and the SAS tends to freak out, but it never goes apeshit.

Funnily enough the starfox barrel roll isnt actually a barrel roll, I forget what it actually is called
Hi yall flappers
Ahhh, okay.

SpadeKyurem[School]: It actually is a barrel roll
To barrel roll, press Z or R twice!
SpadeKyurem[School]: Aeleron roll, or sommink like that
Why are the fins flipping the fuck out?
Before it ends, what is the name of this music?

Why won't he eject?
How I love it so
SLide around!
oh
oooo
ERM
Uh....
mushrooms didn't help
I think the wings will rip off
Kammerjunk, even when the power of metal courses through its chords?
This looks worse
DarianStephens: The parachutes will rip out first.
Ooh, I like this version of Lavender Town.
You should get engines that work in space.
Also, that is too hard landing. I think those are the weak paras.
nice
The wings won't rip off!
Ninjazz: Metal can be relaxing.
Ah, that's soft enough.
Kammerjunk, can't argue with that.
can you use your control surfcces to get the nose up?
Close enough.
Oh he survived
Okay I stand corrected
congrats
I think I found out the name of the last starfox remix, It's Star Fox - Corneria (Metal Remix)
WELPP
look tht thing is smoking weed
HA
Your arwing is damaged
I think I sleep to metal. XD
wow wasn't expecting that!
can you take off with one wing and one engine?
You now have Single Laser

Every time I hear the wily stage I hum the brental floss song
Rockman

Now he's stuck in a barren green wasteland

I wonder if he knows he didnt go anywhere.
Well, time to go home.
The kerbals need a explode button
bai Kammerjunk

Hoody|Skool: No, the kerbal guy.
Bye Kammerjunk :)
Bye Kammerjunk

Oh, my apologies Kammerjunk. :$
GilDash: D:
AJ: Magic.
AJ: MAGIC FUCKA

Kammerjunk: I'm sorry, it just looked so fun!
AJIsAwesome: you so sillieh :3
AJ: You should see the Thing where supposedly 3 fit into.
And I own EVERY generation of pokemon
AJIsAwesome: Haha, it's fine.
Ah that's the new version. Nice.
SpadeKyurem[School]: U could cheat but i don't like cheating myself....
Yeah have fun with that extra weight there.
I don't cheat because i don't like cheating
But i don't care if u do
:P
lol
I used to cheat all the time as a kid. :S
It will not get you into space because the engines will go out...
banned from equstia
Did they add weapons to this game yet?
OOOrrr
Ninjazz: There is a rocket and railgun mod.
But for the older version.
Mod. Not ingame as far as i'm concerned.
SpadeKyurem[School]: U could use the Masuda Method if you have Black or White (or 2) if you don't know what it is google it! :D
I know it would be cheating but Im kinda sad Black 2/White 2 doesnt let you have a White Kyurem and Black Kyurem at the same time
Yes, because this game needs more explosions
Ninjazz: Nope.
Hoody|Skool: You can never have enough.
8 Bit winter wrap up
Or 16 bit?
MICHEAL BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
8 bit
whos excited for ep 6
Yep.
GilDash: I can :I
Hoody|Skool: Lies!
wipergone2: SCOOTALOOOOOOO
Hoody|Skool: And if you've got too much, pass 'em on to me. I could do with a few more...
Oh dear. That will go horribly wrong.
Everyone has
Everyone
I saw one last night
SpadeKyurem[School]: What's that?
Oh, you can actually read us?
I seen one last year, cant remember which one was it
Well then, here is a challenge. Get a ship into orbit. With only ion engines.
I never managed that.
Ey mon, ya gotta get da speerit o creesmas
And I think it is impossible.
I also saw a poster for a Legend of Zelda Symphony of the Goddess Orcastra
Shame I cant go see it
That sounds amazing
It would never go so fast that they would shred off.
It would go at probably 1 metre per second.
It said it was for January 25th
rarity build shuttles
SpadeKyurem[School]: Want
as dresses
Of course. So...it's impossible. With stock parts.
Anyhow, since when do you play KSP?
We should do Dwarf Fortress sometime

It looks really good.
SPAAAAAAACE
colision. there is none
What game is this...?
What's your orbit pattern?
Yeah, but that are way too much panels for one measily ion enginge.
Ahh, M4 Part 2.
One Ion engine takes...7 energy per scond.
Can't possibly remember where that comes from. :p
One panel produces 14 or so.,
nice
But it looks cooler.
Transformers, more than meets the eye
I swear I heard this song in the credits to something
It costs 400,000 dollars to operate this station...for twelve seconds
juice
SpadeKyurem[School]: No
Vordox: Yes
SpadeKyurem[School]: No
I always forget the action groop too. How many RCS fuel do you have left?
Oh it sounds like the end of ME3 but it isn't
Vordox: Hyes
SpadeKyurem[School]: noes
Ah ty
Send it to a black hole :3
adios everyone :)
No, this is M4 Part 2.
CHANGEFORMERS: LESS THAN YOU'D EXPECT
It's from the end of ME1.
Did you try docking already?
I played that game about 23 times. XD
ThunderRush: Symmetrical Docking?
It works like a charm.
Not really. Just set target and then get close.
Sumica has a ....unique way of space flight
But yeah. It needs a bit of skill.
Which I'm sure you have,
Don't waste your RCS. I just wait for the ion RCS.
YOU have a unique way of space flight HAHAHA (jk)
I hope they include them soon.
Ahhh, okay.
They satellte dishes have no use for now, right?
Niiiceee
Sumica space travels! Enjoy SPace@ With a 20 percent survival rate!
How do you even use RCS?
They are just here for the looksies?
SpadeKyurem[School]: Sign me up! How much is it
Perpetum mobile.
They use powe.r
Troll Science
inb4 space ponies
I would be surprised if they don't.
Okay.
Wow.
Rustyheadphones: Ture dat
That would be the total hack.
true*
Nope?
Needs more sand
Sumica: lasers?
An ION cannon?
Sumica: is that all in the new version?
LOIC
Because it is an sattelite after all.
AN ECLIPSE CANNON?
Party?
no party
weeeeeeeeee
!ping me
It needs rotation.
MilkyWhiskers
This is my helicopter impression
You spin me right round
soisoisoi
Right round
like a rented baby
cowvarkian: thank u doctur
Too bad the solar panels clip into each other.
MilkyWhiskers: you're welcome
But now it really looks like an ion cannon.
Uhh
What was the command for renaming yourself?
und dann a giant laser spewed out of it, and killed billions
"/nick
How much are we going to hold the world ransom for?
somewhere in space some alien see that
I know!
cowvarkian: Ah right... It was a long time ago...
One BILLION DOLLARS!
one meeeelion dollars
!nick Doktor Von Milky

It's space. You have no air to stop you.

When I get angry, Mr Bigglesworth gets upset
Doktor Von Milky is apparantly Doktor
Hm...yeah, but they move to the outside.
torque torque torque. tork tork tork.
SpadeKyurem[School]: >.>
..
XD
So it should spin faster.
Is that supposed to spin that fast?
and when Mr Bigglesworth gets upset, PEOPLE DIE
You can always try it.
FINNALLY
LOL
But I would say...no.
...
Von: lol indeed
YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND
Suddenly Starfox blows the station up

I'm diiiizzzzzyy..

Okay. Let's see what this baby will become.
Space. Let's go to space. Space. SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEEEE
Upper left corner.
cowvarkian: I still have a VHS of it somewhere :)
We should put our differences aside for science
Rainbowish: I am stuck here with a core that's completely upset... With space!
MadSurge: I probably do too

Finally

Shizuka: OFC
Shizuka: You cannot Lov Vivi.
Vordox: Hey I put up with the ads for like Mips or Limev because they didnt interupt the entire stream
You can't hog her for yourself. D:
How did you get the job as livestreamer here anyway?
Space. I wanna go to space. Are we going to space? Space. SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCE! Getting tired of space.
Not going to lie. That thing looks kinda badass.
Its starting to look like a Starfox boss or something
You're in a japanese mood, Mica?
Shizuka: so how is our favorite Vivi loving Pyro today? :)
They should rach the ground, yeah.
It looks kinda big.
You really think that thing will fly?
ThunderRush: it shouldn't
It's KBS. Screw physics.
poor testers
ThunderRush: exactly
Yeah, that is totally sweet.
Well...it's not exactly like the mod.
nothing is exactly like the mod
Well, in the mod you had them place them manually, yeah.
Exactly.
It looks really, really good now, tho'.
Hm...who is streaming?
SpadeKyurem[School], I think I see what you mean
There is no conventional rocket in KBS.
KSP
lol it's look bigger than angar gates
Hmm...the voice...
sumica
OH~
Woah

The soliod rocket boosters will fly against the others.
And explore.
*explode.
Hi guys, i have returned ^_^
You realize that?
no go
it's not slow
AND CONQUER
ThunderRush: yes
yes I do
yes
Wooooow.
what is the goal of this game??
Pure skill.
cool
Coolbond: There is no goal.
It's a sandbox.
This got working SAS or is it manual
where's the fuel meter?
You are Despicable Me, sending your corn cob people to bomb space.
Don't lie to the poor guy
hmm
SCIENCE is the goal
That's the point of the game.
green bars
TheSwift0704: The blue button over the globe on the bottom of the screen shows SAS is enabled.
ah thanks
y we don't build these rocket?
kk
/me hands 100 bits to cowvarkian
Where do you want to go with that thing?
pony_3045: because we don't have infinite supplies and resources
/me takes the money and runs
too bad
To the sun!
Orbit?
TO THE MUUUUUUUUUUUN~
and these kill more people then it sends into space
Oh hell
pilot1: and what we do now?
SAS is off dude
nvm
TO THE MOOOOOON!
mmmmmmmbananas
Follow the violet point.
Yeah.
That will show you where you...
LOL!

Is the point to get to the Mun and back?
yes oops
Hahahahaahah.
Caus Luna already did that

Congrats bro.
Well there's your problem lol
You should work for nasa.

Just a loud splash.
Bad Apple?
Lunac: ikr
No.
Let it on.
might be a good idea
Awwwww. Anyway, I hope you have the best parachute.
bad apple :D
Sumica: ikr
Did he reuse the concorde design from loas time?
send it hurling into the closest land mass
Lunac: Nope.
...
dat tank of explosives
TNT?
well $#!%.
GilDash: Yes
melodie_Dream: who would use tnt as a rocket fuel?
that's just stupid
No. That's Kerbal Style.
Whos streaming kerbal?
cowvarkian any looney toons villian
GANGNAM STYLE
you wouldn't even get off the ground
XD
cowvarkian: Solid Rocket boosters are basically controlled TNT explosions.
Starlight_Phoenix: Sumica is :)
They have a rave inside that thing.
i miss show comment button on youtube...
all science is is controlled explosions
whats the goal for kerbal today>
What weylin said.
weylin: XD
00,10liveing
what is going on
Starlight_Phoenix: Kerbals got killed
AND TOUCHDOWN
I should know. I'm an English major, after all :V
weylin|Blarg: if it were, then science would be alot more interesting
cowvarkian: I'm joking. I have just a bit of an idea. But I think it is.
They srvived! failure
cowvarkian: I know, right?
not like I don't fucking worship science already
TRIPLE GOOSTERS ACTIVATE
Anyone here in kindergarten like me? No? Didn't think so.
lol

I have no Idea what I'm saying sorry guys
he will never get off the ground, and if he does, he should explode in mid-air from all the wobble
It will be fast at least.
WHy more boosters? you mangaed it withou them last time
What's the magic level of this space vechile?
tnt
GoldenMic: Over 9000.
OVER 9000!
cowvarkian, 10 bits he will
exactly
I'll take your money
everything
Dat link
You do sound like kurtjmac.
20 bits it'll blow up/
gladly
If you know him.
I really hope it blows up

20 bits it will get to space
swde50: IKR?
GoldenMic 2obits it;ll do a Challenger
I'll take your money too
that's the foam that falls off the fuel tank
let's waTCH AND SEE
When they crash on the ground.
it's going to blow up
pchooooooooooooo
NEEDS MORE SRBS
huh, its still alive
talk a boutoverkill
this should not work
NASA should be taking notes here.
This is how you make a rocket.
blow UP! I NEED 20 BITS!
Kammerjunk: so we can spend billions on fuel, so we can just die in space?
Woah
oooh
This should not work... and yet it is...
HA HA!
cowvarkian: Yes.
preeety
Yeah pretty pattern
nuke symbol
wtf?
NOW BLOW UP THE PATTERN!
haha
why is this working?
/me hands cowvarkian 20 bits
didn't even get out of the atmosphere
lol
no, he did
You're mising some lander legs.
didn't work

I think.
Going down!
*cool
It looks odd.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
cmon...
Blow UP!
nice knowing ya buddy

Woo, I keep my monies!

Hey that could actually work.
ThunderRush: fine
Fluffy: keeping monies?
I'm amazed.
comeon, explode
It actually works!
WHAT
LOL
Hell even the Nazis did better with rockets then this guy
hmmg.
REVERSAL!
He saves the day once again.
Damn, I wanted to see it crash.
Explicating poems, and watcing ridiculous rocket science. This is what college life has boiled down to, now
No cemoent

The shipname! Oh god, so funny.

ttfn fluffy
This is gonna be spectacular.
we're going into ^
Add a nuke.
So, the rocket exploded because you had too many rockets. And you fix it by adding more rocket?
going into
As in, longer rocket.
fail sorry
eeyup
LET THERE Be SPLOSIONS!

you need more support
I regret making that Spotify account!
YES TNT IT BLOW UP
kids... sometimes you love'em sometimes you wanna throw 'em in a woodchipper.
I feel very sorry for the nonexistant astronauts aboard that rocket.
Sounds like the punischer, jcelios.
He throws people into woodchippers all the time.
got his number handy?
ThunderRush: sounds like my kind of guy
Rainbows in the UK?
Sounds fun
So
Sure 0-800-WOOD-CHIPPER
Whos streaming? And Kerbal...
sumica
dayuumm, havent seen kerbal for a while
It's Sumica's stream
They just released a Kids Bop app on Spotify and now I don't want to join Spotify anymore
This should be good
Yaay
yay
Brony_ponies: good
That was a flutteryay.
:(
Annnd its Sumice, this will be great
Sumica*
:'(
Sumica: Do you have Friendship in Tartarus?
yay
Oh yeah, attach some rockets WITHOUT adding tethers. Yeah, no wonder it failed the first time.
Hiya! :)
I kinda cant wait to see this one
hullo :)
Oh look! People!
HI PEOPLE BELOW THE ROCKET
Heya Pegasister :)
Fluffy|Store: what the hell what?
PREPARE TO DIE IN A FIERY CRASH COURTESY OF SUMICA'S FAILURE!
oh wow, it really sounds mid 90s in here :)
yay
Nah, sounds more like classic YouTube.
Alchemist but thankfully no 90's kid or Rob Lieflied
Sounds more like PMV.
Back when YouTube was a mgical place.
i love pmvs
going to blow up
im a 90's kid ;-;
I love it :)
This should be good
DLYYYYYYY
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #648

Im an 80s kid so I kinda like it
/me facehoofs.
annnnnnnnnnnd boom
Wobblewobble
Oh
Did the song just said "Burn it up" and you started the rocket?
wibble-wobble
That was pretty badass.
There we go
And ded
this is known as a glitch
They surived!
Wow, epic fail.
at least it was beautiful
Its no use! ~Silver
this should've happpened everytime
at least they lived this time YAY!
That's not going to slow them down enough!
cannot believe they lived
Take this!
Sumica :(
that was fantastic
It are solid rocket boosters. Struts only can manage a bit.
!grepquote /$I/
The fact that your astronauts lived this time is a f:(king miracle.
mt!
Sumica: make is have less rawkets
Do I hear Daft Punk? o3o
/me loves censoring his swears with Fluttershy.
it*
Maybe if we have rockes at the rockets?
Well, couplers are the weakest part in KSP.
At least from my knowledge.
Less first stage rockets
Oh my, the stream for tonight is going to be spectacular~
:(
...not a rocket scientist just say, "My rocket isn't working"
problem with rockets? must add more rockets
Felxible != Good
I havent been here that much in the last few weeks. Have anyone seen Lil_B lately?
yes
Still problem with rockets? ADD EVEN MORE! AND SCREW THE COUPLINGS!
Because wobbly rocket is always bad.
wobbly rocket explodifies
i have a non-pony related question hopefully someone can help me with.
Though, I thought we've already watched Jurassic Park?
I know how to fix it
Have no rockets
And then
We need to add duct tape.
It wont wobble
Simplez
wtf is this?
Kerbal Space Program
EmeraldSky: no. We only deal with pony related questions here.
Go ahead, EmeraldSky.
Works EVERY time.
i'd love to see walkthru of Mario or tanks
They really need to add mythbuster style duct tape to this game.
EmeraldSky: What's your question? :)
Im a friggin chemist... of course i know how rockets rocket. Put rocks at em.
How else would you fix a rocket in space
bronystate, where if you mention ponies you will get barraged with G3 nonsense
because that makes sense, right
who needs sense?
not us
thank you AJ: im uploading Windows 7 onto a USB drive, in order to install it, do i just open it from the USB drive, restart the computer, or Format the computer?
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
Hi everypony
EmeraldSky: yes
I thought a phone was ringing, then I realized that its the ambient of the song :D
only 4 boosters
hey Dinky
Stig? The racedriver?
Yeah, they really do
Do it
got nothing better to do
More rockets?
I went to some old guys party with my my pone jacket... they wanted to sell me g3 casettes..
:'(
Hopefully, we'll actually get to the upper atmosphere this time.
What the...
What are you trying to to?
Pizza_pone: lol...
*do
Needs moar rockets
Try to land on the launch pad that would be great piloting
Oh wow.
...ramjets?
incoming drop
damn ad's -.-
Sweet
Ramjets? Ramjets.
Ramjets are best jets.
I think they work in space too, right?
...Jesus
Gotta ram em all
Actually, you might need more fuel
EVERYTHING goes wrong with you at the wheel, Sumica.
With six on each tank?
i don't think that is going to work either, and never say "What could go wrong" you are building a rocket a lot can go wrong
Oh. This looks so safe.
science is ALWAYS safe
Need I remind you of yesterdays "no friction on cars" GTAIV fiasco?
Juding catgeorie: Stlye, Control, Damage, and Height
Shizuka: do you maintain you pc?
Sumica: Well, theres the fact that the rockets could explode, it could wobble and many other things
what could possibly go wrong?
...
Wobbly rockets are the worst rockets
Oh, here we go.
LOOK SUMICA
THEY ARE ALREADY SCARED
DONT DO IT
How can this possibly go wrong?
incoming boom
Aww u did it
aaaaand BOOM
Okay, fairly stable...
you forgot the duct tape again Sumica
фтв тщц нщг вшу
Anyone wanna place bets on survival times?
FAIL
Pfft.
Wubble wob wob
HAHAHA
derp
LOL
лооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооол

I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY
WHAT I TELL YOU!
Abort, abort

I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY NIGHT AND DAY
HAHA
Sumica: Youmight are ded
EEEEeeey Hooo

Nope.AVI!
lol boom
I THINK THEY LIVED!
awesome music switch there
mission accomplished
Until it didn't
Aha aha NO
Goodbye everyone :)
You obviously need more fire.
try remove dem boosters from center
Every button reads "TO THE MOON"
worked beuatifully for 5 seconds
They never stood a chance.
jaymoo left...
Killing off the Kerbal race, three 'nauts at a time.
Of course it needs more fuel. That's exactly what I said earlier
You need to launch the second rockets faster.
TNT
they broke whole thing
one of the secondary boosters wasn;t coupled correctly
So the ramjets don't collide with the rest.
ok they are going to die again
aniderp|bestcakeever: jaymoo is still here, see Jmo|Sleeping
And it'll be the same thing again
just sleeping
oh well..
so, not really ehre
PREPARE FOR FAIL
but you get my point
I'm surprised it flies straight.
but much more stable
*flys
Kerbals. They are a strange race of beings. They invented space travel before ANY OTHER INVETION.
i bet 1000 bits they will die
go rocket go
invention*
In a few seconds...
Barbetos|AtWork: and they all live underground
Right
the fuck ya'lll watching here?
WHEEEEEE~!
maybe
Okay. Yeah that's not stright.
Aww, it didn't explode
*straight
анд нау ю дай
XD
Stopwatch: Kerbals.
Oh wow, we're actually doing fairly well this time.
cowvarkian: Yeah. Their gov't says its easier to render that way
TO THE MOON!
SO they listen.
Straight-ish
:P
Were watching wubbling rocks
Barbetos|AtWork: ikr
it's the MUUNE
wubs
Let's go save Luna!
It's WORKING
we're watching mighty SCIENCE in action
Holy piss, it is WORKING
HAPPY HARDCORE TECHNO
<
<3
yay
dangerous angle
how do you know that? could reach orbit
Piss in my Kellogg's and call me Betty, he hasn't blown up yet
<3 yay <3
working is relative
theyre not dead
thats working so far
weylin|Blarg: lolwut
what s the name of this game?
bo0oring, you're talk appleness c:
He was talking to me. *fangirl flail*
Kerbal space program
kerblin space progra
cowvarkian: I dunno
kerbal*
We're gonna go save Luna, everypony!
We actually made it into SPACE this time!!
Oh shi
Those are the thrusters with vector thrusting, roit?
...now what>
SPAAAAAAAACCCCEEEE
SPACE: need to go to space!
OH MY GOD, HE'S DONE IT!
Buffer to infinity
Ohgod Ohgod
That's a rather short orbit...
Dat name
YOu have yet to reach the moon?
Sumica: I really dont think this is gonna work...
Won't this take like months?
Yaaay
We're going to save luna!
Stopwatch: no, like hours
yeah thats what I meant
According to the readings...something is happening.
...I /really/ should be working on my project...but brain says this is more interesting right now
Meanwhile: what a genius
Advertisement
Its digital age.. you can speed up time
weylin|Blarg: it's probably right
To get this feature to work you first need to be in an orbit, Sumica.
Landing on the moon and hitting it are sorta similar
If I got the tut right.
cowvarkian: it probably is. Curse you, ADD ;A;
are there ponies in there?
ponies?! where?!
It will then show you the interplanetary burn point.
if you go to the say hi to luna for me
weylin|Blarg: add/ adhd is worst thing
or best
depends on how you look at it
if you go to the moon say hi to luna for me
depends on the drugs
jcelios: ikr
Lol, the little guys in the ship are freaking out
worst as it's a disorder surely
those kerbals look like they're freaking out
though mine seem to be barely effectual
cowvarkian: best for writing and getting artsy shit done. horrifically terrifying when school is brought to mind
and having no medication to boot
weylin|Blarg: yeah, true
weylin|Blarg: thats what theft is for
dat twins music
Astronauts: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
lol
The Kerbals are all "SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE"
Anyways... why did they take the spore editor?
The kerbals are screaming, but no one can hear them
hey Sumica can you make red dwarf next
In space, noone can hear you scream.
They're all "DAMN SPACE YOU SCURRY!"
Except for the other kerbals
hell, all the medicine one takes for ADHD/ADD is just cocaine, but less stimulating and longer lasting
yay
They probably aren't even astronauts, they just taped some random people inside the craft.
Point at the planet and decouple.
Oh, now we're losing altitude.
Meanwhile: like true scientists
YAY
That will give you enough forward boost to get down.
Meanwhile like red dwarf
And you're spinning the Kerbals right round.
and then there's all the emotional problems with ADD/ADHD, too...and ODD
UGH
That's...nothing like Red Dwarf.
Ahhhh, okay.
you should play "on the beautiful blue danube" would fit perfectly
XD
Then...yeah.
ODD?
They're gonna throw up.
Oppositional Defiant Disorder
The Kerbals have accepted their fate.
fuck u
I wonder when they will add puking into the game.
better song... then silence
Party.
Oh look, the earths coming up to say hi!
Or... kerbal planet.
waiting for burning on reentry
Best song to play while tumbling through SPAAAAAAAAAAACE
lost in space?
JIGGAJIGGAJIGGAJIGGAJIGGAJIGGA
Uh...what's that song called?
It reminds me of an old game.
Kerbalina?
/me puts Chrysalis on nachos
is this that classic song done metal
weylin|Blarg: I'm all for anarchy, but meh
Karbality?
Bronysith no
cowvarkian: :T
We're supposed to go save Luna!
Kerbineria
"Oh the karbality!"
weylin|Blarg: I mean with the whole ODD thing
Is there any way to speed up the process of the descent?
Let's go, everypony! To the moon!
Wow, that song sounds so familiar...
Where's this music from?
its Lost in Space
Sounds like Sonic.
Katamari Damacy?
Lost in Space
come on guys
its the lost in space credits
Terraria is so underrated
Lost in Space?
i said it already
geez
it had Matt LeBlanc in it
Ahhh.
Pizza_pone: Terraria is awesome.
Ohai :D
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Pizza_pone: you kidding me? people wont stfu about it XD
terraria is just so dull though
I had to turn off caps first :p
Could you hurry up with the whole crashing thing?
Like a satteloite
This is taking awhile.
cowvarkian: I know. I actually did a report on ODD and its link to ADD/ADHD back in Tech school. Dr. Russell Barkley has some amazing information...even if the guy's a total downer :c
Sumica Lost in space? oh god that movie is awesome
I love the song choice
Hi
was this the goal of the mission?
Crew: "are we dead yet?"
Sumica We need that for BMN one day
They're gonna crash into the land. They dead.
weylin|Blarg: hmm
Nah, they've got a 'chute
I think...
killerpony7733: Agreed. I've not seen LiS in years.
Rusty: The stream window crashed right when you said that.. wut
NO CHUTE CAN SAVE THEM FROM SUMICA
if you go to the moon say hi to luna for me!<3
I am prophet.
See, they know they're fucked.
STFU LEBLANC
Go to space they said. It will be fun they said.
my*
he's not gonna make it to the moon :P
Meanwhile: yes
Told you.
oops
HAAAAAAAAA
Prophet as in I made pizzapones window crash.
Time warp is bollshet.
SuperBrony64 You should be in bed, young man.
>:l
watch pone now?
Spaceplane!
GilDash Yeah but the so far no win on anything. Seen several get several wins in several weeks but i have no luck :S
Well im off to try and install this Windows 7, wish me luck
Buytoast: so you're canadian, right
08,01i have ADHD
MURIKAN
Buytoast: so, british
killerpony7733: Well, I've got no chance anyway, so at least you have more luck than me! :D
Er, wat
Awesome. So the goal...out of atmosphere with the rocket, and landing with the plane?
DEUTSCH MURIKAN
Or just bugger all rocket?
Just put a few dozen rockets on it.
Oughta make it work.
and polish
can you make a pyramid rocket?
08,01CriticKitten: some of it is, some of it isn't
ADHD everywhere is fake
and irish
I'm pretty sure I don't have fake ADHD, but what do I know
Guess the second option then.
the old home remedy is hitting
YES. This is a fantastic plan.
hitting in the head
08,01CriticKitten: aye
That is not a spaceplane. That is a suidcidal rocket.
...are those fuel tanks or rockets?
I approve wholeheartedly.
Copperhead: Solid Rocket boosters.
that is gonna crash horribly
Ah
oh wow
those bells
Solid Rocket Boosters are rockets that cannot be turned off after launch, but develop a great thrust to weight ratio.
This...is gonna be awesome. For about twenty seconds. Then it's gonna suck
are at this rooms resonant frequency
that was awesome
this is not ecologically safe
weylin|Blarg: well then why am I still being medicated for it...
08,01unfortunately, the UK NHS doesn't really believe that it's something that some people don't grow out of
inb4 xplosion
And some is just overdiagonsis because some doctors are stupid. But ADHD is most definitely real. It's just something that was misapplied a lot in the 90s.
it looks like a star<3
I know what SRBs are
Ahhh, okay. Sorry.
08,01so i can't get medication for it
If this doesn't break the sound barrier, I will be sad.
Sumica needs more boosters
08,01or at least, it's difficult for me to
sup everyone :)
Sumica is about to create a new star
Well...it will fly.
The Kerbal Painus Major
cowvarkian: Not saying you don't have it.
weylin|Blarg: yeah, I know
What is That?
Flying depends on your persepective Thunger
at least it's going to make an awesome looking explosion
For example, my brother was evaluated as ADHD originally. They later retested him and discovered it was actually a rather significant level of aspergers. >_>
well, that was fast
silly doctors
Rusty: It will...explode.
11,02DashWithRainbows: But...but...sleepies tiem is over :<
not a durable design clearly
FAIL
Begin the countdown to failure.
Like that, I'm sure pieces of them flew
Which is why he basically couldn't function in a classroom.
SuperBrony64: ohai
lol
11,02Hai cowvarkian :3
Hahaha, true Rusty.
explosion is fun
SuperBrony64: Its pony play tiem right?
counting down. 10... boom
ohai SuperBrony64 :3
11,02ACS13123: Yesh :D
/me hands SuperBrony64 a plate of cookies
I'm sure ADHD is a thing, but I also wonder how much technology has to do with it. Back in like, the 80's we didn't have iPhones out the plot...
PONIES
SuperBrony64: so, how's the Wii U, that I won't get for a few months because I have no money...
Use those launchpad-struts.
Yeaaaaaaaaaah
/me noms on the plate of cookies :3c
I'm going. See you all later for Movie Night!
Ship explodes prior to liftoff? MORE ROCKETS.
nice maelstrom design
11,02cowvarkian: AWESOME :O
SuperBrony64 Well, alrighty then, you win this round!
the spaceship galaxy
mother of god
a death spiral?
SuperBrony64: ._.
Stallion_of_War: It's a thing but it's not as common as it was claimed to be. It's very likely that most of the 80s/90s cases were actually misunderstood cases of autism.
Rusty more rockets=less fail
I love you Sumic-er-whoever
500 bits says it blows up
This is brilliant
11,02i liek wii u~
God help the kerbals who get on this thing
...no. must FOCUS. Homework is precident over Internet.
SuperBrony64: I want one
no it isnt
Rusty: Sumica.
(which is in fact far worse. >_>)
How many Kerbals have been killed so far?
Is SB streaming?
I think...15.
NO WAI SB.
Oh, and the ritalin.
it looks pretty ;):<3
yes it looks cool. until it explodes
Looking cool will not ensure structural integrity.
Oh gods, the ritalin.
whats with this UStream?
SB, have you ever played Kirby's Epic Yarn?
UGH. Ritalin
hey hows everyone doing?
ah, cocai- I mean ritalin
Okay, how do you do that thing with the name and the pingy noise?
something telles me this thing is gonna blow up before it gets into the air
moar fins
Do I just put someones name in the box?
CriticKitten: ">&gt;)" ?
Ritalin is pretty much the worst drug.
Rusty: Just type the person's name.
What's the audio version of Photogenic?
Audiogenic?
A ladder?
And you're the only one who will hear your own ping Rusty
its just screams "fatal crash"
11,02cowvarkian: It'll be there in stock when you can get one. They're not that hard to come by :)
Audiogenic?
Just got back and... Sumica, what the f:(k are you doing?
who needs a recovery system anyway
hello SuperBrony64
"Recovery System."
I assumed so LadyCanary, otherwise there'd be a flood of pings
Yup.
Does Fluttershy say "yay" everytime somebody mentions Sumica?
There's no way this rocket will fail.
Yup.
11,02LadyCanary: Yesh :D I played it on stream a number of times.
Tower.
That's the concern.
SuperBrony64: I know... I just have no money, and my family thinks I'll sell it or something the moment I lay my hands on it
Apparently not
well it hasn't exploded yet
i don't even know what to say
Holy mother of...
where jaymoo?
It's not a spaceplane, it's a tower.
yay!!!:$
wat?
cowvarkian: You joke, but really, that's what it is.
/me That's a very audio(photo)genic voice you have there streamer...
11,02cowvarkian: That sucks :(
You mean on your weird popout thing Super.
WOAH, we getting some AIR this time.
i need to talk to him now
Rusty: Type part of a person's name in and it should autocomplete. That'll help you more. :)
oooo
Asleep, aniderp|bestcakeever.
cant believe it flew
didnt know there was a swirl
grat...
Oh yeah, SB ;^; Whenever someone plays it, it reminds me of the fact that I'VE NEVER PLAYED IT. And I must have it.
Does it lag or is it just me?
CriticKitten: I know that's what it is
have the hackers been an issue after the cmc episode? haven't been here after that.
And OMG IT'S FLYING. By the beard of Odin.
EEVERSTI: I'll PM you about it. :)
Welcome to the speed of sound Kerbals! Barf bags are to your right.
Ritalin was basically created to give kids the same "downer" attitude as cocaine. Except all the time. >_>
... So many people, two hours left..
wtf? how this thing can fly?
WHAT. THE. FUCK.
Well, it's flying
11,02LadyCanary: Do you have a Wii? O3O
No I do not....
Naturally it was a fucking stupid idea.
should have just aimed straight at the moon or whatevs
This is f:(king fantastic
aniderp|bestcakeever When he wakes up and gets onto Skype, I'll tell him that you wish to speak to him, okay?
bo0oring magic *snortsnort*
I used Strattera last year...that didn't end so well...
Or not
CriticKitten: no shit
/me glomps the LadyCanary birdeh
Annnd that's how they fail
"oops"
/me sits on SB's head.
/me facepalms.
lol
Not what you want to hear from the pilot of a spacecraft.
how are you still going up with the parachutes deployed
11,02It's $15 used at GameStop I believe
hey
AJIsAwesome: okay :)
cowvarkian: Our 80s/90s doctors were kind of fucking idiots. :D
SuperBrony64: yeah
because insane thrust
O_O
CriticKitten: just then?
CriticKitten: Of course
/me pets the LadyCanary birdy on his mane ^-^
Especially then.
SPAAAAACCCEEEEEE
Flap yer arms! Flap like ya mean it!
Spaaaace
15 dollars for what?
Inb4 Sonic Kerblboom
Clearly this was the best possible option.
Poor little thing.
Doctors are fine... it's the psychiatrists
Hey, Im a bird already. I do enough flapping >_>
Back
is he going up??
This guy is deadly calm.
yup
Could've been the best typo there Canary.
>_
Because seriously, giving your kids a drug to induce cocaine-like side effects....why would you even.
/me You have a condition, Let me perscribe a **** ton of medication
ekips, indeed
Aint nowhere to go but up. And hush Meanwhile :||
11,02LadyCanary: Oh mai o.o
Rock. Had all the inertia of the rock
Stallion_of_War: that's basicly it
i need help
Wait
Uhh
Ah, Japanese music. Perfect for space flight.
He has a parachute
Right?
he tried so hard..and came so far
We knew ye well, fair Kerbal.
he is so cute<3
Next rocket!
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: What's wrong?
ohai Invi btw
Am I right, Sumica?
Speaking of, where is the rocket?
im crying...
hai ekips ^^
I didn't see what happened. Wheres the ship?
^
I wonder if all these conditions would go away if we would like, excersize and quit eating a bunch of chemically-"enhanced" crap.
Copperhead crushed space control on the surface
Starlight_Phoenix: it blew up
/me hugs aniderp|bestcakeever "I'm sorry :("
Stallion_of_War: it's even worse now, with drug commercials on TV and "WebMD", i.e. the stupidest thing ever put on the web
What's that fellaws name? Jebediah or bob?
usteam
usteam carrots
I'm callin him Jeb
from personal experience, if a doctor tells you to go with a stimulant medication, NEVER go with a non-stimulant
usteam vegetables
EVER
How many Kerbals have been sacrificed in the name of science since I've gone to the store?
usteam rice
His name's Abraham.
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
nooo
My dad has to constantly explain to his patients why reading a three paragraph blurb about a condition they THINK they have isn't the same as being a fucking nurse or doctor.
Land on your head.
People didn't seem to get all of these conditions back when you had to eat fresh fruits and vegetables instead of all the processed crap we have today.
awww
splat
did he just
vaporize?
ded
*splat*
Oh. He just disappeared.
He just kinda... poofed.
the explosions could look cooler
no blood smear or a cartoony hole?
what's this game called?
not a necessary feature but just saying
Isn't it Kerbal Space something
Kerbal Space Program
King: Kerbal Space Program
Buytoast, nah. he was that fast that he channeld throufgh the whole earth ^^
King: Kerbal Space Program.
thanks
with his speed he should have burned in the atmosphere anyway
This rocket needs more explosions!
More solid rocket boosters.
More rockets? More rockets.
Is Sumica streaming"
*?
ah, then he is one with us all then
Though, perhaps the most hilariously dangerous drug on the market?
this rocket needs more rockets
more rockets...
good lil corn piece
Stallion_of_War: Yes.
give her a spoiler
Yes, Sumica is streaming
fuck no
rockets exploding? needs more rockets
needs moar buttar
Those testosterone supplements.
It needs more rockets, obviously.
Needs more SPAAAAAAACE
and SCIENCE
needs more GAMNGAM STYLE
/me That's a very Audiogenic voice you have there Sumica
No.
Buytoast, no. he is on the othher side of the earth and continued flying in space again
and SPACE SCIENCE
the most dangorous drug: PONIES
we need korean men shouting at women's asses
well then let him conquer the stars
dangerous*
/me You should read audiobooks or something
Don't forget to set the staging right otherwise they will fire into the other boosts.
what's the goal of this game anyway? just get to another planet?
u dont read audiobooks
And that would be horrible.
MORE ROCKETS!
This can only end well.
goal
ekips: There are none, yet.
it.s gonna go BOOOOOOOM!!!
The goal, ekips, is to explode.
http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/audiogenic
it's a space flight sim
They will maybe implement a career mode.
Call this spacecraft "Luna or Bust".
wtfboooooooooom
Stopwatch: Sim? Hahahahaha.
yes I know, I broke da rules
Rusty well, we have reached that goal a few times already haven't we
I say hilariously dangerous because after applying testosterone supplements, you basically have to wash EVERYTHING you touched from the moment you opened the bottle to the moment you closed it.
sim lite
noponyknows: Read them and record the reading so the recording could be used as an audiobook, I mean
Let me guess...
I think i see where this is going
I like where this is going
...this can only end in disaster
It needs much more fire, though.
Otherwise your wife, kids, and/or pets may accidentally be taking the supplements too. XD
my internet browser just closed itself
it's haunted
hainted
painted
oh
the word is hainted
I give this... thing... 2 seconds after the engines started
no it isnt
Holy shit.
hainted isn't even a word
LOL just saw it for the first time
it is in the south
soooooo.....listen to any good music lately
Sumica, wat r u doing
this this will blow up on the launchpad. Just watch
This is not science, this is the culmination of science!
Sumica
STAHP
Stopwatch: nobody talks like that
i listed to EMA's record
cried
cool
Call it "Luna or Bust"
Stallion_of_War: does it really matter?
I give it 5 seconds
im listening to something broke
God bless you.
XD
LAUNCH
cowvarkian: Not really, I was just curious as to how royal cecession works
dear lord were all gonna die
that thing is unstable already
BOOM
lol
LOLOLOLOL
there we go
It's not like Willliam'
moooaaar eneeeergy... oh that was too much
Holy s:(t
He survived!
and if there's one thing I know about ADD/ADHD, is that it makes us wonderful procrastinators /sarcasm
HAHAHAHA
And the astronaut survived!@
lol he is fine
simply beautiful good sir
BOOOOM!!!!
Lol, combust
What a brave fellow.
It's not like William will be king until he's like 70 anyhow, so...
he will be a media titan for that
the book deals
what, is that thing made of fuckin vibranium or something?
And since there is a lack of Lunar pony...
Wait, DID HE JUST LIVE?!!
Rollin'
quick, the parachute sumica!
Yes. Yes he did
To space!
Casual
Roll! Roll to space!
look at him! he's so happy!
lol XD
Do a barrel roll!
the only known survivor of the ksp
Breakdance!
Or defy physics.
A shuttle dancing to techno shit. (pause) Am I high?
Whichever.
He is actually breakdancing.
Kerbal is doing a shuttle breakdance
Sumica: Fin thing is, he's having fun
I believe in you!
Stallion_of_War: ah, ok
fun*
can you explore the kerbal planet?
OH ZOMBIE!
Zoooombieeee!
<3
Stopwatch: Sure.
Yay.
Stopwatch: There is a easteregg or two.
an*
What didn't go wrong?
how old is this music?^^
"What went wrong?" *ad plays* DAMN IT!!
I think that you need more rockets
Copperhead: They didnt die
yay, Cranberries! :D
ekips: 1990s
Not enough solid fuel boosters?
lol XD!!!!<3
Install adblock. don't have any ads.
:P
This music Mica. <3
cowvarkian: The Royal family is part werewolf, and thus lives a long time, didn't Doctor Who teach you that?
What went wrong was not enough explosions!
Never enough SRB's
Stallion_of_War: yeah...
Sure more solid fuel boosters won't help?
ye
lol XD!!!!!:P<3:D
i calmed down..
<--- Oh oh
LIFT OFF
rocket explodes immedialty on the pad.... needs more rockets
lift off
20 bits it explodes
Uh...
:O
Oh, it's actually going this time.
Woah
This won't backfire in any way.
How does that thing fly.
I think, possibly, you disconnected the upper half already...
Thats pretty cool
6_9
Not wobbling.
I think Queen Victoria got scratched by a space werewolf or somehting
ThunderRush: dwarven magic
And wow that's a lot of smoke.
mooore energyyyy
It's over 1000!!!!!!!!!
Flight pattern is straight.
nuts
I'm going to pretend this is actually possible
cowvarkian: Kerbals and Solid Fuel Boosters are like orks and Dakka
Acceleration is good.
It's a true triumph of thrust over aerodynamics
anddd splode
Sumica: I bet you found this song through a dance move video. :P
aaaaaaand BOOM
Dat sound
Oh wow
hey whats with the cutoff smoke cloud?
How id that taking the wight
weight
Nope, no boom.
blow!
That is the secondary noise of science ACS!
i bet this is woderful ecologicly :D
Betcha we can make it to orbit this time.
ecology for wimps
SuperBrony64: i calmed down
Rusty: No, that's the sound of portals my friend
these things never have enough fuel have they
cfcs baby
Invi: well, since they all live underground, they give no fucks about the environment
Third stage?
that kerbal doesn't look like he has the education for this
<--- Dat Stage
lol
XD
KABOOM

Hey, it DID backfire! And Fluttershy said, "Yay".
Sumica :(
Sumica: You might was parachutes pls

Cats do not approve of space
At times?
Apparently, your cat does not like successful space flight
inb4 the chutes don't work
Hahahaha. How cats are. What race?
/me is always evil.
You should do that again, but without cat
Wait... why does the game have a "Blow the spaceship apart" button?
it does not fit into cats plan for the kerbals to reach space at this time
HES STILL HAPPY
HOW THE HELL
CriticKitten: you are a math teacher, right
If this lives
Fluffy well, how can a non-existent thing work anyway? :P
Ill be like

Giant paraboobs!

Rusty: But the 3rd stage made all the rockets explode apart
???
*debris
nyan cat?
Hey! This is a family stream! -insert concerned parent here-
Yes, Stallion, because that is what progress is. Explosions and screaming.
It are explosions and screaming for science.
Rusty: as it always has been, and always will be
^
Retry that rocket again, let's see what we can do without your cat f:(king up the flight.
disengage the paraboobs
And then the engine crashes into the surviving kerbal
Hiya
RainbowAsh: hey
Hi cowvarkian
Oh
He lives
Yey
I'm sorry, but I actually wanna see Sumica make a SUCCESSFUL flight.

Physics has just been thrown out the window
Science Nightlock, science.
The hell IS this game, anyway?
third times the charm?
Real Astronauts land in the ocean and wait for the coast guard Sumica
Ooooone more time
Yay.
Stallion_of_War: Unless they are russian. Then they land in siberia
I'm calling this one "Sumica's Death Machine of Science"
inb4 it explodes again
Initializing Wobble
Boats before space ships.... seems legit...
Well, there are people who build a boat with nova punch remix parts.
Space travel seemed more practical than boats.
One week 'til "The Hobbit".
I see wabble
wobble*
wait... buck...
Fl00t4sh41: same thing
wobble wobble
Space ships before boats...
SPACE BOATS.
Actually, it's more springing the wobble
no wobble no !:[!
wobble, stahp
cowvarkian: Difference is the russians have to bring guns incase of wolves
Is that a good sound?
Fl00t4sh41: yeah, true
Space ships before boats... Is that like the race in Hitchhikers that invented Deoderant before the wheel Sumica?
Sumi, can you make a flying boat that is able to fly to space? ^^
it seems that orgin has been hacked and hackers are selling orgin account details to other people :/
And the good Lord said, let there be wobble.
And it was bad
Heyo
origim*
EEVERSTI: that's not surprising
Screw the rest of their planet, there are things in the sky!
EEVERSTI: Whats origim?

Hey chat.

Nittany_Tiger: Tiger..?
THIRD STAGE ENTERED SUCCESSFULLY!!
Origin?
origin, the EA game distribution thing
Hey Nittany_Tiger
kerbal space program

That or Kerbels are all vampires and can't cross running water Sumica
Heyo
Hey Nittany_Tiger

I feel cheated
Im here
/me explodes

Oh my god....

Sumica: ITS WORKING!?
/me licks Nittany_Discord
origin sucks big time
waiting for my friend USSR
Hi, Nittany_Discord. :)

They can't cross running water Stallion, I don't know if oceans apply to that
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
ah, that guy's fun
No no
Spiral Explosions are working!
Oh
Well
Ussr
no, USSR
ahh okay
He's fucked
Damn! No boom!
cause CCCP is a twat
Pretty star thingie
But vampires in space.
D:
two completely different people
SO CLOSE
Yes
who is playin this
hey, cccp isn't that badd
cowvarkian: Could you type that with a Simon Lane of Yogscast accent?
*bad
You almost escaped the gravity!
Filly_Lightstar: Sumica
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
no
That's a massive parabola
he is awful
D:
Why
And you almost had it!!
Sh, this room is supposed to be asleep.
It's not wakeup time yet.
Sumica: DO U GET TO SXPLODE
Oh hi meanwhile.
EXPOLS
Sumica, say rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Stallion_of_War: I don't want to put the effort to
Yay.
hello everypony
Sumica: Look how scared you made him. You should be ashamed :[
EXPLODE Y CANT I SPELL RIGHT
Yay.
Filly_Lightstar, do you meas sexplode?
well cause CCCP is an attention whore
You just need the engines that are a serious of small NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS
hello yifle1
Bronysith: and you aren't?
i liked sexplode better
not as much as him
Sumica can you show the parabola again?
Yay.
yeah, keep telling yourself that
Better yet, engines made from the dying husks of stars as they supernova!
cause he is all "OMG I AM SO DEPRESSED BUT I WONT TELL PEOPLE WHY""
Actually, all you have to do is stick another liquid fuel rocket on top of what you already have. Then you can at least kinda get into orbit
Maybe
Dark side of the Earth.
ty
Sumica: wat is this game
>.> whatever you say george
Kerbal space program, Filly
Flipping ads.
Copperhead, nah. just needs a second third stage :D
Why does New Orleans have a lot of vampire lore?
...That could totally work
...why are people talking here
Stallion_of_War: because it can
deal with it
Screw- wait whaT?
Copy the third stage and pit it underneath the current first stage
lol
New Orleans is famous for it's jazz vampires Stallion.
random spam
Stallion_of_War: Because it's New-fucking-Orleans.
/me You're as cold as absolute Zero...
It's Friday, people talk in here on Friday.
I do, but since bronysith is bronysith, he must dispute
Rusty: I misread that as "jizz vampires"
AD!
Hey look, it's Slim Kerbal
thoser are known as kardashians
Casual
New Orleans: The City built below sea level, and where everyone gets mad when it floods...
This sounds like Eiffel 65 playing
:]
dat face :D
Stallion_of_War: who would think
That Kerbal is smiling.
CCCP has a very messed up view on life
Not to mention the French Quarter is just a good place to base stories
Anyone else see a damn ad?
of any kind
thats my generalization
Oh dear :D
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Ouch.
Bye bye!
he does not, however, mean any harm
I'm not leaving BTW
ded?
KTKomedy2813: Nope, Adblock plus
Water borne kerbals!
YAY
yay.
did he droen in space?
Saying bye bye to the Kerbal.
oh yeah, CCCP's the bipolar one...
Wait, did I miss anything?
I think I just missed a giant conversation
And then he was crushed by his spacecraft
Gotta stop running 4 tabs
Day X: The Kerbals have learned how to swim. Planetary take-over is inevitable
Collected Community Codec Pack?
gotta get an actual client so you can scroll up to view it
and then he realized that his people haven't invented botes, and he's screwed...
Another day in the life of kerbal.
They in the middle of space now.
ohai EspyLacopa
FFS BOTES????
Yay, more J-techno!!
Nah I can read it. Just trying to be playful.
WHAT THE HECK BRAIN?
They're the future of sea-faring travel, Stallion!
well you failed horrificly
You are now prohpet.
I'd like to see some YouTube parodies, please. If I'm not being too rude.
KTKomedy2813: thats nice
KTKomedy2813: Well, what is streamed is streamed.
Sumi, now it needs moar thrust for the 1st stage because it giot a lot heavier
I'm sensing wobble in our future
horrifically*
yes
well this is boring
And if you want to see that, then go to YouTube.
norly
Anyway, I know acting deppressed and not telling why seems like a way to hog attention.....CCCP may have been left alone if the depressed attitude was not in text form.
Describe your sex life with a video game title
Oh, my, indeed, George Takai.
no peasant masses to make fun of
BRILLIANT!!!
MORE POWER
TBD
YAAAAAAAAAAAA
MOAR SRB'S
Oh my god
I love this plan! I'm excited to watch it explode!
uh...
I can't, because I am a virgin
and so has the wobble
NOW LETS GO TO THE MOON
so
oh my god
alone in the dark?
the engines
I cant even
what
hah, that would work
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mel1xuJr761ql5omco1_500.jpg
100 bits it explodes befoe takeoff
wont the top burners make the bottom ones catch on fire?
XD
What a rocket!
Still not enough engines...
how about...
This had better produce a wonderful explosion.
how many dinosaurs must have been died to fuel that thing for just 10 seconds....
WET?
anything interesting?
...
hah
THAT MADE ME MOIST :p
hay Panda ^^
Is Bronystate possesing any 4chan defence now?
Shh, shh, do you hear that? It's the sound of progress!
It'll have to do.
Ha :D
Sumica stream?
XD
Sumica: HAAAAYYYYY SSSEEEXXXYYYYYY RRRRAAAWWWKKKKEEEEETTTTTT
I wanna see someone describe their sex life then, as Leisure Suit Larry.
Panda, yes
Ah.
OH NO
XD
THIS IS GONNA GO PERRRRFECT
...How many SRB's is that?
my sex life = TBD
LETS GO
CrystalPhoenix: O.O
MatmAQgd, are you implying 4chan has hacked Bronystate before?
Duh, that's the point
: D
I think it's gonna kill you... in some way.
To be determined?
Eeyup.
D: RAWKET GO ASPLODE-Y
yeah
ahh
huzzah
would Ratchet and clank work?
haha... I hope not
Something like 2 weeks ago on live stream, it was quite annoying
This is gonna be the best space flight ever.
explosion time!
There should not be a part limit, Sumica.
Correction. This will be the best bomb ever
And now, let's think about how rdiculous this would be if he used symmetry
are we going to the moon with this rocket or what
MatmAQgd: Was it ponies?
Prepare to be screwed, all on board. (FLUTTERSHY) Yay.
The workers are staring in absolute terror.
what else could work?
?
sweet mary mother of god look at the rockets
Hm.
MatmAQgd: I'll PM you about it.
MatmAQgd: more like going to the dead
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Yesterday is Today
Should someone tell the streamer that thousands of rockets strapped togather/ontop of eachother with no body might not work?
Sumica, are you trying to fly to your home plannet with that.
This music sounds like a mix between something you'd hear in Precure and Nichijou.
Yup, on new episode stream
MatmAQgd, let me sit calmly in my chair and laugh at your gullibility
I see nothing wrong with this. Full steam ahead, lead kerbal engineer Sumica
Yay.
This is going to be a nuke. Yes...
The NASA Death 1
who said he wants it to work
mishia: why tell him when we can enjoy an explosion
Yay.
O_O
Lunac: lol
that too Bronysith
Weel 2 given challenger
This shall be glorious. Shall it not, Sumica?
LEt's move it!
IF IT RUNS INTO A UFO BOOM
Yay. BOOM! Called it!
^_^ Postal error in my favor - I ordered a MLP card binder w/ 6 piece Discord exclusive, the first arrived opened - PS got me a new one - no charge to me :)
Operation Space Grave
Kandarihu: Which series? Futari wa?
300 bits it blows up.
lol
comp said no
eeyyuupp
Operation: You're All Fucked.
Because you want to slowly torture them when they become stranded in space with nothing to keep them alive
yeah
No wait, that's what I do to sim's in normal houses. Nevermind.
Rainbowish: That's a suckerbet
Cypresswolf: Nice! :O
that's always fun
that kerbil
LETS GO
This cannot possibly go wrong.
One insane kerbal to lauch it.
You're starting out 86 meters above the ground...
how about....
Already 86 meters above earth :D
thats fun too
I hear explosions
XD
Heya again! :)
Wat?
...
Oh. Ohhh.
no
JESUS
FAIL
YYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Well, that backfired.
He lives
Well
The sound of death without the sight.
not earthbound series
LOL!
Ahhh, I missed the earth shattering kaboom
Well.
lol....
XD
I bet he thinks he is on the moon.
Wait, hes alive!
FIREWORKS!
:D
2
I only have ONE sims game I'll play and not torture my sims to death; Sim's 2 on gamecube.
Oh wow he's alive.
Ha!
he lived!
How is he still alive?
DAT KERPLING
Magic!
Open the parachute
HE LIVED!
/me snort
Jesus. That capsule must be tough
I DEMAND DEATH
Oooh that will be a magnificent explosion
Kandarihu: Futari wa is fantastic. Max Heart is even better, but it focuses a bit too much on Cure Black.
RainbowAsh: He's just that good
HIS A GOD
huzzah!!!!!XD LOL
;_; It plays amazingly well, and I don't get so pissed off with my sims.
Restart, I wasn't looking!
/me comes back.*explosions*
Well. Lets try and find what went wrong.
hmm
seams legit
Sumica: U HAVE CREATED A GOD
YES
The only fun I ever had with sims was building the houses.
that was a fantastic explosion
Everythingm Barbetos, absolutely everything.
Well...the Kerbal Aero-Space Execution Initiative is VERY displeased
/me pokes MLP_Brovakiin :3
I imagine Sumica making Mr. Burns' "Excellent" face
Jebedaiah killed it
Sumica: Try using Explodium as the fuel source and not the mane building material?
So many rockets. . .
Woah! That was an awesomely exploding rocket! We could even see one of the modules flying almost into the camera! I have rarely seen such a splendid explosion in this game.
also, simcity is only true sim
Yay. Yay>
fuck
Meanwhile: I know a chick that thinks that tii
Oh god, when I enable unlimited money, I always make the houses to damn big
simulation games
More struts]
/me huggles thelonepony :3
*too
fuck em
And duct tape
I take it that Fluttershy sounds off when somepony says Sumica.
How about Rollercoaster Tycoon?
ALL THE DUCT TAPE
/me noms on MLP_Brovakiin :3
<3
This isn't going to end well
duct tape is cool
fuck that
Sumica: USE MORE DUCT TAPE
The hell many times is Fluttershy gonna say "Yay" today?
:D
D:
Like now?
MadSurge: It's the best thing to do in Sims.
Yay.
mishia: never played it
gonna play some Gta now :3
but simcity is best sim
Thats ok
DUCTTAPE PERK ATTACHED
Have fun :3
Ohai
DO IT
But bronysith, don't hate till you try it.
Meanwhile: simulation games ain't ny thing :|
Fluttershy will say 'yay' as many times as she damn well pleases, good sir
Saying Sumica's name makes it go Yay?
LIFT OFF
KTKomedy2813: Su****'s ping is Fluttershy's "Yay" voice clip.
mostly because it assures me how much I would suck as being a city planner
they suck mishia
TODAY IS A GOOD DAY FOR SCIENCE
Get a better space program
so guys, for some reason my xbox live account is being blocked >.>
Did you play it or not
And make me a cheese burger rocket
TOO
THE MOON
I hear explosions
LOL
DAM
science woona is that you?
Fellas, everytime Fluttershy says, "Yay," pull out a frickin' malt liqour and waste your asses to all hell.
THEY MADE IT
CONTACT
You broke the ground!
yes
He's... still alive.
it sucks
Samica.
Rollercoaster Tycoon, All my parks have the same kind of layout in those games. One long stretch full of shops, one stretch full of rides, and then the rest of the park is taken up by a rollercoaster that takes like half an hour to ride.
AND THE KERBAL SURVIVES
He lives
Sumica the real question is..... will it blend?
The Kerbal Aero-Space Execution Initiative is STILL displeased
WE HAVE CONTACT
mishia: never try to argue with bronysith, he'll win whether he actually is right or not
they
survived
WTF
That pod is tough as hell
Sumica.
TAT DAM KERPLE
huzzah!!!!!!!<3 XD LOL :D
Has Sumica broken physics today in KSP?
look at its face
What the f:(k is that pod MADE from, Sumica?!!
THEN DED
WE HAVE CONTACT WITH THE DIRT, HOUSTON!
Chrysalis: Adamantium hull
I just don't know what went wrong
Nah. I declare Meanwhile wins because he had a solid argument
Sumica
mishia: yeah
does he have plot armour?
It's made of unobtainium
lol!!!!!!!!!!!\
.. wat?
meanwhile wins all the moustaches
Breakdance for our amusement!
Plot armor?
Sumica... is a monkey.
Chrysalis: Nope, he's just got skillz
I don't know what you're talking about because I have sith on ignore, but ok.
Chrysalis: You.... You feeling kay?
Can we please take it easy with pinging Su****? Some people are getting annoyed. :)
Meanwhile: if only there were rollercoasters that long :D
armor against the plot?!
Copperhead: Do you mean difficulttoobtanium?
OMG
why didn't I think of that...
:O Even better! I got my Applejack card ^_^ Might as well call it a day, can't get any better (I'll still stay for movie night :P)
I heard a yay. Did you, Sumico.
Sumica: its the rockets in the rockets
I admit, however, I never play the efficant way
I do prefer the Sumi ping
Damn
I just make a badass looking park
lol
Sumi?
The rocket needs more explosions!
.....
maybe because bronysith is actually entertaining to me
DAMN IT, TAKEI!!
Sumi!
Rocket through the roof? OH MAAAII
I love this.
Space ship explodes because to much rockets? ADD MORE ROCKETS!
:D
or break the coasters while people are riding them....
Sumi. Sumica. Pumpkin. Okay.
ohh may
Dear lord
Or play zoo tyccon to feed people to tigers
JUST STAHP
or make the coaster go into a lake
<_<
TO PPAAACCCEEEEEE
You going to ruin it again.
Takei says "oh my" everytime someone says Sumi?
AWAAAYAYYYYYYYYYY
Make a coaster that ends over a lake.
Barbetos|AtWork: But...SCIENCE
that 113 is false
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Niiiice.
BOOM! YEAH, MOTHAFUCKIN CALLED IT!
Why does the ping flip between Fluttershy and Takei?
DAM IT
Pumpkin.
or launch into the sun
Meanwhile: I can picture you doing that :D
holy
Why did mit blow ECAUSE SCIENCE
He;s alive?
fuc
HE IS HAPPY
splode
Hmm...haven't tried that yet. Can't now, I only had thouse at meh dad's house
mishia: feeding people to tigers sounds like the only thing to do in that game
DAMN ADS
Congratulations, Sumica. You just fucked up... how many times now?
he like "fuk ya im godmodein"
3 times so far
yay :D
The Kerbal Aero-Space Execution Initiative is thinking about pulling it's money from this project
that, our make a wonderful looking park
BOOM!!!!!!LOL :D
Ah. Here is your problem. You put the "Explode everything" button on the pilot seat
KTKomedy2813: He's not fucking up, he's making SCIENCE!
Sumica: I think you should purposely try to destroy the pod
then fill it with some alligators
and let tigers run free on it
It just explodes when he sits
The dino one is the best one for murdering people
What other noises can the pings make?
Someone for short play in BO2? steam id: matmak1
I wonder if we'll ever see the return of Shizubus.
SPUTNIK!
SPUTNIK
YES
SPUTNIK
the internet would be the best serial killer ever
yep!
GO GO SPUTNIK RANGERS
Hey, Sumi, a cow married a stoplight.
KTKomedy2813: it is set by the chat program in question. You can pretty much make it any sound if you use it right.
ohhh maaayyy
Barbetos|AtWork: Ah.
MOVEEEEEE TIEM
There would be marks of trollfaces where the dead innocents lay
Oh wait
too soon.
Don't think I ever played zoo tycoon.
I just want my work week to be over
Neither have I.
solarpanels + floodlight + iondrive?
I don't think Sputnik will last long, given the KSPs recent hsitory...
Meh.
What's the best movie of this year?
history
me neither, but sounds like fun
fun murdering people
Can you get sharks?
YAY
Not that good. I prefer the aquatic verison
the murdering kind of fun
Batteries?
:D
AA's are best batteries!
Where we are going we don't need em.
KTKomedy2813: History of the World, Part 2
thought they were AAAA
KTKomedy2813, whatever it is, Breaking Dawn should get a honorable mention for best troll
then feed the innocent to my hungry sharks
^
>_>
More like car battery
mishia: you are a horrible person
RainbowAsh: You mean Biggest Fuckin' Liar?
Isn't Rollercoaster Tycoon still available for sale somewhere?
yup
Probably.
GoG.com
I think it was $10 or £10.
DashWithRainbows: good ol games probably
Everyone should of died in the end of that series
www.GoG.com
It would of been so much better
Acutally, I'm quite nice. Just I hate computers. In left for dead, I make sure to murder all the cpu's.
Still CRAP.
But better crap.
KTKomedy2813, the fake-out climax wasn't in the book it's based on. All the fans got to see all them characters that were supposed to have plot armor slaughtered.
Lets name it Space Spud
DAH, FUCK!
cheaper then dirt
hey, should I buy thief?
than*
Theif?
oh well TO SPACE IT SHALL BE
Its probably ran by potato batteries I bet.
Oh
cowvarkian: If you want to.
yeah
That one's pretty good.
Why not by the third one?
... The fuck was THAT shit? Did anyone see a Spanish ad for coffee... or some shit?
A potato battery named Wheatley?
OWSLA
It has all of them
get it
Sup Guise
KTKomedy2813, install adblock
Yep, the Rollercoaster Tycoon is $10
This statement is false.
no wait... it doesnt
I mean, yah dishonered is a sneaky game, but it makes it too easy to murder all in your path
well, I will go my old self mode
So 'bout £6-7 I think.

brb
RaveBrony: that was before all those technical issues in March
what does registering it even do? make me eligible for a raffle?
not like someone else will take my name
MOAR ROKETS
Or else, you'll grow a PINGAS!

chipmunk voice
Bronystate 1.0, lol

OMG THIS SONG!
Buytoast: in addition to that, it allows for you to do more on IRC in general
as well as place a password on your nick
Anyone who reccomends pony will get CGI pony parody crap.
so we do get a raffle?
hot dog
I <3 this song
Its a lotto
wait, we get a raffle?
are you sure you're not useing one of my youtube playlists?
?
KTKomedy2813: I recommend a Sweetie Belle
Lotto
Sumica: rocket looks awesome
i already get that lotto email
A lotto I was, once again, unable to enter.
wait, you have to be registered in order to get the lotto email?
This Song!! <3 <3 <3
registering your name in IRC is not related to registering for bronystate
We still launching the OFC?
Absolutely amazing!
cowvarkian: you are prompted to
registering your name in IRC mainly means you can get your name back if someone else is using it
no really, what's the name of this game?
NullRadix: thats what I thought
Rapidfire, kerbal space program
Rapidfire: Kerbal Spa-- oh, never mind.
registering for bronystate gets you the newsletter, which lets you votes for movies
NullRadix: its for confirmation purposes though
Who is this streaming btw?
Did I just see the ability to put the rockets sideways?
sumica
11,02i liek poniez
that's the name? the real name?
right, if I'm not here any of you can masquerade as me
yes rapid
but if I log on I can kick you off my name
yes poniez
SuperBrony64: I like turtles
Registering your nick is like getting an ID card for IRC. Registering for the BState newsletter is like signing up for one of those schmoozy tabloid magazines to send junk to your house.
Copperhead: No, you saw the ability to turn Joan Rivers into a carrot voiced by David Letterman.
Ello everypony
SuperBrony64: Oh you :3
real game or download?
TS: Oh, hai, Mark.
11,02\:3/
It's a SuperBrony64! Moooooooo!~
play ponies
download
:D
Also you can choose whether or not to enforce your nick.
this song is gonnaget stuckin my head
free demo; $15 full version i believe
11,02Rapidfire: It's fake.
oh mah goddz
SB64
(almost typed "free demon")
Fluffy: QUICK! GET ME THE MASTER BALL!
....
I was god once...
we want poniez
/me noms on SuperBrony64 :3
That was a rhetorical question
teh silleh filleh iz here
If you enforce it, if someone tries to use it and doesn't know the pass, they get kicked off after thirty seconds.
which is also a registered name
/me tosses the master ball to OohShiny
/me is nommed D:
Sumica: rockets...it gets shit done
Like so
Catch him before he takes all the milk and cookies!
It says I am God now.
no fair; this game looks like fun.
But in a few seconds...
I was actually god a few times
/me gives SuperBrony64 some cookies :3
/me tosses the master ball at SuperBrony64
that it is
password protected
looks like it might work
11,02pony_3045: Daaaaaaaaw
play ponies!
/me waits
I think I was god before it was protected
test?
Fluffy: why would SB take ALL the milk and cookies...he's not that mean lol
it looks to heavy.
/me is captured while nomming cookies D:
Fluffy: What does the pokedex say about his eating cookies level?
play nekci menij or gangam style next
cowvarkian: so were you that jackass that came in with all those famous-people-nicks and caused debate?
NO PONIES I WANT TO WATCH ROCKETS D:
I see Sumica is still trying to construct a rocket.
because I might have done that
errr, sometime this summer
OohShiny: It's over 900---wait, it's only 6000
maybe
I am Rocket Man
i think
I WANT TO WATCH PONIES RIDE ROCKETS
so if i follow these doohickeys on this PonyChat IRC FAQ thing i could get my name protected and such?
I might have been one of them
well, he has an hour to kill.
This one actually looks pretty cool.
ponyrockets
Fluffy: damn it, he'll escaped the master ball!
it wasn't just me
Fluffy: Mine is 9999999999999999999.
yes
Registering your nick isn't hard.
READY TO LUNCH SIR!
Ponies in bronystate? eewww <_<
Liftoff!
Sumica: TO SPACE MAH FAITHFUL FRIEND
KTKomedy2813, that smells like hax
GYARADOS, I CHOOSE YOU!
OohShiny: its not possible!?
We have lift off!
we don't watch horses in here boy
PONIES
Straight flight, no wobble.

Odd, this nick isn't enforced.
Ponies
That is one very long 30 seconds, Reikim.
"Looks like Team Rocket is blasting off AGAINNNnnnn-"
fair enough
What about the horses of Saddle Arabia?
We will make it!
Okay, minimal wobble.
BladedWings: it's possible, because it's SB64
there are Horses in MLP.
when will Celestia create the Pony Space Program?
Accelertion is decent
Apparently it's not enforce.
I think this will work!
*enforced
dat SuperBrony64
Rapidfire: yes, the ones from saddle arabia
the pony space program was done and over after the moon landing
but really
I know it's pass-protected because it asked me for one.
OohShiny: hmmm....we need apricorns to make a SB Ball...only catches SB lol
Whelp.
yeah, see it still isnt enforced
what is the payload of this rocket?
ITS OVER 9000!!! feet in the air
lol
Uh oh, wobble!
shuperbrowniesatayfour pls

a frendship cannion i think
Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
Im going to try to get my Wii running, want to Brawl me SB?
Wobble is minimal
Wobbling
hi SuperBrony64
Whereas my preferred nick still kicks me out if I forget about this window for thirty seconds after it logs me in.
we never know who scootaloos parents
We can make it!
That went smoothly
you need to get some stablizers on dat sh*t
SB *kzzt* I *kzzt* can't *kzzt* understand your *kzzt* accent *kzzt* :P
Sumi its wobbles
higher than the first one.
it's over heting!
There is still too much wobble
SuperBrony64: alrighty ^_^
Short orbit
Not sure but I think it also applies to a couple of the derivations I've used over the last year.
hi SuperBrony64
it will hold
I think that some gods/planets/people are enforced...
how high does it have to be for orbit?
Copperhead - that wobble is just the vectoring rocket keeping it stable
Ponies! also let us know when we can request
the sun...
11,02Cypresswolf: p-o-n-i-e-e-e-e-z

do you have enough power to break orbit?
i don't think half the people in there know what /me does
Actually.

Mush yes
yep.
Michael: went to shit right away :I
you can also look at the timer above the strema
seriously, has nobody used an IRC before...
Whoo I can maths
See, this channel is hidden, so /whois doesn't work on it.
Oh. The timer... For bucks sake
This is my first online chat :L

Reikim: Sweet, good to know.

Evening: The one based on the book.
YES!! ADBLOCK WORKS!!!
ohai pony pepple
Reikim: because its +s ;p
Is that was the "s" does in the +tns? lol

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: Necklaces, Slap Bracelets, Paper, and More!
We are going TO THE MOON!
Not atm.
to rescue woona
what's the target?\
Hi mom!
9999999
Thanks for the offer though, might take you up on it a bit later.
I still can't believe that Pootis 2.0 is still going.
what does everyone elses timer say? i think mine is wrong
Johnb Madden
Never any Rarity merch, geeeez
59 mins.
59 mins
football
Let's keep going until we hit 999,999
Its mostly only RD :(
ok, mine is always 1 hour off
just think 1 hour.
Chrysalis: http://ponybot.net/pix/4861.png
fuckin RD...
Mine is 14 hours off. Dafuq?
True.
800,000
Prince_Lightstar Suhweeeeeet
that sat thing, does it have thrusters?
58 minutes
I dont really have a problem with RD, but she gets All the Merch
^
/me headbobs to music.
^^
but
/me kidnaps MrBen
its only 57 minutes
Lol Nightmare Moon is fighting Celestia in her ds
:$
I don't mind RD getting merch, it's that I would like the other Mane 5 to get some as well.
Of course it has thrusters. what self respecting sat thing wouldnt?
I'd make a 20% Cooler reference but that would be in bad taste.
:O
going to the sun?
Hah
....! *is kidnapped*
:[
RD is automatically flashy and the showoff, kinda makes sense...
Forgot it was Bront movie night tonight :D, Well Ill stay, hay all!
Sumica: ...You're kinda doomed bro
:S
True, and shes the most liked isnt she?
Chrysalis: http://ponybot.net/pix/3206.png
its movie morning for me :D
NullRadix: Plus she's famous in the fanbase as well.
but going by that logic rarity would be second
what exactly is the goal of this game which you are trying to reach?
Im staying till 999999
oh haha
It's Movie Afternoon for me. :P
lets try this again. hi guys! :)
:O
IshPonyPonyThePony the goal is what you want
hi
http://i.imgur.com/Zskmy.png
I'm liking these Chrysalis Pictures :>
MEDIC!

:P Umm, I'm new to this livestream stuff. xD
how are things FlutterMEDIC
FlutterMEDIC :O
pootis
hai RaritySuxPinkiePieRo and FlutterMEDIC
The goal is to reach ever higher distances from the home planet.
/me hugs FlutterMEDIC
Now then again, would I really buy the merch if it was there...
The movie night is at 4:00 PM for me.
what is this song?
alexxm: good, been playing Toy Soldiers
it's at 6 p.m. for me
What
The goal is to party!!!!!:O :O
I guess it depends on the item
Chrysalis: http://ponybot.net/pix/5247.jpg
It's ok FlutterMEDIC no one's said hello to me either :)
Hi fluttermedic *stab*
aww yeah
i see we are watching Kerbal Space Program
RaveBrony: wait, RD is most liked?
I buy pony merch, but it depends on the item in question.
hello socks
What is happening on my screen right now?
i love u
/me puts on sunglasses
oh yeah
time to tan
cowvarkian: Well, she's ONE of the most liked.
[18:04:17] <cowvarkian> RaveBrony: wait, RD is most liked?
It's over 1 million!
Chrysalis is best non-pony
Ha!
xD
RD's fanbase is rabid.
Sumica: Leeets dooo the tiiiime waaaaaaarp again
cowvarkian: I thot she was (or at least famous), even my non-brony friends have heard of her.
Sumica: People like goals in games because it makes them feel accomplished and it is like a pat on the back if you complete it. Example: Achievement system on Xbox live
Socks: no, when i tried to come on earlier, my internet connection said "FUCK YOU" and disconnected
Excuse me sir, your orbital track appears to be heading straight for earth.
besides, spike is best pone
FlutterMEDIC: Aww sad times :(
everyone knows that
Hai Socks! :)
Here it comes. . .
999,999!!!
999999!
1 million!
RD was one of the first ponies that became popular as the fanbase grew.
Poor jokes aside, RD really does have the loudest fanbase.
?
/me huggles MLP_Brovakiin
Dat k
lol
:S
My non-brony friends know "Rainbow Dash", "The Yellow One", and "The Pink One".....lol
/me huggles Socks tightly :)
Im not waiting till 999999K
Steam has Achievements as well
Unholycondolences it also leads to a set of people who can't make their own damn fun, sandbox lets you be creative
hai Socks :3
apparently I've never heard their fanbase
Right. I'm gonna go take a nap for a short while. Be back in roughly 50 minutes.
So imma go now
drifting?
Bai
So what is this game?
What's the music called?
Is it even a game?
kerbal space program
I could go deeper analyzing and theorizing about the /why/ behind her massive and slightly diseased fanbase, but I'll stick to fact for now.
oh no i mean am
i believe this is a success
Danger: Kerbal Space Program
hi Socks
yellow quiet... purple smart
It was the yellow one's fault!
THRUSTERSSSSSS
/me huggles Prince_Lightstar and Michael
someone saw Drawfriend stuff? I have to admit: even Sombra looks cute with a milkshake
cowvarkian: I thought it was purple magic.
Hello :D
i have to admit, the most fun is just watching the rockets explode

Socks: how ya doin'?
let me guess, this is...Shizu?
its more of a probe
ALL THE SPINNING, ALL THE CAPS! only on bronystate
I can understand that most of her fanbase is "loud", but I've met some people who aren't as loud and like RD.
ooh 'nother bitch
thelonepony: Pretty good, I overslept last night so I missed school and got sleep! Win Win! :D
*why most
what is this!?
UMMMMMMM,PROBES, YOU SAY?!?-
Always spinning, all the time
i was like an hour ago my friend
But come on, Im not a super obsessive brony, but i would still like some Rarity stuff.
How breif
I'm ready to party!!!! :O
Oh of course.
:(
is Shizuka streaming?
?
FlutterMEDIC sumica was

AJ, I recognize and respect the diversity of all fanbases.

RaveBrony: Same. Also Pinkie Pie and maybe some Applejack.
No. Stream
Its just picta
thelonepony: How iz u? :)

Sumica will be back for BMN anyway
that's hot
But from an objective standpoint, it is impossible to deny that RD's fanbase is by far the loudest.
All the characters should get the same merch :(

GAK Ponies.

And strangers
Hai everypony!
dude, the other night i clopped so hard
Smooze
FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN!
hey Kinixys
Strangers with Strange words. Oh and pony. Thats BRONYSTATE!
YAAAAAY!
I was playing Thousand Year door last night
So as if the new youtube layout wasn't bad enough, not only does it take forever for my videos to upload, it also takes them forever to start uploading
great game
Gotta love it when your girlfriends phone is broke and u cant text her
Nothing wrong with cloppers just don't make me watch either you clopping or the stuff you clop to.
You see, I only tolerated gak since I thot they were refering to The Smooze.
i'm gonna make popcorn now...
I like to be a tree
well u are watching it npow
now*
Good for you, PinkiePieYourFace.
COME TO THE DARK SIDE, WE HAVE COOKIES!
after i found out it was just a stupid commercial, i hated it, lol
i have no popcorn..... WHY??
I tolerated it because I knew it would die soon.
THE COOKIES ARE CURSED!
The meme, of course.
Still think they shouldn't join the chat and tell us about it...
FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN
Who runs Youtube?
hey wat is pink and disposable
AJIsAwesome and did it die?
did it die??

Google
i still cant believe it
Google runs utube
a little
Pinkie's face
Bronies made the most forced meme since "arrow to the knee"
^^^^
Ikr?
Why do they need to change the layout all the damn time and each change gets more and more convoluted
Does anyone have a Pegasister GirlFriend like me?
It annoys me
Bronysith: Nah, I still hate that one more.
BRB
To piss u off
RainbowDerpy: pink and disposable? your mother *gets shot*
the new layout itsnt too bad
Neither are forced.
Pinkies face
isnt*
Is it just me or does youtube look suspiciously like google video now ¬_¬
I absolutley love jurassic Park, books and movies
so yeah this is getting... kind of boring. what am i watching??
on that note
There's a difference between a forced meme and an overused/dead/undead one.
just as forced as normal memes
:D
Gak doesn't even faze me, the Arrow joke annoy me a little.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47agewU8mD0
http://cheezburger.com/6819292416
no memes are forced
You know how when your watching a video you used to be able to click and view a list of more videos from said person?
either way
they're just overused to execution
I cant find that anymore
Yes
Ermagerhd any guys with Pegasister gfs like me?
both come from the worst fanbases ever
NO
maybe
yes
idk
Magna913: that doesn't exist in my country

A "forced" meme is a line or phrase or image set up intentionally with the goal of becoming a meme. In the true viciously ironic spirit of the universe, forced memes never actually become memes, making the term a slight misnomer.

http://ponybot.net/pix/2159.png
also i though movie night was happening now
Who is it?
Chrono Trigger?
clopclopclopclop:[
<3
So many memories.
Remember The Babs Seed Stream when we got hacked?
chrono trigger
or is my clock out
Phase4: In 40 minutes it does.
CHRONO TRIGGER!
clopclopclopclop:O
chrono trigger!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!?!
hello
yeah, daylight savings has me all confused
CHRONO TRIGGER!
Not hacked hijacked
why is my audio on off
KILL LAVOS!
i'm scared..
Sod Chrono Trigger! Pause video, must avoid spoilers!
Babs Seed
oh man, people still talking about the "hack" in main
KILL LAVOS, FAST!
why
Babs seed is awesome
Buytoast: fuckin seriously
Because sheep are panicked easily?
Babs Seed best song of S3
hah.... that
Crono trigger is good, its sequel...not so much
Because when sheep get panicked, they stay panicked?
so far
Buytoast: Because people are curious for information?
babs seed is a scout
fuck it, brony state is going to the cloppers. im done
where are u hearing babs seed
anyone else have their audio cut in and out>
bye
I like Babs, she's cute and has an awesome mane
i love the name of the new ep
AJIsAwesome: I would rather go with the diminutive, pejorative, sheep metaphor
Because sheep are too stupid to realize when the man in the wolf's mask isn't actually a wolf?
oh yeah, condescending
but there's that thing on the front page and such
Chrono Cross is ok
cowvarkian: I wouldn't.
i mean c'mon
Its so full of bullshit
reading isn't too hard
BlackRose: it's a reference to Sleepless in Seattle
AJIsAwesome: well, potato, orange
i know
babs seed = smashing pumpkins
thats why i like it
:)
As if anyone reads the front page.
;)
WHERE ARE U GETTING BABS SEED FROM?
over there
Buytoast: True, but if people can't read the rules theire first time here, I don't expect them to read the front page.
i would but i'd have to use simpler words
noooooooooob
*their
-_-
My favorite character of Chrono Trigger was Glenn
he was so awesome
ep 4 of mlp
and mysterious
Lol
season 3
now he is in hell
I saw it
Also for a game with the word Chrono in it, it had no time travel whatsoever
Hello, everypony.
Buytoast: nice one
why are u discussing it
hi Nyra
hai Nyra
caus were aloud to
Oh Hai
Hai Nyra
were not spoiling
good point
SpadeKyurem
no he is in hell
spoiler: chronotrigger is a game
that was a good episode
What are we watching?
It's friday which means I'm gonna eat mcdonalds!
Aw damn, i tihnk i was able to participate in this weeks lotto
no
cool story bro
Besides, we still have people who STILL believe that 2012 is going to be the end of the world. I'm not surprised at all we still have people asking about the hijacked livestream.
...
stay
for
*A movie slot
satan
jurassic
park
SpadeKyurem[R]: Chrono Cross = Time crossing, because two timelines cross... that's why
So what video is this? Crono vs everyone? Crono Quest?
btw, i've got a brony meetup tomorrow
Time to watch ponies
No, I mean right now.
cowvarkian, wha? I thought it is porn
we meet again
that movie is awsome
i love mcdonalds<_<
ponies!
I cant believe we are watching my ALL TIME favourite film tonight, Jurassic Park! SOOOO AWESOME!
wut
People still believe the 2012 thing?? wut
i love Jurassic Park!
AJIsAwesome: wait, people believed that in the first place?
Also I just love how Cross just kills the main characters from the first game off
Nyra: T-rex roar FTW
i wll shut up
the only park i wouldnt wanna visit
Ponies
ya man don't go in the long grass, Raptors are in there
36 min. blagggggggggggghaaaaaa
I thot they found more to the calendar O.o
Yes. It is very sad.
TALL GRASS
I thought everyone was just joking about taht
Getting angry at people not knowing the difference between a "hack" and a "hijack" is futile, to me.
fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2012 has been bullshit for over a year now.
raptrs gonna kill
omnomnomnom
clopclopclop
satan we meet again
Reikim: it was bullshit the moment it was uttered
NO CLOP
CLOP IS BAD
but.... mmmmmooooommmmmm
http://ponybot.net/pix/786.jpg READ TIS
What video is this?
clop him to death
I've seen it so many times to the point where that I can recite every line, sound, roar, screech, sound effect, etc...! I love being a nerd for AWESOME Movies!
clopclopclopclcopclcpolcl
velociraptors..
SpadeKyurem[R]: it still has a background, Kid is Marle's ancestor send to the future (it's Schala), and was raised by Lucca
What game is this? It looks like FF3/6 but different
Ah ah ah You didnt say the magic word
Lyra spoke
The music sounds epic.
Lyra talked in Royal Wedding
00,10give it a rest
inb4 it actually fucking happens
That Frog remix
The plot for Cross is so god damn confusing
that would be hilarious
xD
yes yes she did
Didnt Wrek +m to explain that AJIsAwesome?
Glenn's theme is so awesome
he probably did
this game is donkey kong 64
Bon Bon has best voice
demon
d'aaawww
Then he got btiched at aaand those viewers are no longer here, lol
FUCK
but yea
So ultimately, it's practically pointless to lash out or get mad at people not knowing the differences. Besides, we also have people who didn't even attend the Babs Seed livestream, so it doesn't shock me that they ask about it.
d'aaaaww
Dat's a lot
of characters
d'aaawww
hopefully it doesnt happen
need more tiny people
WHERE IS MY MCDONALDS?!
What's with the snowman?
Meh
The one that gets me is the statement "The Mayan Calendar is ending, they predicted all these things, so obviously it's the end of the world".
ponies time!
d'awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!
awwwwwwwwww snowman died

Hello everyone. Nice to see that on my first time here, I get to see such a classic movie, heh.

THAT DOESN'T LOOK VERY SCARY! He then proceeds to get raped by a Brontosaurus
Thinned out their numbers a bit earlier so I'm actually allowed to have a stream today.

That must be one tasty Scootaloo
His boy-or-girl-detector!

ohh
Also Raptors had feathers, that would make this movie .... interesting
@fluttercry
Technically, the Velociraptor is actually really small. The ones in this movie are probably about the size of Utahraptors
let's get a team of scientists on it
What they're talking about, I believe, is a Deinonychus.

Dr Grant: Not a good parent

They discovered that velociraptors have feathers after this movie was released
and he just pooped himself

Mmmmm mm. Wendys always hits the spot.
That was awesome
thanks Dr for traumitizing that kid
Wait what?

raptor even means "bird of prey"! See, we even named it as a bird before he realized all the evidence for it!
Congratulations, man. You just scarred a child for life.
Yeah, kids.
Are you trying to give the kid nightmares?
That kid is going to have a fear of turkies for the rest of his life
