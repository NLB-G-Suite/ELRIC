On the one hand, sleep is good. And if I stay here any longer, I'm liable to start making pseudophilosophical commentary, and I don't think ANYONE wants that.
Yeah, that level
or from the reverse tunnel connection?
Wait

0,14Platinum Games is the developer behind Madworld, Bayonetta and Vanquish
0,14I dunno
0,14XD
Bayonetta is good. The world should have more games like Bayonetta.
mfw I just remember Lollipop Chainsaw came out. SONOFABITCH I needz it
*congratulations :D
I know TT_TT
I'm still crossing my fingers for a Bayonetta 2
But I spent my money at the convention.
not*
Bayonetta is good because it goes "let's do this Crazy Awesome thing" and when asked why goes "fuck why not" and then goes on to do it and still have a plot deeper than most mainstream games *coughCoDcough*
I think more companies need to start pulling a Blizzard and wait 10-12 years between sequels :P
I did ^_^

Swear kickers are now off.
04NS you're a bad influence.
lol
I've been told that several times
by you of all people

BRB
04Denying that you were a bad influence me is tantamount to idiocy.
08,01FairysHuff: see the nota bene
hurr
04Nope.
04I've been reading Brothers of Blood from the Dragonkeeper series.

in the play
BACK :)
No kidding.
04I figured
Basically in my part
I have to play 3 different "faces" of him
*Noms on Wonka Bottle Caps*
1. When he's alone doing his soliloquys
04I'm not sure how that works though.
I'm not an actor

Anyway
piano time
04aww
04bye
Also, my english teacher is awesome
/me hugs
/me hugs back
08,01fair enough, but it's a two person subjective transaction
04A
14see you
xD
08,01i hate that fact that physical contact is mostly seen as sexual in this society
I've had lengthy discussions with him about various Shakespeare play
04hurr
plays
:}D
but hey
I dont hug at all, its not common to hug friends over here, only girl/boyfriends.
08,01i can cuddle with my friends without it being sexual at all
04Shakespeare is only fun for me when we do tragedies.
Yes
Only hug when drunk.
04I'm doing goddamn Taming of the Shrew
04.u.
His trag-
haha
04I'm Petruchio
04I get to be the @$$hole :D
I should read that one
08,01hell, one time when i had sex it was completely non-sexual.
Apparently it's pretty good
14:D
How is that even possible?!
04twice
Saturn: how does that even work?
/me dies
08,01Informant_Pony: we were both very drunk

And you like... uhhhh, let's just... you know?... Uhh... or something? How does that work?!
08,01Alchemist: well, mostly is was just trying to be ironic
08,01*i
04No one else cares about acting their parts :'D
04I take it as a compliment
Well you made my brain implode.
favourite shakespeare villain
*Explodes*
14I remember I made people laugh when I was rubbing my hands and talking to the public xDD
lmfao
*Respawns*
STILL GOT IT! :p
I see him as slightly excited... sorta, and very very confident
I don't think he's necessarily evil
Saturn: You live in Scotland?
"He, when he hears of her / cannot refrain from the excess of laughter"
/me has nothing to add to the conversation xD
08,01FairysHuff: i do
14lol

"O beware, my lord, of jealousy; 'tis the green-eyed monster that doth mock the meat it feeds on"
Saturn: How would you feel about hanging out sometime? ^_^ In a friends only manner.
where he's like
Saturn: Awesome! ^_^
04that's
04what
08,01ah, okay
14yeah, he was such a b*****d in the italian translation
04Sometimes I get around it but I usually don't
14that's why I liked it
14<3
08,01he lives in Dundee
"To be, or not to be. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream."
08,01i tend to hang out with him a fair bit
Saturn: I don't know anyone in Dundee
14pfft, try reading the italian translation of that time
04I now know where "perchance to dream" comes from.
Saturn: Actually I only know one person in Scotland whos my friend and shes my EX ^_^ I'm pretty socially isolated.

/me glomps Saturn
Saturn is now regretting her words LOL ^_^
08,01but seriously, how about you come to st andrews? it's accessible by train (get off at Leuchars), but the bus is bitchingly expensive to get in from the station

http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/autism-and-asperger-syndrome-an-introduction/what-is-asperger-syndrome.aspx
08,01i've often thought that i might have mild aspergers. i certainly fit the profile, but i've never wanted it confirmed or diagnosed, as it doesn't really affect me in a negative way, and i don't want to be labelled
08,01plus, with me, it's probably just neuroses, and not actually aspergers
08,01though i have no idea
Hey Bromies :D
hey Saturn and others
Saturn: My diagnoses has helped me as I don't hate myself as much anymore for not being able to cope with thing other people cope with on a daily basis.
08,01to be perfectly honest, i'm more convinced it's the neuroses is growing up with a twin brother

*Tiphoofs away from Alicorn_Prince_Shane*
Saturn: I get overwhelmed easily and have to remove myself ^_^
08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: about to be pinked
Saturn: LEGASP
Saturn: u have to stream after u dye it please
I was pinked last night! :d
Ponies keept saying I was a ware Pinkie :<
08,01i mean, one of the symptoms of aspergers is an inability to understand jokes
Saturn: you alwas make me laugh
*always
Saturn: Wow... that must have been interesting.
08,01ha! yes, it certainly was
I don't have any head things that I know of. I'm just a tad crazy
13tired, as always you?
Saturn: I tend to have a more intelligent or silly sense of humour more Gintama or BillBaily.
08,01oh, also
08,01Simon Amstell's stand-up is absolutely hilarious
