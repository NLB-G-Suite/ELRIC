inb4 Metroid moive....and it's Other M's storyline.
SaxyPretender: *rim shot*
0,14:3
RAWRity: Another case where I would have to kill a lot of people!
Reikim: I can see the rage toward that starting and not stopping for a loooooooooooong time
err...I mean, the main character is dead in the end.
punch out
5:l
guys guuuys the reactor core is god damn offline what to do? :O
And some side character gets all the glory
and gets the girl
Why does Shizu enjoy punching things so much?
Reikim: Because they make funny noies.
noises*
Zombies are pathetic in this game. I mean seriously, a flashlight?
05i like how the devs atleast tried to get some feelign of choice into the game when you got to choose if you want to send the transmission or not during comm 2. too bad it doesnt matter in the end. but it was nice of them to try atleast.
Wrek: wouldn't that make the players feel even more insulted than if they didn't have choices?
wheres the scary?
13yeah this is safe, even with railings...
ME3 incomming
Doom will never have choice besides: Kill Demons or Die?
Shizuka is cheating
ORANGE
I SHOULD be dealing with me backlog of betareading...nah, screw it.
05but betruger ends up sending it if you didnt
I like it when it's scary
05if you send it
05then betruger will jstu say
8,6CoD has more railings
05"thanks"
Polydunami What scary?
its online
05Shizuka: i bet procedure orange was "hit button"
13so complicated ><
Nah, it was probably "keep doing what you're doing"
/me hugs Wrek
killerpony7733: So any advice?
I though Orange was mix Red with Yellow?
thought
05hi RainbowJack ^_^
"After all, you're a whole lot more competent than any of us"
I said, " I like it when it's scary," NOT "I think it's scary," Diglett.
Why you starting, DeadpoolDash?
hi wrek nice to see your not typing drunk :P
#Dashiesauce
05but oyu get my point WindWhistler: it was back when no game had done that before
sagas i....really..can't say in some way you may need to think alot over it
oh boy, an ignorant advertiser!
05it was early and experimental
What the Doom series taught us: whenever we go to space, we have to make sure to have more anti-demon-invasion procedures.
05and nice and new at the time
hi RainbowJack, how are you?
This game needs a crowbar
Yeah, I get it.
start what? My engines?
killerpony7733: I know and I have and it never gets any simpler :'( :'(
Spriggals: But it has a chainsaw
Mahboi777 : i am doing fine just woke up and need to get ready for work
Though personally, I'd be afraid of making the "wrong" choice.
All that plasma :3
where are the chest high walls?
RainbowJack: Where do you work?
What FPSs in general have taught us: if you're not that one guy with all the guns, you have a 1/1000 chance of surviving. And will do so only if the guy with all the guns happens to miss you during the ship-is-exploding timed sequence.
RainbowJack: oh, well good mornin
05oH! iirc Shizuka you get the bfg next level if you get the code
DeadpoolDash: In the pit with the regenerative realth
sagas i can't really help you but you seem to have the issue of wanting intimacy with guys but sex with girls
sagas : at a big company here in the netherlands
Reikim: Except Iin Deus Ex ( to be fair it's more RPG) I let everyone live
killerpony7733: I know
05apparently the PDA is a pain to find but meh
Zambies
time for some Fisting
so does this autoaim like the first doom?
Ugh
sagas maybe you just don't see sex logical with guys
05DeadpoolDash: no
And Shizuka gets in another boxing match with the zombies.
0,14Tonight on BronyState, Shizuka beats the shit out of zombies
RainbowJack: ooo The Neatherlands. I visited there once. It was very nive
Shizuka is cheating
4-KILL STREAK
I just realised what Fisting means. I'm sorry
SaxyPretender: Sounds like a good night.
0,14eeeyup
Shizuka this is doom not punchout
05alister: no worries
/me facehoofs
Alister hahaha
Alister.../).=
It was because it kept moving, so I was afraid I was going to miss.
sagas : yes the netherlands is nice
Alister: :D
this...is...DOOM!!!
killerpony7733: I dont know I just dont feel it. Thinking of sex with guys just doesnt arouse me
Wrek : how are you feeling?
killerpony7733: For whatever reason
Usually when you're aiming, the gun stays still, but these games that like to go more realistic try to make it unsteady, and that screws me up
05heartburn, headache and tired at 5:23 in the morning
05gona go to bed soon ^_^
sagas: asexuality , it exists
indeed it does
Wrek: ...Go to sleep, man.
Alister, pansexuality exists too.
/me 11,01dusts Wrek
Alister he said he wants intimacy with guys but sex with girls
Alister: But sex with women still does
/me likes sex, with the ladies
Wait, you guys are STILL talking about that stuff?
punchout time
Alister that isn't asexuality
Polydunami: So does omnisexuality, but we haven't quite gotten to that point yet.
Oh silly me, it's about sex, of course they're gonna be talking about it for a while
Wrek: Heart burn, nausia, indegestion...Upset stomach, Dyahrea...
Oh my, that's... interesting...
05favorite doom enemy for me aughta be the revenant though
Pepto Bismol
05its the one most rememorable for me
.
sagas: Sorry didn't see that. You're probably just shy for now. It'll be ok once you find the right girl
time for the sex song...
i played doom 3 i only used godmod in the hell part
05DeadpoolDash more spam form you adn you get a timeout ban
Wrek Every time someone says Revenant, I think of Mass Effect 3. :p
okay wrek
13usually i god the whole way through
13this mod added regen health
13which i cranked up obviously
Well , Finals tommorow. So Good Night Everypony !
13moment, need drink
Wrek Do tell. :|
0,14later Alister
Night, Alister!
Goodnight Alister :3
8,6and then Shizuka gets ambushed while she's afk
Alister: Dream of Ponies
/me thinks Wrek doesn't liek me
You kids these days and your mods
Cya Alister and good luck on the finals!
kirzstryfe: awww
gnight Alister, good luck
Stuck in my head... T_T Watch at your own risk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WxcaCjiMw
05Gamefreak300: no youtube links during streams
Back in my day, we had to do things without hacking, because there was no way to hack
DeadpoolDash: -lol- you silly foal. Just give him a hug.
*Insert Shaun Of The Dead theme*
RainbowJack CRAP *ducks for cover*
Oh whoops... my bad. Wasn't aware
13can probably make it to hell tonight
My most memorable Doom enemy is actually a tie between the cacodemon and the hell knight.
05Gamefreak300: better read the rules then
I can understand hacking a computer, but I have no idea how people hack consoles...
Though the Reapers do sound better than Nirvana. :D
05Shizuka: you gotta beat the guardian while im here!
Wrek, I'll take a look. Been awhile!
13dat cheap jump scare :#
lol
SunderlandPony89 Haven't used it in a while.
Dang imps :|
gamefreak300 : if its stuck in your head posting it wont get it out
13i wonder how many testers fell for that
I miss playing Phantasy Star Online....
05all of them
if only we didn't misplace the disk...
Wait, Shizuka, that was supposed to be scary?
WindWhistler : many of them just use modio and a flash drive on a jail j-taged 360
Diglett, it was a fun video! I just wanted to share the wealth. Stuck in my head all the same though.
Spartan-Pie: ..............................come again?
polydunami: maybe there scary isnt our scary
See? To hack, you need extra knowledge. Knowledge that, as far as I'm concerned, isn't worth learning just to do something on a game.
I suppose.
Great, I reconnect and the stream is dead.
Polydunami doesn't really scare easily :S
WindWhistler: Hmmm, depends on what you're doing.
I mean, you have to learn the programming and all these codes and stuff
/me 11,01dusts Polydunami
BATTH ROOM
8,6stream's fine, probably something on your end Reikim
/me sneezes
it's really complicated, and I couldn't take the time to learn about that stuff.
zombie taking a shit
WindWhistler: Or look it up on youtube and follow the video insturctions :D -lol-
Thanks, going to go fix that now...
0,14...oh that's a bad way to go
Diglet does get scared
lol...zombie using the bathroom?
At all
Shoot ALL the lights :3
like for ps3 you have to get it jail broken
13so fun fact
kill all the light
WindWhistler: You dont have to be einstien to hack a video game :D
bullet poof lighting
13in the doom 3 engine, there is no natural light
oh a fun fact
05this came out 05... i was.. 12 at the time, yes i was fuckign scared when i played it :P
13there must actually be a light source in order for something to show
Iron_Edge: Really? O_o
13that's why it's so dark
lol, no global illumination
So you could possibly play in pitch black...
13it's fascinating reading the code
WindWhistler: eyup *rustles your mane*
Ha Wrek is scared of Doom 3
13ZOMBIELAND RULE 4
13ALWAYS FEAR THE BATHROOM
Hm
Shizuka: What about when you were on the train heading to delta? Wasnt there sunlight through the windows?
Iron_Edge: le gasp!
Wrek, you were allowed to play this at 12? Lucky you.
/me faints from shock
That sucks someone has taken my name lol.
Scared, Shizuka?
13TWO IMPS ENTER
wtf
13ONE IMP LEAVES... THEN DIES
IN DA BATHROOM
05Reikim: i played the first doom at the age of 3 so
Dead Space is Scary
0,14yay zombie infighting
13Iron_Edge: one huge light
My first experience with Doom was actually Doom 64 for the Nintendo 64, oddly enough.
0,14also, brb, gotta restart this
OK....gotta go everypony
Shizuka: Damn
13also no i don't think there's any jump scares left for me in this game
13played too many times
I couldn't possibly play games like this. I scare easily.
Wrek: Wow, that's...impressive. My parents were way too strict, so I wasn't able to play M games until I found the means to buy them myself.
05Shizuka: more or less same but there is always one i forget here and there x3
I'd probably be jumping at every corner.
PUNCHOUT! time
Wrek, I played Wolfenstein 3D when I was about five.
rawr
RainbowJack: You should try Silent Hill 2 if you want to a scary game
body blow!
KNOCKOUT!
Shizuka will PUNCH you into shape! Unless you die!
13okay i know there's a way in here, help?
/me rings a bell
geez, doesn't that guy ever get tired of laughing?
/me sighs
05heck, my mom and dad used to play the first dooms adn marathosn together with me sitting in his lap watching
my parents got me halo CE the month it came out when i was 9
05good times
protal gun!
/me holds a lightbulb over Shizuka's head
any ideas yet?
And off to bed.
Wrek, cherish your parents forever.
Sleep well CriticKitten
13guess it's that
o-O
/me 's lameness knows no bounds...and now she is sulking
Wrek: I wish MY parents would do that...
Night CriticKitten oh damn he's gone
Bye everypony
Later Dark92Enigma
See you Dark92Enigma :)
My mom can barely play a simple side-scrolling Kirby game...
gotta go to study
13dat british
bye Dark92Enigma
/me adds WindWhistler to the Bronystate Females sheet
13dat terrible british
She thinks there's too much to remember
05or when dad and stefan a friend of his and one more LAN'd starcraft and i got to join in x3
WindWhistler: At least she actually plays games.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PRESS ONE OR TWO BUTTONS
Sounds like a english german accent
you know what we should all do? Bronystate Paintball Tournament
i got gta 2 on the deamcast when i was a kid it was awesome
often*
13this guy narrates the videos too
yup
Ah well...
RAWRity: Yeah, if you can scrape together the money for the plane ticket.
My mom gave me permission to play Halo. It didn't end very well....
evening, everypony! :) How are we all tonight?
It was when I was like, 10 or something
This is in the future where the british accent has probably changed somewhat... ?
Sylandest: alright
evening Sylandest
03I'm prolly going to fail this assignment
I got a nightmare from it so I stopped playing.
Reikim: that's why we'll just hi-jack a bunch of airports.
03and the entire programming class
03x_____x
Hey Sylandest, and I'm doing fairly wel
RAWRity: Well that's one way to solve the problem.
13someone find the 112 cabinet code for me?
i can get you the code for the cabinet
/me waves at superretroworld and Paladin_Drakkenwolf and SunderlandPony89
...........no one's listening....
13pretty please?
ok
05mom however was a major sucker for the myst games, i was always so midn boggled how she was able to progress where the kid me could barely get off the first island
/me sulks
05<3
anway, I best be heading to bed. See you all later.
Bye, RAWRity
WHY DOES NO ONE PAY ATTENTION TO WINDWHISTLER?!
Night RAWRity.
Lucky, I want to play Myst :(
try 538
13i would play realmyst for you all but doesn't look like scrcap would play along
cya RAWRity
Cya RAWRity
Shizuka: 538
Hi guys
Get to the point!
13danke~
bye RAWRity
WindWhistler: I hear you and see you
hi icybeauti
528491
WindWhistler: I'm paying attention! From a distance.
WindWhistler: how can you get a nightmare from halo? halos not scary
Try 666
howdy icybeauti, MahBoi777!
Hey MahBoi777
Shizuka there you go ;)
13i forget which PDA gives it to you
lol
Hey Sylandest
Hey there icybeauti :)
WindWhistler: Here, have a hug to make up for not saying anything <3
/me glomps Sylandest
05btw shizuka
HEY Sylandest!:D
remember, if your not responded, your comment is still shown
/me returns MahBoi777's glomp :)
05901
Hey Polydunami
._.
05that is all
superretroworld: Well, there was the Flood...
I failed maths
got my reports today
howdy, MahBoi777! :D how are you tonight?
o-o
ouch
my mum is going to kill me
I need your help :<
?
Thats cheap
WindWhistler: true
03public String toString() -- gives the inorder traversal. <- I dunno how to do any of this...
And the fear of an enemy popping out at you from anywhere...
and then The Maw
13yup
13which is actually 931
13got that yesterday~
Though I heard a funny thing.
I just set up SSH for my parent's PC (access from anywhere) and I would like to use it as a tunne/proxy for my laptop when I am at school
Sylandest: I am doing great, thanks for asking, how about u?:)
I like the part with the flood
:s
Apparently there's a secret scene you can get during that ending
And it's hilarious
isn't tostring an inherted method of every object?
i was scared of the flood when i first played halo for the first time
WindWhistler, you have to beat The Maw on the highest difficulty
MahBoi777: pretty good as well, hehe. Just relaxing as the evening winds down. Have I missed much?
13but could be wrong
05STEAL HIS PISTOL Shizuka!
anyway, implemet/override this method in your class to return w/e he wants
13blum does a lot of voices for this
do it
03yeah but
03I dunno how to do an inorder traversal
03let alone make it a string
03LOL
The Flood ruined Halo 1-3 for me. Just coulldn't stand those annoying bastards
03and this is due in 20 mins...
C or C++?
Java
SunderlandPony89: They scared the crap out of me...
No, that doesn't sound like Blum
oh
stolen ha
SunderlandPony89: why?
But for some reason, I always loved the ones that fall over and explode
03http://faculty.washington.edu/moishe/javademos/jss2/ArrayBinaryTree.java
03I can like
03copy
03but she'll know
03XD
well uh, syntax in C is like Token(1, true).ToString(); sorta thing
WindWhistler: You need to try Silent Hill 2. True pshyological horror, and it was brilliant
SUUPPPERRR MEAT BOY. ;B
05red neurotoxin
I always called them "Wobblies" because of their wobbly arms
"Have a nice day"
dunno what it's like in java
atleast the robot voice is nice
You know the one I'm talking about?
And er HML
13bit of a spooky machine...
13course they all are
you can reference the code?
all that decontaminating
are you able to access the SSH from school?
SunderlandPony89, I've never played a Silent Hill game and I'd like to try them out.
DECONTAMINATION
Anyone?
THAVE A NICE DAY
/me peeks into chat.
05LadyCanary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That made me jump
Wobbly Flood? Explodes and more Flood come out of it?
howdy LadyCanary!
Trouble is, I don't have a playstation
:D WREKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi, LadyCanary!
superretroworld: The Flood missions were just long, boring, tedious, and drawn out segments that sadly made up more than half of Halo 1-3, and I ended up selling all 3 because of those freakin' flood levels
Anyone?
i remember those flood
What is streaming? :o
hi LadyCanary! how are you?
Oh hey LadyCanary! :3
05doom 3 a la Shizuka
LadyCanary: Doom 3
Well, I'm doing it from home
For some reason I thought they were cute. Because of those wobbly arms.
:D SHIZU PLAYING DOOM 3?!
> Using a VPN to connect to my home
XD
All of my WUB AND YES <3
use the ssh -D flag
LadyCanary: She does it all the time
So guys, I'm having a serious dilemma here, and I need help resolving it.
Polydunami: Silent Hill 2 and 3 are the only real noteworthy ones from what I' ve heard. And I can only speak of SH2's brilliance, since I've yet to start SH3, but SH2 was.. well... there's a reason why it's my favorite game ever
I did that
But that one level that really scared me was the one with the giant Flood brain thing.
SSH -D 9000
oh boy halon that gas that sufficates you
set my proxy in chrome to localhost 9000
but
doom 3 a la Cheating Shizuka
OHai LadyCanary. Seen the newest Metalocapyse yet?
sagas: Well I've never seen her play Doom.
it scared me so much...
I haven't used reverse tunelling for ages
:O NO I HAVENT SunderlandPony89 D:
tunnelling
on the ssh connection, I can't even *ping* a site from the computer
and uh
05Shizuka: did you even play quake 4 by chance?
I think it was the second to last level?
On the one hand, sleep is good. And if I stay here any longer, I'm liable to start making pseudophilosophical commentary, and I don't think ANYONE wants that.
Yeah, that level
LadyCanary: YOU NEED TO! They made a MLP refrence! Toki is a brony now
03and my teacher told us not to google stuff, what a moron >_>
well, from your parents' computer
or from the reverse tunnel connection?
But on the other, I have Shizuka punching zombies. What do I do?
..And now I love Toki even more.
pony14238: I want the commentary...
SunderlandPony89: you're pulling me tail
Wait
from SSH into parent's PC
afternoon everyone
howdy, XAX
Well that's odd
Polydunami: So you know what I'm talking about, right?
afternoon XAX
LadyCanary: As if you needed any more reason to love him :D
halo evry pony
13yep played q4 too <3
logs in fine, can see files and do stuff
13also
:D Shizuka!
but no networking access :s
13canary canary!<33
Anyway, I repeat, NOPONY wants me to start getting philosophical.
Well, there are those mannequin monsters and the infamous Pyramid Head...
^o^
05Shizuka: the waste dumps with the enhancement Q4 mods makes that game brilliant
i remember when you could take out a hunters with just a pistol
05so grotesque!
13oo there's enhancements for q4 too?
netstat says I do have localhost-9000 working/listening
13i will have to look into that
Anypony miss me yet? :D xD
so blargh
13i want q4 to look this shiny~
13i miss panda~
Panda: I missed you! :) *hugs*
So. Sleep, or zombies?
Oh, I'm still talking about Halo. I've never played Silent Hill.
yes, Panda!
O////o Shizuka
Panda: YEs
Sylandest: There you are.
:D
/me giggles.
Umm
/me hugs every pony
Om: Indeed I am :D How are you tonight?
dat mental breakdown
Sylandest: Thankfully I'm not. They said Toki had a MLP item, although it had a work like "dismembered" after "pony". Still counts though :)
/me hugs Panda back
There's one thing I don't understand....
Sylandest: Fine, and you?
SunderlandPony89: indeed. I'll have to keep my eye out for this. ty for informing me, hehe :)
Oh Toki, how I require a plushie of you <3
MahBoi777: halo
How can I not handle playing Halo, but I can handle playing Phantasy Star Online?
superretroworld: Indeed, that ending was pretty intense
hello geeky-brony!
night every pony :)
I mean, RUINS was a CREEPY level...
night night Spartan-Pie
Om: oh, just winding down for the evening. I've got work tomorrow, so no late night shenanigans from me

Goodnight Spartan-Pie :3

Night Spartan-Pie and hello geeky-brony
Sylandest: aww :D

Night Spartan-Pie

Panda: hehe, well, I'm here for a couple hours at least. plenty of time for shenanigans then! :D
hey TheRareP0N3
05now lets see if shizuka knwo how to do this ;3
Sylandest: That's okay. Mix it up
hi TheRareP0N3 and geeky-brony
Hey there Panda and TheRareP0N3 :3
Excuse my lack of typing, I'm gonna do a bit of studies :)
Pew pew pew
Polydunami: :D hita
GO SHIZU GO!
Panda: best of luck! :)
Panda: good luck
Polydunami: oops hiya :D
I have a weird feeling that it is my router's problem
MahBoi777: what are we waching
doom 3 FTW. ;D
Sylandest: you alright know ill need it superretroworld thank you :)
/me wants to pick up his cat but isn't sure because his cat was around a dead bird for an unknown amount of time :\
geeky-brony: Doom 3

Panda: hehehe :D
MahBoi777: ahhh ok
Doomy doom doom~
SunderlandPony89: do eeet
How did you know they were there Shizuka?
gotta love that FOV. :3
Great, now I'm bored again.
13ow..
13ow ow..
SunderlandPony89: pet teh kitteh
FOV?
ooooh
lol
LOL
Ugh
LOL
iuch
lol
*ouch
Field of view
lol wtf
and LOL
derp
Well, that sucks
Derp so hard.
13whoops... forgot to save any time ><!
LOL
-75?
Oh dear
Shizuka: noooooooo
oh
Awwww
13yeah, got squished
Shizuka: the bane of all gamers?
13instakill
D:
Shizuka: that sucks
How can you have -75 health?
13panda wo ist mein drawing :3
well damn
call of duty is fun with 90 field of view
:B
OH, THIS IZ BAD
how much time did you lose?
SunderlandPony89: wait... your cat is an outside cat?
WindWhistler: You've been bleeding out for too long and your teammates have refused to heal you.
13speeeeeedruuuuuun
my cat can't go outside, declawed. :P
How much time did you lose, Shizuka?
well, that looked...friendly...
Reikim: Wouldn't that just be 0 then? Because 0 means you're dead...right?
who here plays borderlands?
:B
My arent you the SPEEDY one Shizu
unless you're still losing blood even after you're dead.
Panda: We let him outside when he feels like it. Had a hell of a time getting him ini today since for some stupid reason my sister let him out a couple of hours before the time where he WONT came back in, IE nighttime
I've HEARD of borderlands...
WindWhistler: Sorry, tabletop gaming joke...0 is falling unconscious, negatives is further life loss. -10 is usually death.
I don't know what it is
yay shotgun
borderlands was so boring
13:3
Polydunami: it's a BA game, look it up
borderlands isn't boring
Hey guys, nice to be here
BA?
badasss
:P
I've got a massive headache today <_<
Was that a drop-shot?
Oh, I see
SunderlandPony89: :( which is why i usually i made sure my cats are spay and neutered, so they dont have the urge to go outside :D
Reikim: Oh. Huh, I always assumed 0 means "ded"
We watchin'....Doom 3?
Borderlands had the most let-down of an ending...
superretroworld: I'll a gree it got boring after awhile. I eventually sold the game after I got several characters to max level and had sucked all fun out of the game
i will say borderlands starts off slow
Not bothering to punch them, Shizuka?
Cool
has eny pony play the anlien doom mod
TheRareP0N3: all that it is is shooting insects in a boring desert
05goan lay down a bit Shizuka: ill fullscreen the stream
oh lord, someone's watching Family Guy in my house....
05remember 901 ;3
Panda: HAsnt worked for my cat. He is neutered and still wants to go outside
/me gives a pillow to Wreky
superretroworld: Not really. :P
Family Guy is a dumb show...
05thansk LadyCanary <33333333
WindWhistler: AGREED.
I'm getting dumber just by hearing it.
i hate that show
sagas: really?
Adult Swim keeps showing these awful shows that pretend they're funny
your soul will be mine

Ha! Joke's on you, I sold my soul ages ago!'
WindWhistler: they said complaining about derpy wont let anyone laid
13nah making up for lost time~
Family Guy was actually funny in its early seasons... what happened?
o-o
Mmm....souls.

Panda: As are my cats. It tamed my "feral" cat for a week or so, but he soon was back at being wild :P
What the crap? Someone's calling at 10:51 PM...
thats not doom guy
Polydunami: welll you gun out of jokes, you get too cocky....
If you want my soul you'll have to do some negoatiations with Celestia.
Panda: Yeah. He gets all stimulated and stuff when he sits on the window sil. I think he wants to hunt
WindWhistler: I JUST KILLED THREE MORE.
Polydunami: They became whores to pop culture
SunderlandPony89: ah i see....
SunderlandPony89: yeah it was sorta boring in my opinion, but i heard the ending was dissapointing
Anyone play Killing floor?
Shoot him.
damn plasma enducers!
Pew pew pew
superretroworld: Beyond dissapointing. Granted, what did you expect after a boss that was a giant vagina moster with tentacles?
sagas i think it may be inducers

Reikim: Have you played the game? The boss seriously is just that! Also has a few eyes \
Also Shizuka save.
Whoa, a kid
03sigh well
Reikim: It's a metaphor for politics
yeah, a kid. :B
WindWhistler: Now where would you get that idea? ;)
TheRareP0N3: :D

I just got back from a road trip with friends to California. Fun stuff, I missed you guys though,

its the BFG 9000
THAT WAS AWESOME
looks like a fail, as usual with every call of duty..lol
Jaketehsnake: how long have you been gone?
Dat LadyCanary. What's up?
i was really hoping for cod waw 2 :(
used to like call of duty, but than it just got really boring
Shizuka woah woah woah easy conserve the ammo for it
Badass Flying Griffon?
should you really use those so often? It doesn't seem to have a lot of ammo...
TheRareP0N3: lol cod sucks
your such a waster Shizuka
geeky-brony: agreed
I went to Joisey during the weekend for a con, Reikim ^_^ I bought ALL THE THINGS and met cool people :3
TheRareP0N3: (\
can't stand the community nowadays.
geeky-brony: /)
TheRareP0N3: I used to like CoD, but then MW2 came along and, well...
LadyCanary: Excuse me while I try to repress all the jelly. Which con?
GREETINGS BRONYSTATE! YOUR STALLION OF WAR HATH ARRIVED!
>Nowadays >It's been like this for years
TheRareP0N3: which community :o
13this is about where i start going infinite ammo
lol i banned myself from mw3.
:D
geeky-brony : /)
halo Stallion_of_War
hello Stallion_of_War
It's usually the community that makes me ashamed of liking anything.
Reikim: AnimeNEXT. I bought stuff :3 and I cosplayed as Black Canary
WELCOME Stallion_of_War!
Good for you, TheRareP0N3 :3
... I'll be right back
RainbowJack: (\
Stallion_of_War: And I welcome our stallion with open arms!
The Brony Community is good community
Panda, About a week and a half. I missed Bronystate!
Polydunami: For wallhacking, no recoiling, and inf ammo hacking! :)
TheRareP0N3: :D how?
Is it safe to say that CoD has the worst community out of any gaming community? I think so
Shizuka: Y U CHEATING?
We are taking a break from SLAYING THE GODS OF OLYMPUS to come here
Stallion_of_War: /) indeed we are brother ^-^
SunderlandPony89: What about Sonic?
superretroworld: No recoiling, inf ammo, and god mod. :B
Jaketehsnake: hehe where in cali did you go? you should visit san diego :D
SunderlandPony89: eeyup, im pretty sure thats where the meme noob came from
0,14I dunno, SunderlandPony89, the fighting game community can be pretty dickish
/me finally got a PS3
LadyCanary: All the stuff! Damn I wish we had some good conventions near where I live. Travel is so expensive.
I bought MW1, 2, and 3 just for the single-player campaign. I decided to try playing online and it was awful. Nobody would help me out with trying to figure out anything. My teammates in team deathmatch would just berate me for not knowing what I was doing.
hi, what game is this?
Don't forget Sonic!
cod4 is amazing
WindWhistler: At least they dont call people things I can't even say on here out of fear of teh banhammer
Reikim: Aw shucks D:
Panda, I did go to San Diego! And LA, Anehiem, and Vegas on the way home.
after cod4 and cod5, everything god stupid
cod needs to die
oh doom 3
SunderlandPony89: Really? I think they're just chronic complainers.
Not to mention they have no creativity.
geeky-brony: sadly it won't. it's one of activisions most successful franchises
11,01OtakuTom: Yeah.
Apparently recoloring a character makes it your own art.
Hoe does Battlefield stack up?
:D Nittany!
*How
Why are we discussing COD?
11,01LadyCanary!
Jaketehsnake: well warn me next time, we could meet up or something and watch some pony XD
LadyCanary: On another note, you cosplayed Black Canary! I've only seen her in a couple of things, but I find her interesting. And not just for the fanservice, although that is definitely a factor.
TheRareP0N3: how do you recoil a gun?
WindWhistler: ...you have no idea the extend of the things the CoD community say to people they dont like, do you?
Teleporter?
superretroworld: no recoiling. :P
sagas beats me kinda have a itch against it
11,01CoD jumped the shark after Modern Warfare.
She is mai waifu Reikim :3
/me dusts Nittany_Discord with the Feather duster made from feathers plucked from the many Harpies I've slain recently
SunderlandPony89: Probably the same thing any rabid fan says about people they don't like.
Well im getting off now
I volenteer Sylandest for that experiment
superretroworld: it's pretty easy acutally.
I got on and Shouted at people saying "HELLO! I AM IN/GOING TO CALIFORNIA!? WHO WANTS TO MEET!?" Sadly, nobody obliged.
TheRareP0N3: wich is sad ther beter games out like ninja gaydun
Om: which experiment? lol
/me 11,01feels special and clean.
did Wrek fall asleep behind PC?
MahBoi777: All of them.
i wasted 60 on that game.
luckily ii'm buying myself a 50 dollar steam card. :)
Jaketehsnake: i think that was during my "stressful" days :( i would have raised a hoof
RainbowJack: how r u
Shizuka, punchin zombies :D
Om: OH, I see
he's going heavy now. :D
RainbowJack: No, he's just lying down
"Eggheads"
Eggheads
eggheads haw? he ded
My gawd
I'M AN EGGHEAD???!?!?
punching zombies...what is this, Minecraft? :P
00,02eggheads
00,02:3
Nittany_Discord: then it went in the water, stabbed his heart, got it out of the pool, cut the head off, burned the body, hung the head on the wall and did the same to 12 others when Waw came out
Otakutom: don't remind me please.
no spike nukels fail
what is this talk of eggheads :D
This guy is smart.
WindWhistler: Besides for the xXx1337Sc00p1PZxXx type of people in the CoD community, this side of it is also why it needs to die http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/harassment
Om: what did I miss?
OtakuTom: We don't speak about that around these parts.
geeky-brony : i am fine getting ready fr work
WAT. The fapping droids?!
Sylandest: I volenteered you!
pawnch
RainbowJack: awesome
When your race opens a portal to Hell, you better damn well have a bad feeling.
Om: I-wait-for what?
You know, you could say the same thing about rabid bronies...
ocean*
I heard fapping droids! I'm scarred
/me screams
like the ones who sent death threats to a person they thought was responisble for changing Derpy.
looks like shizu-chan cant punch those :D
Sylandest: Yup, you probably wont survive :(
emphasis on THOUGHT
Save the game!
Om: what was I volunteered for? I might have a chance
SunderlandPony89: I get on the mic and I instantly have kids yelling at me for using an *OP GUN* whiich is just a mac11, i tell him to watch his f***ing mouth because he's like, 6. and than he threatens to hack me. and that is why i went to pc gaming. :)
WindWhistler: I defer to Faust on this. Hold on, let me find the quote...
Shizuka: remember to save!
Sylandest: Everything.
SAVE IT
SAVE Shizuka
ALL the things?
all of em
TheRareP0N3: The CoD community seems to be full of such annoying preteens, I'm afrais.
GO SHIZU GO
*afraid
Om:oh, well...i can survive some of everything, can't I?
i have OCD over saving
Reikim: preteens? you mean little kids?
Reikim: That sounds like 70% of the Steam community.
13went all the way
TheRareP0N3: "Sir, I believe you have a servear case of, baby voice..."
annoying preteens arent as bad as annoying teens
TheRareP0N3: Yes, that.
13forgot the plot coupon
Save it
plot cupon? :0
oh look, you completed an objective, looks like youre gonna get ambused now
EA is makeing Dead Space three Co-Op becus the first two wer to scary .......... -_(\
Panda: Yes please.
You mean 12-year-olds?
WindWhistler: A majority of bronies didn't send the writer of that episode death threats though, only a few people. Nowhere near the about of CoD players who spread hate and bile
no. I just hate the 12 year old faze people in my school
*OH I DID A 360 ASDF CUMSHOT NOSCOPE*
Sylandest: Eeeyup.
TheRareP0N3: I envy you. If I had the money and know how I'd swtich to PC gaming in a heartbeat
SunderlandPony89: Oh no, I'm not talking about the writer of the episode, I'm talking about a FELLOW BRONY.
me: i don't. give. a single. f***.
Panda: plot what now? :D
time to go to hell
Sylandest: idk... Shizuka said it
Eggsalad... that will get the teleporter working again
WindWhistler: who?
She wrote to them about removing Derpy because she thought Derpy was offensive.
To anyone who questions to brony fandom, or levels accusations against it...my response is thusly. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M2E7mFY4K4U/TzGnbOU6MII/AAAAAAAAeAs/33qgjXMkdMQ/s1600/1.PNG
Panda: hehehe
Fill your pokedex
WindWhistler: Again, at least a majority of bronies dont do that kind of stuff
I want my coupon
SAVE
> never happens again
As a result, she got TWENTY PAGES worth of death threats to that one person
Sylandest: so... i guess Shizuka has "plot" cupons...
Om: did you check the newspaper?
Isn't this a prequel?
13plot coupon
Sunderlandpony89: Acutally, getting a pc is quite easy. :P just know what you want, not get tricked by some company
Panda: yaaayy, coupons
Shizuka: what is that?
WindWhistler: Here. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M2E7mFY4K4U/TzGnbOU6MII/AAAAAAAAeAs/33qgjXMkdMQ/s1600/1.PNG
Dat plot
Sylandest: ... noooo
13an item you need to get one free plot advancement
Om: *hands you newspaper* check it then
Have you guys heard of Yamino?
Shizuka: OH!!!! well ponies have muddled that meaning I guess XD
/me checks newspaper for plot coupon
6_9
Shizuka..can i have one?
Sunderlandpony89: I had a slimline comp with a integrated graphics card, and I magicly upgraded it to a ATI radeon 6990. :)
Panda: I...oh god, now i see where you went with that :D
Shizuka: Free. Yeah, sure. What with all the crap you have to do to GET it.
13well yeah
WindWhistler: who was the person that wrote a letter about derpy?
PC gaming isn't hard, steam + good pc = profit
13but it's different from macguffin which is an item central to the plot for no reason
TheRareP0N3: :D
13plot coupons are "go here, get this, advance story"
hell i'm gaming on an ATI radeon 3100. :P and that's awful
TheRareP0N3: Good PC = Money though. Lots of money
MahBoi777: hay what game stiotin u play
13good ambience in this room for the voiceover
Wait why would this guy give you this thing when you are going into hell?
Shizuka: The MacGuffin is central to the plot for a reason! That reason being plot.
superretroworld: Her name is Yamino.
Sunderlandpony89: Gamble? :D
/me finds nothing
so.... doom 3 has best plot? XD
13taking breaks like this so i can scroll up in chat X3
TheRareP0N3: To young :P
Om: nothing at all? no coupons?
13honestly if you take it for what it is, a reboot of doom 1, it's a good story
Sunderlandpony89: I'm 13. :P
Sylandest: Nothing...
> open portal to hell
geeky-brony: Xbox 360
Panda: Its a good thing I know multiple definitions, so I don't misinterpret that XD
> explore it
You had me at ATI, TheRareP0N3...I've had nothing but problems with any of their cards. I definitely prefer nvidia cards over ATI, even if there is the occasional driver problem.
MahBoi777: (\
I KNEW this looked like the first one!
This is the human race in a nutshell.
Shizuka: any idea what the min specs are off hand? i may get a copy
Om: then we must try the interwebz
geeky-brony: /)
13for doom 3?
13it was 2004, so quite low
TheRareP0N3: I'm 17, so I'm not to far off from being able to gamble :P
Otakutom: I'm not getting into video card wars. AGAIN. so i'm stopping this
Sylandest: I don't think I want to search for those...
Panda, this game came out some 8 years ago, so just about any computer should be able to play it.
13my laptop's integrated card can pull it off at around 10fps in big rooms, which is where the engine is doing the most work
Om: then no coupons for any of us...XD
Sylandest: Somehow I am fine with that.
lolfail, it does need Firefox
13carmack does good engines... or did, rage flopped really hard
but whoop
/me takes all the coupons
WindWhistler: she probaly must be the most hated brony now
Om: as am I. no wait, there goes MahBoi777 with them! :O
or does it :c
Sunderlandpony89: I don't gamble. oblivously. *lul* but just get a cheap comp, like a slimline that has a PCI express 16 slot. and than upgrade it. and bam. you got yourselves a dual core + a good video card
Uh oh...did I miss something earlier, TheRareP0N3? I definitely wasn't around for a video card war ^^;
Shizuka: oh since 2004... my 08 lamtop should be able to handle it eh?
13probably
otakutom: *facepalm*
superretroworld: She WASN'T even responsible for it. People just ASSUMED she was.
oh yeah, this kid at my school
Sylandest: Oh noooo!
13Phase4: still around? http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php
TheRareP0N3: ponies dont have palms ;)
Yes, she did write a letter, but no, she wasn't the cause.
TheRareP0N3: Given my horrible luck with computers, I'm still scared I'd end up screwing something up
Om: after him! *chases after MahBoi777*
00,02Shizuka, thx
i said comp gaming is better. than you can have 32 gb of ram. :P and xbox has little ram, 1 gb or so
Panda: Quit being picky!
him: 1 GB? THAT'S BETTER
me: LOL.l
13<3
Om: how am i picky? :D
/me test
Sylandest: Nah, thats work
hey, it worked
Panda: You just have to have palms.
Om: *stops chasing*...oh, well...good point. *sits* im too tired for work
/me has Doom on floppy-disks! *yay*
Sylandest and Om: now now, I stole these fair and square

Om: hehe :)
0,14Guess who just got retweeted by a Platinum Games employee because FUCK YEAH FEMINISM
MahBoi777: I dun care >_<
MahBoi777: do with them what you will. Om and I are allowing you to escape...this time...
Reikim: POOT TELEPORT HERE
Just read this and you can see that the MLP community is no better than the CoD community.
ACTIVATE
yay for teleporter travel
WindWhistler: is ymino there only evidence?

Just read that journal
yomino*

0,14it's a good thing :3
who is platinum games?
Om: okey dokey, thanks
SaxyPretender: then hooray! :D
WindWhistler: Your never going to find a *perfect* community when it comes to popular things. theres going to be the asshats and the good people, in a way we're all the same. :P
MahBoi777: Why thank me?
0,14Platinum Games is the developer behind Madworld, Bayonetta and Vanquish
0,14Also, Anarchy Reigns and Metal Gear Rising
SaxyPretender: oooh! nice! Congrats!
....so games I have never played then, okay
Om: why not?
this is not hell
SaxyPretender: so what happens now for you?
TheRareP0N3: I'm just saying, you say CoD should die because of their community, but quite frankly, this is ridiculous, especially considering it's a KID'S show.
0,14I dunno
0,14XD
MahBoi777: Cuse I haz a shirt on.
SaxyPretender: :D dat tweet
Bayonetta is good. The world should have more games like Bayonetta.
mfw I just remember Lollipop Chainsaw came out. SONOFABITCH I needz it
I mean MLP
Shizuka dat reaction time
SaxyPretender: well, congratulaitons anyway. Well done! :)
*congratulations :D
Om: oh okay, nevermind then :1
WindWhistler: After seeing what's on the internet, i don't consider MLP a kids show anymore. *wink wink*
LadyCanary: You also needz Bayonetta if you haven't picked it up already
I know TT_TT
I'm still crossing my fingers for a Bayonetta 2
But I spent my money at the convention.
I got a White Canary figure. ALL OF MY YES
TheRareP0N3: You get my point.
Anyone happy for the steam summer sales this year? :)
OtakuTom: Sega said no until futher notice, sadly enough
0,14one of the employees was saying that we need more feminist critique in video games, but that's actually based on feminist critical theory
LadyCanary: ahh, thats right. How did it go for you, the convention?
7 years and im still nope losing my hopes for a mother 4
not*
Bayonetta is good because it goes "let's do this Crazy Awesome thing" and when asked why goes "fuck why not" and then goes on to do it and still have a plot deeper than most mainstream games *coughCoDcough*
0,14he gave a link to a couple of really good essays/books, I mentioned I read an excerpt from one of them and BAM retweet
Lovely, Sylandest ^_^ I cosplayed and I got complimented by these 2 girls who MADE their costumes. Self esteem boost GO! ^_^
0,14also, YOU GOT A WHITE CANARY FIGURE?
I like my mother 3 :3
WindWhistler: Think of it this way, they're both the same. Cod was aimed at adults and teens but it ended up going to kids and little kids, and MLP: FIM was aimed at small children and now it's popular with teens and adults
I think more companies need to start pulling a Blizzard and wait 10-12 years between sequels :P
LadyCanary: indeed, well done! It sounds like you had a great time :)
I did ^_^
SaxyPretender: YES I DID
0,14JELLY
http://www.entertainmentearth.com/images/AUTOIMAGES/DC30681lg.jpg
SaxyPretender: you so jelly
Reikim: You call that plot deep? I call it an incomprehensable mess. I love Bayonetta, but I wouldn't say it has an incredible and deep storyline
SaxyPretender: HAS A STRANGE ADDICTION WITH TONS OF JARS OF JELLLYYY
So we need more games that just go Crazy Awesome because they can. Also, the video game industry needs more strong female leads.
That's her, Saxy ^_^
man, that's funny hearing Tara Strong.
0,14...waaaant
TheRareP0N3: It just goes to show that all kids want to be adults and all adults want to be kids :P
LadyCanary: *whistles* nicely done, Canary!
SunderlandPony89: Yeah, that was bullshit, having not played the game, but then it wouldn't be hard to beat out a lot of today's plots.
I looked for Black Canary but they didnt have her. So WHITE CANARY.
OtakuTom: I don't wanna be an adult. :P
OtakuTom: good point

Panda: things happened. resume studying :D
Reikim: Got a point there
I still maintain that the gaming industry could use more strong female leads. Like Samus (pre Other M, but we're not starting that).
0,14^
Reikim: yup.
Word up.
0,14I don't think the new Lara Croft is a step in the right direction
theres kinda of a lot of strong females in games already
TheRareP0N3: when becoming a brony, youre never an adult
New Croft? Explain plz?
inb4 Tropes Vs Women arguement fires up
superretroworld: :D
Well Samus was the first true strong female gaming character I think
0,14I feel...weird everytime I see the new Tomb Raider game
SaxyPretender: I have yet to see it. What's it like.
Archville
SaxyPretender: you and me bother :(
?
SaxyPretender: At least Lara Croft has a good VA: Nolan North
SaxyPretender: I got that feeling too. something's been changed from the dynamic that makes it work usually. I can't put my hoof on it though

superretroworld: i like staying inside half of the time, considering the fact that there's alot of kid's being stolen nowadays.
superretroworld: so whenever I do go to the store or something, i carry a pocketblade with me just incase. :)
a lot of kids*
how do you even die with health regeneration like that
0,14It's problematic when a lot of the cutscenes they've shown is her getting the ever loving shit beaten out of her
twilight_sprinkle: You dont
13it snaps to the nearest 20
Me and my bf have been playing Half Life 2, and we're both loving Alyx. She may not be a "lead" per say, but she kicks so much ass.
er
13moment
Personally, I think the reboot of Tomb Raider with filling in Lara's backstory and even giving her a (albeit slight) visual redesign is a step in the right direction. It's really getting rid of the oversexualization of her and making her more human.
SaxyPretender: indeed. sometimes it helps to build character, but in the vids I've seen, its more like they're just literally trying to tear her to pieces
0,14^
LadyCanary: HALF LIFE 2 IS A BOSS GAME.
so it doesnt regenerate all the way tp 100 if below 80?
No shit
13it regenerates up to 80 then
TheRareP0N3: (\
13or 60, 40, 20, ded
OtakuTom: you make a good point there
ook thats more interesting
geeky-brony /)
SaxyPretender: I'm guessing its to make her seem more human and in a desperate survival situation
Shizuka: oh i was afraid you were cheating :D
TheRareP0N3: i mean inside yourself, not the real word, put always carry a pocketblade just in case :D
0,14I will give you that point, OtakuTom, but some of the implementation is kinda problematic
SaxyPretender: mfw I open up the new Tomb Raider trailer and get a Lollipop Chainsaw ad :D
0,14XD
Panda: You always thing everyone is cheating.
but*
13only mostly
superretroworld: inside I keep a 5 inch blade under my computer desk. :)
Must..play...Lollipop Chainsaw ;3;
13usually i godmode and infinite ammo the whole way
Om: i do? 6_9
... I'm skeptical.
13also
Panda: so far :D
13oblivious, party of this guy
It's hard to judge a game when it's not out yet. All the trailers are showing her in trouble because that's what builds up the suspense and interest in the game. It works, though.
624
well thats because you are Shizuka, Shizuka
LadyCanary: so if alyx were lead, youd play hl2?...
Shizuka: indeed, lol
624
TheRareP0N3: for what?
BAH! You surprised me!
13oh thank you X3

So, first comment...when the hell did Squenix acquire TOmb Raider?

0,14oh hai Pinkies4thWall
/me glomps Pinkies4thWall
A game like Lollipop Chainsaw (which I'm picking up in the morning) is easier to have fun and energetic trailers, 'cause the game is designed to be comedic and over-the-top. Tomb Raider is much more dramatic, so you're not going to have those over-the-top moments to really have a "fun" trailer.
^
Oh gawd, so hungry -.-
tl;dr
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall
Om: then go get noms
OtakuTom: Also, Suda51 is a crazy motherbucker.
Om: eat
Sylandest: Its cooking :C
Om nom nom
Om: but its also noms

dead
I couldn't agree more, LadyCanary XD
lol dat jump
I watch mlp because it's an uprising show and it acutally is good to think about happy things than to think of some bad things that happen IRL atm.
No More Heroes <3
I've heard Lollipop Chainsaw isn't as crazy as Suda51 normally is
0,14B-b-b-but
0,14it's Suda
TheRareP0N3: hear hear! :D
0,14he so crazy
13okay that beeped, is there a secret here?
SaxyPretender: I don't know, the trailer looks pretty promising. It looks dramatic in a good way. On top of that, the new design is good; yougner and fresher, fit for a Laura just starting out. What I think it risks is a fandom break like happened with Other M.
... Lollipop Chainsaw is a game by Suda51?
Sylandest: Yes. My name is comically the same as the sounds of eating
NOCLIP
Just what I've heard, and I hope it's wrong
Makes perfect sense O_O
Yes Polydunami
Shizuka i do not know :S
noclip. xD
Om: you see? its in your name! you must go and obtain the noms!
Shizuka noclip then
I don't care if it's not as crazy as some of his other games, but it fits my "guilty pleasure" criteria pretty well.
ZEUS! YOUR SON HAS RETURNED!
TheRareP0N3: thats pretty crazy
0,14I'm still waiting on more info, but I'm very uncertain
I BRING THE DESTRUCTION, OF OLYMPUS!
superretroworld: what is
Sylandest: Funy thing is, I don't eat all that much :I
I AM KRONOS
Stallion_of_War_III: -_(\ lol
Om: but you did say you were hungry :3
I'm love playing games like Oneechanbara, despite the fact that they're pretty bad from a technical point of view.
0,14Guilty pleasures ftw
DW7 is my guilty pleasure <#
SaxyPretender: It's risking a lot, but I hope it turns out well. I think it has a lot of potential, so long as a) the developers don't derp, and b) the fandom gives it a fair try instead of pulling They Changed It Now They Suck
<3*
Sylandest: Yes. Painfully so xD just gota wait now...

superretroworld: Yup. Not lying too. :P
im back <3
hello
And if it's another game like those (girl(s) going around killing zombies in rediculous clothing) AND made by a crazy motherbucker like Suda, there's no way I wouldn't pick it up...lol
Hell, I've probably bought $25 worth of DLC for DW7
howdy, PinkiePieGuy

You know, in these gameplay trailers, the player needs to shut the hell up.

lol just joined, looks a bit like valves engine
Superretroworld: Pretty much, my school is bad. kids get in random fights, someone put a knife to a kids throat and said *I'M GOING OT KILL YOU N*****" and got sent to jail
though the health bar is nothing similar
TheRareP0N3: that does sound bad. I hope nothing happens to you? :(
MFW a friend of mine called Lollipop Chainsaw sexist
TheRareP0N3, my cousin spent a year in the bad part of Chicago.
I think this may be my cover art for my cover artless copy of God of War III
sounds like my school
...AHAHAHAHAAHHAHA wut SunderlandPony89
SunderlandPony89: what? how does that even work?! :D
what does MFW mean?
just found out I can buy Doom 3 for $9 from app store :D
It's too late...I'm going to have to say goodnight.
LadyCanary: And my other friend called it fap material

superretroworld: my face when
Night Reikim ^_^
Sylandest: Hehe, Nope. I troll them back. :) They normally ask to take my lunch money, i simply reply: you acutally think I eat this shit hear? you wish.
TheRareP0N3: cant you switch schools?

PinkiePieGuy this is nothing neat the valve engine you can see games that run on it and tell but this isn't :D
Reikim: goodnight! take care!
Goddess of War, much? :3

LadyCanary: And those are just my online buddies. If my RL friends saw me playing the game... oh boy, it wouldn't be pretty

Also, Shizuka: Teach those bastards the meaning of PAIN!
Superretroworld: No. tried to convince my mom but she won't do it. Won't surprise me that one day i'm dead. :C
TheRareP0N3: still, make sure to be cautious. We don't want to see you getting hurt
Alright, night everyone. <3
SunderlandPony89: Well of course. =_= there's a lot worse fap material out there.
night reikim
Reikim: Dream of Ponies
Sylandest: It doesn't "represent females in a very good way"
Sunderlandpony89: damn straight. earlier I found out there's minecraft porn. -_-
LadyCanary: ...wat XD
13it's a shame that ROE has like three video disks
Play me the song of your people.
TheRareP0N3: sorry bout that :(
Shizuka true true but it was good still
TheRareP0N3: Rule 34 strikes again! :P
im reading deadman wonderland
Sylandest: I don't get hurt, as I said. I carry a pocketblade. :P
its amazing
SunderlandPony89: do they detail this explanation, or is it just thrown out there?
and i'm not really afraid to die, so honestly. :P
TheRareP0N3: well, thats good and all, but still, I worry for a friend who is put in dangerous situations. Habit of mine, hehe :$
red wins!
SunderlandPony89: Like I havent heard THAT before. >_< They called freaking SKULLGIRLS sexist. Because they have big tits? Wooooooooow smart. To be fair, the ONLY ONE who actually likes to draw attention to her tits is VALENTINE.
Sylandest: That's all I got her to say, she HATES debates. Thinks there is no difference between arguements and debates, and she HATES debates
im off you bed, night everyone

This is Doom 3 as played by Shizuka, Irish_Pony :3
Sylandest: Yeah. You were, I'm sory you had to learn this way.
OtakuTom: they make references from High School of the Dead? Sweet!
superretroworld: She's not really a sex symbol though. And who cares if it has zombies, it's not like it's trying to take itself seriously
Shizuka, you have an awesome choice of games. :)
Om: my entire life perspective is altered forever...XD

SunderlandPony89: There's still some PS exclusive characters that haven't been added to the roster (at least as far as I know) such as Crash Bandicoot, and I'd even argue that Snake from MGS should be in it since most people relate Metal Gear to Playstation instead of Nintendo. Heck, make a deal with Squeenix to put some FF characters in. Final Fantasy was exclusive to PS from 7 through 12!

geeky-brony: since it isnt flawed then you admit it is true your not a real man
13if you godmode and overflow a bfg
xmasskills: why
13sure
I can tell when I'm doing something in the game that I shouldn't be able to do, like take on a whole army of Combine in HL2, but to me it's more fun to experience the story and get to be an unkillable badass X3
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: thats never a good thing to use, it also screws up the game
SunderlandPony89: PONIES can only go so far
xmasskills: Yes, ALL THE WAY!
Wait, how do you know how much total ammo for a gun you have?
twilight_sprinkle: only if you kill necessary characters for the game

Just spam the Blast Force Gun
Shizuka: hes not that big
Shizuka: give 'em the ol' one-two!
puch it
the bigger he is, the harder you gotta punch...
Heck, I think the last movie I saw based on a video game was Advent Children...and the last one before that was Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within >_>
that charging sound is more annoying than an alarm
Punch the Cthulhu
Advent Children was awesome

kirz|art: why are you changing the colours?
Gamer_Luna: Any time. I do enjoy making people laugh. :D
8,6because the contest I'm doing the picture for says OC's only, no official ponies
^
8,6so I'll have 2 final versions, one with OC's, one with the original hooves
well he was on the ground while i was beating him up
I like making people laugh but I don't know how @_@
what contest? :D
Who are the OCs?
it's easy Polydunami
so i just took it all the way
Ah...I was wondering why there was the sudden change. I didn't know that it was for a contest. I found it weird to think that Hasbro would suddenly start cracking down on all pony art...lol
Whats this song?
Geez, xxMoopyxx. Must've really got on your nerves

I dont like yelling, but sometimes thats the only way to get through to some people.
when a mod talks in chat dos anyone else read it in the royal canterlot voice

MAN I LOVE DR WHO
Attention span has died. See ya

Bronysith: are you british?

Has everypony seen my rainbow Dash Tile?
Bronysith: I tried to get into it but it's too silly trying to be serious for me :D
/me is glomped
Bronysith: oh. Well Im too skinny for tackles, chances of being crushed is a bit high, but apart from that I welcome these glomps :D
/me falls to floor from glomp
so many glomps
though I tend to glomp a lot when Im drunk and it annoys the hell outta everyone ):
/me glomps trollhunter
all dem glomps 0-0
what is glomps
/me glomps trollhunter
Glomping involves runnning full steam into someone you like, wrapping your arms around them and tumbling to the ground along with them while still holding on. Once on the ground the holding of said liked person continues and may involve crush squeezy love.
Hug attack :3
A glomp is a tackle hug :3
thanks for clearing that up for me
Impromptu quick kisses are encouraged after glomping
/me if i ever meet the mane 6, they are so glomped
i should not have had that say /me
all them glomps and wubz around
Yeah, like that
Alchemist: think enzo hugging bob in ReBoot
Alchemist: Yes just like that ^_^
You leave Rarity alone, Sith.

Informant_Pony: i love rarity

Hmm... No, don't know any Jan Svankmayer :S
Bronysith: aghhh noo that affects me
Out of curiosity how many genuine mares frequent this site?
FairysHuff: Shizuka is the only one I know.

Good night everypony
/me glomps Pinkies4thWall
FairysHuff, we have a few mares around
Gnight, Pinkies4thWall! Take care. :)
may the force be with you Pinkies4thWall
FairysHuff, but its an anonymous chatroom and people dont really start conversations like "Hi, Im XY and Im a girl", so Im sure there are more than just one :D
Random info. I just woke up from a series of disturbing dreams. One where I was asleep in bed and for some reason a hot shower was running in my room and flooded the place while I slept. I drowned. O_o

Alchemist, dat biology fail xD
>You will never get to pop a charlie with your A1
Alchemist: True that. It's just that all my friends are girls and I would have liked to make one on here as well.
FairysHuff: as far as I know dreams of suffocating/drowning means that you are sleeping in an uncomfortable position and cant breathe easily. e.g. on your back, or with your pillow in your mouth :D
yeah, it's 3:48. good night

OtakuTom: are you my mummy?
Phase4: You should watch the Doctor Who series from the 80s. Some of the best episodes with one of the best Doctors.
Wow. I did not know it was that late already
FairysHuff: when was the 4th doctor?
FairysHuff: I dont remember my dreams: I remember feelings and pictures for about 5-10 minutes and then they are gone.
So yea...I just read some news that'll make me a Linux convert (at least on my laptop which is starting to show it's age)...
Steam is coming to Linux in the near future :D
Alchemist: Same here.
00,02OtakuTom, IKR
00,02EPIC
00,02BEST THING EVER
Bronysith: I don't know.
Now to decide which Linux distro to get XD
FairysHuff: have you seen the 4th doctor? i have heard hes fantastic
00,02OtakuTom, theres only a few
00,02that are any good for desktop
00,02derp enter
Sylvester McCoy is the doctor I grew up with. I still love him. He's so cooky.
Anyone excited about Breaking Bad?
I'm looking at Ubuntu 12.04 (I've used previous Ubuntu releases on other computers) as well as Mint.
00,02slow for some reason
FairysHuff: the 7th doctor.
FairysHuff: I haven't seen anything before Eccleston yet :(
OtakuTom: /) i love eccleston
Bronysith: I haven't Actually watched DrWho since Sylvester McCoy left. That was back in the 80s
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_actors_who_have_played_the_Doctor
Night night every pony :D
FairysHuff: ill be sure to check him out after the 4th doctor
panda: nighty night hugs
night panda
night Panda
I'm a bit biased when it comes to my favorite of the 3...I started with Tennant, then Smith, then Eccleston. I didn't really like Eccleston as much as Tennant and Smith.
Night panda :P
Good night Panda
panda: Night!
Bronysith: Don't expect much. It was the 80s ^_^ Hes just funny to watch and does the doctor in a unique and comedic way
night panda
/me hugs everypony
panda: Or actually... MORNING!
Om: xD
FairysHuff: i bet. it WAS the 80s
I'm going to dance off to bed now too good night everypony

DeathStar: Nighty night hugs

http://images.4chan.org/k/src/1339667518620.jpg
I really want to see Tom Baker (4th Doctor) and Peter Davison (5th Doctor)
What is this wizardry?
I would have been entirely trapped by the last two
night Polydormant.
OtakuTom: i heard that tom baker is fantastic.
or Polydominant, whatever.
/me dances off to bed "good night everypony"
night DeathStar
Morning everypony
DeathStar: Dance winderful dreams
dormant means resting, as in dormant volcano
I'm dormant
Baker was always the fan favorite, at least until Tennant came around.
/me sleeps
morning VioletGreySha
OtakuTom: so now we have a picard vs kirk syndrome right?
/me hugs Phase4
/me 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
My game design teacher at college loves (and I mean LOVES) Doctor Who. I'm pretty sure I was guaranteed an A in any of my classes with her just for being a fan XD
:3
/me hugs Phase4 with VioletGreySha
The doctors seem to be getting younger and younger. Can't say I like that trend. I prefer watching older doctors. They put a unique spin on the show
hay Bronysith ^-^
/me super glomps VioletGreySha
ded
not the super glomps
/me jumps on VioletGreySha and hugs :3
FairysHuff: i need to find a place to watch Tom Baker. its not on netflix besides the movies
Ok for real/ good night
aaah 2 ponys on me :3
X3
/me glomps Ninjazz
Ninjazz: hey
Still here. Just AFK :)
Hey there, Bronysith. :)
Bronysith: You should watch the series with the first doctor. It has "Proper English" so much fun to listen to ^_^
good night guys
Night Night. ^-^
FairysHuff: Eventually they'll find some way to write it in that The Doctor finds the ability to circumvent the 12 regenerations rule and keep regenerating into a younger and younger state, eventually starting another spinoff series: Little Doctor Who Adventures.
Ninjazz: hay ploty :P
FairysHuff: again. as soon as i find a place to watch the old doctors i probably will
night Pinkies4thwall
>__<
/me slaps OtakuTom
Ninjazz: lol
The names I'm given. :$
:3
OtakuTom: I hope so. I do prefer the older doctors. Perhaps he can reach a certain age and then just wink out of existence and pop back in again as an old man once more.
I take it you don't like my sense of humor, Bronysith? :P
OtakuTom: Like a reverse buddhit reincarnation ^_^
OtakuTom: i dont like kids where kids shouldnt be.
Bronysith: There are places you can stream the oldest episodes for free.
FairysHuff: LINK ME!!!!!
I'm still waiting for the day that they announce Patrick Stewart as the 12th doctor XP
Bronysith: I don't have them. Let me look em up.
OtakuTom: John D Lancie would be better
FairysHuff: ty
lol...that would be pretty epic.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwjLrhBLsw
I'm just waiting for another "I'm still not ginger!" joke.
ell night everypony :$
Seems the very first episode can be found on Youtube ^_^

I want additional time :I

OtakuTom: LOL!
WallDives: i only drink english tea
14how are you?
It's best ass, WallDives.
I'm not too bad
relatively okay actually

Om: Yus they are. I prefer using them over any other weapon in Skyrim. Shame they have so few execution animations. ~_~
Bronysith, then you must have a lot of money to drink it on a daily basis.
14:D
I hate tea :P
WallDives: i kidnap lots of english men, and grind em down into a small bag..
FairysHuff: They got a few more with that patch... But still nothing, amazing.
trollhunter: LOL I love that. Friendship teh crap out of them ^_^ lol
/me slaps Ponies47 for fun
Bronysith: :'(

FairysHuff: Yeah, you get a bit op still when some skills reach 100. Some stuf just isn't fair xD its fun tho
Dat Rarity Phase4
^
Bronysith, not that I like one more than the other, just quality coffee is cheaper than quality Tea.
and I happen to drink a lot.
Om: The game is incredibly easy on master level even with mods to make it harder added ~_~
Now now Bronysith we wouldn't wanna have a lightsaber would we?
WallDives: this is true
Ponies47: nope.avi
You wanna talk OP, Om? I have a friend that broke Morrowind so badly that he was able to kill gods by throwing a wooden coin through them.
Bronysith: GOOD! *Pats head*

I'm still having a hell of a lot of fun with the infinate sprint glitch
The funniest part was when he had to delete that save file...He made so many Fortify Intelligence potions that he accidentally rolled his int over into the negatives and couldn't recover XD
Bronysith: Do you accpect my friendship?
14yeah
14I will get worse today though

Bronysith: Da power of friendship! :)

Bronysith: Is the Tardis still stuck as a 1960s police box? ^_^
14nothing wrong with that x3 I do gym because I need some more strenght
FairysHuff: yes...yes it is
FairysHuff: It sure is :)
14people here are crazy, you know
LOL! Iconic imagery right there ^_^
It wouldn't be Doctor Who without it :3
14you learn self-defence one day, and then you realize that 9/10 people around got a knife. So you also need to learn to disarm them
Who is streaming
14<.<
OtakuTom: Very true.
Ironicly, I think my faveorite weapon in Skyrim is the sheild. They actually have slo-mo kill cams too!
Crossbows in the new expansion for Skyrim. At long last
Phase4 is streaming
Going AFK for a bit
AGIAN!

FairysHuff: im getting a full size molestia body pillow plushie!
/me shrugs
Probably against other people
e_e
But I know that I'm not up to par with other black belts
Bronysith: LOL ^_^
Bronysith: ._.
Okay, I've gotta go for now. I'll be back in about an hour and a half :)
/me glomps OtakuTom

I already have a medium size Bubbles Plushie from PPG.

trollhunter: power puff girls.
trollhunter: power puff girls
mmmm Steak and chips(fries)
ok cool
/me blinks
I WANT STEAK AND FRIES!
It's a fairly nice day outside. I want to go out and find a place to relax. But I would prefer to have someone to snuggle with while out there.
damn you all for making me hungry.
14well, as long as you can defend yourself well, I think you are fine
What can I say? I'm an affectionate person
Bronysith, ccant eat that.
/me shrugs
DRAKE
04"failed" meaning...?
/me hugs NS
FairysHuff: my very special somepony is on opposite coasts with me
Red = ded.
I'm not affectioate. But most of you know that already
04And if you failed maths I'm surprised your mum didn't go apeshit on you.
/me hugs Om
Bronysith: Atleast they are in the same country. All my friends are in different countrys ^_^
^
I'll eat you >.>
Om: All you need is love Om. *Cuddles*
FairysHuff: i havent even held her in my arms yet. i really want to meet her
e_o no. thanks
Hmmm, Om. What's this?
Ninjazz: Well.
uhhh
Ninjazz: Om doesn't like being touched. Which is why we are touching
Ah.
language
-___-
Drake, I got 41/100 for my mark
lmfao
Om: Was about to make an innuendo but thought nah better not ^_^
Where was Gondor when Om was touched by somepony other than GilDash?
I think I already caught the inuendoes here...
Om: Thats strange cause there weren't any to begin with.
Ninjazz: They didn't light the fire.
14I failed economics
14:D
Om: Your dirty mind working overtime again ^_^
04ouch
04I thought you were good at maths NS
did i just see a rarity?
14I don't know if your school system is screwed up like mine, but if you fail just one school object and you fail its test on September it means that you have failed the year as well
FairysHuff: No, overtime is when they convince my fingers to say them
Dark_Horst: yes you did
Actually thats an interesting social aspect. People who assume anything involving any type of physical contact must be sexual in nature.
Drake not on the topics that we did
hii
Thats something I've never understood.
And all of our marks are based off one god damned assessment tasks
FairysHuff: so is it sexual for me to want to hold my girlfriend in my arms?
class crap doesn't count for anything
Why can't cuddles be cuddles and nothing more?
that entire mark was based off my first assessment's mark which i screwed up
hey pony_3587
^
Aye.
I wouldn't say that, but half true.
:)
Bronysith: I don't know. Do you have sexual intentions? If so then yes.
FairysHuff: no. ijust never had a girlfriend before
I just don't like being touched e_e is that so wrong?
FairysHuff: and i want to hold her in my arms to know this is real
Bronysith: Ah well then since this is your first you will have sexual thoughts and desires no matter what you do. Can't be stopped ^_^
Om: It's not wrong. I just find it amusing to tease you ^_^
FairysHuff: i dont want sex. i just want a relationship
emotional relationship
arg /)_-
mfw FairysHuff is Gils in disguise.
Bronysith: You'll still have the thoughts and feelings. It's innevitable. You can't control your genetic drives.
Gillysuit is sick, soooo
00,02mmmmm
00,02food
Om, then someone had to fill in.
No no no. That is quite alright.
so, these ponies a custom mod?
game mode or something?
14:(
/me slaps Phase4 and takes his pizza
00,02:<
Somepony is always willing to fill in. Doesn't matter who, just that someone will. =__=
Dark_Horst: I think they were made by god.
BACK :)
Ninjazz: I don't like that rule.
who'S playing btw?
Dark_Horst: me
Om, it's the cycle of life. =__=
specify: who are we watching paly
Dark_Horst: Phase4
Phase4
Ninjazz: It can cycle elsewhere
Dark_Horst: I want to but my computer is to slow :<
Om, it rather that it didn't and just laugh at us. :<
what lag loot?
too slow for t2? how does that even work
Bronysith: May I ask how old you are?
FairysHuff: 18
Dark_Horst: It's 9 years old :<
holy shite
my computer
It does like to flex that metephorical diafragm
Dark_Horst: IKR? I'm saving for a new computer :<
Bronysith: Well don't make the relationship mistakes I did. ^_^ Make sure you and your girlfriend are completely and totally honest with eachother and talk out everything rather than argue.
FairysHuff: well first i want to meet her. shes in california while im in georgia
*Face Hoofs when thinking of all the stupid mistakes he's made in the past*
08,01my god, i'm so tired
the feeling is mutual
08,01time for a very strong cup o' tea
08,01thank celestia i can work from home...
FairysHuff: At least you learned something form making mistakes :$
/me 08,01lies on FairysHuff as his kettle boils
Om: Yeh... it's just took me over 12 years to learn them ^_^ Uuuuugh.... so much face hoofing.
BRB EVERYPONY i need to take a shower
08,01Ponies47: i've been trying, but my body doesn't seem to understand the conept of night
FairysHuff: Cover it with a pillow :\
give that pizza back to Phase4 bronysith
Om: Huh?
so you can facehoof into the pillow xD
08,01i actually went to bed at a decent time last night
Throws a pillow at Om
Om: aaah ^_^ heh
08,01just after 1am
Nuu ill fall asleep e_e
08,01Ponies47: my 9-5 job is now 12-8
FairysHuff: Sory if I make little to no sense at times. Not running on much brainpower anymore
A lesson I learned about relationships. Always make sure your otherhalf knows you can't read their minds and get them to talk everything out.
Om: Tis fine. I will occassionally go crazy just for the fun of it.
It is quite fun...
Another extremely important relationship lesson. FREAKING RELAX!!!!! O_o
ReLAAAAAAAAAAAX!
Om: Seriously ^_^
08,01a lesson I've learned about relationships: seducing your ex's new boyfriend is hilarious and fun

Swear kickers are now off.
04NS you're a bad influence.
lol
04Also sorry for the late reply.
I've been told that several times
08,01nota bene: this generally only works if you're on good terms with your ex, and they are polyamorous
by you of all people
FairysHuff: I know, I have read...Some book...about it... oy...Twi moment /)_-
anyway
what were you saying, Drake?
BRB
04Denying that you were a bad influence me is tantamount to idiocy.
08,01FairysHuff: see the nota bene
hurr
Oh yeah Drake
Have you read Othello?
04How'd you screw up your assessment task?
04Nope.
04I've been reading Brothers of Blood from the Dragonkeeper series.
04Book 4 hellyesssss
what's the enforer?
bleh, relationships...
^
Dragonkeeper has a 4th book? WHAT?
04ayup
04recently released
o___________-o
woooooah
okay
^^
I want to get I, Iago and Iago: A novel first
also I'm doing an Othello viewing task at school
Something I don't think people understand is that physical contact is only sexual when theres sexual intent in the persons mind whos initiating it. Otherwise it's just friendly affection.
and I'm playing Iago
04My school librarian was just like "Hey, I know you like this series so I thought I'd tell you about the sequel"
04lol
The west has become overly sensitive to such things
who's basically a manipulating, "evil" villain
in the play
BACK :)
No kidding.
04I figured
Basically in my part
04since you drone on about him all the goddamn time and seem to be in love
08,01FairysHuff: or in the one who is not initiating it
I have to play 3 different "faces" of him
04Asexually, platonic love. Somehow.
*Noms on Wonka Bottle Caps*
1. When he's alone doing his soliloquys
04I'm not sure how that works though.
08,01if you hug me and i smile slyly at the boner it's given me, it's probably sexual
2. When he's with another soldier guy, being all blokey
3. When he's with Othello, being serious and "honest"
So
I'm not an actor
o__o
>.>
I'm going to have fun failing
what??
Anyway
piano time
an then there's people who dont feel comfortable getting hugged by random strangers

@ Drake
xD
'tis true though
08,01i hate that fact that physical contact is mostly seen as sexual in this society
I've had lengthy discussions with him about various Shakespeare play
04hurr
plays
:}D
but hey
I dont hug at all, its not common to hug friends over here, only girl/boyfriends.
08,01i can cuddle with my friends without it being sexual at all
Hamlet and Othello plays are <3
04Shakespeare is only fun for me when we do tragedies.
I'm in the middle of King Lear
Yes
Only hug when drunk.
04.u.
His trag-
haha
04I'm Petruchio
04I get to be the @$$hole :D
I should read that one
08,01hell, one time when i had sex it was completely non-sexual.
Apparently it's pretty good
The important thing to do is reject the common social view of physical affection and form your own. Then act on it.
14I did the theatral version of Othello twice
14as Iago
14:D
How is that even possible?!
Lucky, Viri
04I did your mum
04twice
I'm playing Iago in Act IV Scene I
/me dies
08,01Informant_Pony: we were both very drunk
where Iago has like, 3 different faces
14lol
when he's alone, when he's with Cassio, and when he's with Othello
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I'm not an actor so fun
non sexual sex sounds like dry water tbh.
pfft relationships *Noms on more Wonka Bottle Caps*
14I remember it was tedious as hell
But I have a unique brain ^_^
14but also very fun
sex without affection is another thing.
And you like... uhhhh, let's just... you know?... Uhh... or something? How does that work?!
08,01Alchemist: well, mostly is was just trying to be ironic
08,01*i
04There's like 4 or 5 people holding the class together for me.
08,01so it's not entirely true
04No one else cares about acting their parts :'D
04People say I should have gone into drama class.
04I take it as a compliment
Well you made my brain implode.
Yeah Viri
Iago is an awesome character
favourite shakespeare villain
*Explodes*
14I remember I made people laugh when I was rubbing my hands and talking to the public xDD
08,01however, there is a guy in Edinburgh who i'm friends with, and it's completely impossible for us to have sex, because we're both too silly
lmfao
*Respawns*
I don't see Iago as rubbing his hands
Well another piece of advice. Only have sex with someone you truly care for. That way it will actually mean something and won't be boring as hell to the point you fall asleep during >_>
STILL GOT IT! :p
Chat has become sex. O__O
I see him as slightly excited... sorta, and very very confident
FairysHuff, TRUE DAMN STORY.
14there was a part of it while he was talking to Othello
the one where he goes "Now will I talk to Cassio about Bianca"
"He, when he hears of her / cannot refrain from the excess of laughter"
/me has nothing to add to the conversation xD
*Curls up in a ball and starts sucking on hoof over all this talk*
08,01the first time we tried, he asked me to talk dirty (which i'm terrible at), and i ended up pinning him down and whispering "now bake me a cake, bitch" into his ear
08,01FairysHuff: i do
WallDives: I learned that lesson the hard boring way ^_^
its the time of night when the chat turns to sex
14lol
:D
FairysHuff, me too >.>
14maybe slightly different screenplay x3
14also hi HML
08,01inb4 FairysHuff lives in scotland too and knows who i am from that story
*Keeps sucking on hoof over all this sex talk*
Mfw
where is everyone from
"As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; and his unbookish jealousy / will prove Cassio's gestures, smiles and light behaviours quite in the wrong"
08,01FairysHuff: awesome! where abouts in scotland are you?
trollhunter, united States.
not that part?
er
14uhm
Some island in the pacific ocean.
<- Wisconsin Brony right here ::)
Bad young Us of a
08,01nice
14I think I recall the jealousy and the laugh
1414/didinitalian
Australia for me
Hungary.
was it the one where he's like "Thus credulous fools are caught / and chaste dames even thus, all guiltless, meet reproach"
08,01i'm in the East just by St Andrews
where Othello-
OH
04ohai HML
the jealousy one?
that's Act III Scene III
04How the hell can you quote that
04Unless you're looking it up
14yes
04sneaky
08,01eeyup
14x3 Othello is quite interesting Drake
14read it :D
"O beware, my lord, of jealousy; 'tis the green-eyed monster that doth mock the meat it feeds on"
Drake I know these lines off by heart
14and make a WTF face when you read the ending
I love Iago's lines at the end
where he's like
*Throws a sandvich into the middle of the chat*
08,01FairysHuff: of course, i was just about to ask if you wanted to meet ^.^
I'll be sure to keep what I have learned in mind, if the situation ever occurs.
"Demand me nothing; what you know, you know. / From ere forth I will never speak word."
grab sandvich
04that's
04what
and "I bleed, sir, but not killed." *smirk*
08,01FairysHuff: do you know Sketchy Sounds from EFR?
Om: And what have you learned?
I know some of hamlet too, though considerably less
04Shakespearean plays confuse me, since each new line has a capital letter.
08,01ah, okay
14yeah, he was such a b*****d in the italian translation
04Sometimes I get around it but I usually don't
14that's why I liked it
14<3
08,01he lives in Dundee
"To be, or not to be. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream."
08,01i tend to hang out with him a fair bit
I love that part in Hamlet
And yes, Iago is a bastard everywhere
14pfft, try reading the italian translation of that time
but he's so awesome
14everytime I discover new words xD
08,01you don't happen to be going to BUCK this summer, do you?
04I now know where "perchance to dream" comes from.
FairysHuff: Well I know this aint a test. Bunch o' stuff about what not to do. And that you live in ireland
watch Parker Production's 1995 film version of Othello, Viri
Kenneth Branagh as Iago <3
Anyway piano

08,01FairysHuff: ah, okay
08,01well, i guess scotland is the right place for you
08,01there's no sunlight
trollhunter: Guess I'm just gonna ahve to wait until she goes to work in about 2 hours :<
*have
No sunlight?
Hmmm.
14I think 50GB monthly might be enough
Om: Other than in summer Scotland is usually overcast all year
14but I'd be paranoid everyday about not having enough left for the next days xD
ponies47: that sucks
FairysHuff: ...seriously?
FairysHuff: I kinda like overcast
lol
Om imagine a slate grey roof of unbroken cloud. Thats Scotland mostly all year round.
04aye
trollhunter: Yeah. I all got is Wonka Bottle Caps but all that's left is cherry flavor. Candy is not a good breakfest :<
hey XAX did you just get on
Ohai XAX :)
FairysHuff: I can imagine that. Sounds a lot more stable then the weather I am used to
XAX: Yus seriously ^_^
Nah been here for an hour or so :(
Om: Oh it's not stable at all ^_^
Hai everyone, I guess.
Ponies47; well make it count
IM BACK everypony
trollhunter: Okie doki loki. Don't really like cherry flavor but it will ahve to do. Atleast I got plenty of water bottles in my room :)
FairysHuff: Probably not, but I used to live in a very fun place for weather xD
*have
Om: if you love violent wind and rain you'll love Scotland.
Ohai Bronysith :)
14x_x I don't think that letting new posts from Forum Games show up in "Recent Posts" is a good idea
sorry XAX you just havent said anything in abit
14it'd be nicer if you could control which sections to include there, maybe the most interesting for you x3
trollhunter: It's alright :)
FairysHuff: Never have been fond of wind, but havent really lived with out it xD I was talking more along the lines of drastic changes in temerature
14my opinion, of course
Om: Though because of global warming I've noticed a distinct change in the weather in the past 20 years ~_~ This saddens me.

*Glomps Bronysith with the superglomper6000* :)
08,01but seriously, how about you come to st andrews? it's accessible by train (get off at Leuchars), but the bus is bitchingly expensive to get in from the station
I don't like the sound of the word lube sounds weird.
Om: lube. TROLOLOLOLOLO :p

Computing tech moves far to fast to keep up with. It's changing all the time.
14Lighty :3
08,01ah, you probably have a touch of OCD too, then
13Viri :3
08,01or am i getting it confused with aspergers?
08,01i know that one of them is the one where you need routine and don't like change, as one possible symptom
Hang on. I'll link you.
http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/autism-and-asperger-syndrome-an-introduction/what-is-asperger-syndrome.aspx
14how are you? ^^
08,01i've often thought that i might have mild aspergers. i certainly fit the profile, but i've never wanted it confirmed or diagnosed, as it doesn't really affect me in a negative way, and i don't want to be labelled
08,01plus, with me, it's probably just neuroses, and not actually aspergers
08,01though i have no idea
Hey Bromies :D
08,01i tend to force myself to do the opposite of what my brain tells me to, in regards to social interaction
08,01so i end up being pretty sociable, but sometimes things can trip me up (being so tightly wound, because i'm forcing the social behaviour on myself) and make me run away from social interactions (sometimes literally)
FairysHuff: i always thought that it was my fault that i couldnt be social. im just glad the thing i have has a name
08,01to be perfectly honest, i'm more convinced it's the neuroses is growing up with a twin brother
08,01*of
Bronysith: What is it you have?
FairysHuff: autism
08,01FairysHuff: aye, i know what you mean; but to be honest, i love it
Bronysith: What level?
*Tiphoofs away from Alicorn_Prince_Shane*
08,01hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane

08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: about to be pinked
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: You don't wanna knowwhat time it is :P
I was pinked last night! :d
08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i totally will
and chat derped for me
morning, everypony! :) *yawn* how are we all doing today?
Ponies keept saying I was a ware Pinkie :<
/me glomps Sylandest
Aaaah dyed hair. I miss my shocking pink hair with dark blue tips.
08,01i mean, one of the symptoms of aspergers is an inability to understand jokes
08,01and... well, who here would say i'm not a funny person?
/me hugs Bronysith1
morning Sylandest
morning, Om! :)
*always
08,01FairysHuff: ah, don't worry; i grew up with an indian mother, so i'm used to difficulties in humorous communication
08,01ha! yes, it certainly was
FairysHuff: i guess thats why ive had a hard time getting a grilfriend really
08,01the indian sense of humour is very different to the british
I don't have any head things that I know of. I'm just a tad crazy
13tired, as always you?
thats much better
08,01FairysHuff: then we will get along just swell
Bronysith: I know what you mean. All my relationships have failed badly before my diagnoses.
Om: one tip: dont try to analyze yourself based on wiki articles. If you really want to know if there is any condiction you have better see a doctor about it :)
FairysHuff: i feel really uncomfortable really going out
Bronysith: Your not the only one ~_~
08,01FairysHuff: yes! my god, those are hilarious!
08,01have you seen any of Tim Minchin's stuff?
08,01oh, also
/me hugs Bronysith and FairysHuff
Alchemist: Pah, what does the internet know? And doctors for that matter, they have almost never been right the first time =_=
08,01Simon Amstell's stand-up is absolutely hilarious
Well it is Tim Allrn
There's somepony for everypony out there :)
*Allen
14x3 I'm ok. Pain is going away

FairysHuff: :D all to cheer up the day! hehe
FairysHuff: dragoncon. it is going to be so awesome /)^3^(\

Hey, how's about a wanna have a pizza pie>?
Alchemist: I suppose thats good xF
xD*
14body xP gym workout was very hard last time
14arms, chest, legs, sides..
13ouwwie
I recently bought a pen camera to keep me safe when out and about. I have been badly bullied as a child and physically assaulted by strangers as an adult. So makes me even more nerouvs to go out or be around others.
FairysHuff: thats why i carry a katana
So if anything happens again atleast I will have video evidence of it for police.
00,02last round for me
It makes me feel a little safer. Though having someone with me would be better
FairysHuff: dont you have a close circle of a few friends you can go out with?
Alchemist: No. I'm completely isolated. All my friends are online.
FairysHuff: thats not good... :(
FairysHuff: know this my friend
FairysHuff: you are never alone
14especially chest xP
14I couldn't cross my arms xDD
Alchemist: I find it hard making and keeping friends as people find it hard being around me.
FairysHuff: Mine are all online now
FairysHuff: what Bronysith said. You're never alone :)
08,01Phase4: all the time
FairysHuff: i will always be with you through the force. Use my strength, share with me
13i cant cross my toes when im too long in the cellar without thick clothes
08,01mostly on the internet
00,02...how
Bronysith ^_^ lol thanks.
14o.o
FairysHuff: no im serious
FairysHuff: like-minded people too?
08,01but some people see me from behind, and are very shocked when i turn around and show off my massive black beard
I WUB ALL OF YOU! <3
/me wubs Ponies47 also :)
Wooo must get some sleep, Later everyone
08,01also, anyone in the UK who would like to sell stuff: http://ukofequestria.co.uk/attachments/buck-poster-v3-png.1663/
i wub you too Ponies47
Night night TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
Alchemist: Yes. My mind works in almost complete logic and i can't read the social and body language cues others can. This strains friendships for people who can.
dawwwwww so much wub :)
Alchemist: Yes. And I am not ashamed to admit that I am scared shitless about it ^_^ LOL
Alchemist: But it all about controlling my fear as best I can.
08,01# a simple mare living simple dreams / a rumour that's not quite as it seems #
Sylandest: True. But like most people with Aspergers I am Fluttershy incarnate. ie very quiet. Makes first meetings awkward.
EVERY PARTY NEED'S A POOPER! THAT'S WHY WE INVITED YOU! PARTY POOPER PARTY POOPER! :p
FairysHuff: I dont really know what to say to encourage you, so Ill just shut up and hope the best for you :)
08,01FairysHuff: don't worry about it too much; i'm so chill that penguins flock to me
08,01i have been known to wear polar bears.
man i suck at team fortress but ehh it's still fun to play
Alchemist: It's fine. Don't worry. You don't have to encourage me. ^_^ I've learned so many lessons over the years that I think I may finally have a philosophy that I can act on.
08,01hence the saying: "wow, this curry is great! what's in it?" "bear meat."
DAFUQ YOU SAY ABOUT RARITY?!
08,01cow334: meat from a bear
GET OUT OF MY PC DERPY
Ninjazz: what-what?
08,01cow334: bearly
Ninjazz: Look who decided to return
Grrr. Nvm.
08,01cow334: why not?
Om: he reawakens, hehe :D
I have been a bad pony. I stay up to late :(
One thing I think everyone should know about me. I HATE drama.
08,01FairysHuff: never run a convention, then
FairysHuff: I treid to think of something whitty to say, but my mind kept drifting to cats and watermellons
Om: Witty and funny huh? How about BUTT CHEESE!
Om is that good. Plus I just farted again.
Om: what is this "garlics stuff" Nin is telling me about?
FairysHuff: but cheese is moldy :(
Sylandest: I made something up~
I'm gonna go AFK for the enxt hour or so. I gotta fake sleep so mom doesn't see I was being abad pony and staying up late. BYE ALL!
Om: yes, but what did you make up exactly? I'm curious, lol
Om: Brie Butt ^_^ heheh..... I laugh at my own jokes.
*next
ROSE! NO!!!!!!
laters Ponies47
*a bad
FairsHuff: same here. She made a big deal out of nothing but it later turned out that it was because she had a problem with our relationship but instead talking about it she canned her feelings, lashing out occasionally, and eventually cheating on me.
FairysHuff: Thats good!
Sylandest: Ask him.
14brb
00,02thats it for me tonight
Om, no you tell him.

I'll be back in about a hour or so. Gotta wait for mom to leave for work. :)

Bed? No I'm fake sleeping so mom doesn't see I've been being a bad pony! :P
08,01you eat pig meat?
08,01surely that's just as wrong?
FairysHuff: there are people like you and then there are people who NEED drama. Like those women who actually like arguing with their boyfrinds over nothing. Its a different world and I wont understand it either.
Ninjazz: You are right, so go tell him.
00,02not going to bed , just ending tf2 early
00,02might stream a video series from linux
08,01maybe it's only wrong if the animal is fluffy and cute...
Phase4: DR WHO!!!!!
Om, I don't remember.
Om: just tell me the story you came up with! XD
00,02Bronysith, dont have any downloaded
Sylandest: I tild him you had to consume much garlic for a rash xD
Om: whaa....how does that even work? :D
Someone should stream Big Trouble in Little China on here at some point in the future ^_^ Classic.
"Do i look like an out of bounds sorta guy?" man i love dr who
Sylandest: I'm not the one who took the story without a wink of convern
Oh crap... My mother has arrived in the house. >_> *Sigh*
Om: Not sure how I bough that one... :D
bought*
But there are some odd things in this world... So, meh.
xD
Ninjazz: It is me, after all. Sometimes the odd makes sense and the logical does not XD
I'm so freaking tired. ITS GREAT!
Om: then sleep! :D
Sylandest: If I sleep now I'll miss things @~@
Om: I missed out on seeing the end of Doom 3 last night, so now its your turn. XD speaking of which, I need a shower, so brb
My mother is so freaking loud with her normal talking voice I can hear everything she says all the way upstairs in my room. Please for the love of god STFU
Om: besides I read somewhere that after a certain point your body can produce a reaction to exhaustion which will make euphoric :D
Om: I know that feel.
Well I guess since i stayed up all night good morning every one
/me glomps cow334
08,01cow334: have you ever eaten rabbit?

00,02WallDives, nope, cant transfer them
Okay, I really like the fact that he gives the backstory on the characters, 'cause I'd have no clue who pretty much any of them are.

Group cornetto?
I wish i could speak english as well as wrek... but i'm horrible at speaking the "th" I just can't do it right :/
i approve of all orgies that may happen
I'm getting - no, DEMANDING a refund from TaoBao, 2 weeks after sending payment for the Derpy toy they had on site and they still are in processing phase - the seller can't get anymore but didn't bother telling me or sending me a refund until I sent them an email :|
Especialy if they involve ice cream

Oh and it gets better - They kept the page up, but changed the picture of the item to a different item
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5lhn22qEm1r8f79so2_1280.png
Orgies, icecream and bondage. Brilliant night out.

hiya ACS13123
alexxm: it's been good
Bought a preorder Derpy through ebay, seller lives in north Texas, seems alright, and offered a refund in the event he couldn't get ahold of them while at Comic Con next month
all I hear is CLICK CLICK CLICKETY CLICK CLICK CLICK.
and GLUG
and thus I KILLED THE CHAT
I never pick up the white weapons
I like Wrek's voice :)
Jim: you can sell them to pay for repairs at least
I found they were only worth like 10 coins or something
08,01pyrocatboy: link to the tumblr?
08,01i wanna see the rest of it
God, I remember when about 100 damage was HIGH in D2
08,01unless it's nsfw
08,01(if it is, pm it to me)
Is this hard mode or what?
now I'm seeing 5 digit damage numbers and the enemies STILL aren't dying
This is Hell difficulty I think
MadSurge: I think it's Inferno
otakon: equals the hardest difficulty?
Jim what are the difficulties and what would they translate into
MadSurge: I think so
You have Normal, then Nightmare, then Hell, then Inferno
thanks Jim
took me much consideration to get the pre order through ebay, cause I prefer sites like J-list where they only accept your payment when they have the item in stock and prepped to send to you
Oh god, can't imagine what's the hardest difficulty like D:
Which basicly translates to: Normal, hard, very hard and OH GOD WHY
bronyfunds got 160$ since this morning. Thats not bad right?
if they dont or can't get the item, your payment is left alone and nothing is sent
thanks Jim

Diablo 3 is 70% clicking
the hell?
What just happened.... What?
:p
Jim: more like 90% clicking and 10% looting
Can you move with WASD in Diablo3 and Dota 2?
Nope, you click to move
- why not?
I hate RPGs where I have to click to move
Because that's how the game is made
Why do I have this sudden urge to listen to iron maiden? O_o
Literally prevents me from playing a game
Lambo: yeah me too that's why I didn't like Diablo on the PC
Reminds me of Sacred - the furious clicking.
Is Diablo hard to defeat in tis game?
Hello bronystate

DIABLO HAS NO YOLO
Malavolent: In other words: "Sing us the song of your people"?
pyrocatboy: makes sense, since Tara does the voice for the heroine
Jim: You clever bastard, pretty much yes :D
|Discord|: Yes, there's Hardcore mode, where you only have one life
pyrocatboy: well, same voice actress :D
Please do never say YOLO again. YOLO is Carpe Diem, Memento Mori for dumb people

pyrocatboy: That is just wrong
Shit, I am afraid to play the last two chapters of Dead Space
pyrocatboy: it's okay, but needs a decapitated Spike's head on her hip
how come Lambo
Lambo: just do it
"Oh, you played so far? HERE! Have some invincible enemies"
Me: "Yeah, great idea."
Lambo: nah, it's not a very scary game :D
I wish I could purchase Dead Space 2 in german Steam Store...
Lambo: lol it's not THAT bad
Also sawing off the invincible fucker's legs slows him sooo much :D
Lambo don't worry it's just jump scares
alexxm: Actually, I kinda figured out the way they implement those. I can easiyl predict them now
So, now I have 2 copies of Amnesia, and I STILL haven't played it
/me confused about this click click click click...goes to Bronystate...ah they streaming diablo :D hey everpony good evening :)

otakon parents issue an ultimatum?
otakon good luck finding a job

what excuality has your sister been doing otakon
Wrek: There is no sound except for your voice
alexxm: well, she has an inheritence from a family friend that she isn't allowed to openly access until she's 24. My mom is the executor of the estate, and my sister keeps trying to get extra money for God knows what. She's blown through 40K in about 8 months with nothing to show for it really.

CountDoofus: link it

Wrek shoot him
No not me!

-_-
00,10Jusgeing by quality my guess is Wrek streaming
i was talking about the torch guy
Wrek: BOOOO
GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: you're new here aren't you ?
Yes
-_-
welcome to the herd
Welcome
Telling you, it looks like crap. I think it does, anyway. http://fav.me/d53kww6
/me glomps Sumica
CountDoofus: It's ok
00,10oof

hey derpy_pony what have you been up to
I'm back
Welcome back Panda|store!
evil and stuff, alexxm
hey Panda|store what did you get
Well, the highlights in Cadance's hair is off, the eyes look like shit, Armor's muzzle is too small, Cadance's wing is a sloppy "smash-it-on-and-erase-to-make-a-wing" job... and could go on and on.
Traditional FPS conventions have it that dark rooms are bad
Then again, I'm almost never happy with anything I make.
was that a face hugger
00,10ever notice most games when they do augmented vision bits it dosent realy help.
Sumica: eeeeeeyup
CountDoofus: To be completely honest the only thing that stick out is that their legs need a little more beef to them. But other than that it looks great.
Sumica halo odst did a good job with it
Sumica: except for deus ''My vision is augmented''
deus ex
the latter was linked to the spiders?
ladder? ladder
Spidereseseseses
00,10metriod prime is the only one I played that did a good job at it.
why does this song make this game creepier
Tha music is really setting the right mood for this game
:o Shizu stream! WITH FITTING MUSIC?! Ohyiisssss
Deus Ex has this really cool vision wich lets you see enemy trough walls. it's effective with the laser gun that can shoot trough walls
Singing in the rain... OF BLOOD! Muhahahaha!

I'm not bad thanks. (:
13screen on the desk
Gildash: yeah... i wish they would remaster doom 1 & 2 with the new engine.
Shizuka: game's ambient sounds are the only "scary" thing :D

Gildash: well yeah, but i mean using the new engine from the remastered version of doom 3.
dem spiders.
13the remastered doom 3?
Crono_brony: Maybe. They'd need to keep the mechanics the same though, or it wouldn't be the same. :S
GilDash! :$
13didn't look any different to me in the trailer
MadSurge: Me! :)
Gildash: Of course!
am i the only one who was reminded of face huggers by the spiders
13wrek trigger the baby thing
13opens a panel for ammo
I am back guys
Space Marines
that was a good episode of DR WHO
why do old show tunes make this game creepy
/me hums a merry tune
Which episode Bronysith ?
This music is most fitting and perfect yes.
Jim: season 2 episode 2
oh my, season 2 is so great
oh... this is a modded Doom 3 eh?

I am excited about the friday movie night!
Gildash: i actually work with the doom 2 engine and try to create fun zombie maps.
13ja wrek is using the same mods i am, bit different settings
13gotta get up in their face and meatshot them wrek~
/me giggles.
Crono_brony: It's been a long time since I played Doom 2. :D
i tried modding that game once... mods didnt even work, pissed me off
Puttin on the ritz!
So many options
00,10I want to go around slaughtering people to Shiny Toy Guns music
That's normal
Sounds like a plan Sumi

00,10I remember this part form shizu
I would never have guessed
Gildash: Yeah, i actually recreated minecraft in the doom2 engine... the mod was called "doomcraft"
that's pretty impressive for 450$
13i hate the modded imp sound, doesn't have any of the punch of the original
Is #derpy_hooves the real derpy hooves
13i found myself reflexively hitting right mouse a lot trying to melee things away X3
00,10all dem fancey guns and he uses that as a pistole
L4D style?
10Yay Acer
> cheaper than iPad
Jim: l4d2 style ftw
Bronysith
I always found myself running out of stamina when I first played this. Too used to the first 2 Dooms. :D
00,10I should pick up the new sins game
Shizuka: XD
13infrared is the better option for goggles since thermal is working off light levels, not heat
GilDash: The first 2 Dooms were so haying amazing.:)
Pew pew pew
13punch it!
LoyalDash: If I had them I'd still play them occasionally. :)
LadyCanary: That is the sound a gun goes, my son.
