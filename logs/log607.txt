LETS NAME HIM DOBBY
04Can we mention the Beatles version? :D
Gimli NC reviewed that. I still think this is a better version
how long is this again?
this version is 4 hours long
Is this the extended cut of Fellowship of the Ring?
11,02So, Dobby found a ring?

ohai Smeagol
Don't feed the trolls
OH NO
I sweear, I think "A Dog and Pony Show" was inspired by this xD
11,01There it is *points*
is this regular or extended?
Needs to be a 88 hour long movie
YAY HIS NEW NAME IS DOBBY
if this is the extended version its 4 hours
Gollum in this scene is hidden in shadows because at the time there wasn't a particular design chosen for his character
a 476 hour long movie
How about the William Shatner/Leonard Nemoy song?
Gandalf_The_Grey no, because that was never finished IIRC
extended apparently
Inby everyone spams my precious a thousand times during this thing
,
4.5 hours they were saying
my little rings fellowship is evil
discord returns
His new name is Dobby
do we or do we NOT mention the 1977 (animated) The Hobbit, because I hope we dont
or was it only 4?
stop pinging me!
A 3498723497349875 MILLION CENTURY MOVEH
So the ring ....rolled away from him?
dun dun dun
no a dog and pony show was inspired by "The Hills have Eyes" xD
he became a pollititian
How?
So this is going to be an annual thing on BronyState after last year.
omg it is 1:11 am in europe, i have to go to sleep
Noes the ring!
because it's sentient

Yay, my favorite wizard:D
HELLO MAGNETO!
Soupjuice: Don't shove your fucking opinion on others.
They're splitting Hobbit into three films right? Maybe if Bronystate is still around after all the films are out on DVD we'll probably have a full Tolkein week here
I'm pretty much as nooby to this as I am to Harry Potter. Never read the books or watched the movies, even though most of the internet is so familiar with it that spoiler rules might be null and void.
04He arrives precisely when he means to >:I
in my dreams,gandalf turns and incinerates him

That cart is so complicated and awesome
DA SHIRE

Best thing about this movie is how much Jackson did without using CGI
Faramir: shhhhh... you'll ruin his big entrance
Ladies and gentlemen, the acting talents of Ian MacCellan (sp?) will be performing the role of... Magneto
Faramir: From me. You're welcome.
Faramir: No, that's from the second
Dat house.

11,01Gimli: Read that last trivia bit at "flowing skirt"

Are you streaming all three back to back?
12,1Sauron: lawl
They must have used some CGI
Andy Serkis is best Golum.
Gandalf_The_Grey: one movie for day?

Twilight Sparkle.
Murky: No. Just one a day
Dumbledore+Gandalf=Dumbledalf, The Head White Wizard

Apparently the tower is actually the clock tower in Birmingham uni

12,1Murky: HELL NO! Why the hell would we kill ourselves doing that?! are you nuts? We show one film a day.
CUSTOM PONY RACE IS BEST RACE
And it doesn't loook like it does in the film. :P

The villagers are approaching.
I gotta buy this version of the movie.
this movie is a great background noise for League of Legends :D
12,1I love the extended cut. In the Theatrical cut, it felt real rushed and jumbled because of the rather novice editing job to trim the film down.
how did they manage to make that pipe?
Or now
Just 4 more months until we see that story
aww
What year was this released?
MAGIC!
Hobbit children, nothing cuter in all of Middle Earth

12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Hobbiton was made a year before production began to make it look like it was a natural, lived-in place, complete with real vegetable patches. The greens department regulated the length of the grass by having sheep eat it.

12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the birthday party, when Bilbo is naming various hobbit families, he says "Proudfoots" and a hobbit calls back "Proudfeet", with his large feet in the foreground. The shot was deliberately framed to imitate the shot used in The Lord of the Rings, as an homage to the film that introduced Peter Jackson to J.R.R. Tolkien's works.

12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Usually on a feature film, when the director comes to view the dailies, there's about 20-25 minutes of footage to be seen.

Gimli: I'm glad I have a gold membership
RivaLz: actually Bilbo resisted it longer, over 50 years
Congratulations Frodo, you're the mr. Underhill now

the problem is that they misquoted the last line in their response
The first tower.

12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scream of the Ringwraiths is actually Fran Walsh, the co-writer and co-producer of the film.
Great Hunter for the Ring who can sense it across the land: Get's distracted by cabbage.
They stopped him just in time.
Gimli: lol how did she do that?
And none of the original voice actors are in the game
he hates it with a passion....fruit
00,10Riders on the storm
Man, I was bitten by a mosquito about 15 minutes before the movie.
12,1I wish they kept Tom Bombadil, but honestly, he really WASN'T important to the story other than filler...
The power of darkness compels you.
04I thought it was the Ringwraith being so evil that the insects and other creepy crawlers were drawn to his evilness
05,15Tom was just filler.
0,14also, the game would be a dating sim
ow
0,14WITH ALL THE SHIPPINGS
0,14ALL
0,14THE
0,14SHIPPINGS
05,15So, I'm okay with him being absent
YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM DEATH PONY! :[
11,01Only two shippings.
All the shippings?
Tom does give a significant amount of foreshadowing about later events.
bk
Gandalf_The_Grey: Nope they are running away
The movie would've been a laughingstock if the Bombadil part was left in
11,01The rest will be day-one DLC.
Rohan theres already one like that made by pokehidden
Wow, almost 1 hour already?
frodo
so otakon would be in the game?
Rohan clean your mouth, you are drolling
12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: One of the stuntmen dislocated a shoulder in the scene where the Hobbits tumble down off the road to escape one of the Ringwraiths. This was also the very first day of shooting.
11,01Premium DLC.
Gimli no offense but from what i heard he's part in the book was just out of nowhere and never really explained
Plus, it's fun to speculate about what he really is.
fail
Tom Bombadil & Goldberry added some nice story, I thought
afKirz, lol
11,01Twidash is $5. Lyra x Bon Bon is $15.
Kandarihu: Oh yeah? Well I walked into a spiderweb, and found its host resting between my fingers.
I have to follow him.
afKirz as DLC
Sauron, if you don't buy it day one, you can't buy them later
Spell-of-gaming yeah LOTR is a 3hour movie
12,1alexxm: Which is why I wasn't TOO upset when they left him out of the movie.
05,15Two shippings, a straight and a same sex shipping, but the dialogue would be terrible and the ending of the romance wouldn't be satisfying
Appledash is 100000000000000000 bits
:O
0,14Sethisto x Trixie is day-1 ultrapremium DLC
Look out!

Oh man
well if i ask my grandma i can have his golden sword :|
12,1Didn't even ATTEMPT to fight back.
We should watch it on BMN sometime
You idiot, now they are going to kill you.
I remember this scene so well.
04But that's Frodo's character
oh man
11,01Stabby stab stab
he mad
HE MADE HIS WILL SAVING THROW!
05,15Despite the Bait and Switch, I loved MGS2
but his AC was too low...
04He's supposed to be the most innocent creature you'll ever come across in Lord of the Rings
staaaaaaab
Frodo's a pussy through the entire series.
Suddenly Aragorn.
:O
then frodo dieed, the end
12,1Eh, good point, I guess.
dat power
He attempts to use the ring to hide from them, only to realize it only makes him more visible to them.
Frodo's weakest class
CriticKitten: he's basically a sheltered child
What sorcery is this?
GG, Frodo.
12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Aragorn battling the Ring Wraiths at Weathertop was Viggo Mortensen's very first day on set. It was also the first time that Mortensen had ever handled a sword.
Nazgul take critical damage from fire!
Fire, BAAAD!
FIRE BAD.
kill it with fire
He's a freaking Hobbit, what do you want from him
owww my face
fire fire fire!
CRITICAL HIT!
its burns!
Good thing Viggo is a lunatic.
where wa gonfdor when the wraiths almost killed frodo?Oh wait....aragorn was there
DEMENTOR?
So I guess Aragorn is a GW2 ranger who prefer a 1H Sword / Torch combo?
or at least try to
owned
And that's how a real human king shows how it's done!
I do believe I'm on fire.
I wana be a ranger when I play D&D again
HEADSHOT
KILL HIM WITH FIRE
0,14I should, at one point in my life, pick up the MGS HD collection
kill em with fire
oh men
ded ded ded ded
Aragorn is so OP
0,14play 2 and 3
11,01If I had a capture card and working PS3, I would stream MGS4.
05,15Next time I play Neverwinter Nights....Ranger time
0,14and then burn the disc
ded ded ded ded ded ded ded ded ded.
Dang
:O NWN!
05,15or Baldur's Gate. Whichever I get to first
love that game
0,14and then skip right to Revengeance
04Riders has a point too. Hobbits aren't exactly courageous creatures, in fact I think it's stated as such throughout the films
Aragorn is OP cause he is King...
He's hurt.
Torch in the face!
MEDIC!
Samwise_Gamgee: sadly the DnD Rangers suck compared to Aragorn
If by "1H sword" you mean "2H sword in one hand", yes.
and then burn the people
Why do people I talk to always confuse hobbits with rabbits
/me mashes his E key
Wait, what happened to him?
MEDIC!
Well what did I miss?
Take him to MEDIC!
DOKTOR!
Reikim butthurt bioware fans
dr fluttershy help
MEDIC
I heard that as "Elvis Medicine"
Quickly! Bring him to the white peoples!
we need a dispenser over here!
Ah, I see.
This theme reminds me of a game, but I don't remember what
Cuts back to evil lair.

12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Orc blacksmiths shown beneath Isengard are actually the WETA Workshop staff who made the weapons used in the film.
05,15I'm not sure why, but it's impossible to run a stream, my PS3, and my capture card at the same time. :(
I would be interested if, say, Valve bought EA nd thus Mass Effect.

Butterfly.
Something like Star Wars, but not quite
Hi,miyagi-gandalf
Gimli, are you saying that some kids never weild wooden swords in childhood?
kay*
Giant weta?
Murky: In the context of GW2, you can't hold a 2H in one hand, and the 1H fit his combat style there better. Thus the joke. :P
My god I keep getting ads over the stream and I have AdblockPlus on
Reikim you see clearly now the rain is gone?

JakyBoy: Team Fortress 2
*tries to catch it*

AttacktheAndalite, get adblock super plus ultimate xtreme edition
Gimli: do you have one on the moth?
maaaaaahhhhhhh fooooooooooooddddddd
Kill the Trees.... use them as weapons!
12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The moth that Gandalf whispers to was born shortly before filming that day, and died soon after the scene was finished.
yuk..
Riders: he's been up on that tower for six months, he MUST be hungry
NO!
d3rb: lolo nice try~
Aww
:) Yay
Gimli: a'www
Gimli: Aww :(

Gimli: ur making this up now arent u?

The bad guys are born from mud. True story.
Gimli: Did it have a name?
What the fuck is that?!!!
And that's were baby orcs come from.

12,1Colt_45: Nope.
OohShiny: actually Radagast the Brown is more like FLuttershy
Gimli: And the Oscar goes to... Dragonfly!
It's to show how truly evil they are.

Wow. Non-cast production staff being cast as extras. That's pretty economical.

Yes.
05,15Uruk-Hai, SUPER ORCS. And they use Trees to make them
CriticKitten: Nope, they are humans that are converted
isnt that count dooku?
Gimli: Well, you could say it was the role of it's life.
looks like anakin
Mash that space bar, Frodo! *ME3 reference*
RainbowGuy: yh but JRR never explained HOW Saruman made the Uruk-Hai
and thats were babbies come from
brb
we need to stream Blackadder sometime
Spazturtle: Elves, you mean?
I believe...Uruk-Hai were once elves. And...somehow they turn into orcs. I feel like I read that somewhere.
Born from trees? So are the Uruk-Hai like evil dryads?
His eyes are so blue.
.
^
frodo had watched "robot seizers"
Uruk-hai the original half orcs.
what did they use for the ork breaking out - plastic bag? rubber?

Blackadder?
CriticKitten: Yeah

In short, he's dying.

05,15Gandalf_The_Grey Orcs were.

I'm about to die too, speak softly at me... :'(
no,really?
gimli trolls + orcs = urukhai
Gimli: Goblins.

"Damn it, Frodo! Stay with us! DON'T HEAD TOWARD THE LIGHT!"
Oh my
where do you learn all this stuff, Gimli?
Into the White.... PART 1
pointy ears and all
no? aww.
yes
dat eyes
mr bean
11,01Sadly, I don't think Valve will buy EA unless Valve delists EA from the stock markte.
Mr. Bean is quite amusing.
is so much win
Orcs were once elves, Goblins Dwarves, Uruk-Hai Men, and Trolls SPOILERS.
11,01*et
Soupjuice: he reads up on it.
perfect timing
11,01*market
Arwen is real.
no frodo, don't go into the light
Damnit Rainbow Dash, down in front
soo elves are medics?
George Takai likes ;)
PitViper: actually goblins are just small elves
exactly as i thought! HEHHEHEHAHHAHA
He had too much pipe weed
get to the chop....river!
PitViper: No spoilers. Even if there was a spoiler tag.
PitViper: Goblins are what Hobbits call orcs and small orcs.
11,01Or Valve just buys a majority share.
Agent Smith!
pony!
So who's this lady again? It's been a while since I've been through this series.
Don't drop Frodo, okay.....
PitViper: I'm pretty sure the Uruk-Hai are a perfected form of orcs, which in turn are former elves.
well im back
Rarity
and actually there is no Troll spoiler
12,1Michael: Elves know natural medicines better than anyone else in Middle Earth, hence they are much better at healing than any other species.
I'll send ponies for you.
Whoops, i drooped him..
00,02aparently... whats his name who wrote the books was a linguist, and all the languages in the book were fully defined
ya go pony
oh my
05,15yup
Reikim: Arwen, daughter of Elrond.
12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), who is trilingual in English, Spanish, and Danish, requested the script be revised to let Aragorn speak more of his lines in Elvish.
I want to learn Elven
wait, wouldnt going to the light be a good thing seeing as light=elves and elves=healing and crap?
Gimli: IKR
Phase4: j.r.r tolkien was a linguist yes
12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Elvish language lines spoken in the film are not just quotes from the book, they were derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's own limited dictionary of that language. Dialect coach Andrew Jack used actual recordings of Tolkien reading his books to guide the actors' pronunciation.
It is up to you pony. Save Frodo.
00,02Gimli, bit hard to read that blue
RUN, RARITY, RUN!!!! Dx
that is because they are so avesome
*awesome
Also, yes, Tolkien actually invented a language. He did that first, and THEN built a world around it.
You can do it!
Dovah: yes, thus Frodo is crossing over to the shadow
DEATH PONY!!
pony ftw
It's the Shadowbolts again Dx

Boromir They said pipe weed though
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The voices of the Black Riders (Heard when they reach the shire, before Gandalf returns, and when Arwen carries Frodo across the river) were provided by Andy Serkis, the voice of Gollum.
Gandalf: Weren't you ontop of a tower?
11,01Sumica has best pings.

omg adfs
he should uppercut bilbo for leaving him the ring tbh
lowfn, me
Gimli, actually what gandalf rides out of isengard is a Giant Eagle, they are highly intelligent creatures
04I have to say, about the coolest, most badass thing Hugo Weaving ever did was the role of Agent Smith in the original Matrix
:)
One does not simply enter mordor.
/me takes the cure and it crumbles in his hand
friends
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Although David Bowie was said to be keen on playing Elf Lord Elrond, the part went instead to Hugo Weaving.
yay its bilbo
Bronysith
1,11...
:D
right now i am content with the hilarious hitchikers guide to the galaxy
1,11oh god.
back to the future
I am disappoint
1,11David Bowie...
Damn you Bronysith, this is snake oil
No, technically they couldn't fly over. The eagles wanted no part in the affairs of the war from what I understand of the trilogy.
David Bowie as Elrond.
Great Scott, he's aged.
05,1510,5 how about this?
...no kidding Gimli.
The elven crotch bulge would have been fantastic.
David Bowie dear goodness :O
PonyStationVita: adblock
Azuredragon, AlienWarhead whatre you guys goin as?
OMFG David Bowie
its awesome because we are not even half way through :)
11,01Mica
Failing to read the one LotR book that's actually easily readable
/me slaps the shit out of IshSexiestPony s cancer
Dance Magic Dance.
The Nazgul would have fought the Eagles if they flew over Mt Doom
That looks terrible.
Unrelated: God that's some ugly colouring.
Hugo Weaving is a boss. He MADE The Matrix what it is
/me punches Bronysith
They refused to fly anywhere near Mordor, let alone over it, IIRC
OHHH MY
oh
mai
lol
and thats how equestria was made
04If David Bowie played Elrond we'd have the Elves breaking into song every other scene
Reikim: i did read the lotr trilogy 3 times though
oooooooh my, what a wimp
Bilbo Baggins, he's only 3 ft. tall
:I
oh my
05,15I give up! I'll stay boring
lowfn maybe nostagic critic
cratorkid: test
LOL
Oh my~
so true
Well
1,11entrance into The Lonely Mountain.
The Eagles would haved had to fight Diamond Dogs with David B on the job
Bilbo likes to write Fanfics and Doujinshies. :P
so true.
oh my
dat music is lovely
Your current colour works fine.
You could always use the dirty rarity colours.
Gimli... David Bowie as Elrond... would he do a ... DANCE MAGIC DANCE?!?
:O
I'm goin as slenderman for Nightmare Night. :$
1,11If David Bowie played Elrond, we'd be spending this time discussing his crotch. -_-
lol david Bowie.
did someone say dirty?
lowfn lol ok
The elves would be singing 80s music instead of this wispy stuff they're singing now. =P
Gimli: Shhh, It's okay. :c The Movie Travia monster can't get you
04Noooooooooooo
David Bowie would be a decent Elf actually
INDEED GIMLI
My son....
>_><_<
Naughty > Dirty
damn...i'd like to read the hobbit again but i can't find my copy of the book
05,15Sexy dirty...or...you don't like her dirty
brb
Of course you're not like Bilbo, he is the greatest little Hobbit of them all
Maybe not Elrond, but...
At least it's better than rapping.
You mean David Bowie isn't already an elf?
Is there ever a point where music isn't playing?

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The water used on the Rivendell set was brought in and contained chlorine. The entire water system had to be water-proof so that the chlorinated water would not leaked into the ground and contaminate natural water. After shooting was finished, the water used was collected back.
RosePetal WRONG

Watching LotR on Bronystate, best day ever
SEAN BEAAANNN
Don't tell me about armies. I've led computer programs, owls, and Nazis into battle
So the Uruk-Hai are a perfected form of orcs that has been mixed with goblins.
04Nobody cares about Legolas
1,11Gandalf_the_grey: That's what I said.
And there's the reason why women decided to watch these films
04Oh shit, herro Gimli
It must be destroyed.
1,11hai.
SEAN BEAN
Oh I think girls like me watch action movies sometimes.
Legolas!

What is a man?

If I were Elrond I'd have pitched him into the volcano, ring and all.

Hey, Isildor, you're an asshole.

...So...Why didn't he kill him!?
owloysius, hi
Nostalgia Critic is a hack.

I agree with CriticKitten, Elrond just showed some serious lack of common sense there.
because he is a dumbdumb

What are the movies for tonight?
If it can cut the ring, it can cut your finger!
Do you know how sharp that sword is?

Can anyone bring me up to speed from the beginning of this movie?
ohh maiii
Reikim: Same way. They really didn't answer that problem, in fact the idea never came up. Which bugs me severely. The fact that they send the Fellowship by foot instead of eagles or at least horses is equally mind-blowing.

00,02no one's ever tried that before
waaaaaaaattttttt
I like you, Gimli. Taking the most direct route. Stupid, but to the point.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the council scene in Rivendell when the fate of the Ring is being decided, when Boromir makes his plea for the Ring to be brought to Gondor, the "Gondor theme" can faintly be heard; in "Return of the King", this theme is heard as a full orchestral piece. Composer Howard Shore didn't plan out that this Rivendell background music would develop into the "Gondor
1,11main theme" by the third film, but it ultimately did evolve into it.
We need 10 tons of tnt, a nuke, and a chicken to destroy it
"The SMIIIITH must be destroyed"
11,01You have only one choice, Mr. Anderson.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the Council of Elrond, leaves are continually falling in the background to suggest that this is a meeting that is taking place outside. This meant about half a dozen crew members were positioned above the set, dropping leaves at various intervals. This also meant that the production department had to collect sacks and sacks of leaves during autumn, and of
1,11course dead leaves turn brown fairly quickly. This also meant that every single one of those leaves had to be individually painted.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The large tree that stands above Bag End was built especially by the production department. Every leaf had to be manually attached.
Shit, four hours? I knew it was long, but jeez. Extetended edition?
aw man
11,01Fun fact, we didn't do intermissions for LotR last year IIRC.
He was Megatron, apparently.
Literally. People would die of exhaustion.
Like they did last time...
Wow.
Dammit, I wanna go get cigs, but it's raining outside
TALLY HO
00,10first movie is just shy of 4 hours long so yeah put in an intermition
stupid question, are we only watching the first movie or is this a crazy marathon of all 3?
04I don't think we did, Sauron
1,11Sauron: Correct. We didn't do Intermission...and it sucked. XD
11,01Yep.
04I think it was a straight shot all the way through

That's what I was wondering OohShiny
Sumica: Thanks.

You can play mann up with other people who are just playing normal, or so I hear.
BEEEEEEEESSSS
Riders: ?
To be honest intermission just means the film's going to finish later
04But it was a good "tired as hell"

Phase4, I'd assume it requires everyone to have a ticket. It's for access to official servers, and I didn't see anything about inviting others to the server.
MY BODY ISN'T READY YET!

1,11Eight of the nine members of the Fellowship got a small tattoo of the word "nine" spelled out in the Elvish script created by Tolkien. They got it at a tattoo parlor in Wellington, New Zealand, to commemorate the experience of the movie. The ninth member, John Rhys-Davies, declined and sent his stunt double in his place. Elijah Wood's tattoo is on his lower stomach. Sean Astin and
1,11Billy Boydhave the tattoo on their ankles (to commemorate all those hours in the hobbit feet).Orlando Bloom, who plays the archer elf Legolas, has his on his forearm. Ian McKellen's is on his shoulder. Dominic Monaghan's is on his shoulder. And the eighth member, Sean Bean, has his tattoo on his right shoulder. Viggo Mortensen has his tattoo on his left shoulder.

/me hugs otakon "Because I can"
Pink3: he first half
cookie: High five
04You know what I realized? In LotR all it took for the world to be like "Oh shit, Sauron's returned!" was for Gandalf to say as such
PinkiePieYoshi64 no intermision
Dang, stupid storm Dx
PinkiePieYoshi64: the firt half
ah, ok :D
How much of the film have we watched so far.

otakon: More than enough time! Trust me.
soo many emtpy beer cans and bottles - been an interesting week :)
actually,they had a few wars as a clue that sauron was returning
11,01Gandalf is Middle Earth's news anchor.
So another hour and a half left or so I'm assuming
05,15I DON'T WANNA GO BACK TO SCHOOL MONDAY
otakon: Of course you were randomly hugged~
13 minutes and counting
it's just,no one actually cared to much
one day luna will own a movie!
1,11Actually, Gandalf, the elves knew that Saruon returned long before Gandalf stated such, which is why they were leaving Middle Earth from the get-go.
04I find it slightly amusing how in Harry Potter all of the wizard world was like "NOPE! NO 'HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED' HERE! NO SIRREE!! NEVER!" until they actually *saw* Voldemort
Dear Luna... Why hath we not acquired this lovely soundtrack yet!
shoo be doo

muffins>cupcakes
1,11richfiles: I'd say roughly 3-4 hours long.
Starting my last year of college in 2 weeks
04@Gimli: It just makes me laugh how all of Middle Earth understood the gravity of Sauron returning and didn't try to exactly hide it, while all of the wizard world had proof for the first few movies but kept turning a blind eye
Is college years 11 and 12?
I had enough "fun" with my first two degrees. I don't see myself going back to college any time soon.
NEW MODERATORS?
I missed "By the Bay" didn't I?

1,11Gandalf: Actually, it was only the Ministry turning a blind eye, and the propeganda that they thrown out was WHY the rest of the Wizarding World didn't believe either.

/me laces the booze with hot sauce
You know what? A badass movie calls for a badass meal. Be back during showtime bronies, I'm making some French Toast.
oh god
13Gandalf_The_Grey: the super evil in the HP universe had only been gone for 11-14 years, so was still a fresh serious threat to be feared
sonicandmario85: Then prepare to be cultivated.
13Sauron was gone for thousands of years
13
o gawd that courage the cowardly dog episode
13such that no one knew he was such a threat
04But then, it would make more sense for Middle Earth to be more skeptical

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The two most renowned Tolkien artists are Alan Lee and John Howe, and so it was important to Peter Jackson to have those two on board. Lee was tracked down to a tiny little village in Dartmoor, England and was FedExed a package of Jackson's Heavenly Creatures and a letter outlining his intentions. They monitored the progress of the FedEx package every step of the
1,11way, but were somewhat surprised when Lee rang them only 3 hours after delivery to say he'd love to work with them. Howe meanwhile was living in Switzerland, and because someone hadn't worked out the time differences between Europe and New Zealand correctly, was rung about 2am. He says that the biggest frustration with that phone call was waiting for Jackson to finish his pitch before he
04If Sauron be nothing more than an urban legend by that time

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It is estimated that filming of the trilogy pumped about $200,000,000 into the New Zealand economy. The New Zealand government even created a Minister for Lord of the Rings, whose remit was to exploit all the economic opportunities the films represented.
05,15I can't break out of my shell, so I can't make egg jokes
Kandarihu: In case you're wondering, taht spider really did bite me. I just found a purple-ish painful bump where it was at.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It's common practice with a high budget feature film to have more than one unit shooting at any one time, usually two or three. With "The Lord of the Rings", there were occasions when there would be between five and seven units shooting at any given time.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A rubber puppet with a horrific face was superimposed over Ian Holm's face when Bilbo Baggins catches a glimpse of the ring again in Rivendell. Holm was so delighted with the puppet that the design team had a cast iron version of it made for his mantelpiece and gave it to him as a parting gift when Holm wrapped all his scenes on the film.

pwnd
move time + 2:16 - 20 minute intermission - ITS FRIDAY NIGHT
:D
Lawl pwned Boromit
I still don't understand why Gandalf seems apprehensive about about Moria
run
But a dwarf who has relations there doesn't
Dari: Because he's a racist.
dem good eyes
"Unless I have no other choice." And suddenly he has no other choice.
Lol :D
gimli doesnt know moria is fucked
My cousin Balin would throw us a Royal Party

Surely Gimli is more likely to know than Gandalf?
damn birds

so fucking long
next year we're doin Dark Knight trilogy right?
Like I said, dari, Gandalf has a copy of the script and he knows what happens at Moria
Look at tall those flying words!

epic false acting
05,15Gandalf_The_Grey I saw that yesterday. Best movie eer
BIRDEMIC
uh oh
snow everywere
haha fail
13that is...
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While the rest of the Fellowship struggle through snow drifts, Legolas walks on the top of the snow. This is in line with the information given in the novel, because Elves are so light-weighted that they are able to walk on top of snow.
13so sad.
this isn't good
04Indeed, best bad film ever
?
Back. Mom and I are dinnering
Gandalf has... ways... of knowing things. Things he shouldn't know. Part of why he's the Wizard.
Imagine zap apple cider
04Though Manos is just as wonderful
tf2 Shizuka ?
finally get into a TF2 server?
13valve utterly broke MVM with an update today
I swear I read somewhere that they used a giant ring made of gold for that scene
00,10still say it was a nice touch to have them all sloging through the snow while elf boy prances across the surface of the snow.
13we just waited 20 minutes
lol
ring goes on,ring goes off,ring goes on,ring goes off
birdemic is so bad its awesome
I hold The Room closer to heart, yet i still agree
What
Really?
notice that Legolas is walking on the snow
13to get a server out of date error
05,15awww really? I wanted to play it
Sucks.
Gandalf_the_Brony: What movie?
The Ring hungers...
Gandalf_The_Grey: What movie?
Birdemic: B-Tastic?
Hah
indeed
XD
lol is anyone else hearing "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" in their head everytime they see Gandalf? lol
i don't trust that one...
bad touch
Frodo is 40 years old here
Kandarihu: E Tastic
LAG
04I remember hearing that a Tolkein historian gave her blessing for Jackson and the film when she saw that scene between Boromir and Frodo in the snow
Can you not use phases?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: nope
1,11YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED THOSE KEESE!
Piranhaconda foar b movie
05,15Birdemic
Kandarihu: Let's take a "Gander" at this movie.
Spazturtle: And Aragorn is about 80, if i remember
Piranhaconda
air staff from runescape?
05,15WHY DID THE EAGLES AND VULTRES ATTACKED
Nope
:p
The way his voice wavers when he says he doesn't care...that's good acting.
elf is walking ON the snow
fuck elves
87 is aragorn's age
Icecrown?
They need pony mounts
ABBALANCHE!
^
lol runescape was my life 5 years ago
Samwise_Gamgee because your jimmies are rustled at night
now its mlp
Secretly, Gimli is planning the moment he takes out Legolas' kneecaps.
People lived longer then, and Aragorn has elf in his bloodline, from way way back.
Suddenly Nordic singers everywhere!
This is making me think of freaking Icecrown
Frostmourne hungersss...
ABBALANCHE
Ryunosuke, its because they are light weight and are so intertwined with nature
trololololo
Gandalf is worst wizard ever
13Meanwhile: the update hosed a value used to control matchmaking, namely to hide your server from the browser and/or matchmaking but still allow direct connections

By the way I'm Reikim
SHADOW AND FLAME
The darkspawn
go*
04That's why Gandalf is apprehensive, dari
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The cast often had to fly to remote shoot locations by helicopter. Sean Bean(Boromir) was afraid of flying and would only do it when absolutely necessary. When they were shooting the scenes of the Fellowship crossing the snowy mountains, he'd spend two hours every morning climbing from the base of the mountain to the set near the top, already dressed as Boromir.
1,11The crew being flown up could see him from their helicopters.
pony34612: what is reikims fav anime?
05,15Protip: Don't dig too deep in Dwarf Fortress
Who does Lee play here?
04He knows the Balrog is down there while the dwarves don't
fire to the rain opps i should shut my mouth now
Well I've seen the film before
That part reminds me of Dwarf Fortress so much XD
05,15Yes he was
So I know that much
Sure, dump it on a Hobbit.
13saruman
lol
what a dumb
But I still think it'd be more likely for the Gimli to know
Just /whois me, Bronysith
http://derpy.me/aTvYy
13silly rei identify
13or ghost
Rather than Gandalf
05,15and he showed the sound team what a back stab sounded like
who would want to climb like that
0,14^
So be it.... Jedi.
It's not letting me :<
/me shrugs
0,14I was gonna say that....
Dwarves, diging to deep, and unlocking hell itself. No really?
woah bridge from legend of zelda twilight prin.
Samwise_Gamgee: naw man you need the lava sea
Samwise_Gamgee: need to play that some more
13that's dedication though, climbing a mountain in costume
He has relations there and you'd think he'd be in contact with them every so often
Argh
indeed Shizuka
Oh
Now
and my goddamn stream is DEAD
Now I am Reikim
the hell is going on?
13yes
04Yeah, Sean Bean is absolutely badass to climb a mountain in full costume like that

it keeps happening
Believe in the me that believes in you
MORIA
Eeyup
otakon: get better internets
/me lays down and leans her head into Shizuka
1,11Gandalf: Agreed.
And yet Gandalf does know?
13>Sean Bean is absolutely badass
Not according to the books prince dari. Gloin reports at the council that they haven't heard from the dwarves there in some time
The dwarves dug too deep and ruptured the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 8c
13is what you meant to say
Sean Bean is awesome PERIOD
LunarSS: easier typed then done
so who is the guy in the white? is he a friend of Gandalf? ive only seen 2 Towers and a little of RotK
lol

Lol

Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: His relative in the mine also didn't know about the Balrog
Apparently Dwarves don't visit one another often...this takes place several decades after the Hobbit - how can Gimli not know about the events of the Mines of Moria?
Or are we just putting it down to gypsy magic?
It was a dwarf that made the door and an elf that cast the locking magic.
Reikim: thats hippies

When did Gooper Blooper get here?!

Among them was Mortensen (aragorn), who wiped out terribly one day and bruised one whole side of his face. Makeup tried to hide it, but were unsuccessful.

If a wizard starts running, you'd better follow.
DAMN HE fumbled his reflex save
Dwarves don't believe in the power of railings
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Since the Balrog is supposed to be a stone demon, the sound it makes was created by grinding stone tiles together.
He lost his torch! There go his fire-based status effectd

"What is this new foe?" "A power unlike beyond any other." "Ah. Run?" "Run."

BOOM HEADSHOT
0,14CAST MAGIC MISSLE INTO THE DARKNESS
ded
officially legend of zelda
Fucking elves. They hax, I swear
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As Gandalf and the others leap the stairway gap in Moria while fleeing the balrog, incoming arrows shot at them by goblins high above seem to rapidly flex. This is not an accidental special-effects artifact; arrows actually do this, and it contributes to stable flight, similar to a gyroscope's effect. That one of Legolas' arrows does not flex in a flying-point-of-view
1,11shot may indicate that elvish arrows are enchanted - or that the filmmakers just wanted to spare the audience the extra distraction in that shot.
Swiftly Orlando bloom!
just move youre little rump with a hop a skip and a jump
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: Stone demon? It's a fire demon tho...

i sense a leap of faith coming
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gimli's line "Nobody tosses a dwarf!" was filmed after the "Toss me" line in the sequel.
Legolas using AimBot, no fair man
its not a fire deamon, its just a powerful deamon
Stone + Fire = Lava. Clearly or friend Balrog is a fiery monster from deep in the earth's core.
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: sure, I guess.
Remember Frodo: HOP, SKIP & JUMP:O
HA. That's awesome.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The ironic part about the Fellowship mourning the loss of Gandalf was, at that point, none of the cast members had met Ian McKellen, let alone seen him dressed up as the wizard.
04This scene
It sounds like the track is skipping in the background at times, am I the only one hearing that? O.o

OohShiny well... i bet everypony or at least MOST know this movie :S

MrBen: The reason is, they filmed all three movies at once-- a titanic gamble in the film world, but one that paid off.
Samwise_Gamgee: Yes.
your crying is bad , you should feel bad
You know what, I still can't let go of the Man of Steel music. My god Warner Bros. is lazy
Ghost_of_Gandalf: Watch "THe girl who leapt through time" to see something that works better

Gandalf the Grey COULD NOT PASS!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: More than 1,600 pairs of latex ears and feet were used during the shoot, each "cooked" in a special oven running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There was no way of removing the feet at the end of the day without damaging them and so each pair could only be used once. The used feet were shredded to prevent a black market in stolen hobbit feet but apparently
1,11Dominic Monaghan (Merry) kept a pair.

Ghost_of_Gandalf: You were saying?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: John Rhys-Davies, who plays Gimli the dwarf, is the tallest of the actors who play members of the Fellowship. He is 6' 1".

dat poem
11,01Now I'm getting bad password.
and that poem fell flat
"Gaaandaaallf sucked, he died in the first movie... Only 1 hour in after fellowship. He really was a newwwwb" <-- Translated
05,15I can see why most of these scenes were cut
lololo
Samwise_Gamgee: bc they add character?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Orlando Bloom landed the role of Legolas two days before he finished drama school.
It's also his second role, ever.
lol
:P
Boromir is suffering from a Will penalty of -10
Samwise_Gamgee: Mostly for time... even Jackson realised that the running time would be insanely long were they to keep everything in.
05,15otakon they're unnecessary. Everything you need is in the normal editions.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the Fellowship's stay in Lothlorien, Boromir says that his father is "a noble man." Denethor, Boromir's father, is played by John Noble.
The first was as a murder victim on "Midsomer Murders"
Samwise_Gamgee: BLASPHEMY!
yeah the extended cut gets rather tedious at some points

Just out of curiosity, is this the extended edition?
My stream is off, so.
yes
magmablock: Yes.
aight
yes
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Pregnancy changed Peter Jackson's vision of "Lord of the Rings". Originally, he wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel and Uma Thurman as Arwen. Unfortunately, both actresses became pregnant after being asked to read, and the roles were filled in by Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, respectively.
magmablock: yes it is
it is
LOOK AT THAT ELF
EEYUP
what is the extended edition?
she stares into your soul
L
I can't see.
04>Uma Thurman
04No
04Bad
omg
05,15Why not? Uma Thurman is awesome
SHE TOOK Reikim s SIGHT
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett's role as Galadriel required her to film for only a month.
Uma as Arwen? Nononononon
^
Soupjuice: Cutscenes edited out of the original movie
I'm glad those two were recast
04Thurman as Arwen? Hell no
0,14I love me some Uma, but don't think it would've worked
Soupjuice more screens are added
No, I mean, I HAVE NO STREAM.
ooohhhhhhh, thanks
0,14I think these choices were better
Jeez.
Totally
04Yeah, these choices were pretty perfect
LUCY LAWLESS
Soupjuice I mean scenes
Rohan: but Uma is so HOT
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett joked that she took the role of Galadriel because, "I've always wanted pointy ears".
<3<3<3 I love Lucy Lawless!
Yar. I always found this scene cool.
thanks baby babies
I can't see either of those two being better than these two.
just yanking your wand Reikim
Haven't we all Silver?
Oh Celestia....
11,01Pointy!
Meh, I think it would have been good eay
Pointy EARS!

Mirror of Erised?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During filming, Liv Tyler left her pair of prosthetic ears on the dashboard of her car. When she returned they had melted.
Sith please do the room a favour and find one that's more like you.
Oh my gosh, I'm in the future!
Whoops!

Bad Ending
04I think Lucy would have better than Thurman as of choices for their respective roles, but Cate looks much more befitting of an elf, I would think
i did
was banned from it
0,14Cate Blanchett has this sorta of regalness to her
the ring
Friendship!
04Yeah, what Rohan said
0,14*sort of
Byt Lucy Lawless has the eyes for Elvish
Can't blame it.
04She has the right face
and NOTHING would happen if it touched the water
Friendship is indeed.... strong Magic...
04The right voice too
Her eyes are her iconic stature of actress.
SYMBOLISM
audio up
that chick is creepin me out (O_O)
RP rooms are supposed to be pretty lax about banning.
No pressure
TIP: Don't fail
SHE HAS A RING OF POWER
IT BEGINS.
Jedi mind tricks
I think Lucy woujld play comedy well, but it would be really weird t osee her in a movie like this
Boss Time!
In the scene of the destruction of the Hobbiton Mill when Frodo looked into the Mirror of Galadriel, the model of the mill took over 6 months to make for a 3 second shot in the film
OMG
well
In other words, no pressure
Vivix: Lucy Lawless? Xena herself?
OMG
Vivix: You ever seen her being in a serious role?

No, exactly that
and then RARITY!

SHIT
I'll be in my bunk.
PPOOP
0,14...well, I didn't need to sleep
ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
Luna Alert
Yeah well she is not as scary as Flutterrage.
In other words, Galadriel is a backstabbing bitch that knows she's a backstabbing bitch.
We need to have Princess Celestia do that, that would be so AWESOME :O
This scene scared the shit out of me when i first saw it
HOW MANY POINTS DO I RECEIVE??
OK. Nightmare Moon was a PIKER.
Who does this scene better Luna or Rarity?
Rohan: same here

She resisted

/me hugs Bronysith

Jeez, that ring fucks everyone up
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Over 12.5 million plastic rings were made in order to fabricate simulated chain mail for the movie. Two crew members spent the length of the shoot linking the rings by hand into suits of armor. By the end of production, they had worn the fingerprints off their thumbs and index fingers.
1,11Dat ring
but we like you :3

All shall love me? That's flutterage

Where's Nittany, we need his Fellowship of Dust
Dem Applejacks D:
Why didn't they make real chainmail?
Ma'am, you just failed the test
ok ok
jeez. D:
Peter Jackson preferred dolls and miniatures and real things over CGI, and it made the movie better-
those guys were kewl
o hai Uruk
04I imagine real chainmail would be much more expensive
HURR SMALLEST person
Chainmail is extremely heavy and probably a lot more expensive
woah whos this guy?
ORIGIN STORY
PonyStationVita: Lurtz
PonyStationVita: that's a Uruk Hai
:O WHAT THE...
00,10not to mention the weight of it Ghost_of_Gandalf

Manflesh. If you know what I mean.

Probably anti armor things
otakon: Well now he looks like a member of KISS.

Actually it's just a broadsword with a hook
MAN FLESH!!!
Hook for antiarmor, cleaver for fight?
otakon: that could wrek some shit
make me think of skyrim
Unspoiled. Whoa. :s
Hobbit might make a better movie because it's a lot shorter
Vivix: the hook was to punture armor, the blade itself is heavy and thick
otakon don't worry, i know how this goes, but i won't spoil anything
"Wipe them out....... all of them."
dari: To stab with a sword is an artists fight. Uruk-hai are brutes who crush bone with blade.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original plan was to film the trilogy in two movies. Miramax said that it had to be done in one movie so the producers went to New Line Cinema. When their presentation was done, one of the people at New Line told them that they were crazy and that the film had to be done as a trilogy. This caused the producers to go back and rewrite the script.
Marley: yfw The Hobbit is gonna be a trilogy
yummy
:D
"These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick, and their shields broad."
lol
Don't forget the ROPE!

Again, I'd like to mention if theres any fans here of Portal 2 BGM and L4D, or Steel pole bath tub: Mike Morasky worked on this movie in 2001 shortly after resinign as a indie musician
otakon: wait a minute...SENSU BEANS
LOTR would take at least ten films if they really followed the books
Random real life trivia: IRL, there's starchy foods used by some armed forces that really do fill you up with barely two or three bites of it.
i wounder do they hav a ebony mine
Now that's a KNOIFE

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While filming the trilogy, Viggo Mortensen got so into character that during a conversation, Peter Jackson referred to him as "Aragorn" for over half an hour without him realizing it.
04Lol

Lothlorien Coat: +20% stealth
HOW?
Viggo is a cool g y
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: Told you, Scandianvians KNOWS how to act :P

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen joined the film when it was already shooting, never having met Peter Jackson before, nor indeed having read the Tolkien books either. It was Mortensen's 11 year old son Henry Mortensen who was the chief instigator in convincing Mortensen to sign on as Aragorn.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Wherever possible, costume designer Ngila Dickson followed J.R.R. Tolkien's descriptions of the characters' clothing to the very letter. One such example is Bilbo Baggins's waistcoat which does indeed sport brass buttons, as referred to in "The Hobbit".
OohShiny: Yes that was the joke.

aj i stoppped watching it after the test thingy in the forest thing
I acn feel it
I love ruins
cratorkid: Chunin exam?
Hated Naruto even when I was part of its demographic's age range
Samwise_Gamgee: I'm sure LotR Trilogy made a huge favor for New Zealand's tourism
i read the LoTR trilogy 3 times in my lifetime
coming baaa-aaack again...
I didn't know the Force existed in this movie....
i couldnt ever find a copy of the hobbit somehow
AJIsAwesome: yea if thats what its called
00,10spot check fail
naruto was great until about season 3
Where was Frodo, when Gondor... wait
Sumica: they need higher perception
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the cast are traveling on screen, they always walk from the left of the screen to the right, never the other way around. This is because of the movie convention that West-East travel is represented by left-right movement.
0,14Personally, I'd like to read The Silmarrion (still never sure how to spell that)
00,10you bastards you blew it up!
dammit Frodo don't spit the party
Inb4 Best Movie Scene in a LONG time
AJIsAwesome yeah i didn't really like shippuden either
I only read some naruto, stopped because I got bored around 100 episodes in
just my opinion though'
Silmarillion?
yay
I NEED AN ADULT :S
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: i was waiting for that trivia
One does not simply gather sticks
I swear if anyone spoils Naruto for me.
otakon What's wrong with it, Neverending story is actually awesome!
I am an adult!
Isn't that the one about Sauron's origins and the thing worse than him?
We're down to the last hour about now, right?
0,14yep
WE NEED A SONIC SAYS
Aparantly Boromir is a creeper
Kandarihu: yeah
no sonic sez!
00,1040min left
That interests me, I'll admit.
Dark92Enigma: Neverending story IS awesome
05,15I have too many books to finish right now. I have The Necronomicon which is a ton of Lovecraft stories, and I have Churchill's History of Britain series, which will also take forever.
Madness?
madness>?
wait, still 40 min?
Madness?
Dark92Enigma: said the addict
wow
No, it's Sparta
oh no
Why do I get a child molester vibe out of this scene
I telling on Boromir!
This is GONDOR!
THIS........IS SPARTA!
HEY KIDS, IT'S OKAY TO BE HUGGED BY SOMEONE YOU LIKE,
No means no
THIS, IS...
THIS IS MIDDLE EARTH
GANDALF!!!!
madness? THIS IS LORD OF THE RINGS!
no this is spagetti
You've done it now
NO THIS IS PATRICK
cratorkid: i'm not an addict!
The Necronomicon is best Lovecraft collection
The only Lovecraft story I've read to date is Call of Cthulhu.
THIS IS VEGAS
00,10bad touch bad touch, do not want
BAD TOUCH
Frodo = I need an adult

SEE? SEE THE VIOLENCE INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM? I'M BEING REPRESSED!
No!
1THIS IS MORDOR!
BAD TOUCH!
VICTORY SHLL BE MINE, MINE!!!
ah get him off me
no this is twilight sparkle:)
Dark92Enigma: i know , just that was something one would say
I tried At the Mountains of Madness but the pacing didn't agree with me.
Boromir = I AM AN ADULT
AHHHHHAAHHAHAHHAHAHA!!!
:)
It could be mine. It should be Mine! GIVE IT TO ME!
BUT WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO TOUCH YOU IN A WAY OR PLACE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE,
i see your mind?
whao
Dark92Enigma: :)
he mad
cratorkid: Oh, you.....:D
THAT'S NO GOOD!
lol
CURSE YOU, BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!!
04Suddenly different mood

Hah, humor.
Bipolar Boromit
AJIsAwesome: IT'S YOUR BODY!
otakon: sean bean is such a good actor
Sumi's playing it off the soundboard.
^
Suddenly sorrow
*Boromir
I hate this scene, it makes me sad. :'(
One does not simply fall on the ground
00,10Noting like a bit of head tram to clear ones mind.
You know, it's odd that the Ringwraiths have just....given up following him this whole time
sean bean is my favorite actor
AAAAAAAAAAAAARTAAAAAAAAAAAX
SEAN BENN BEST ACTOR
He was going--so insane with desperation. I loved this
^
It's his ping noises.
0,14I was really hoping that Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation of At The Mountains of Madness would get made
To the person with the sound board, where does that "whoaa" effect come from
Bronysith: yes yes he is
Riders: but Frodo is an adult, he`s looks around the age of 20
He doesn't use a soundboard.
SEAN BEAN IS AWESOME
aren't the ringwraiths dead?
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO TOUCH YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO!
but whats the origin of the soundclip
It's from S1 E2
NO CLIP CHEAT!
The sea serpent.
mica
11,01Reikim: Thanks.
Frodo is an adult yeah, I can't remember his age in the books
AJIsAwesome: SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
mica
They want the ring so badly that they've decided not to come after him any more?
EYE SEE YOU!
I SEE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
No problem Nitt.

Ohhh myyy

Ponies, of course.
Riders: you must be new , its when you ping someone who is streaming , if you try sumica its a yay , mica is a oh my and sumi is woah
OOHHH MAAAII should have been used a few minutes earlier
THE ''Ohhhh Myyyyy'' HAS BEEN DOUBLED
11,01TF2 is a game that needs an instruction manual. I hated that it didn't come with one when it came out.
yay
Buytoast: Er, how? The water shouldn't have killed them alone, they're creatures of great evil magic. >_>
well i don't know
Next sound effect to be obtaiined: "Naaauuuugggthyyyy"
Where did this Oh My sound clip come from, anyway?
Crap Vita has 2 go bye
AJIsAwesome: I expected you to say ''NO''
05,15Day Z needs a freaking 101 class
I you want that Ring, you must put a ri-shit, not again
I promise... I will destroy the ring >_>
Day Z?

:'(
I'm totally going to destroy eeyup<_<
sumica
Good Guy Aragorn
Yeah TF2 isn't that simple to learn when you've just gotten it.
Dark92Enigma: I thought you wanted it to stay blank.
Shit is about to hit the fan!
Wraiths are busy getting ready to attack Gondor
05,15MrBen George Takei said it in a commercial for a TV
BEST SCENE INCOMING
1,11This scene alone tells us that these two were perfect casting decisions.
You grow into it.
sumi
love the new >_> <_< faces
Aragorn is my favorite character
Indeed.
I AM HUMAN
cratorkid = I've been doing BronyState since it was founded, I just missed a lot of streams in the transitionary phase to BronyState 2.0
Gandalf_the_Brony: Aw man! I just bought this fan!
look at those dreds. Do you think they are rastafarians?
A bit like Dwarf Fortress, only easier.
I WILL SCORN YOUR LIFE FROM THIS EARTH
FORWARD!
Samwise: Oh.
This scene! This scene!
AJIsAwesome: nope. that blank was reserved for YOU to say NO
fucks given by aragorn: 0
FUS RO DAH!
Where's Han Solo and the: "AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!"
Aragorn: FIGHTING ORCS (LIKE A BAWS)
Riders: ok , nice to have a vet here :)
I love this part in the games!
<3
Dark92Enigma: I'll fill it in. NO!
You versus 80 Uruk Has
F*** YEAH! I FEEL THE RUSH OF AN EPIC ADVENTURE!
Didn't Viggo wound several of these guys in filming?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A scene involving the Fellowship escaping the Uruk'hai via some river rapids had to be abandoned as extreme flooding in the Queenstown area had washed the set away.
damn he just keeps rolling 20
and less than 30 uruks survived, the end
FIND DA HALFLINGS!
CRY COWAAARD
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Composers are usually involved with films for about six to eight weeks. By the time this film was released, Howard Shore's involvement was stretching back for two years.
So much Sumi in this figt! :D
AWESOME LEGOLAS MOVE #1
AJIsAwesome: .....THEN YOU GET OUTTA THERE!
SEAN BENN!
GO GO GO GO!
Aragorn uses Elhendeil +15 strength
triple trouble
Wait, that's Aragorn, bah
There's a storm going on near my house, so I might get cut off.
AJIsAwesome: (insert rest of the segment)
0,14same goes for most games
Leave the streamer pings alone, it's getting annoying.
0,14especially fighting ones
Where theres a whip theres a way
He's gonna run for it... D:
He's making like a tree!
cratorkid = I had assumed that the ping effects were just a humorous soundboard. They seemed to sink up way too well to be accidental
Legolas has infinite arrows?
AJIsAwesome: OH ok
:)
Hax
lol merry and pippen
THERE THEY ARE!!!
GET THEM!!!!
SEMI NARUTO SPOILER INCOMING: Anypony remember that time in Naruto where zabuza killed all those guys without his arms?
lol
05,15What kind of die does that sword take. 2d6? 1d8?
goddamn pippin is the biggest dumbass to live
MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU GOTTA TELL SOMEONE YOU TRUST, LIKE YOUR PARENTS, YOUR TEACHER, OR A POLICE OFFICER!
"Rolled around on him till he went invisible. Resisted urge to have a little cuddle (made easier when he punched me in the face.)" - Boromir
THERE THEY COME
Fighting ones are very much a learning process.
merry and pippen <3
00,10they want us to find them, surly that's not a trick or a trap
Yeah use the pings at only appropirate moments (Like the Oh My at a sex scene or whatever)
Hey, look, a distraction!
riders its usualy somone just typing a ping when they know something is going to pop up
The ring makes you metrosexual?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the fight between Lurtz (the leader of the Uruk’hais) and Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen successfully parried the dagger thrown at him on his first attempt.
GO GIMLIE!
*Cues AOSTH credits theme*
Sumica: orcs have minds of the jersey shore cast
Scoot-Scootaloo: Where's Yur MLG?!
Fighting games are learned by button mashing.
ello everypony :), finally got me some MLP cards :)
04Dat luck
cratorkid usually me :)
SEAAN BEEEEEEEEENNN
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SEAN BENN!
I still can't play them worth a damn, mostly because it requires playing against people and that's not really something I can do.
Kurra What6_9
LEEROY JENKINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
04REEEEEDEEEEEMPTIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Don't pretend like it's hard to initially learn fighting games.
BADASS
Boromir is epic!
Quick, who knows the name of the Uruk'Hai leader in this scene?
EPIC BOROMIR
Wait... were Marry and Pinnin the sons of Marry Poppins!? :O
05,15I haven't played P4A in 3 days! OH GOD
FECK YOUR COUCHES! I am Boromir!
It's hard to learn to play them well.
epic
I know you're a big fan Saxy but the Mona Lisa, your games are not.
Dat Rapid Fire D:
Crotch shot?
05,15I'm so far behind now!
unlimited arrows?
Legolas is a fucking baws.
00,10some one took the quick draw and indless quiver AA's
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Legolas's arrows in the final battle are computer generated. It would have been physically impossible for even the most gifted archer to fire off so many arrows so quickly.
Boromir uses Horn of Gondor *allies are on the way*
AJIsAwesome: I think i know the lyrics....i'll PM you later about it
0,14pffffffffffffffffft
So wait the oh my was another ping? I thought it was Sumica using the sound board. I know the yay was his ping but not the other stuff
Legolas using ammo hack
Wander can learn from that guy.......
F*** YEAH! THIS IS EPIC!
Go Boromir! Sean Benn has the POWAAAAAAH
^
damn so many mooks
Clonk
BUFF BANNER
this battle is microscopic compared to the others. X3
05,15I've screwed myself over for online now haven't I
PEEEEEEEECOLAAAAAAA
0,14fighting games can be quite easy to pick up
BLOW THE MAGIC CAUNCH!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The climactic fight scene was shot in the middle of a heatwave, with temperatures in excess of 100 degrees. Many of the actors playing the Uruk'hais had to be carried off the set with heat exhaustion.
0,14but getting good at them?
WHY DID HE DROP HIS SHIELD?
If this is a D&D game, Legolas is either a dexterous demi-god or he's cheating his rolls
I wonder how they managed to make Legolas's speed look so real, though.
Come on Boromir! You're my favourite character!
0,14they can have one hell of a slope
If you haven't learned DF you aren't allowed to complain that your game is hard to learn.
Legolas, Aimbot?
Come on Boromir! Just a few more minutes
:P
Riders: he's a elf, he rolled a 20
Oh feck, this one...
HELP HIM, YOU FOOLS!!!!
Best SCENE
HELP
Kurra: true that. :) This is just the beginning
damn Horde mode
HIM
Legolas rolls a dice factory.
CriticKitten: He just pulled the string, aiming more or less towards them. Arrows were generated, so it looks pretty good
holy crap there's a lot of them
he got a 20 for dexterity
Right there, that big Uruk'Hai...anyone know his name? It's from the card game.
THOU
CRAP!
:'(:(:'(:'(:'(
NOOOOOOOOO
1,11CriticKitten: He merely did the actions as fast as he could. The actual bows were added later.
damn boromir can tank
that's at least 5 deaths now
Bronyhawk: Lurtz

BOOOOROOOOOOOMIIIIIIIIIIIIR

OWWWIIIEEEE!1!1
and then he took and arrow to the heart.
They're fucking HUGE arrows.
Boromir uses Second Wind
Tryndamere ulted!
he gets up
So far one the best(if not the best) deaths of Sean Bean.
bauss
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T TAKE AN ARROW TO THE KNEE!
sexy time?
overkill
LIKE A BOSS
Gandalf_the_Brony: He's so awesome he has three winds.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sean Bean is wearing a fiberglass bodysuit underneath his costumeto stop the arrows sticking out of him from wobbling.
in the ass!
Boromir is Tryndamere
*of
otakon: he gets shot 3 times and doesnt bitch about it at all
Tryndamere is surprisingly useful today.
Not yet./

KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
PinkiePieYoshi64: they aren't there yet
Boromir....
/me is horrified
Boromir is in Critical Condition!
hobbits: highly ineffective
Kurra: Actually, given the locations of the arrows, you could live for a while with those shots.
0,14because you cock up the netcode
Tryndamere was slain!
why not kill the guy who's shooting you first?
/me sheds a manly tear
Otakon: WHYYYYY!!!!!! :'(
0,14and then the match lags
otakon: while a skyrim pansy gets shot once and is a pussy
:'(
/me cries in pain
I only skip the animation after the hundredth time I've seen it
Kurra: But it would be UNBEARABLY painful.
WHY DOES SEAN BEAN LIKE TO DIE IN ALMOST EVERYTHING HE'S IN :[
:'(
You know what the best part about being Sean Bean is? Being able to say "Hello, I'm Mr. Bean" :$
I FUCKING WANT A COPY OF THAT BOW!!
Hammer X to extend bleed out time!
HOBBITS FAIL
AJIsAwesome: Only when inhaled, it is used in boats, cars, tons of things. Usually only dangerous if you breathe it in while spraying it
Goodbye Stark
You would die just from the pain.
FINISH HIM
Tryndamere was slain
yeah aragorn!
IF ONLY HE HAD HIS SHIELD?
WHOA
00,10cool use of shield
Tryndamere did a Pentakill
dat shield throw
0,14I'd rather sit through the character openings for a match instead of having a laggy fight
Wouldn't it be awesome if Darth Vader came out of nowhere, killed all the orcs, saved everyone, turned into a potato and implowded?
05,15the lag on PS3 after someone skips is crazy. Like....powerpoint presentation levels.
HERE COMES THE CALVARY!
FIN, BUCKING, LYYYYYYYYYYY
OohShiny: god damn , wheres zilean when you need him
sumi
Kinda sucks that Lurtz wasn't even in the book :3
Kurra: Pain alone can't kill you. You go unconcious once the pain threshold is broken anyway.
eww
Whoa :D
Kayle uses ult!
:D
Bronyhawk: no he wasn't
oh shit
nice hit
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It took eleven hours for Lawrence Makoare's full costume and makeup to be applied for the role of Lurtz.

My Brother....My King.

"Killed by orcs. Stupid orcs." - Boromir
Rest well Eddard Stark
Kurra: Pain doesn't kill you. Pain is merely a nerve-impulse response intended to warn you about damage to the body. You would pass out if the pain is too great, but the pain isn't what kills you. The arrows he took would cause him to bleed out while experiencing quite a lot of pain.
Man, the team on Nyx is doing insanely well.

Listen to Gandalf Frodo
I fucking LOVE that quote for the record

"oh, My" were also the final words of James T Kirk in "Star Trek:Generations" and Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.

/me uses Inspirational Speech
Ian McKellen lives on in all of us.
Frodo is useless
otakon: when i think frodo, i think elijah wood, such a good guy
FRODO!!!!!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene where Frodo is leaving everyone behind at Emyn Muil to take up the quest on his own, divers went into the water to make sure it would be free of any sharp objects or debris for Sean Astin to run into when Sam goes chasing after him. Although they gave the OK, Sean ended up stepping on a piece of glass that completely pierced his foot from top to bottom,
Frodo receives Gandalf Memories +30 determination

05,15Sam is so fucking loyal

the problem was is that they split the party , you NEVER split the party
Sumica: LOL

05,15Ghost_of_Gandalf I've been saying that for so long
SAM AND FRODO. BEST FRIENDSHIP EVER.
Ghost_of_Gandalf: Weren't you dead? YOu shouldn't speak
Rainbow Dash hasn't got SQUAT on Samwise Gamgee when it comes to loyalty.
Sexy Time is happening
AJIsAwesome: YOU MEAN....the Gomu Gomu
congrats Samwise,youre the new rainbow dash lol
otakon: i think we could all use a sam gamgee in our life

BOOOROOOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR
And the movie ends with a Brohoof
Meanwhile = Technically Sam is less of a load than Frodo
ded
:'(
Boromir: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Samwise_Gamgee = The Element of Loyalty
AJIsAwesome: I DON'T remember the full name
WHY DIDNT HE WIN AN OSCAR :[

"They taking the Hobbits to Isengard!"
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The climax of the film actually inter-cuts the last chapter of the book (Boromir trying to take the Ring from Frodo, Frodo's escape and his departure with Sam) with the first chapter of the second book, which shows Boromir's death and funeral, Merry and Pippin's capture, and Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas beginning their pursuit of the Orcs.

suddenly, another rolling blackout in my home... and gee, I missed a lot Dx
I'm sure it could have gone better, but how can you ever tell?
Samwise_Gamgee: EveryTHING is spot on. I actually don't know of any way that this movie could realistically have been made better.
totally straight moment

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, changed its name to Middle Earth for the film's opening.

Suddenly, typist!
Right on! Is bed time for Mr. Ben!!
1,11I have to say, even though I haven't read the books, I can just tell that the film followed the book to the T. How? because there's no bulky loose ends, no cluttered editing and no rushed scenes. A perfect adaptaion of the first book, an opinion that many, MANY share. 10/10
dat oc
superretroworld: you know it? :)
Sumica: He wants the credits to go fatster, Sumica :D
Later all y'all!
Good night guys and thx for the moive

WHERE'S TOM BOMBADIL?!
00,03God, I love it XD
another computer? wow, I wish I had that fast of a computer service
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: It's damn well adapted from the books, I don't remember any book ourage other than Tom Bombadil
what pony is tha tthat is punching the computer
11,01Such beautiful musc.

8.5/10 least favorite out of the three
11,01*music
Well, what you tell her depends on the situation.
Honestly, I can't think of a single way that this movie could have been better. Which speaks LOADS about the fantastic quality and effort put into it. Definitely a 10/10.
Eh, I wish they could have had Tom Bombadil in it, but other than that, it was VERY faithful to the book.
i love this movie than words and experse/10
dat OC
1,11RANDOM RANKINGS TRIVIA:
1,11The entire trilogy was voted #9 in Total Film's 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time list (November 2005).
I can't, she's like 3 years older than me, and I think she already has someone
00,03My OC TOTALLY fits in with the music :3
Sorry, they cut a lot out and gave a much larger part to Arwen. Among other things
words can*
Scoot-Scootaloo: Orly? XD
otakon: he also told the best alternate ending to the story :D
Howard Shore/10
00,03If only I knew what it's name is...
superretroworld: oh God no
Rainbow-Crash: Really, Mr. Bombadil wasn't in it? XD
also shes a coworker
If you want really corny romantic blather, though, I can hork that up like bad avocadoes.
New Zealand/10
Tell her your soul cries out for but a splinter of her being.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Scoot-Scootaloo?
all dem stunt performers
10/10<3
wohoo, im jst in time for the credits!
11,01'dat Scoots.
twilight_sprinkle: sucks dude
That was a pretty important chapter, though. Definitely need to see how they handled that.
If Sumica dances now...
XD
ermg dancing pony now
words can not express how much I love this movie:)
Vigo Mortenssen's chiped tooth/10
04This is just my personal opinion, but, Into The West is much better
otakon: wat movie was dis?
Sumica: we gonna have a encore on sunday of all three movies?
Tell her that the sun itself cannot shine light where she can.
otakon: no seriously, wat movie?
twilight_sprinkle: Star Wars
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: I completely agree. I didn't read the books either, but i can tell this <---- was a perfect adaptation of them.
lol bottom right pony
Tell her that she is a vision come from Heaven of pureness beyond mortals.
00,10hahahah otakon, no
I can literally do this all day.
Sumica: lol
Sumica: how about HISHE?
05,15Well...the books actually have A LOT more. but this adaptation is very very good
<_< this movie was bad >_>
everyone dance like a pony
K_A: Nope, not on film at least
Like I said, it would have taken ten movies if they really followed the book.
twilight_sprinkle: im sorry
:'(
Still taken aback by how spectacularly well the effects and general direction hold up. If Hollywood is still remake crazy in 20 years, this is one film that does not need to be touched because it still looks incredible
00,03I could just stare at it all day...
K_A: No. Jackson, rightly, that although theTom Bombadil scene was an interesting part, it added nothing to the actual plot, and wasn't filmed.
Samwise_Gamgee: it was as close as it could get
Scoot-Scootaloo: The music?
05,15GOD THIS MUSIC IS SO GOOD
So, how are we handling the lottery for next weekend?
Ghost_of_Gandalf: definitly
Dat poni surfin 4 clop :D
So when is the Two Towers going to be?
IshSexiestPony: tell her that as long as the...god i cant do this
Tell her that the merest glimpse of her lightens your soul and gives you the strength and endurance of a thousand men.
Look at all the carpenters!!!
Kandarihu: same as usual, or a break
04Howard Shore did an amazing job, he's a great composer
Sigh. There's a moth in my sleeve.

Meanwhile and his moths
this music is what we need when we have presidential inagurations.
00,03WUB WUB

Tell her that she is a flame, and you but a mere moth.

00,03WHERE ARE THE PONIES :[
05,15NO PONIES
Thanks Gimly_Son_of_Gloin :D
05,15:[
2PM EST ? what about GMT system ><
BUT THERE WAS BILL
fffff... 2PM tomorrow... I might be stuck at work
Where was Gondor when this movie was so good?
what about bill
Kencolt: Well, he was more of an initial guide to them during their travel through the old forest and was more for exposition, so I can see omitting him for pacing reasons.
sean bean is the best for any male medeivel protagonist who dies
It's only 10.. No pony??? :(
WHERE ARE THE LORD OF THE RINGS WITH PONIES!
bill was a pony
I was told there would be ponies
:D
Fun Movie Fact - in the Director's commentary to this film, Peter Jackson mentions he has the Bag End set in storage in hopes one day he can turn it into a future home
05,15Saigneur convert it
WHY DOES EVERYONE FORGET BILL
there's ponies at the bottom of the screen, obviously
No pony?:'(
lord of the ponies
00,10mfw 20 min of credits
You get a lot of moths around here alright.
Forgot how incredible the Lord of the Rings soundtrack was
Tell her that perfection is a pale shadow next to her.
Bill's dead! Jim!
Benickerson: that was only to get you here
Is bill still alive?
There hasn't been a day in the last month that I haven't seen one in here.
how could you forget about the soundtrack
i think he died in the books
They like you.
I...I can't do it. She'll reject me, and if will be difficult for the both of us to work there in the presence of each other, one of us will have to leave, I can't lose this job
04Don't forget we had that intermission :P
did he not?
Actually, a lot of stuff was omitted for pacing, believe it or not.
And your moustache.
Dang it!
Meanwhile LUNA will find it by the Second or Third Movie, i guess
1,11What is the time difference between Eastern and GMT? 3 hours?
But I can't rate the movie because my attention is spotty.
2pm EST, that's 8pm CET, right?
Okay then, guard your feelings, that's cool.
otakon: im gonna miss the second one too. should i watch the third one or will it just be spoiling?
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: I think 5 hours
new zealand made a sh*t ton of money of of this
TWO TOWERS!! IT HAS PONIES!!
In the book the hobbits ride ponies to Bree
04So it'll be just over 4 hours of movie night tonight, with only one movie and zero pony eps (unless an ep is shown after)
I've been doing that for, what, three years now? I'm doing alright.
/me slaps IshSexiestPony
it's only 5AM GMT+1 !!!!
00,03FUNFACT: Despite my OC, I am NOT a PC gamer...
twilight_sprinkle: goddddddddammit
00,10summer tim an GMT is +8 PST so +5 iirc Nitt
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: Well, the movie started at 7 for eastern. And midnight for GMT. So you figure it out.
/me nomz Bronysith's hoof off
IshSexiestPony: dont believe in yourself...fine
00,03Hurray for timezones!
believe in Reikim
Should have pony ep b4 and after movie
they make it so confusing
D:
I think its 4, Gimli_Son_of_Gloin - Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern
Console master race? :P
Should not have pony eps
11,01-5
Ever
We should have like clocks of the world over the stream
otakon: so should i watch the 3rd one? or not without watching the first two?
Jeez, 4am GMT?? Poor Brits and others.
how come ive never seen those two ponies before?
11,01-5 GMT actually.
No, actually, that's a terrible idea, don't do that.
besides I already said I think theres someone else in her life already
i wonder what pony episode we shall watch tonight
That's just fine.
05,15NONE!
Whats the scheudle for tonight?
05,15This was it
Weta is best effects studio
:
I think Sumi showing the four pony eps in-between the Potter movies was to make up for not having them tonight.
We need Gen 3 MLP Live
cratorkid: As i've said before; Peter Jackson made a huge favor for New Zealand's tourism
:'(
THERE
seriously!? aw man
CREDITS OVER

This can go two ways Ish.
Oh god no

04What we're seeing on screen is currently the list of Official LotR fanclub members, yes?
IshSexiestPony: a) Don't listen to me, I don't know what I'm talking about. b) Get over it. c) Once over it, with a sound mind, ask her out. it shouldn't be serious when it starts anyway
the pony on the computer is raging by the more credits
Or you can steel yourself and stare her right in the face and take the chance.
so it's 2PM EST ( GMT -4 ) which means 7PM GMT +1 ....
Scoot-Scootaloo: did you pay for your name here?
tony tigerspy
Oh, but the scenes from the book I really liked were well played here, and Gimli matches exactly what I imagined from the novel.

I am friends with her, thats all we'll ever be
Bronysith: I know!
Ghost_of_Gandalf: Val is the one at middle right?
Marley = I can't see it being done. The Silmarillon provided interesting background on Middle Earth but it lacked a real central story
otakon: Dunno, i've heard that Jackson will include some material from other Tolkien's works
00,10that's Phase4
Being friendzoned for a year or two doesn't hurt all that much.
11,01Val isn't a weather pony.

Hi everypony!

Ghost_of_Gandalf: it looks like he's TROLLING EVERYPONY
Seriously, I LOVE the SHire music
LunarSS: Silmarillion had a story? It was the only book related to LOTR that i COULD not read-
That's very much depends on the exact nature of the feelings.
and at least 10 clark's
THIS IS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER
otakon: yet i havent read the hobbit...
holy crap
00,10they are now listing off the entire population of new Zealand

Scoot-Scootaloo: dat ping :P
Bronysith: READ IT

Inactivity?
Is it bad that this music reminds me of the Sims >_>
oh my god
otakon: hmmm....nah
david h combs III
Bronysith: its a good book
SirGanjalf|TheGreen: He can't include stuff from any works except LOTR and the Hobbit, since he doesn't have the rights. He is using the appendixes of the books though
They just opened a phone book and.... XD
garland t ConleyIII

You've probably been paying too much attention here.
Kicked from console.
otakon: i have hitchhikers guide to the galaxy to read first
Does Shizuka have a Desktop Pony?
all of these thirds
Looks like ima need about 16 sandwiches
So who are all these OC ponies??
they ARE thanking the whole population of goddamn New Zeland
Sumica, lol.
True but there are a lot of individual stories that would make good films
Kurra: mods here

Martin C Crapper
So I was intentionally kicked

Yay! :)
00,03Does Violet EVER stop moving to the beat? O_O
So who is top left?
Well.... there were a LOT of members in the fan club.
Vivix, it does but the story is not included in the book he never finished it
I like the upper right one :3
Ranger_Striker: that's Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo: never!
otakon! y u no answer me
11,01John T Urinal?
Sauron: :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hell no! Thats what she does! :D
twilight_sprinkle: I didn't get a ping bc you typed Otakon I think

Either which way
04Lower left is Sumi, bottom middle is Wrek, lower right is Scoot-Scootaloo, mid-right is Phase4, upper right is Violet Vanilla, upper left is Nittany

Scoot-Scootaloo: I like your OC :)
Luna <3
Mid-right I'm pretty sure is Val, Ghosties.
That's not a OC
i need to start carrying a towel with me
WOONA
04Yeah, see, I thought it was Val too
WOONUH! :D
00,03Then again, I made one out of peer pressure...
Woona
WOONA
Mid Right is Phase4
luuuuunnnnnaaa
04But Sumi told me it was Phase
LUNA!!!!!!!!!!!! SHE MUST'VE FOUND GONDOR BY NOW!
7 ponies my god....
/me \ 8D /
nu, nu, I'm just going to bottle my feelings up and never tell her, even if it kills me
Phase4: You're getting confused with ValtheJeanD :
needs another pony
05,15dem Fs
:I
Longest credits ever?
04Phase and Val's OCs are exactly identical
I love that the mods can't identify Phase4's pony. x]
/me double slaps IshSexiestPony
mid left needs filling....
can someone pm me a link to moonstuck video?
7 ponies for the Dwarf Lords and their halls of stone
I thought Phase had kerbels exploding in a rocket for his desktop pony?
JESmith71: maybe
00,02i'm middle right
Woona:3
/me dodges
one more pony?
I SEE LUNA!
Did they need all those people because they actually killed them?
/me ties IshSexiestPony down
luna!
yay Luna!
/me nut kicks Bronysith
Oh, we're already in the F's? This will be over in no time.
PreciousShy: it is, you just cant see the rocket :P
Sumica: Put Phase4 On the left side of the scree.
IshSexiestPony: just say "hey i just met you. and this is crazy"
Oh, well that expalins it
Complete the square!
These are the fanclub members
00,02dat scoots rage
Phase4, what.... are you customizing a mech loadout there? o3o
Long as the Sonic Colors credits where they credit every Sega divison in the world
no
05,15New Line Cinema would like to thank the entire population of New Zealand
Bronysith:|
Marley: you could join the fanclub or pay to get on this list, so it's freaking massive and unrelated to the movie
thats a terrible idea
Just as long as you're aware that it will be extremely painful and in the long run you will hate yourself.
Sith you have the most useless advice I have ever encountered.
lol
Only in G? Wow...
eeyup
Meanwhile: it wasnt advice
I...have to agree with Meanwhile
otakon: so u didnt get ping again?
who are these ppl?
are these opening credits or ending?
we need another poneh
dem desktop ponies
IshSexiestPony: read her some vogonian poetry
superretroworld: just fans
these are the opening credits
Is anything going on after the movie
twilight_sprinkle: okya that time I did, what?
wait
because they want people to sit through them until the end raging
NO NOT THAT
superretroworld: Moderator OC's
Is anything going on after the movie?
Just be quiet.
going WHERE THE FUCK IS MY MOVIE
I'm still suprised.
04I'm sure there was a Hermione Granger in that list somewhere :P
otakon: wtf
Scoot-Scootaloo rage XD
Poetry. Really.
I made over 200+300+ frames total of sprites. ._.
/me facepalms
/me punchs Bronysith "that is how you hit a man"
really, that many people?
1,11So many names.
You're about as useful to this topic as a parachute on the Titanic.
Likes Lord of The Rings, gets in the movie credits. Seems legit.
otakon: i asked if i should watch the next movies or will i be spoiling too much
11,02Back ^-^ Did I miss the ending of Lord of the Rings? O.o
On,y shows up in the extrended cut. And if anyone can show ANY evidence of ANY movie -- in any version-- with longer ending credits I'll plotz.
lol
Sumica: okay this is wearing thin now
yes
wait til it gets down to the john's
twilight_sprinkle: WATCH THEM
then you will see at least 20 john's
when ever i see welovefine i think of wolfenstein
04You're just in time for the half hour credits, Super!
To be fair, with a little MacGyvering you could make a parachute into an acceptable life raft.
Scoot Scootaloo is playing "I wanna be the guy"
Yeah, they just pay to get on the list, I remember people I knew wanting to join the club to get on it
Sumica: please chipmunk it?
11,02Yay :D
05,15Do what I do and never ever say anything, and then when she asks YOU out, say you are busy and go home to play Skyrim
Aww... Woona! :)
@Faramir: Yes, your brother just died, JYI
otakon: mkay, i might make it to tomorrows one
FYI*
ha
Look at those credits!
but I don't have skyrim
/me wacks Samwise_Gamgee over the head, again
Scoot_Scootaloo Not that you have peer pressure.......You just do what everypony tells you in order to feel less insecure >_>
Parachutes have no buoyancy by themselves.
otakon: actually ill probably miss half of it..
1,11hmm...I wonder what I should have MY desktop pony do...?
Reikim: you can make a raft completely out of duct tape
gawd dammit!
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
<.<
GOT YA!
You'd give it some via said MacGyvering.
nothing else
/me runs off.
Is anything going on after the movie?
just duct tape
I am so totally reading every name <_<
Gimli_Son_of_Gloin: read out Trivia?

Gimili_Son_of_Gloin: Have random movie refs? Bring out a lightsaber, a ring, a top, shoot webs, etc.
and were only about half way through
OH GOD
If a girl asks you out, and this is not a common affair for you, and she is not psychotic/deranged/insane, then the smart thing to do, Samwise_Gamgee, is to accept with good grace, go home, and praise Celestia.
MAKE IT STOP!

Just to point there are 4 million of us so I doubt it
but this is rediculous
Krammer?
someone add a pony to the left middle

My god, these credits. I think they cover the entire soundtrack.
These aren't people that were involved in the movie at all thoguh, so skipping this would be no shame

Dealing with people is a complex affair that often consists of feeling blindly along a tunnel lined with spikes; but after you prick your fingers a few times, you start to learn where the spikes are, and after a while it becomes easier to see.

All in all, the moral of the story is that there is no "safe" way to deal with people. If you want to be safe, be a hermit. Each action you take in dealing with people is a risk; but in the majority of the cases, the gains will outweigh the risks.

Ouroboros: B.U.C.K is yes

I see a lot of bronies in TF2, more so than i've seen in any other game. Why?
Hi September :)

Sergio_Scriptor: howdy
because all of my normal tf2 servers are empty
September: Yes phase has two or three
oh jesus, dem sentry busters
ohai killerpony7733 and Sergio_Scriptor ;)
Hi Lil_B nice to see you again :)
Sergio_Scriptor the only 2 days I wasn't here was during last Saturday and Sunday and this Thursday because I slept most of the day XD
Lil_B: well the only time i im hable to be in here is during friday night and saturday and sunday :) the rest of the week im packed with highschool work :(
Lil_B: Hehe been here a while :P i'm in the match with the others

killerpony7733 I tried but my TF2 won't start
Lil_B: Awww
Lil_B: well enjoy while you can :)

Lil_B: lord of the rings :)

Lil_B: i think it's also Lord of the rings 2 and 3 :| so sorry man
:\

Yep :\
All 3 and extended version
The first one was 4 hours long :D
Thank God for that intermission half way through the movie
I will be there, but I will probably drop out here and there to do something diferent, I really find them boring
Lil_B: it's tastes :D
everyone likes different movies
yeah, if I somehow get Metropolis shown here, I will be amazen and everyone wlese will be bored XD
even though it's a Masterpiece
Lil_B: i would like to us to somedya see movie Battleship potemkin,altought no one would like it :D
a 150min silent movie with amazing score, superb acting and (for 1927) amazing special effects
Lil_B: it's a ncie movie and all,but im guessing there would be a LOT of person that would hate it :\
Lol I've been voting for my all time favourite movie: Forest Gump.
my msms
my mama told me life was like a bix of chochlates
:)
currently I'm voting for "The Seven Samurai" as A _movie and "Manitou's Shoe" as B-Movie
Lil_B: im voting for A movie "Singing in the rain" and for B movie "The Gold Rush( 1943 version) :)
I'm voting for nothing and getting a muffin for it.
Jmo4267 the Muffin is a Lie

There is still place for second place :=D

00,02nvm
00,02Spectrum_Rush wins

this site has just about all the G4 merch - http://www.strawberryreef.com/Index/Year/2011.html - if you're looking for a certain pony, it'll tell you if its a store exclusive or not.
No Octavia :(
may take awhile for the site to load, there's tons of pics
still waiting on my stuff my nightmare moon and zecora is on back order
No Octavia yet...but there's a Vinyl Scratch in the Collectors Set, Hasbro most likely will have Octavia in the future
Mai waifu
No Octavia? ;-;
BOLLOCKS TO THAT!
If they do a mucisians set - Lyra, Vinyl, Octavia would be perfect as a trio
Awkward moment when pony toys arrive in the mail and parents get to it first
AdamTheDuck: :D do they know you are a brony ?
Lets just say they are still wondering why I have Season 1 on my phone... :D
AdamTheDuck: XD
Whoa a glittery-transparent Fluttershy
you think your parents getting to your pony merch is bad? :P Try getting glares from the cashier at a store with a basket full of pony swag - that guy glared at me the whole time & asked questions - is this all for you? Aren't you too old for this?
o.O
Cypresswolf: XD yep that is usualy how it goes
Haha, that must be very uncomforting
well, not as much as looking behind me in line and seeing a couple of moms with their kids right behind me as he was ringing up my pony purchase :D
Haha
Cypresswolf: XD
Oh the perils of being a pony collector :P
^^^indeed :)
i'm going to be hated becuase of this but, i lost my blind bags :(
Flyboy: Lost? Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
D:
in my defense, i hid them from my parents a bit too well
i might look for them again now. brb
Flyboy: faillure sucess
i just found them in 5 seconds -.-
:D
Flyboy: :d :D :D
they were in a drawer next to my computer
i only need fluttershy then i have all the mane 6
Maybe they're secretly alive and wandered off on a toy story-like adventure - think about that one :P
i have twilight, rarity, applejack, pinkie, dashie and big mac
and half of them are on warhammer standd
stands*
Trixi-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
guys i had an awesome dream i dreamed that i had bought a toy pack of ponies that had vinyl scratch with octavia and lyra and bon bon in the pack with big macintosh
ok then
spitfirecolt: sounds like a lovely drean :)
All I want is Octavia... :(
it was
same here adam
Understand the concept of love?
I'm going to stop questioning the sense of the lyrics of these songs...
Good idea AdamTheDuck
I Wished MvM had an ability to join the robots,and then we could have more people :)
That'd be insanity.
Hmm, like versus in L4D
AdamTheDuck: exactly :)
I wonder if walmart sells poster tubes...I havent bought a poster in a couple of years, I have too many art prints & wall scrolls, wall space is nonexistent
All demo team? AWESOME xD
Hello Dragonmatte
I always either get into bad teams, or Tf2 crashes :S
Hi Dragonmatte :)
Hai :3
What is this song?
No idea
Like my teams can't get through one wave xD
Lucky you can get into a game at all
Yeah
Mine just goes time remaining: any second now
I have a few 5' x 8' vinyl movie promo posters for Legend of the Gaurdians, how do you get something of that size framed? O_o let alone load it up and haul them back home - I think I need a U-Haul trailor and a giant artwork crate
Once i finally do, i crash in the 2nd wave or something :S
to '?' and i'll wait another 20 minutes
I've lowered my video settings, so now it hopefully works
Hopefully
Also finished my first mann up yesterday :3
Got a robot scout hat :D
So much win
And it was like 15 mins before the servers were going down :3
I don't understang why valve did this lining up for server crap
understand*
One does not simply understand Valve.
Jmo4267: Oh you
;D
One of these years, I will get those framed...I just dont have the money for what I think they're going to cost to get just one of them framed
I love the last waves :3
I could turn this house into an art gallery :P
THose are the best :D
That'd be awesome to see Cypresswolf
It would be a funny looking art gallery - anime, foxes, & ponies :P
Black hole?
I'd love to see something like that.
and a few giant owls in the mix
Cypresswolf: XD sounds like a deal braker to me :)
Dat braker :3
I suppose that would be fitting - this house is already a zoo
they're Legend of the Gaurdian owls :)
does that make it better? :P
Dat Gaurdian. :<
It was already good when you said ponies :3
That was an awesome movie otherwise.
Soren, Digger, Klud, & Nyra
I <3 Digger
I watched through their eyes
Boltasar: well they are robots :|
still waiting on LotG 2 *taps foot*
I would so kick them for cheating, using aimbots. tsk
Boltasar: :D
also, man, the stream is one round behind
40 minutes...min-u-ets...til pony raid
Pony raid?
Dragonmatte: Yes, we're all gearin' up for the Raid.,
Aha
yesh, with Toys R Us sending out the Zecora toys before filling preorders, I'm heading down there to try to find one so I can cancel that preorder
they open at 9...a little over an hour from now
I wish more stoof was sold here :I
We used to have blind bags here, but they stopped selling them for some reason
I'm still finding series 1 blind bags here - 2 has been out for awhile, but never stocks

I dont feel like going anywhere today - my aunt Karen is visiting from Oklahoma, but its been over 100 degrees here all week...can be bothered to mow the yard at all today :P thats what sundays are for
Wakey Wakey, Engie
Cypresswolf: indeeed :)
Uuuuugh, i wanna play MvM, but i know it will crash or we would get stuck at first wave >.<
And i would have to wait in an hour :S
I just stop, rage then flip table and end up going back to Killing Floor :P
Dragonmatte: i know that feel brother :'(
Seems legit
Pony up boys!
I feel them SFM pony movies coming xD
