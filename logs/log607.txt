1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett's role as Galadriel required her to film for only a month.

LUCY LAWLESS
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett joked that she took the role of Galadriel because, "I've always wanted pointy ears".
Yar. I always found this scene cool.

04The right voice too
Her eyes are her iconic stature of actress.

audio up
that chick is creepin me out (O_O)
RP rooms are supposed to be pretty lax about banning.
No pressure
TIP: Don't fail
IT BEGINS.
Jedi mind tricks
I think Lucy woujld play comedy well, but it would be really weird t osee her in a movie like this
Boss Time!
OMG

In other words, no pressure
OMG
this part
No, exactly that
and then RARITY!
I've only seen her in joke roles

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Over 12.5 million plastic rings were made in order to fabricate simulated chain mail for the movie.

i couldnt ever find a copy of the hobbit somehow
00,10spot check fail
naruto was great until about season 3
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the cast are traveling on screen, they always walk from the left of the screen to the right, never the other way around. This is because of the movie convention that West-East travel is represented by left-right movement.
00,10you bastards you blew it up!
Inb4 Best Movie Scene in a LONG time
just my opinion though'
Silmarillion?
One does not simply gather sticks
I swear if anyone spoils Naruto for me.
I am an adult!
Isn't that the one about Sauron's origins and the thing worse than him?
We're down to the last hour about now, right?

0,14I was really hoping that Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation of At The Mountains of Madness would get made
To the person with the sound board, where does that "whoaa" effect come from
He doesn't use a soundboard.
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO TOUCH YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO!
