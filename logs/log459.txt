I remember that song now freaking hilarious
And now it's not awkward anymore. Weird.
Not a minute too soon
where's pinkie!!
If school dances were actually like this, I would go to them
TACOS!!!
I don't remember Home Alone having a scene like that
the glasses are off
/me shuffles
Call it a hunch, but I think they're about to do a montage.
but they aren't
/me dances with pinkie pie
*dances*
So' 'op.
"dances like mad"
lol
Dat groove.
Got to get that title song in there
It is to my school's eternal shame that they didn't even play this once during our senior prom.
OK, I got a confession.
/me sits in the corner drinking heavily.
*DACNCES LIKE A BEAST*
I gotta cut footloose.
04Everyone do the pogo!
boogy down
get those damn lights out of the fucking cam
04Oh wait, this is the 50's
