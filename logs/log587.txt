01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Jim Henson personally trimmed twenty minutes from the film after a disastrous preview in San Francisco.

DIDNT WATCH MNOST OF IT ?/10
HmmmmmmmMmmmMMMmmm!!!/10
01,11Yes, a few aspects are old hat and cliche, but the story is creative and original, the design is enjoyably dark, the characters, while kinda cliche, are enjoyable and at least a little memorable, and above all, it has this sense of timlessness to it, just like almost any project Henson's been a part of.

yay more Krummhorns
Spectrum_Rush|: i did it first :
Shizuka: the 80's were AWESOME!
/me dances
they give us CMC, right?
Once again......i gotta say this was a very interesting movie....the visuals were creative, the philosophy was engaging..........the characters while a little cliche, are still enjoyable, and still with it's flaws, and dark scenes, it still hold up today as a timeless classic, kinda like Jim Henson's Muppets meet NeverEnding Story........i give it a 8.6.
reminds me of Gryphon
08,01crumhorns? in my pony episode?
Kencolt: did you SEE the soul stealing scene?
Then 90s... DDDDDUUUUUUDDDDEEEE
what was this movie called?
it would kind of interesting if mlp did a small crossover or parody of this
i'd give it an 8/10
lakingsfans: the dark crystal
I give it a 7.5/10

FEET?!
Pony manes have nerve endings have been canon since this episode

Meanwhile: it's a boy meets girl story with crazy videogame inspired fistfights
13what remains are eligible
Chimicherry changa?
11,02Do they want the edited version or non-edit?
Shizuka: wait...was my B on that list?
11,01Give them the "correct" version.
11,02Guess we'll have to go with the edited one...

8,6so to recap, our movie night for next week will be

hope you guys dont mind
8,6B Movie: Endhiran - RainbowcrashNBurn
8,6Pony 1: The Last Round Up - Riders
8,6Pony2: Cutie Pox - WhatPayne
06:D Yay~ Scott Pilgrim~!

11,01DJNilla!
13of the list, two Bs were eliminated for being unsuitable for movie night (animatrix is shorts, the lorax is 25 minutes or else far too recent)
06<3
Shizuka: ah
11,01Also, remember that we've changed our lottery a bit.
05posting it on the frontpage kirz :D
13about 3 As were eliminated for being too recent to be safe to acquire
11,01It closes Thursday now.
13the rest were As filed as B, or Bs filed as A
double ah
11,01We still roll during intermission though.
13liebe vivi~<3
yay Vi is in
11,01This way, we won't spend 30 mins figuring out if what we rolled was A or B.
Well, could be worse then.
1330?
13we were up for three hours debating
8,6I'd also like to remind everypony that we are holding an art contest from now until the end of August, and are looking forward to having as many people participate that are able. If you'd like to have a chance at the prizes, you can find all of the details for the contest here: http://www.bronystate.net/2012/07/13/bronystate-presents-the-summer-art-celebration/
art contest?
right, time to go to wreks art thingies at BUCk
13has been up for weeks...
and cheat to win :D
11,01If you'd like to keep our work down, read up on A and B definitions in the FAQ and don't be afraid to ask us if you're not sure.
Except when they do.
But shh. Morals.
/me hugs Shizuka tight
no, but ill at least then have some semblance of artistic merit
13We will be stripping the names from the lottery and posting the full list of entries, with invalid votes marked red. This way you can all learn what does and doesn't count in each category.
06und if you support VixShizuka then say Derpy after the -m! c:
11,01And check and see if the movie is eligible for reshow. We have a past movies list on the site.
13und if you don't support vivi x me... i will hit you with a pool noodle :<

Barbetos|AtWork: and added CG

/me is trying to remember what she wanted to tell otakon last night
if otakon is banned then who will take his thrown as most kicked
Shizuka: Any plans to either move the timer to the top right or remove the cut out during intermissions in the future?
i shall pass in the test :)
Rain: He probably spelt something wrong.
13not my cutout
Dinky and Derpy, so adorable.
13and as the intermission took over an hour to render
13nope

Rain: well, any luck remembering?
no, Meanwhile, I thought something randomly last night and wanted to tell otakon
13and as the intermission was designed around the timer being in the lower right
13nope
Rain: He has a large head?
Shizuka, was there a problem with my entry?
/me tires to remember

suddenly sonic
Why is there so much hating in the chat btw? What happend Betwen Liokin and otakon ?
So, now that drama's done....what's on stream?
MaxTheBrony: he just doesn't like me

Scott Pilgrim Versus The World <3

Dat blood eagle flag
Yeah, Sumica!
otakon: Anything you said? or any topic that may have been discussed?

I think they have the flag
EARTHBOUND?!?! OMg
OMG*
I think Liokin is a pretty cool guy, eh is a dick and doesn't afraid of anything
Wait, is Sumi still streaming?
i went for a random encore this time just for the hell of it
00,10like the sight for the fusion morter
oooo, excellent
00,10no wrek is streaming now
i shouldve picked Gladiator tbh :/
Yeah. I remember when skiing was a glitch. Now it's elevated into a basic game mechanic.
Thought so
had i known i was going to win
I think alcohol is involved
Man, I have no clue what game this is. o.o
CriticKitten: Its Tribes Acend
CriticKitten: tribes ascend

Tribes

Hey RustyMeat :)
its the game where you rollerblade on grass
Heya RustyMeat
hai RustyMeat
I'm about ready to throw my laptop out the window
hai moonshine :o
This reminds me of every single LAN party I have ever attended.
Pinkies4thWall: Why ^^
Pinkies4thWall: lol why?
ded
this is not how you repair a laptop, Pinkies4thWall
Pinkies4thWall: do it upload it to youtube then get instant views
well at least you win :p and scott is a nice movie :3
use a hammer
Killed by: Running into a wall too fast.
00,10dat stealth pack
shazbot
I remember in Tribes 2, Inventory Stations and Vehicle Stations could be destroyed. And Repair packs could heal players
shazbot
Fucking thing won't show stream and chat in the same window
Shazbot!
MaxTheBrony: Naw, I already got a future addiction in the form of GW2, don't need more. xD
yay GW2
CriticKitten: heh :D Me too
CriticKitten: I love you...what race/prof?
Pinkies4thWall: what IB are you using?
Dat motion blur

I want a Brony state Guild ;p
00,10this realy needs brodside
http://cheezburger.com/6464910592
nd windows update come to ruin my day with over 100 updates to be download
MaxTheBrony: Agreed, that has to happen
/me is memeber from a guild
i want a COD Elite Bronystate clan
meh
Call of duty?
MaxTheBrony: I'd volunteer to help make it, but I'm too busy with Team Legacy :P
Likely gonna run a Sylvari Ranger as a main. I found it absurdly effective to lay down Grasping Vines, then drop Barrage on top of that.
Ew, COD :L
yeah and also a halo reach clan
Heh :) Im Not the guy who should be running a guild :)
who want's one TF2 dedicated server for BS?
Hm? What's going on now?
MaxTheBrony: Guild for what?
Nabronyan: Gw2
Michael: MEEE
otakon: chrome AND firefox are brokemn
^^
Summer Wars is done. Finally
*broken
Pinkies4thWall: it's your flash then, update it
AttacktheAndalite: summer wars is awesome
CriticKitten: cool beans. I'm gonna go sylvari necro for WvW and asura Warrior for sPvP and PvE
just for the lolz
Summer Wars? Now there's a movie I'd like to see again :3
Pinkies4thWall: clear cache, clear history, check version, disable ANT video downloader if you have it
cachi01: I just finished downloading it. I think it finished a few hours ago but oh well
You gotta love the Asura with a hammer xD so cute
Polydunami: you just might
MaxTheBrony: I like them for their /laugh emote and their witty golems
00,10oh right tribes uses the flag has to be at home to be able to cap it
I first saw it about two or three years ago.
Well if it didn't it'd be over faster than it is anyway.
Or something...
Recon speed is lunacy.
I saw it the first time a couple nights ago on here.
^
oh otakon http://wigflip.com/roflbot/ is bit better in then memegenerator imo
Allegr0: I havent seen them emotes yet :D that i gotta se
goddamn now THAT was a jump
So this game. What is it?
MaxTheBrony: just look it up on youtube, they literally rofl
Polydunami: tribes ascend
I see.
damn, i'm tired :(
00,10fast respauns
Allger0: Seems good. I'm hoping we end up with a BronyState guild at some point, too. :P
[MILF]
haha xD so cute asura , rolling and tapping the floor xD
CriticKitten: or at least have some organized brony guild, like with reddit folks and the like
dem MILFS
Spectrum_Rush|: nice, thanks but this is what I did http://cheezburger.com/6464910592
By the way, Allegr0, I'm afraid I'm going to miss tonight's stream. I'm away for the whole evening :/
lol
Pinkie Pie truly is a pain in the ass :3
Polydunami:that's fine :) , just be on the lookout for next week's show :P
Im going to stay up until 3 pm xD thats when the stream starts , and i will stay as long as my mind can bare :)
Polydunami: DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Polydunami: and make sure to ask around for the question of the week!
otakon: http://i.imgur.com/924vm.jpg me to :D
What stream?
With Giga and Allegro
:D
lol Spectrum_Rush|
Allegr0: Aye. Anything of that nature would be good. I may avoid the forums come release, though. They're rather nasty at times.
Hm? I didn't know anything about a question of the week :S
dammit we need WREKMENTARY!
CriticKitten: aren't all official forums? :P
wut
anyway brb again
Allegr0: GW2's is especially bad though. The fanboism borders on fanticism.
Mornin' everyone, who's streaming? :)
hi AdamTheDuck
wrek is
Hey there AdamTheDuck!
Mornin' AdamTheDuck wrek is :)
sup AdamTheDuck
Heya AdamTheDuck
Don't dare even imply that something might be wrong with their perfect game, or they'll burn you at the stake :p
O.o AdamTheDuck is it morning for you?
yep MaxTheBrony
Where do you live?
and what game is this?
Also, cachi01, I don't think Pinkie Pie is a pain in the butt or anything.
Australia
dainbow_rash: Tribes
Ah
:)
Polydunami: :)
CriticKitten: true, though ANet is trying really hard to moderate it well
CriticKitten: they've done better than most companies I've seen
nvm that message Allegr0 just checked
None of the mane six are worst ponies in my opinion.
I sure hope that Gw2 Doesnt Fail like Swtor did
:)
well, Gnight everypony, i'm to tired tonight :)
Good night Michael :)
I just wish I could see more of Applejack in the show itself :S
/me hugs cachi01 , MegaMoonShine , Polydunami, Michael and MaxTheBrony. Whoa thats a long list
applejack doesnt get the love she deserves
:D
I love AJ ^^
dem freckles
I'm heading off too. Thanks for another awesome movie night guys! :)
i liek frekulz :3
Allegr0: Eh, to a minimal degree.
... Okay, that was obnoxious :S
Night MegaMoonShine
byeee MegaMoonShine
Heya Waffles
:)
Night MegaMoonShine
Goodnight MegaMoonShine!
Sumica you present?
HI MaxTheBrony :$
bye MegaMoonShine take care
00,10yeah what's up
Allegr0: For example I saw a guy get ripped apart by posters for (not kidding) suggesting that Rangers should start with a sword or bow instead of a throwing axe. >_>
Sumica: why does it say I can never win under the "how movies are chosen" bit on the rules page?
CriticKitten: yeah...people are gonna do that :/
wow iwas just gonna ask you that Meanwhile
00,10eh?
xD
Allegr0: And I was like "Um, dude has a point, the GW2 homepage states that Rangers are masters of the bow. And traditional RPG Ranger classes do also wield swords iconically....but NOT throwing axes."
Dat sudden rock music xD
Allegr0: People were like "Durr hurr but GW2 is different herp"
00,10Where does it say that Meanwhile?
http://www.bronystate.net/faq/ The hell?
Dat Battle Rock :)
CriticKitten: lol
Sumica: the very bottom
Sumica: FAQ "How are the Brony Movie Night movies chosen?"
CriticKitten: fanbois will be fanbois
CriticKitten: What class and race are you ging to play?`?
going*Ä
Allegr0: No kidding. But you'd think their mothers had been insulted, some of 'em.
Surely this is just a joke.
00,10who's oatmeal did you piss in Meanwhile?
MaxTheBrony: I've got several characters planned, but I'll main a Sylvari Ranger. It seems the most effective combination I've witnessed
Ah :D
Btw What does the Asura have as Pet?
Sumica: I don't know. To be honest, you can keep it there if you want I just wanted to know why it was there.
And sylvary
sylvari*
ola
/me eats ALL the oatmeal
It seems like a joke to me.
Heya pony_7384
00,10Not entirely sure Meanwhile. I am sure some one was trying to be cute.
Personally it made me giggle.
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/292973_385293041536245_953788840_n.jpg
My computer is broken. FUCK MY LIFE
MaxTheBrony: Sylvari gets to choose between a moa, a fern dog, and a stalker kitty.
Meanwhile: i eagerly await the day your choice comes up... just to see waht happens :D
Dunno about asura.
:)
Ah
:)
hyjmnu
:D
:(
Spectrum_Rush|: "Rerolled because Meanwhile"
:S
;);););););)
Meanwhile: almost sounds like an unfinished sentence there
pony_7384: Please dont spam Emotes ^^
oh we are watching scott pilgrim? WOOHOOO
Wow, I was watching and thought to myself that Wrek's having the same problem that I do... then he made a sweet kill, and I realized that he's still better than me.
Skill =/=/= level
sex =/=/= 100
O.o
lolwut?>
Yeah... Scott Pilgrim... woo hoo.
the ammount of ammusement in Polydunami is TOO DAMN HIGH
God I'm really starting to hate that announcer's voice...
slow chat or my computer derping again?
AdamTheDuck, that's the Diamond Sword announcer.
00,10oh did you win a WMC movie Meanwhile
slow chat Dovah
Sumica: I've only ever won a pony episode. And that was a year ago.,
lol
Well this guy doesn't sound so bad ;)
00,10this reminds me of wow battle grounds
pootis
How goes life folks?
00,10ingnore any one in the midfield
Heya Ann :)
a milf killed wrek
hi Ann!
Ah, this is that "free-2-play" game with jetpacks and such eh?
Eeyup
Ann: and rockets!
Ann: and going 200mph
I've been wondering if it's worth the download.
and skiing
o.O
diamond sword!
00,10not so much on rockets
Ann, it is
I don't get it; why is Perfect Blue considered a B movie?
*puts on dl list*
00,10more spinfusors and fusion morters
Ann: well it's free so unless you're on a dataplan it wouldn't hurt to check it
Polydunami: Anime
5 Centimetres per Second is an A movie.
Well, I'm actually stealing my neighbours net because my ISP is being... beligerant >.<
Polydunami: there is no anime out there that is A except for maybe Miyazaki movies
ok operation make homemade pizza was a success
Or is eligible to be an A movie.
/me dances to the pizza
I used to vote for One Piece Movie 10 as an A Movie.
Kandarihu: if only man, if only
otakon: What about end of evangelion?
Kandarihu: the ONLY canon movie
AdamTheDuck: screw that noise
All this talk about pizza and movies makes me want to watch Samurai Pizza Cats again.
;)
:S
Ann: good taste!
Best joke dub ever.
Medium is not enough to be B-movie material.
:P
my team lost
AdamTheDuck: I'm sorry I don't like NGE at all. I don't like the characters or the situation at BEST the mech and technical designs are awesome.
well for me at best
its been 8 months since I last tried to buy minecraft. Should I try again?
Has any streamer streamed Korra , Adventure time , or any of those types?
I understand, it's not for everyone
Dovah: do yo9u have enought money?
MaxTheBrony: korra yes
You know what else was eligible as an A movie? Grave of the Fireflies
otakon: yes
Adventure Time = <3
:'(
:O
3
MaxTheBrony: Korra yes, Adventrue Time no
I come for my dily dose of pony...and whatever this game is. BTW heya everypony.
I wish Adventure Time, but not eveyone's cup of tea and hiya icybeauti
ohai icybeauti
hi icybeauti!! u late ponies already ended
Adventure time episodes are perfect for intermission :)
I've just started watching Avatar (third episode) so Korra wouldn't mean anything for me.
So your anime argument is invalid.
heya otakon cachi01 AdamTheDuck MaxTheBrony
Guys, I got some great news! My dad got approved for a liver transplant at Duke Hospital! :)
Ann: The last air bender :D? It is awesome :)
Ann: korra has nothing to do with Atla
Heya icybeauti ^^
I had to go to bed. I had to pick up my cheerleading stuff
I thought it was a prequil or some such?
[spelling]
Dovah: Not so much but it is really awesome felling to see the old cast as adults
Fisheh_Fish: congratulations
AdamTheDuck: Thank you :)
for some reason, my spelling is always worst on this site.
Fisheh_Fish: Thats awesome :D
MaxTheBrony: yeah but you wont be missing anything if you watch Korra first
Also, you can't tell me that split second clips of nudity disqualifies the movie from A movie status; after all, Requiem for a Dream had full frontal nudity and was still considered an A movie.
I'm not even going to lie, spell check destroyed my spelling. I do try to make an effort now though.
Dovah: Only Emtionaly ^^
Emotionaly*
I spent last night watching a doc on north korea, began a Q episode, then watch some pony. Then I went to bed after some pony,
*computer
heh
Wait Requiem for a dream was once streamed here and I missed it!?!
O.o
So, what movie are we bebating is "A" or "B"?
Both :D
I still never learned how to enter the lotto, and I did sign up for the newsletter.
Perfect Blue seems to be classified as a B movie.
The shark movie?
Oh nvm
I thought about Deep blue sea for somereason
I didn't know there was a shark movie called Perfect Blue.
^^
Wrong movie
THERE ARE OTHER EPISODES PICKED BESIDES FLUTTERSHY!!!
I was looking at the spreadsheet for this week's lottery picks, actually.
Deep blue is an anime is it not?
Perfect Blue.
er yes
That's what I meant.
and the last roundup was picked. I'm quiet happy about that.
so otakon should I try to buy minecraft again or no?
And still labeled as a B movie.
Ooh what's that movie? With the goldfish girl?
I know what the A movie is, but I've never heard of the B.
So, what really classes something as B movie. Since it's budget based, primarily, what does one have to spend on a movie to make it "A" these days?
I think they should stream Battle Royal :3
Ann A is like big blockbuster and B is hipster movie.
And she likes eating ham. Uhh what is it called?...
Poyo?
Wait there everypony, i'll be back in one minute.
Im waiting xD
/me is confused
So would you consider The Princess Bride to be a B movie?
um yes
Polydunami: Yes
Is it?
Well, Paranormial activity was pretty low budget, but fits in "A". And there's some pretty non-hipster B movies. Arthouse movies, on a whole, are very hipster, but they're disclouded.
Right it was ponyo. : S
ah
:)
Shazbot
What about the pokemon movies? I was going to pool in the first one next week.
Actually, yeah, it's a B movie. Cult classic and all.
;)
It seems to be just public perception these days.
B's
ALL POKEMON MOVIES ARE B's
PERIOD
True
Okay Thank you.
Possibly C.
END OF DISCUSSION
I think the pokemon movies are actually As
RX-78-SweetieBot: -____________-
Dat kick
lol
Pulp Fiction was A at the time, but is considered "cult" and "hipster" now. *shrugs* who really knows.
My olest brother remembers seeing the first 2 in theatres.
how do you enter this lottery thing-a-ma-jig?
MaxTheBrony: don't forget Princess Mononoke
oh look, in the list shizu posted someone put the first pokemon movie as a B and shizu corrected them that it is an A
otakon: I actually havent seen it D:
Dovah: Newsletter.
Dovah: enter the newsletter, send a mod your email
Dovah: Sign up for the newsletter
Dovah: Sign up for the newsletter, then after that, I have no idea
MaxTheBrony: you should, good movie
I see
otakon: I will then :)
13it was a collaborative effort
icybeauti: The link to the lottery is in the newsletters. :P
RX-78-SweetieBot: bull how is Pokemon a A
Heya Shizuka
/me facehoof
Shizuka: HOW is Pokemon a A?
otakon: ask the mods
hi shi hows everything going
I am and hello spitfirecolt
otakon: an*
WHATEVER!
otakon, the budget behind it
Heya spitfirecolt
hay guys
if you're any fan of animation all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies are worth watching.
Yeah
For the most part.
it doesn't even have the animation quality to back that budget though.....
Exactly :D
when is the documentary coming out
otakon, the same way The Brave Little Toaster is an A
When it's done I suppose.
Ann, yus
Rain: but that one is acutually GOOD
So much flag stealing in this game.
YEr
Rain: and not some damn pandering of pokemons to children
Oh god, the hours spent as a child watching TBLT
Okay, I'm going to head out now.
Ann: TBLT?
I can't imagine a fandom overlap with the likes of Beavis & Butthead and Miyazaki.
Later Ploy
bye Polydunami take care!
Bye Polydunami
The Brave Little Toaster
I'm out for the entire evening so I'll see you guys tomorrow!
otakon, tell me you didnt get teary eyed when as was turned to stone and pikachu was hopelessly trying to schock him back to life
Otakon, why do you hates the pokeymans?
Aw you gonna miss the stream D:
I'm out.
and then I will believe you
Bye Polydunami
melons
Rain: enope bc I KNEW it wasn't the end.
i did rain i got tearyed eyed
It's Scott Pilgrim is it not tonight?
Rain: plus the very ending makes the movie pointless
k I'm gonna check the EQD for any news on release date brb
Ann: That's next week.
Hell, I cry for most sappy movie things >.<
Ann: No that's next week
Ann: next week, you missed this weeks movies by about 5 hours
Ah, thanks.
has anypony streamed IB?????
Ann: the four minutes in UP
otakon: everyone knew it wasnt the end. Doesnt mean the emotion of the scene is lost.
and this is?
RX-78-SweetieBot: Brave Little Toaster had more emotion
Alpha-Omega: tribes ascend
Alpha-Omega: it's Tribes: Ascend
Brave Little Toaster is best Toaster.
Wait, season 3 is only getting 13 episodes :'(
otakon: It did. Thats because toasters rule.
cool?
dammit Meanwhile for once we agree on something.
Meanwhile: and woodentoaster?
"Followed by something more" or soemthing to that accord.
night guys
i love brave little toaster meanwhile
Meanwhile: would that be a B or A, i say A
cachi01: Catches fire.
night alexxm sleep well
Don't worry, 13 or not, they'll deliver.
I know the brave little toaster, where was that from again?
Meanwhile: and the derpy decorative toaster cozy?
icybeauti: Disney
otakon: Now i remeber!
Downloading..now
icybeauti: good movie
cachi01: Should never be spoken of again.
say that on tv when it first came on
Meanwhile: stay outta my shed...
...
Fifel goes West was pretty awesome, while we're on the topic of old animated movies.
care with referances to .mov
shed outta my stay
i think it was but i saw it on disney channel
*careful
The sworders have our flag. >:I
I wonder what would happen if you tossed The Doctor into the movie Independence Day.
Must
cachi01, Stay outta mah shed >:D
I've always like "Goes West" better to be honest.\
EspyLacopa: they'd win faster
Fifel is best jewish family.
Ann: well it's definitely more action packed but I like the first AT better, more emotion.
fievel goes west was good but not as good as the first
What about a disney movie like the lion king or even sleeping beuaty?
icybeauti: yes to that too
i dont like disney tale movies
we REALLY need a Disney week or something
Yeah otakon :D
You know, that new Princess Frog was it, was actually suprisingly good.
wait...Disney Tales?
^^^
sleeping bueaty over lion king for me
Sounds awesome
Ann: yes it was
the really alterate a lot i mean they are good but they are not showig the true story
Ann Did you see tangled? I really enjoyed that one too.
Also, Tangled was pretty good too
tangled was hilarious :)
tangled was meh
I did, I was honestly suprised it was that good. I had low hopes but nope.
I just remembered why my itunes derps so much. I have 26 gb of stuff in there :P
otakon: more like a disney month... or 2
Dat shot.
Alpha-Omega: lol time to clear it out
I dont like Itunes at all D:
Spectrum_Rush|: yeah, recently I've been putting Beauty and the Beast on for my A
Noooooo it's all the my little pony episodes
I think it's disney channel and the IRL movies that disney sucks on. The animation usually doesn't fail us. Remeber phineaus and ferb?
:O
tangled was good but frog princess was better
http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f295/annomander/4262012005454iwsmt.jpg
*nods* I can agree with that.
otakon: ooh very good choice there

Thanks.
Yeah that pic kicks ass
lol ann that was awesome
Ann: LOLOL
Ann: Soo awesome! /)^.^(\

I used to not like it, but it grew on me
Nittany_Discord: same here
What's he playing?
Tribes
turtlegod98: Tribes
I rewatched all the dragonbal series
Pokemon, Yugioh, Medabots, Beyblades, so many...
Nittany_Discord: that usually peoples first
Nittany_Discord: you know, i wouldnt blame you for thinking anime is stupid after seeing dbz
11,01The stuff that showed on Adult Swim changed my opinion.
I loved Dragonball Z.
code lyoko
Ahaha, ya we rewatched two seasons of Dragon Ball in the field.
Winnie the Pooh
i dont like code lyoko but
How many times can i be kicked until i get banned?
he runs awfully fast.
Lol naw StoryLine
it part of my childhood
Code lyoko seemed interesting to me
How was that recent Winnie the Poo movie? The one that had all the old VA's? And I do mean old...
it was kinda
the flintstones
Ann It was awesome
:)
Code Lyoko... ew...
I'm going to soudn like a girl, but remeber lizzie mcguire?
Remember the toonami from the 2000's?
11,01twilight_sprinkle: Yeah. I thought all anime was like DBZ for a while until I started watching other shows.
I expected it to be.
icybeauti: lol
Fisheh_Fish: Best Toonami.
is their any gravity?
You know 20 somethings have seen Winnie the Pooh at some point
HE was awesome
icybeauti Lizzie Ncguire was the shit
Toonami....that was the greatest thign evar.
Yeah
O.
o
I never really watched any Disney live action honestly. I was always into cartoons.
didn't see it
Omg i reamember
Toonami was fucking bad ass in 2000
Ann: most of them suck
Remember slime time live?
Hell yeah :D
Sailor Moon
Oh my gosh yes
disney today sucks!
^^
Oh, here's one, Bump in the Night, or Afraid of the Dark. Yeah, I just dropped that.
I don't care what anyone says, I loved mulan
slime time wasnt aired on mexico so no :(
When did shows nowadays start sucking -_-
Nittany_Discord: thankfully i managed to avoid dbz, despite being surrounded for all the hype for it. even as a little kid i somehow was bored to hell with it, when i rewatched it as an adult i understand why
I was too young for those, gotta check em out
Well Disney's buisness profile has changed.
Pixar is the new disney
Sumica: Is there any limits how many times i can be kicked? i have been kick 117 times so far :) by writing to fast
mulan. the movie that shows you that being a travesti is fine
I will be honest though, I never really got into Cinderella
Most shows now don't suck, there's just a lot of shovelware out there so to speak. Also many of us wear our nostalga glasses way too much.
00,10it's not just your kicks MaxTheBrony
Lol true dat cachi01
MaxTheBrony: no, sumica kicked somepony 117 times

I wasn't :3

Tribes

Alpha-Omega: i hope you make lotsaspaghetti!
Ah ok lol
Hello everypony

Heya Rarityisboss

Hai Rarity :D
Oh god, no more sketties >.< I made too much and had to eat it for a week. Don't get me wrong it was epic, but just too much.

Headshot....
I didn't have a computer until I was 17 and people look at me like I'm crosseye'd.

twilight_sprinkle: not as good as the first one biut yes
Haha I remember going to the library playing Runescape after school xD
I remember when my library had movies... Good times
I wish they would produce a Pokemon anime following the story of the Manga.
Simba in swahili means lion
I gave my vhs to my nephew...BIG mistake.
It's worth watching.

Ann, we have to pay for movie rentals at our library
cachi01: hm kk
What madness is that!
SPARTA
Rarityisboss: yeah, theres a stream
Derp
11,01Sounds like there's a kid with a soundboard on there.
Remember Blockbuster and renting a game because you were to poor to own a game
:)
Remeber razor scooters.
I miss movie rental places, mostly because renting a game was cheaper then dropping 60 dollars.
I'm waching it right now
Oh, you beat me to it Storyline
StoryLine: i still do that :I
Me to
Jurrassic Park, that is
11,01Or someone's spamming voice bits.

PINKIE PIE Rarityisboss
Derpy
11,01Rarityisboss: Rainbow Dash
Rarityisboss, Applejack
Rarity
I'd say Rainbow Dash Rarityisboss
Honestly Derpy, because of what she represents.
Rarityisboss: Luna
Underpony: Too poor to buy games? Yar har fiddley dee dee...
Rarity people. Hands down.
i love the soundboard vids on yotube like "Schwarzenegger plays COD" or "Samuel Jackson plays COD"
Luna i must say :)
Ok best Playstation one game
of the main 6 though TS.
Meanwhile: lol
Ann agreed
the fun has been doubled
Twilight
Hmm best ps1 game
I liked Sam L plays CoD
/me smacks Meanwhile with a rolled up newspaper
StoryLine: mmmmm crash bandicoot?
Rarityisboss: I take mine back. All ponies are best ponies
Crash bandicot on ps1 ruled :D
Yes Crash Bandicoot
11,01If you go to the "Our Staff" page on our site, our favorite ponies are there.

Best PS1 game: Valkyre Profile and Einhander.
Final Fantasy IX

Valkyre Profile.
applejack096 dat massping :D
twilight_sprinkle: i bought both
do you guys think Rarity is okay? :P
cachi01: did you like it?
Yer

Hey, FFXIII isn't bad. That's the one with Vhann right?
Rarity is nice
00,10Dont mass ping please applejack096
11,02applejack096: Hey, please don't do mass pings, thanks :)
twilight_sprinkle: yes

cachi01: i heard it was incredibly linear
08,01applejack096: don't mass ping or i'll eat you
I like Rarity. one of the top ponies
Oh lordy :3
I remember playing Duke Nukem 3D
Well of course FF's are linear!
It's a JRPG.
Well after it came out, though
:(
twilight_sprinkle: FFXIII is cool but FFXIII-2 IT RAPES YOUR FUCKING MIND
Ann: i suppose to some degree yeah
08,01omnomnom
I remember i played Sc1 with my friends Coop ^^
:[
Ann you are so right
on the same computer
Ok gys :) Didnt know it was one of the rules. Sorry my bad :)
Applejack/Twilight > Rarity/Pinkie > Futtershy/Rainbow
so superBrony and Violet like derpy too....SWEET
(but that's just like my opinion man)
cachi01: yeah lol i got that impression after watching Jon Trons parody of it
Only one of you mods like Rarity :(
It's been a while since I've played a good JRPG though. I miss epic sprawling stories. Those kind of storylines that you go to bed thinking about.
you guys ever heard of team fortress 2
O:o
Nope
what is that?
no
Rarityisboss: oh yeah that cod ripoff
TF2 = so much god damned win.
>Good JRPG
lol no
[00:54:49]* #bronystate :Cannot send to channel - Message blocked due to repeating (+K set) ?
fluttershy is always the fave....
It's too violet for me
^^
I own FFXIII and XIII-2 and think they are "good" games. But they suck in FF srandard
11,01Go Wrek.
you know why Rarity is my favorite?
Why?
Who is streamng this?
Why?
What makes them bad anyhow? I never played them, but I'm just wondering.
because in tf2 shes the spy
oh
11,01Rarityisboss: Do you want to be a maid?
11,01:p
God... damn... spies
11,01^
Spies...

I never really was on your side.
Allegro and giga where are you D: Damn swedish time
:S
I never played TF2
O.o

And here's a touchin' story, once upon a time you died. And I lived happily ever after.
D:
MaxTheBrony: in less than 40 mins

ive been a maid
I don't like multiplayer in general
hi MaxTheBrony
anything else?
Spectrum_Rush|: ah thanks :D
Ann: And then suddenly, someone who knows what they're doing.
Heya Rarityisboss :)
TF2 is one of those games that I keep coming back to.
11,01Zanon: Nice.
Yeah, then you get raped...
Ann: the story is to upbeat for a FF game
GIANT FOREST MAP FTW!
/me feels somehwat suspicious now
so this game is like a giant hl2-engine surf map?
Ah, fair enough.
Reminds me of Endor...
hey guys have you waching th olmpyics

I haven't
oh
I'm downloading the opening cermonies :p
And I live in London
hohoho
Rarityisboss: i havent been following much besides the tennis

So, Pinkie Pie is the best pony. Glad we all agree.

Underpony: lol silly underpony you mispelled pinkie pie

O.o
Meanwhile: Yes, Luna definetly is best pony
Bai everypony

bye applejack096!
Ann: I still like it but don't expect a normal FF game. The Music is so amazing though. I dare say it competes with FF7 music wise
Rarityisboss: yeah theyve been out for a while (and not allowed to talk about them here btw)
Applejack gets a boost in my books only because of the episode where she was sleep fucked.
bye applejack096
Spectrum_Rush|: luna is best princess
Ann: whut
Byeeeee :) ;)
Rarityisboss I've got a spoiler for you! Ponies will face conflict, followed by resolution!
I really should play it, but having a PS3 that isn't backward compatible makes it hard.
I heart AppleJack
Allegr0: woah.
Rarityisboss don't tell anyone :P
kk
Ann: same here :(
:D
11,01http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/545/2hcov88.jpg/

Ann: i cant play ps2 games but i can play ps1 games O_o
Applebucking Season or something. Whatever that episode is. If you've ever been sleep deprived it's a very fair and accurate depiction.
Swag
I heard that in Season 3, Snape kills Celestia.
snape?
o.O Spoilers!
People really need to read the rules page before actually loading chat up...
awesome picture Nittany_Discord
11,01I didn't draw it.
I still like it
Ann: FF7,8,9 is 9.99 on ps store online. Your ps3 can play it
The funniest is when a commercial for next week's episode comes on during dtream
/me thinks Rarityisboss is secret Giga xD ( dunno why)

Hasbro has to cader to their biggest toy demographic first. They'll have more "high quality" stuff later. They're already seriously catering to the fandom already.

08,01does Eminem count as a "nigga"?
I only listen to brony rappers and Beastie Boys
08,01i do not know about these things
Then the world collapses.
I prefer Tupac and biggie, to be honest
You know, I never did like Beastie Boys...
But opinions right?
allo, how were y'all evenings?
08,01i want to see some indian rap
I loved the beastie boys.....Then of course, old eminem

Gheto Boys

Hey Dken2021
To be honest I like the new Eminem stuff.
why are we talking about rap when we can talk about metal???????
Old school, not the new school shit
My personal is my name is because it was the first one I heard

13?
Did this just get opened?
dudes thats under spoiler rules
11,0113 episodes.
I'll take what I can get. I am easy.
you is gonna gets banned
FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
:O spoilers
13 episodes are okay.
:D
13 is an unlucky number :o
not spoilers xD
They are twice as long tho
13 is spanish is bad
half a regular season, but might be choked full of great stories
Not spoiler
i kid i kid
haha
Hopefully Dken2021
for a children's cartoon at least
KFS, Kentucky Fried Scootaloo:D
05pfficial does not mean it isnt a spoiler
Fisheh_Fish ponies will make it not unlucky anymore
Random slurp!
Yay! :D
once I found a Rainbow dash in a box. it was a G3.
so what Wrek said
...i thought 13 episodes were being made by Studio B, and 13 were being made by DHX.
00,10early realeased songs are spoliers even if they are offical
^
It's over, Hasbro is finished.
Lol
nope
We're all doomed
O.o Educated people on the internet ?
Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban. - says the MOTD
Something close to that yes, that's how they sell it off, and such.
heh
Buytoast: dat name uhmmmmmmmm im going for some toast
Even if the show dies, bronies will live on
yus
It also has something to do with how they release it to other countries.
Hasbro isn't finished, just not doing well.
XAX: Studio B and DHX are one in the same
00,10keep in mind the only thing confermed was that the other studio is making 13 eps
Oi, you gotta let the show die at some point.
I HAVE PUDDING!
we need at least 8 seasons b4 bronies will be satisfied
There will be more seasons of Ponies - Hasbro isn't going to shoot their golden goose before their top show has reached its peak
exactly what Sumica said
or else it'll be the simpsons v.2
Preach it DoctoDoctorWho
XAX: theres another studio though
05another kick to the ocunter
theres obviously not going to be a movie
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/07/william-andersons-poem-on-seasons.html Related to some extent. *shrugs*
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/10351192.jpg my reaction to 13 episode season.
05useing the spoiler alert tag
00,10they have not confermed even slighly that s3 is only 13 eps
I'd go to see that movie - Many Many times!
I cant beleive 13 episodes

We are
exactly what Sumica said
Appricating it

GigabitHarmonie: want me to help?

:O the quality of ponies in a movie? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/910/
One aspect is that this IS making the "Magic 65 episodes". SO, no less than any other animated series to be a success.
Whom is streaming right now? i could help out
Honestly I fear they'll keep ponies going until their dead. I have no fear of them going anywhere.

Multitasking much.
The reason it was on discount this week was for this

I'm the boss
Well remember that cryptic message William Anderson said about they're being more seasons coming. I bet Season 3 having only 13 episodes is so they can hurry up and reach the 65 episode mark so FiM can be syndicated already
Unless they are black apparently
Hi

Welcome Fou.
Heya Fou_Lou
It is.

We understand GigabitHarmonie :D We accept you offer
YES WE DO
Woo clairnet luv

So are you guys friends "IRL", as in, hanging out together. Or are you in different parts of the country(s)?
Their Irl
:)
Ah, thanks then. That answers that.
Twas answered
Am I the only one that finds "collectin" Facebook friends utterly proposterous?
haha
xD
watching this is making me regret selling LFD :(
?
Fisheh_Fish: i dont care. Fackebook friends mean nothing
Well thank you for answer.
Fisheh_Fish: Its so dumb collecting friends whom you dont even know
:) ;) :D :P :( :$ :O :| :'( :S :[ <3 6_9
Exactly
wait Lil_B got in?
Dem Emotion
Yeah
I don't have a facebook account.
My arch nemesis friend requested me
bye slaughtershy
Nice name
Crazy I know.
I was like "Bitch please"
xD
Ann: You dont need one
later
Ann: Its honestly pointless
:[
I don't have a cellphone either, darkages I am. Though I agree with you guys, it's pretty unnecessary. Social media driven society though.
Its catchy
:D
^
Makin me tap my foot
Ann: i dont have a real use for a cellphone too. but i ahve one
yeah
ahh crap its in my mind!!
My cell phone is for rape emergencies only
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie did either of you play Star War TOR? How did you feel about if you did?
Ann same with ya, but I kinds need one to know if I got a job or not
pills here
Honestly I don't want one. When I'm outta the house I want to be left alone! Though, ya I hear you Fou_Lou, there's a lot of pressure for people to have one now.
Have you played any of the poni flash games recently, like adventure pony
Thrackerzod: Where would you find them?
google^
@Dken, yeah work wanted me to get one too, I hear you. Though got rid of it at 2 months.
Seems legit
derp
MMORPG = all MMORPG
WoW will never die.
Pandaland will revive it.
You'll see.
"You ded"
Ann: and im not buying a new one unless my old one stops working because its a nokia 3310 ^^
@Fou_Lou Fair enough. Internet here is pretty good. I've little need for one.
derp derp derp
old Nokia = indestructible.
Fact: Allegr0 hates pressing the on button on his 360.
Music is art!
Yeah
^^
Exactly
:D
+1 Ann
being funny is a art
Ann: same here. Im either at home. Having internet. Or at work. Having internet too. Or somewhere out or going from to work. so no need for a cellphone
Allegr0 lol You pretty much summed up how people felt about SWTOR I think. I dunno if I am ready to get into GW2 though, so many MMO's have let me down in the past. =\
forevar
Dem impressions
purple but fun
:D
o_o
scary but fun
Allegr0: and GigabitHarmonie do you know any languages? if you could learn any other language ( fictional or factual) what would it be?
Aaaah my fucking glasses
@ Fou_Lou Honestly I enjoy being detached when I go out. Being able to be "unreachable" is nice. That way you don't have people saying "Well you have a CP take it with you!"
Swedish Ofc :D
Allegr0: LIES!!!!!
I'm asking this cuz I don't wanna feel like a pussy, but am I the only one that was too scared to finish Amnesia?
Nope.
God, stream or LoL?
Nope me 2
^^
Ex boyfriend couldnt finish it.
Oh, good. That makes me feel much better
purple but fun
Ann: its nice to have one for emergency situations. Even if you have one you can still turn it off.
Hai LonelyCanary
That is true Fou. I want one for my car because I commute 6 hours every weekend.
Hihi AttacktheAndalite
hai vinyl
lali-ho Canary
Just a pay and talk is fine I think.
xD
Hey LonelyCanary
programming languages doesnt count
Haha, language = programming language.
Hai Canary. Am playing Basara right now. :3

Alone in the Dark.
aha! that was a fluttershy!
if those count mathmatics is a language too
GigabitHarmonie Allegr0 would you guys play LoL with us in a future stream?
I'm pretty sure i can program GW2 at this pont just because my girlfreind wont stop talking about it, as i type this message im getting my inbox filled
Gigabitharmonie I learned to write the japanese alphabet and I want to say it helped me to acutally feel confident in my drawing. It might work for you too if you want to get good at drawing?
Have you guys played Slender?
String_Shredder spirits within of course, nothing final fantasy about it
i live on mars
"LoL"?
Ofcourse we understand :)
we are Bronies
whos talking in the stream again?
You know, I don't think there are any other fandoms out there with this much community. You don't see Transformers fans running streams and LoL community plays. It's always impressive.
this could not go wrong
so hows everypony doing?
What's LoL?
Fisheh_Fish: league of legends
Pretty good Sketch_Toku_Brony , how you doin?

Heheheeh... Excelent
bronystatepodcast@gmail.com
dead space 3 is a co op game.
Reikim I know giga's a friend of Vi, not sure who allegro is
If you were banish to the moon for 1000 years what would you be doing?
Allegr0 do you think the survial horrior games as a gener has lost its touch in resent years?
My own episode in season 3 /( )\ SO AWESOME
Hello to you too :D
GigabitHarmonie actually they are splitting the sequal into parts
CTR?
...Bronystate has an official podcast now? o_o How come all these things happen and I don't notive? >.>
part 1 of the sequel is out
0.0
I'm looking forward to Dead Space 3 but the fact that they're killing the horror element makes me cry.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
:p
Allegr0 wanna play civ 5, please :3
porn
/me whistles awkwardly
Nothing to explore on the moon
Moon is craters.
the moon hasnt mucht to offer though
Allegr0 I would do backflips!
A lot to explore in the forest
Allegr0: they split the sequel into parts, part 1 is out atm, its called "I Wanna Be The Guy: Gaiden"
You've seen one crater, you've seen them all.
in the moon you can search for rocks
WAIT, The moon of Endor?
What is your favorite moment in MLP?
04YES
04YES
04YES
0,5Si Senor
Derpy_Hooves: THERE IS A FUCKING SEQUEL? OMGOMGOGMOMGOMGOM
04The only medium that it's surviving on is PC
04On consoles, survival horror is dying and/or dead
^
cachi01: ja its been out for a couple of weeks
resident evil's gone the action route
Amnesia <3
GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0
04But on the PC, holy shit, survival horror is alive and well
OMFG
GOING TO DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW
cachi01: hard as fuck
like 3 times harder
Download slender while you are at it
Gigabit has been working for the site for a while now, and may be starting up a podcast, depending on how things go
slendeer is fun
/me flies over to JarlBaconTheGreater and nestles in his mane
Yeah, I finally bothered to go check main page >.>
lol no SlenderPony
I'd support this
04>Resident Evil 6 horror
but the fucking 8 notes are impossible
0,5ohai LC
04>implying it will be horror
resident evil 6 is fun and itss awesome
e
Minecraft is amazing
Ghosties: leon campaign is terror based
Who wants to brohoof my 8 feet long legs? =======================/)
05i wouldnt call slender a game
05i would call it a test
There's also that SCP Foundation game. Pretty darn scary.
Discord vs Loki who would win in a game of choas?
04Cry of Fear
04Cry o' Fear
Shooeie: q
slender is awesome
Shooeie: Loki
04Like seriously, that game is awesome
05Epalant: its boring
DEAD SPACE
Allegr0: what were your opinion on the "Fatal Frame" series :3
yes Epalant
DEAD SPACE
04In fact, the Swedish people are brilliant at horror
@Wrek i believe you are mistaking sir
The thing is, horror games don't sell as well. They're too...artsy. Thoughtful. They're not multiplayre gun-fests like, say CoD>
anybody hear about drake bell becoming a brony?
yes i know supersaga
04YES
cachi01: did you find it?
04Scratches is AMAZING
Scratches, that's Steam isn't it?
04It's a point and click adventure game
Drake Bell Became a Brony?
Takes too much writing acumen to create a good horror game, and most developers aren't willing to invest that much in their writing team...
04But the atmosphere is truly awe-inspiring
Allegr0 Ever watched Adventure Time?
Steam Names?
0,5Point and click? Just like that po- ..... nevermind >.>
Derpy_Hooves: eeyup :3
ISNT Brake bell and from drake and josh

I dont know how?
05ill probably take over again

Drake and josh!
cachi01: have fun pullinng your hair out :3
YAY

omg i used to love that show on nick
ADVENTURE TIME!
11,01Wrek: Draw me like one of your French maids?
Allegr0 Discord vs Loki, game of choas who wins?
Adventure Time is like ponies: you get so many people bugging you about it that you end up watching.
eenope
HungryForChicken: on his twitter, even tara strong tweeted about it
i cant send a reques for some reason
Chocolate milk of glass.
Fight over.

Your Winner!
i've been a fan of adventure time since the first episode
Well then... Discord Vs. Q. Who would win?
Q
Same person. No fight.

TheRandomkid321: how about pinie pie invites rainbow over to make cupcakes , but when rainbow shows up , she needs a special ingrediant , so they go on an epic for it
TheHoodyNinja that is almost as bad as Rainbow and Rarity, if not worse
TheHoodyNinja Okay. While I'm at it why dont I just go into science class and throw a bunch of chemicles together?
