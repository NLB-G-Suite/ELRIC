Lunar_Brony: Then you're really quick typing on a keyboard.
/me Is gald happy Wrek only doessaucy ponies and not R34

CapTaIn_MasterBoss43 I use the "tab" button, but otherwise yeah
Its a compliment Wrek, you're a good artist.

05never said there was
05but of what you said
05nothing resembles a cmopliment
HA i just notice the spy and raity
00,10I belive the term is damning with prase
Lunar_Brony: But you still typed quick, i know you can use the TAB button to quick use the name like ; SuperBrony64 |Zzz (i put some space between SuperBrony64 and the |Zzz)
damning with praise? i've honestly not heard that before
hit a nerve much..

Lunar_Brony: I mean that even if you used the TAB button you typed kinda quick couse if your heart stop your dead in like 10 seconds+. That is - time if your heart if weaker but if your heart is stronger (not love) + time.
Again, back to this.. i mentioned rule 34 and everyone brings out the pitchforks. i wasnt TALKING about rule 34.

octavia <3
Wrek can I say wut age group s3 is for?
when dose S3 start?
05nope
Oath Lunar_Brony
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
It's not a spoiler :(
XylemTube expecting/hoping latest as Mid-September
For me, spoilers only fuel my desire to watch
probably earlier
argh im sick of the random sex ads that pop up in the stream telling me to date some japenese girl
i dont want to be spoiled....
http://derpy.me/lWZKA
Imperios: For other's it don't thus you keep it to yourself
Shards of information, like pieces of broken glass
Okay
Quick_Thinker: install adblock plus. takes two minutes
and that just adds more problems later
Anypony seen Dan vs.?
never had any problems with it
05Quick_Thinker: get adblocker
also im not saying i hate ads they help the site more then likely im just wishing not all them were sex ads
05...
I just go along with ads. Some of them end up completely invisible
05we dont have any ads on our site
05those ads you are seeign are the stream providers
05we dont get shit
Quick_Thinker...the site doesnt get anything from the adds....
oh well that sucks
omg the cafe has stoped working and im allout of cafe! im going to fall asleap NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
IGot a sudden urge to watch Friendship is magic b****...
05this site is pure non profit
05we pay for everything out of our own pockets
05no need to worry about adds
05now while i start up this next thing
dahell Sabershy?
05enjoy this final vid
Wrek everything? I would whistle, but I can't
Wrek: You going to be drawing?,
Jmo4267: :$
chat derp?
no, just quiet
Wrek this site is quite amazing with the community but come S3 no pony will be able to see each others names like in the S2 finale
SILENCE.
Picard > Kirk
by that i mean in the chat
Quick_Thinker I don't get it
05uhm
05there is a reason we lock the main room and unlock the 6 side rooms durign episodes
05so that the floodeffect is lessened
point taken
Quick_Thinker that would only be during the episodes right? It'll be just like it is now the rest of the week
Wrek makes sense
i'll always be in Twi's chat though
I'm in #bronystate
just sayin'
hey Wrek unrelated question, do you know any guides on how to add proper shadows to drawings ?
Just took a three hour nap

I feel really stupid for the current parents of this generation
isn't watching all of mlp 9 hours..?
/me asks a question
hm 19hrs of ponies
Soupor, not really
How do you motivate yourself to read?
19 hours sounds about right
my little sister wins everyday then :D
/me fastforwards all the episodes 10x
Problem solved.
I wish my TF2 was working
What's wrong with it?
00,1020 ish if you take breaks for like food and such
still doable
MASF123 The cloud logo has a ? and it doesnt open
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ultimate-brony-challenge.png
Damn i crashed
So the computer doesn't recognise the shortcut as an application .exe file?
MASF123 it did yesterday
that little character was unnecessary
but yeah that's doable
Soupor, many
and we are doing this over tinychat
If you haven't rewatched any episodes or watched pony promos from The Hub, you've watched 19 hours worth of official ponies
I can do that on ipad. I still have the website saved from where I originally watched MLP
nomtree<.<
METROID
Alpha-Omega, is this it? http://mlp-fim.com/1
It's very "logical" for parents to blame siblings if one of them gets hurt. :I
either over Tinychat or Skype, not quite sure yet
nope I saw them all on dailymotion.com
i used netflix
TheRandomkid321 hav you checked on a forum to help with your problem
I've searched the forums and found nothing
Oh, your baby brother slipped?! I BLAME IT ON YOU.
this game looks fun
it is
can you aim?
ye
yes
Its hard though
Yawn.
metroid
prime
gamecube
2002
isnt this game free..?
yes
It is free.
might get this game
I wish my hardware can handle this. :c It looks seriously fun.
Though it takes lots of practice to get good at so don't expect a pick up and play experience.
just hope laptop can handle this
TheRandomkid321, did you try uninstalling it and re-installing it, restarting your omputer?
Spell-of-Gaming: I had a gaming ish laptop from around 2009, And it handles the game more then well
TheRandomkid321: Would you be talking about tribes?
I haven't even got my hardware upgraded even once. :c
I'm planning to save money if I want to upgrade. :c
/me hugs killerpony7733
dont think a Intel HD 3000 will handle this game
/me hugs back FairysHuff
Intel is really... crappy
hiya
MASF123 I rstarded my computer last night before bed. That may have caused it. And I aint currently got a spare 12 hours to reinstall TF2 any time soon.
I'm planning to ask my parents for an alienware laptop for my 18th birthday
ROFL^
Please tell me you're joking.
nope not even in the least
Alienware is all fancy but not all that good
Alpha-Omega: Don't bother. Their over priced. You can get a gaming laptop with the same specs for cheaper since it wont be a brand name.
Alienware are a joke.
^This
I'm surprised my Intel graphics card can handle GTA 4 and Skyrim quite nice :D
They're good style and all, but not worth the price.
You could get a better computer for less.
^^^^^
true
Alright then I will look into it
You better.
:S
lol
:D
I mean alienware has great design and looks and all that..but it isn't worth the dosh. Their specifications aren't that great.
it better have a quad core processor then
My laptop has a quad core
I believe
Mines has an i7 whatever that is.
hmmm might browse around Newegg for a computer
Just cause it has Nike on it, they'll charge alot.
understood
I mean, I'm not a fan of laptops but I thought I should throw that in.
Jmo4267: yeah though there is known brands worth buying due to how the make something, But overpriced as hell brands god no
Desktop all the way :$
^^^
they*
in fact I might start dto research right now
If you could fully customise a laptop, I would be fine with one
But you can't really :(
hmm either buy a gaming computer or build one
Sometimes you can change the CPU/GPU, but it depends on the design.
I find Toshiba to be a great make. Never had any problems with their high end laptops.
dell let's you
RAM/HDD you can change fine.
Only laptop I've ever owned was Toshiba, and that lasted 4 or so years.
Lasted its time.
Yup. Well made.
eh toshiba
im currently on a Samsung laptop
Samsung are good to.
^
I'm on ipad
i prefer building my own , you get what you pay for
I have too much Samsung stuff in my room.
And I'm not even gonna get into Apple. ;-;
:D
i HATE apple
Android or gtfo.
same here I still kind of don't like them
Jmo4267: Wanna know the most funny?, The most durable of the iphones is the 1st gen
I know.
cratorkid: I used to do that but after building 4 of them I got bored of all the time and energy it took to build one. As well as research all the tech.
I love android operating systems
It is sad and funny at the same time.
The others break like a match stick
Android is great for their open API and customisable interface.
Apple can build a nice looking computer
drop it?, glass breaks
An example is the OUYA console, that thing is gonna be mental.
Open API Android console.
The possibilities will be endless.
port
FairysHuff: yea i can understand that , when i upgrade tho its more often with less parts then doing an overhaul each time i upgrade
cratorkid: I just don't have the patience for it anymore ^_^
/me still needs to beat Half-life 2
Tsk tsk FairysHuff.
Disappoint :P
*Shrugs* It is what it is ^_^
Indeed :)
FairysHuff: yea. im not bothered by the timew tho , this way i dont pay 1000 dollars for a pc thats worth 400. with the right parts and overclocking you can turn an 800 pc into a 1000
^
That is exactly right.
There are several examples that could be thrown in, but I'm too lazy at the moment.
There are several factors that it won't be applied though.
Alright everypony! Good night and have a nice dream/day!
Goodnight Sabershy.
Night Sabershy
I think I'm going for the asus g74sx
The ASUS G Series is decent.
nite Sabershy
Seen several reviews on different ones.
I have an ASUS TF201
Dunno so much about the prices though.
Team Fortress 201? :P
it's 1600
Not too bad.
$1600
This is totally Team Fortress 201 :D
http://uk.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Transformer_Prime_TF201/
here is a case from IBUYPOWER i recomend you dont use them, but this is an example of a portable case http://techngear.com/ibuypower-lan-warrior-ii-gaming-rigs-new-colors.html FairysHuff
Well the only reason I want a gaming laptop is mostly for college and I LOVE graphical power and speed
And a high end Toshiba Satellite Pro gaming laptop.
Damn wreks game is full
Toshiba have always made their Satellite laptops great.
Alpha-Omega: You may not want to get a gaming laptop if your going to college. It will only distract you from studies.
^
Ello there everypony.
Ello Malavolent
Hello Malavolent
To be honest I'm kind of a work first fun later person
Alpha-Omega: Lucky. I'm a huge procrastinator ^_^ Can't help it.
IMHO i hate apple but they are good for work
at timed
times
I can't help but procrastinate every. single. day.
^
Haha.
Well of course I have a list of what matters first
porn?
I've angered my parents hundreds of times because of it.
thats procraterbation not procratinationg
Roll on cybernetic implants for the human brain so we can stem our procrastination ^_^
^
I'd actually appreaciate school more if there was only few homework and the learning system is FUN.
^^^^^^^^
The learning system is horrible
Makes me cry.
Also I'm most likely going into a field in computers
Reenactment of school in TV: Fun. School in real life: I think I want to cry.
^
/me is getting bored of video games
I'll be back in like..20 minutes or so, gotta go twinker something. Love you all :$
i am thinking of getting back into playing Piano
FairysHuff: i dont have a piano or keyboard
hoping to get one for birthday
I like music, until the learning system made it confusing
You can get a keyboard much cheaper than you can a harp.
ded
alright best buy has the computer for $300 dollars less
£80 for a Keyboard, £2000 minimum for a harp.
Alpha-Omega: which computer?
I wonder how many people in my country go in to the gaming industry.
FairysHuff: You picked bad instrument to play :D
Alpha-Omega: you realy should just build your own
A penis survey computer
There's a lot of avid gamers here, but the only shit they play are MMORPGs and FPS
cratorkid: Build my own harp? O_o Are you crazy! I'm no artisan.
:D
trust me if I build my own computer it would cost well over $200 dollars
FairysHuff: lol
Oh, and Facebook games. :I
2000
Spell-of-Gaming: not true i dont play either
05talking ab out me are ya Spell-of-Gaming?
Wrek: Nope.
My country.
Play farmville all day :D
ggggrrrrrr facebook games are stupid and pointless
^^^
Spell-of-Gaming: im mostly RPGs and i dont count most valve games to be fps , they are above that tag thats been hamed by COD
Believe me, you don't want to know how much I've cried when I saw that my classmates have expensive computers and they play mostly Facebook games while I have a crappy one and it can't run Dungeon Defenders on a fast framerate.
:D
Spell-of-Gaming: Why not just kill your classmates?
I used to think that investing money to upgrade computer to play better games was worth it.
They've learned about Steam now though.
I guess you grow out of it eventually.
pay $2000 for a gaming computer, then play nothing but crappy mmos and Facebook game
games*
Thats kids for yah
^
BTW, I'm 11 :3
My friend told me about steam about a month ago and plus I'm a recent convert to pc gaming
orly Spell-of-Gaming?
buy $2000 pc , play WoW all day
FairysHuff: ?
Just teasing
:3
Spell-of-Gaming: be carefull with your age around here
Spell-of-Gaming: need to be atleast 13 to be on without supervision
metroid
prime
POOTIS POOT POOT POOT
FairysHuff: pffffftt hahah
FairysHuff: no im 70
^
^_^
cratorkid: I think it's still possible for me to get banned, but since Bronystate has no affliates with the government whatsoever.
:D
I think I'm free.
17 and been playing video games all my life. Now I need glasses :S
It's possible for WordPress to ban me though.
Jmo4267: is a pony

cratorkid, you realize you said you were almost 3000 years old, right?
FairysHuff: You've never really grown up, right? :D

estimated amount of people on bronystate when season 3 comes?
ill definatly be there
/me attacks himself and misses
over 9000!!
i wasnt there for the wedding episode :'(
i wasent here for any of them D:
^
I wonder if we get a BronyState goody bag when season 3 starts.
like, a party?
Or a convention
For a Bronystate goody bag, you need Bronystate membership.
/me flips a table
^
BOLLOCKS TO THAT.
is this game good looks fast paced
In Season 3 there will be [Censored By Bronystate]
boo
:D
I think the Bronystate shop is gonna open in April 2013
I believe there will be BronyState adult toys at some point. *Cough*
Did you know: The first episode of Season 3 will be aired [You need Bronystate Gold Account to read this message]
cool I would love a shirt
not again
If you pre-order membership, you'll receive the Season 3 goody bgag.
((the bronystate shop is not serious, okay? :3))
If you don't pre-order you get a kick to teh teeth
Doen't stop me I still want a shirt
foesn't
fuuuuu
derp
ill make my own bronystate shirt :$
I wonder if they sell brony t-shirts in my country.
I know they sell children... I mean... eh... someone told me that >_>
If you want a huge Season 3 goody bag, you need to bring the best pony to the store. :3
twilight?
Twilight Sparkle?
I guess you need to bring everypony
:)
/me rolls eyes
Everypony combines to form ultra megazord robot pony.
Transformers 4.
that would be awesome
if they we fused how did a robot get in?
It was an android phone
I would love to see a joke tab saying "Shop" in the menus above on April 1 next year.
that would be awesome :D
...
And if you click the tab, it should show the image on Megaupload when it was closed but Bronystate-style
Teh chat is quiet :3
avast fluttershy's ass remix
Fluttershys arse is best arse.
i want brushie song
why was it even called avast fluttershys ass
I have no clue
.....6_9
for the lols?
Cause its best arse
Avast X's Ass is a meme :P
Doest Fluttershy use ass extensions?
The original song is "Avast your ass". Remixes replace the middle word with what sounds are being used to make a remix of the song.
It's dead right now
LIES!
no tail extensions
Eg: look up Avast microsofts ass
Wait no
Avast Octavia's plot is still the best.
Avast windows xp's ass
I love her hair though :3
Malavolent: Avast windows xp's ass sounds sxc though
Think I'm gonna go play something or nap. Haven't decided. Later ponys.
I'm still afraid of that game where you open up Excel as a game.
Bye FairysHuff
bye FairysHuff
excel as a game booo
It's not an ordinary game
It's an easter egg by Microsoft
...?
Just search it on Google or YouTube
ok
Don't tell me I warned you, though.
Spell-of-Gaming is it that hall of the damned thing
....why warn?
alexxm: Yup
That crap still haunts me
brushie brushie brushie
brushie.
=.=
pushie pushie pushie
BRUSHIE!
pushie.
:'D
I think it's laughable that I procrastinate but I don't have anything to do
when procrastinating
There's nothing interesting in my life to watch, really.
Just daily struggles.
Watch paint dry.
It is very entertaining and enjoyable.
:D
i suck at paining
Twitter needs more trolls.
painting*
lame easter egg
I guess it's time to check Reddit. :I
i like zeg rush on google better
zerg
Alpha-Omega have you searched do a barrel roll
/me enjoys watching paint dry
yup
Reddit.
/me shivers
Doing a barrel roll at the same time with zerg rush on Google at the same time might be... interesting
Spell-of-Gaming can't you only do stuff like that one at a time
all i needed to do was restart my computer.
like what
I don't want to know
Rofl.
I once saw a clop-clop reddit.
That exists. :I
I'm serious =.=
Burn it with fire.
Buut yes
I usually visit /r/aww on a regular basis
http://i.imgur.com/M0sVS.jpg
nom nom nom http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1096/
I hope you go outside on a regular basis too. :)
I can't right now, really
It's raining cats and dogs
I am allergic to sunlight
dat pinkie :3
I live in ghetto apartments. I don't want to go outside
>_>
How long did it take for you guys to cook up those excuses.
Alpha-Omega do you have a gun for protection?
i live in the ghetto. the outside world scares me
no
i go outside when i feel like it
I can send you a picture of outside if you want. :3
Jmo4267 I have been using the allergic to sun excuse for months
I bet you have.
XD
:D
Also there's nothing interesting in my town except the mall
^
Alpha-Omega Small town?
even the mall isnt interesting to me and i live in the second biggest city in england >.>
this world is pail, it nees a little color
:D<
No it's just lame to live here
If I go outside I am usually forced to (school etc) but otherwise I am scouting for locations to film youtube videos... taht I one day will get around to making... I'm waiting for my voice to 100% mature
That's the problem I haven't been to the mall in forever. Parents are always busy
If books took you to a place, I would read them just to mess up the timeline
^
:D
^^&
the only pony t-shirt from my mall is just says "BRONY" and has rainbow dash
^^^

Hello Chrysalis! :)
im good Chrysalis, you?
i'm good Chrysalis how about you
im pretty good
bit warm, damn weather
Back guys what is playing
Wanna trade with my cold weather?
i have sooo much Erros

What format/quality you rendering?

Fair enough.

Good 'ol L4D.
shazbot
...
i miss my old pony theme and wallpapers ....
Morning everypony :)
Hey MegaMoonShine! :D
why does my laptop struggle with minecraft, but runs L4D perfectly ._.
how you doing MegaMoonShine
hai MegaMoonShine
ello MegaMoonShine
Maybe due to the fact Minecraft doesn't require a great computer?
hey MegaMoonShine
/me and Waffles
teehee
sounds reasonable
If you looked at the minecraft file itself and the saves it makes, they're small as chips, meanwhile L4D renders and generates alot of data therefore requiring quite abit of a computer.
Plus L4D isn't blocks ;D
lol
:D
Is anyone besides me playing with wrek in tribes? 6_9
Chat is derping up. QQ
Damn emoticons wouldn't show up.
i just left KILLERPONY7733

wtf T^T
Jmo4267 you get the problem wrong, he is saying he can run l4d without problem but minecraft is not working correctly
i highly doubt my Laptop will handle this game
Oh I read it wrong.
Thought it was the other way around.
Your java version might be out-dated or some of your minecraft data is corrupted.
If you're running a texture pack or mods that'll also throw more process onto it.

aw darn, I missed the movie the other day. How was it everypony?
^
mmmmmmmmm
strange
oni_link: Awesome! :$
MegaMoonShine: Im bummed out cause it didn't get to see that awesome movie with y'all. At least you liked it though. I have that movie on DVD :D
Also, what game is this?
oni_link: Which one? :S
oni_link: This game is called Tribes: Ascend
MegaMoonShine: The A movie for the last movie night? :P
and this game looks awesome :)
oni_link: Yeah, that was a great movie
Same with B movie too. That was one of my favourites as a kid
I fell asleep during the B movie :(
too late
Ohhh I can't wait until I get to get a PC alredy.
MegaMoonShine: I wanted to see the B movie soo bad :(
We are the Cutie Mark CrusadersOn a quest to find out who we areAnd we will never stop the journeyNot until we have our cutie marks
I had to go do something, and I missed the ending of the first movie and the first episode :(
MegaMoonShine: aw that sucks. Im psyched for tomorrow or later today I should say :D
Does anyone know this song btw? I've heard it before somewhere?
i'm back i remember i can't/know/want to cook so i have lucky charms
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Its the breakfast of ponies :P
oni_links what about apple jacks?
Lucky Charms, huh? The cereal with loads of Rarity! :D
TheRandomkid321: I think Apple Jacks only covers a certain portion lol Lucky Charms are Magic and oates :D
IKR MegaMoonShine
also I want my MPG :D
This looks like UT on crack , me gusta :3
^Best description ever.
lol thats what it looks like :D
Indeed it does.
Is this F2P?
Yeah it is.
With microtransactions too..
So many games I gotta play when I get my PC
this one is on the list now :D
:P
And microtransactions you said? how do these affect the game?
Kill them, Wrek. Kill them all.
Uh, from what I've seen it is like xp boosts and such.
My weakness ^ ^ ^ D:
What are you talking about?
For example; Perfect for new players, the Steam Starter Pack includes: A lifetime 50% XP Boost, 4 Bonus Weapons for base classes, 2 class unlocks, 4 Perks, and 800 Tribes Gold.
Hmm, this is verry appealing :)
The gold is for said transactions Im guessing right?
Yep.
800 Tribes Gold: Customize your experience in Tribes with 800 Tribes Gold. Buy cosmetic skins, additional weapons, experience boosts, and more!
(Source of this information is off Steam)
Jeez, I have to wait two months though. Having bills sucks, I have little to no money left for myself nowadays
Oh bills, how fun.
And Im either getting an M17x or a really badass desktop when those two months are up :) ( that is, if everything goes according to plan)
Alienware laptop.
/me flips oni_link
lwhy you flippin me Jmo4267? D:
Build a custom desktop.
Don't even bother with Alienware.
If you wanted specifically a laptop, get a different brand such as Toshiba or Asus.
Or something.
Cheaper and alot better specifications.
asus republic of gamers stuff is far better than alienware
Jmo4267: I've been looking around fot laptops and for the display, Alienware is the best... but a Desktop isnt out of the question. I had this setup that would cost me about 1600 USD and I would be able to run just about anything on Max Setting (which is what Im after)
Several factors you have to put in place, 1. Do you want this laptop/desktop to last you along time? 2. Are you wanting to upgrade it later on or get a new computer?
the_real_pony_1604: G73s are nice too, I just haven't been keeping up with Asus lately.
Jmo4267: I plan on keeping it for a good while and upgrading if necessary
Is portability absolutely needed? Or just essential?
Jmo4267: I was considering getting a laptop and desktop replacement because this laptop I have is good only for browsing and maybe some music stuff.
I am currently on 4.5 years on my current build, and if you build with a really good mobo they last for a long time. all the systems I build for myself and friends are with asus mobos
the_real_pony_1604: thats fairly long :P
I'd go with the desktop option, with $1600 you could build a great system.
I had my old desktop for 8 years before getting a new one
my laptop is currently a macbook pro with windows 7 installed on it
I was happy with it the whole time
Ew Macbook.
the_real_pony_1604: mine too :D
Hey that's not actually a bad idea. Seeing some MacBooks are bloody tiny compared to regular laptops, installing windows on one sounds like a plan.
I used to feel the same way about macs, but i was forced into them because of work. and it is hard to quetion the hardware they use
Jmo4267: Both options are nice, but I feel like I would't be as happy if I had a desktop because of it being confined to one spot.
Then go with a decent laptop, just not Alienware.
You get Alienware and I'll hunt you down :(
oni_link: That's a good point. I'm still extremely happy with my desktop I got in February. But it sucks how im confined to one spot.
Macbooks have a decent design/architecture but it's just the fact that it is Apple.
I despise the brand.
alienware, when it was its own company back in the 90s was the best thing you could get. now that they are just glorified dell computers they are not the same
hello everypony
Some things they're more beneficial in then laptops, but still.
Hello LightTrooper105
/me give Jmo4267 muffin
/me noms muffin
I'd say go with an Asus G Series laptop, reasonably priced and great specifications if you get the right one.
But it is completely up to you.
Just throwing my two cents in.
XAX: In regards to Windows on Mac, Its awesome. But Im on an older Macbook. I have the 08 model with 256MB of vid memory and this one heats up more than I feel it should. If you got a new one, Im sure the experience would be amazing. At the same time, you'd have to re-learn shortcuts.
yay intelligent conversation
^
my only knock on asus laptops, I work with a lady that I talked into getting a republic of gamers laptopl. the power port failed on it and she needed to get a new mobo after 6 months. and from what she found out is was pretty common for that model
Jmo4267: Well you are providing good points and helping to make an informed descision, so you are helping alot with this. But Im just stuck because it comes down to portability or power and i cant choose between the two at the moment :D
There is always flaws with something.
nothing is perfect
Exactly.
Toshiba Satellite laptops are well built as well.
my macbook is just a 13inch with the i5, 8gigs of ran, and a 120gig ssd. but I like it
Had one of the old series and lasted me for 5~ years.
DAT RAN.
Jmo4267: They get relatively hot though from what I hear
They do.
I had to use a cooler-mat, but even that wouldn't cool it down fully.
Not sure about the new ones.
the only reason I say that about the asus rog laptop is so he can do some research and avoid that particular one
Haven't touched a laptop since.
the_real_pony_1604: how are you for video memory though?
A SSD in a laptop is questionable tbh.
hello every pony
512, and the ssd uses less power so I can get a longer battery life
Hello therainbowvortex
Yeah but the fact that the size is small.
If you're only using it for browsing and doing small things, then I guess it would work.
i read my little dashie again it still makes me sad :'(
the_real_pony_1604: better than mine, thats for sure :P
I swapped out the hdd, and got another hour of "youtube" time out of it
But if you're doing things such as playing games, producing alot of videos/etc. then SSD is out of the question.
why why did it have to end like that :'(
I hope you've read the sequel.
what squal
Lemme get the link for you.
I'm not 100% if it is the official sequel or not, but the authors seem to be the same.

Jmo4267: yeah most definitely. It was part of my expenses for the desktop. Im thinking of doing the same for a laptop if i make one. And I know Alienware is overrated but considering what you get for that price, its pretty damn good. I have yet to see a 1200P monitor @ 120Hz

Just use longer sentences
Jellybean stinks.
Fluttershy- just a heads up rp isn't really allowed in this chat
Fluttershy-: You do realise this isn't a RP channel?
and I hate comcast, Cox, direct t.ve, etc
How dare they replace the internet browser with Chrome without flash player.

I haven't stopped since that pony guy was banned by prince
why wont anyone belive me
Gold moment.
Jmo4267: I had a Droid 2, had that replaced 6 times. Upgraded to a Bionic just to get a giant middle finger from Motorola when they released the Razr, wanted to destroy everything when they realeased a bigger battery for the Razr (aka the Razr Maxx) and finally had enough of them when they tried charging me $100 USD for replacing a Bionic because the charger input broke. And before that, replace that damn thing 6 times for a gra
No born here, but I've been in the Uk for 7 years, picked up some of that and I tend to mutter a bit
dem cool kids
woah wall
I had a Razr myself. They were good looking but not very dependable.
Sexy wall of text, isn't it?
Does anyone belive me?
well based on minor observation all the ponies seem to have their own homes and jobs so speculation goes to close around the 18 range and ranging up
:D
Fair enough Mutterguy. I want to go to the UK myself sometime.
im in uk
>come to the UK
Jmo4267: dat sexy hate wall :D
yay
But why?
why not both
we have droid 2 phones at work, about 30 of them. they are HORRIBLE phones
Why?
... no one will belive me
I wanna see snow.
and I love british accents :P
Jmo4267: Android 2.2... *shudders*
OLD SCHOOL ANDROIND.
Androind. God damn it.
You've never seen snow?
Android.
I'm from Australia, there is no such thing.
My God.
>never had a snowball fight
Sad times
I feel for you bro. :P
Yep.
I love snow.
Jmo4267: Wait don't we have androids in australia?
I'm pretty sure ditching beach sand at someone doesn't count.
Jmo4267: I got it. But you have to admit, it was a lot clunkier and force closed ALOT more back then.
we have ice and sometimes snow here
Yeah have Android in Australia.
Yeah I remember oni_link :P
we have*
To be honest we don't have snow all that often here though
So who is talking?
but when we do it sends everything to hell
dude we should have a brony brand cereal
Jmo4267: I just feel bad for those legacy users :D
I do too oni_link.

Pfft
Jmo4267: He ended up getting a Droid Incredible 4GLTE. I was mad at first but saw it was made by HTC and after tinkering around with it, Its not a bad phone :P
>implying anyone ever does anything at school
FairysHuff, test
HTC make decent mobiles oni_link
i did, thats why i now have a masters degree
Hah
i uesd to draw on everything in school
No one ever does work at my shcool, we still get good results
English
Jmo4267: The newest evo was my second choice for a mobile as a matter of fact :)
Also the exchange rate isn't nearly as in their favour now as it was back then $NZ 3 to the pound at one point
Work is reserved for the last month before exams
That's enough time to do all you need to get good results
oni_link Nice choice, HTC would be my 2nd next to Samsung.
yes, because thats a great learning mentality which let you actually learn stuff
so that if you go back to it you know it
Mutterguy NZ has it rough with the economy, I have several friends that live there and complain alot.
Jmo4267: hi hoof for similar tastes /)
rather than just forget it after the exam
oni_link Indeed! (\
Well most of the stuff you learn for exams is useless bullshit you can forget afterwards anyway.
did Wrek not finish that drawing he was doing when I went to sleep? about 7 hours ago? not seeing it on DA

Jmo4267 not sure if it's bad as the UK is though.
#silentponyville
VICTOREE
Fluttershy- no channel advertising please.
Mutterguy I'm not sure either, I don't follow UK economy :P
sorry
oni_link Yeah it will either be the S3, Galaxy Nexus or if something else is released.
I have no need for a cell phone. I don't talk to anyone
Alpha-Omega-Prime, well that's antisocial
I only have one person who texts me. /foreveralone
My reason for getting it was for work, but this whole year I've been sick. So that plan hasn't turnt out grand.
Not really it's more experience than anything. I always call and text but not response from said friends. SO no point in cell phone
test
oni_link: I don't really mind about the camera on phones. ;-;

THERE we go ^_^ Finally found it ^_^
oni_link: They do. They did an excellent job with the design and architecture.
Now I can finally uninstall mIRC
Phew *Wipes brow*
Jmo4267: And getting rid of those capacitive buttons was an awesome thing to do too, more screen space :)
Yep.
Thankyou every pony that helped out. I appreciate it.
Which is great.
Anytime FairysHuff
Jmo4267: Yeah, Stock Android is best OS
oni_link Indeed!
FairysHuff: Why're you uninstalling mIRC? ._.
XAX, Cause it's not free.
So whats the benefit of using an IRC program?
It is. :P
Dari has the right idea.
oni_link, there are many benefits, but it is each to their own. Some of those benefits might not fit your taste.
Jmo4267: I always wanted to try it out, I never got a chance to
It doesn't crash as much as yourr browser
And I'm too lazy to list them.
oni_link: Not being shit
Rofl^
Main advantage of a proper IRC client
Mutterguy: As far as I can remember, mIRC has never crashed.
MFW the online counter for my mIRC
12330 hours
..Wow
I get flash fails all the time when Im on the website, so that woulnt be a bad thing to try
yeah see my point hold true
That's over two years.
Or 513.75 days
and wow, congrats on that :D
I leave it on all the time. <:
well xchat irc is a free program.
Your PC never sleep?
mIRC is free too
no it's not.
You just have to click through the window that pops up when the trial is over
which is the best IRC client and why?
it has a trial period and mines is almost up on mirc
Oh lord, take cover.
lol
The trial period runs out, but you can still use it
oni_link: Only ever used mIRC. I personally can't form an opinion on others.
Similar to winrar
IRC?
XAX: but its been good to you right?
Alpha-Omega-Prime: What you are currently on
oni_link: Yeah.
XAX, yeah I did that when I got bored of the screen at the start
Ipad?
:P
i might give it a try later on then.
Alpha-Omega-Prime: Internet Relay chat
I've used mIRC myself, worked fine. Saw my problems.
I tried using it yesterday and mirc wouldn't let me message on to bronystate. It would come up message failed to send.
But I'm fine with the website IRC.
oh :P
This thing
Is an IRC network
:P
LIES.
lol
I wouldn't lie to you...
Or would I?
What about an Android IRC app? Any good ones worth trying?
I think you would.
Prince Dari you speak? I thought you were a robot that only posts Equestria daily links
Sorry to say.

Best 10 seconds of my life after seeing Octavia on that episode xD
I can't choose. Why is it so hard?
This brings up a story actually. I once use to live on a farm in Narrogin. It was a late night and I had to use the bathroom, I kid you not I saw something on the wall in the dark. It was a spider the size of a bloody wheel.
Had to use a spade to kill it.
I kid you not.
we need octvia emoticon
Fear Australia, fear it.
Octavia
Ouch
Wrist-crackling.
Jmo4267: Holy jebus.
I need to play more Tribes.
Jmo4267: I do, I hate spiders...
Biggest spider I had ever seen in my life.
I actually have the game and some other stuffz.
I enjoy spiders. ;D
guys they said on the stream last night that in season 3 there will only be 13 episodes
SHAZBOT :D
If we had spiders that big I'd be trolling all the arachnophobes in our country so hard.

Red-back spiders scare people so much though.

Camel spiders are over-hyped though.

IFDreebs don't take it personally
Take what personally?

i need to go to bed now i have school tomorow
That's not the sequel I read
Night therainbowvortex
Oh goodness I don't. I do wish it were slightly more lenient.
night therainbowvortex
Slightly.

Jmo4267: oh yes, those things on average are over an inch long - Ive seen some over 2 inches and they fly O_O
Flying roaches.

gahhhhhhhhhhh Im so bored, I cant game on this and I want to play PC games because console games are so boring

Only console I'd touch is the OUYA.
Jmo4267: O U.
Probably also Australia
when I started reading my little dashie im all like :| then when I finished im all:'(
Oh that image.
I love it.
oni_link: console games aren't THAAAAT bad,just PC is more kick-ass:D
XAX NO U
wow you and spiders
I love that post
I shall send my spider army after you all.
Jmo4267: but thats a pc esentially
;D
;)
Saw on running across my kitchen floor while cooking dinner - Im terrbly afraid of those roaches at the best of times - I just got a big handful of napkins and picked it up by hand before it could get away
Jmo4267 zerg rush!!
Yes and no oni_link
ZERG RUSH.
what day is it?
Due to the fact it is Android Open API you could compare it to PC.
but you still can't touch the hardware.
;-;
sonicrainboomer259|b: well yeah. the only console game I look foward to is Halo. Ports on consoles suck. and Ive gronw past the cod phase I was in when I first bought the xbox
lolhalo
hi guys, what're we watching?
Meh Halo
Halo 3 ended that series.
Timesplitters is the shit
After that was dull.
COD is overated
ohai Flyboy
Timesplitters. My god.
Epic game.
^
Hey Flyoy
(>^_^)>
I love Timesplitters
/me flips table
/me never played Timesplitters
hey everypony
DAMN SCRIPT >_>
Then get it
It's PS2
You should go play it.
Hi Flyboy
so whats this? and who is streaming it?
PS2 is best console
Hello Flyboy. Tribes Ascend
/me doesn't even know what timesplitters is
NO, SNES IS BEST CONSOLE.
Jmo4267: kewl.
Wrek is streaming
oni_link: I was gifted both MW3 and BO during the summer sale. Im enjoying them >_>
Or N64..
PS2 had all the good PS1 and PS2 games
And kicked again. fml
So no contest
:P
LOL
Is that Caravan Palace I hear? AWESOME.
hey Wrek
...Wow
AHAHAHAHA
Kick scripts really hate you
lolraped Jmo4267
I think the Famicom Disc System is best console.
WOW FML.
oni_link: the day of the 3rd and 4th Generations of console's were the best
I HATE THIS SCRIPT.
XAX: Is it your first CoD game?
pc has emulators for all those systems and android has emulators for some of those systems as well.
MW2 is my favourite CoD
AdamTheDuck: I got #4 in '08 or something
boom
Jmo4267 count to two then press enter?
PS2 was great for its variety of games.
sonicrainboomer259|b: they were my favorite but they didnt age well
I can only count to potato Mutterguy.
:<
this reminds me so much of unreal tournament, simply becuase lightning gun :P
Prince of Persia trilogy
XAX: Then you won't understand the fact that the game has not changed sinse mw1...
Highlight of PS2
^
that'll do, just mouth the word
I'd prefer Ratchet and Clank though
so is this free?
Best series ever made.
Flyboy: yeah
Plus CoD 1 and 2 were the best CoDs xD
Hellow :+
:3*
oni_link: ooh boy! ima get it!
First CoD was the bomb.
Second CoD was great for multiplayer.
thanks goodness for steam.
Jmo4267: I have that game hiding on my hard drive somewhere.
CoD4/MW2 was good too. After that it just ran down-hill.
I still remember D-day landing
Nice XAX.
The first Modern Warfare was the best in my opinion.
^
Wrek: how are you guys communicating? skype? teamspeak?
I'm gonna get ready for church now.
I think my favourite 'modern console' game is RDR
The only reason I've touched Black Ops is for Zombies. Nothing else.
^
Peace
So much ^
Zombies is THE BOMB.
I played campaign too
Jmo4267: Hell yeah
Because campaign is always fun
Yeah campaign as well.
but multiplayer..
/me shivers
But yeah, zombies was the highlight
Jmo4267: I've personally clocked up 24 hours on MW3 multiplayer and 27 hours or so on Black Ops singleplayer(Campaign is quite good, and zomg zombies).
I don't really have high game standards though.
I've played 58 hours on MW3 multi, 52 on black ops single.
IMO
Eh..
Someone (I think DCD) told me there was going to be zombies with something like up to 12 people on BO II
Yes and no.
oni_link: But Soap
oni_link: what you talkin bout?i still have an N64 and play it constantly,and i have some gamecube games that i play on the wii,i also have a Ps2,and #1 fav game is from Ps2,which is Sly cooper 3(i love the other 2 though)
^
Gunna be sweet
Nintendo were great with their line of consoles, but Wii/3DS was their downfall imo.
what game is this excactly?
Tribes Ascend.
Wii is a pretty good
console
Wii is alright..but still
I only got it for Metroid Prime 3
They're gonna have to make much bigger maps for zombies if they intend to have up to 12 people being able to play though.
sonicrainboomer259|b: The 64 is a hit and miss for me. I still play it today though. For PS2, All I liked was Final Fantasy X and Snake Eater. And Gamecube was only good for first party games. Nintendo wasnt good for 3rd party support.
Wii convinced me to flail my arms infront of tv screen...
^^^
Oh wow I love you oni_link
>PS2
>only liked a couple of games
What the hell is wrong with you
PS2 had so many brilliant games
Jmo4267: lol thanks?
kingdom hearts.
KINGDOM HEARTS.
0.0
Ratchet and Clank
Kingdom Hearts, Ratchet and Clank, Final Fantasy
uh
Prince of Peria, Timesplitters, Nightfire
Timesplitters yeah.
Put it here Jmo4267. /)
jax and daxter
(\
Jak and Dexter.
First 3 were good
after that it went down.
dynasty warriors
^^^
Yes
I completely forgot
<3 DW
Jmo4267: Lol jak x.
/me never played Ratchet and Clank, Timesplitters, Prince of Persia, Jak and Daxter or Dynasty Warriors.
LOL JAK X.
Lol I remember Dynasty Warriors
AHAHAHAHAH.
Are they still making those?
yep AdamTheDuck
what about sly cooper?
I had that game myself, it was alright but total trash pile.
Sly Cooper!
or Sly Cooper :D
Oh damn sly Cooper
wow oni_link
You need to..yeah
You have never lived, oni_link
Explore the PS2 to extreme lengths.
I only ever played that through a hidden demo on the Ratchet and Clank 3 disc
Do it now.
Same.
Oh the secrets of Ratchet and Clank. <3
so who else is playing with wrek? anyone else we know?
i'm afraid to Sly 3 is my favorite game
All them bolts, all the upgrades.
Jmo4267: Lightsaber wrench.
This script..
Lets just say I was too preoccupied watching my brother play Final Fantasy X and because of that, we never got games :D
Lightsaber wrench <3
He never beat it lmao
Ratchet and Clank Gladiator was bad-ass.
i'm a Wii lover Jmo4267 deal with it
You know what we forgot
I don't hate the Wii, I have one myself. It is just they could of done better.
Star Wars Battlefront 1/2
^
OMG
I want my 3rd one. FML
HOW COULD WE FORGET
LOVED THAT SO MUCH
And the Lord of the Rings game was pretty sweet as well
Holla everypony! :)
Okay, I have played Battlefront 2 but on PSP :D
PLAYED OVER 250 ON THAT xD
Hello GilDash
Hey GilDash :)
I remember playing battlefront with my friend after school everyday.
Fun times
Jmo4267: Gladiator was actually pretty cool. And zomg co-op campaign.
This is why PS2 is console king in my book
The co-op campaign was awesome.
Wrek: 2 things, 1: who esle are you playing with? anyone i would know? and 2: how are you talking to eachother? skype? teamspeak?
SO MANY amazing games
Jmo4267: it's not nintendo's fault,it's all of dem 3rd party companies
PS2 was my whole life
Ah Battlefront 3... How we are never going to see you again...
^
That game was been in production and stopped so many times...
I never knew the existence of the N64 cause of the PS3 sadly.
PS2^
sonicrainboomer259|b: Nintendo's strong point has always been the software. but I hope they get more 3rd party support with this new console.
Worth it though.
I had a n64 too
But these days I've got two N64 stashed in my game chest.
Battlefront 3 was pretty much done, then that studio flopped and we never saw it again
Then of course PS2 has all the good PS1 games as well
I always enjoyed the freeroam of Jak 3..
Since you can play PS1 on PS2
Spyro 1/2/3
oni_link: that would be bad,cuz alot,and i mean ALOT of3rd party games on Wii suck
^
There are so many games to list ;-;
^
Yeah you can
Memory card..?
Jmo4267: I played the living crap outta Gran Turismo 2.
I never got into Gran Turismo XAX. >_>
I played GT on PS1
Was never any good at it
But I played it anyway
:P
I did play that one future racing game though..what is it called..
my dad played the first gran toursmo for ps3
It was all futuristic and trippy..
i menat ps2
sonicrainboomer259|b: No, the problem is that 3rd party devs hated working with the Wii hardware. lower graphics, low cpu.
I can't remember the name. QQ
Uhhm
Only thing that comes to mind is Powerdrome or something like that Jmo4267
So, is this where you go for the "Friday Movie Night?"
Na that ain't it.
Oh crap, Gran Turismo 3, GTAIII, and SOCOM II were my everything
It had great music too.
lolsocom
Pony_55: das rai
The game that made CoD kids cry.
Jmo4267: How so? ._.
I still remember the boulder from Crash Bandicoot. </3
Well me and my sister still play PS1 together occasionally
<XAX> Thank you
And we can save just fine
We play on the PS2
XAX How so? It isn't to their liking.
Jmo4267: I played online, NEVER AGAIN. its too hard :D
Just reminded me
Digimon World for PS1
That game is so hard, but so awesome
DIGIMON WORLD OMG.
Wish I still had my ps2... :(
SO GOOD.
Jmo4267: Nothing is to a CoD fanboys liking.
XAX Exactly ;D
MegaMoonShine: D: you don't have a PS2 any more?
Jmo4267: They don't even like their own game sometimes.
XAX YEP.
Did you guys know that if you transfer your save data from a PS1 card to a PS2 card, you can save and load from that PS2 card?
Yeah oni_link :P
>:
You should have gotten a new one
i feel bad for joshscorcher,these retarde COD ganboy's and 10 yr old kids are giving him a bad name :(
I still have my PS1 around somewhere
Mini PS1, still got.
sonicrainboomer259|b: who?
So small :3
Hah, I just remembered a PS2 game that I really loved
iPod touches can run PS1 emulators ._.
Road Trip Adventure
I didn't think it would be my kind of game
Why did you have to say iPod and not Android. ;-;
But when I started playing it
I LOVED it
^^^^
Jmo4267: they can
It was absolutely awesome
oni_link Yeah I know, but he said iPod instead of Android. That makes me cry.
So many good games, so much nostalgia. ;____; Want to play
SSX 3 and SSX On Tour were my drug
Oh God, SSX
oni_link: popular countdowner,unscripted video's,and more
Let's see what happens when I throw this out.
Pikmin.
Jmo4267: its okay * pats back*
I never actually owned SSX, but I always used to play it around my friend's house
No bite? Oh wow ;-;
/me hugs oni_link
It ain't fair D:
What console was it on Jmo4267?
sonicrainboomer259|b: hu?h
GAMECUBE.
Ahh
*huh?
I never had a gamecube
Jmo4267: it isnt D:
PS1 was my first console
..What
I used to play gamecube at my friend's house
oni_link: search him up on youtube
Jmo4267: Was that the game where you gather those little wshatchamacall it
Commodore 64 was my first 'console'
i never got to play a gamecube
.....
i don't get it
whatchamacall its*
I feel like the gamecube loner. ._.
Yeah.
I thought that was really cheap too XAX.
But I've still got my PS2
So it's all good
Same.
lol XAX, I recently picked up a YLOD PS2 BC PS3 a week ago
Would be nice not to have to worry about memory cards though I suppose
Tried fixing it, worked for 5 minutes and then went YLOD again.
Bugger.
ragefest was involved.
>:
Spent 2 hours fixing it too.
Got all excited..then boom. ;_;
Jmo4267: Could try get some local tech shop to fix it or sumting.
Na, it was just a small project on the side.
Ah.
Sheep, Dog, 'n' Wolf was a great PS1 game too
Definitely not sending it to Sony, $170 to fix it. Fuu.
It's nice to see what these stages look like from the view of a system that can handle the game properly.
lolfuckthat
ikr.
I think I did the circulation incorrectly.
So meh.
sonicrainboomer259|b: I dunno why your console won't save, mine does fine. :<
*toy story 2
SNES Toy Story.
Old times.
lol
Lol sonicrainboomer259|b
Out of curiosity, how old are you Jmo4267?
sonicrainboomer259|b: i dont know who to search for
I got a ps2 emulator recently to play an English cracked version of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix. It runs that game fine, but for some reason if I try play one of the ratchet or clank games, or one of the jak games, it runs about 20-30fps.
Ahh, 17 here, turned 17 earlier this month. :P
Nice :D
Oh XAX, how dare you use a PS2 emulator.
6th of July
dat feel when youre older then a mod
I had an N64 emulator on my old laptop
Well I'm the youngest mod
^^^
Hah, thanks guys. XD
Jmo4267: Dat quick maths :P
i didnt know that
I'm ditching cake at the screen, but it ain't working.
Jmo4267: Can't buy an English version of Final Mix.
night all
True XAX, forgot about that.
Night Mutterguy
bye Mutterguy
Thanks alexxm
Night Mutterguy :)
It's like the special version of FF12
XAX: Final Mix :(
Night Mutterguy
Can't get it in Australia
Its JAP only
oni_link: Yay fan made Engrish cracks.
Lol engrish.
XAX: lmao engrish
who here knows a lot about tribes ascend?
Tribes Vengenace. ahh.
Vengeance^
Still remember picking that up from my local video store.
Jmo4267: erm... is that a yes?
Dis game looks pretty
NOP Flyboy
Not gonna be touching Ascend
damn it...
i just neede to know something
It has microtransactions, that pushes me away.
Very far away.
It's like Combat Arms all over again
^^^^
That game is on steam now :|
PAY $10 TO WIN THE FREAKING GAME WHY DON'T YOU
/me never played Combat Arms
IKR.
Played that game years ago, haven't touched it since. Not a good game really.
So stupid... gold perma guns for $20...
lol nope.avi
The only reasons I stopped playing Combat Arms is because A: updates. B: hackers.
The picture for Combat Arms on Steam is disturbing.
Lol ikr ^
Mutation man holding 6 guns while looking cranky.
Yeah..
who the hells multialtion man
I had p good aim on Combat Arms, so on most occasions I actually won gunfights with P2W players.
Vi and I both used to play AA (though not together)
anyone here heard of The Guild II?
nop^
Nope^^
Nah.pony
then look it up, its amazing :)
2006 Game and is on Steam.
heh
Ah.
That was an alright game.
I might give that a go. My old PC couldn't run it.
Was AA that military simulator?
It was so annoying when you got shot and could only walk really slowly
Reminds me of ARMA
Though some of the servers where they forced guns were a laugh
/me was a console FPS gamer most his life
Oh lord oni_link
>console
>fps
please tell me you've at least played Counter-strike before.
That is something I am not capable of playing.
I laugh at you. ;D
Something about aiming with analogue sticks
Oh god...
Im just not capable of doing that.
I've tried many times.
I know what you guys were talking about but I never played them. And yes, I have played. I used to spend many hours at the cafe on that game.
Mouse/keyboard > Controller most of the time.
WREK UPGRADED: your mom
Thank god oni_link
What's with the pasword thingey? :S
I remember playing AA. It was an alright game. I remember it got a unique kind of hate simply because it was a military recruiting tool. People were calling it propaganda because it wasn't hyper-gory.
I remember playing SW Battlefront 1 for the first time when I was a kid
"OMGOMG HOW DO I AIIIIIIM?!!?!"
Was gonna hurt you for a second. ;-;
XAX: thats like the opposite to em, i can t aim without them
Jmo4267: At least I wasnt like HURR DURR I CAN PLAY THAT ON MAH CONSOLE
^
Cause if you were, you would of been thrown out a window.
Multiple times.
I always knew PC>CONSOLE
I prefer analogue sticks for aiming to beh onest
And a Sherlock episode comes to mind.
Jmo4267: I borrowed a wired xbox controller off a friend one time and plugged it into my PC to use with some games. Bound all the keys on counter strike to appropriate keys on the controller. You know the first thing I tried with the controller?
be honest*
I just never had the money for one.
XAX What's that?
I tried surfing.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
LOL
lol
Oh XAX you poor guy.
Too funny.
Wut
I see Wrek is finally playing Sentinel. This should be an interesting sight
Surfing?
Jmo4267: It was the pure definition of HOWTHEFUCK
Kandarihu: Nope, Tribes Ascend
TF2 on consoles is a joke
^
nice shot
Surfing is lots of fun.
Kandarihu: Wait, unless you mean the map or something...
Be it in CS:S or TF2.
CS: S
MegaMoonShine, I know he's playing Tribes Ascend. I meant the Sentinel class.
God damn emoticons.
Hey XAX, can you show me how to surf with a controller? :D
Jmo4267: I like watching skill surf videos on YouTube. Its just amazing watching videos of pros playing certain maps and thinking "how the actual fuck"
I know right. I've seen this one guy that surfed so well and still could pull off headshots so simple.
XAX: how did that go by the way?
The map is Raindance. I recognize it the most from Tribes 2, more than any other... I think.
Jmo4267: The next thing I tried with the controller was bunnyhopping :|
LOL.
LOLOL.
oni_link: It went craply.
lol
How long ago was this XAX.
Jmo4267: I play on a minigames server that has a serverside bhop script. All I had to do was hold down one button on the controller to jump. Strafing on the other hand... that was downright impossible to do well.
glhf.
Jmo4267: Ever seen the video "phoon too much for zblock"?
YES.
Good.
HE IS A MONSTER.
Defiles the law of Source engine.
Jmo4267: First time I watched that. mfw. O_O
^
I'd hate to vs him..so bad
I don't know, this game seems kind of bland evenf or a F2P...
even for*
F2p games are bland. :P
True...
But yeah, you're right. He was doing that shit on an ESEA server with zblock enabled. Truly amazing he could pick up speed like that in the first place.
Yeah.
These days he is a commentator for some company.
But I bet he could jump right back in and defile everyone.
Really?
Yeah
CS:GO E-sports or such
Crap. Didn't know that.
Can't remember the name, saw it a while ago.
Jmo4267: Aight.
I'm gonna flip this script and make it whimper.
Bunnyhopping is truly downright nearly impossible on a default server now thanks to orange box update. But he could still molest everyone with his aim.
Yeah.
His aim is mental.
All them 1deags
Even in original CS he demolished people.
sup
I didn't even know phoon played the other CS games ._.
I pretty sure he did..unless I'm thinking of someone else
Jmo4267: Jesus, I looked up that vid.
You might be.
too much for zblock?
yep
No matter who you are, you will sit there and think what the actual buck.
I would cry and smash my monitor
^^^^^^
Jmo4267: The thing that I found really funny was the very first reaction. "LOOK AT THIS KID SCRIPT"
lol
I know right.
He just sits there yelling trying to hit him with a USP
or that other one who was like , dude teach me to bunny hop, jk you scriptin
and the face shot :D
^
Yeah I must be thinking of someone else..
Jmo4267: The clip where he bhops up mid on dust2 and gets to B before the CTs. If that happened to me I would actually cry.
But he does the same stuff phoon does.
I wouldn't cry, I would chuck my tower out the window.
^
You wouldn't admit to him being legit, ever.
LMAO
You would instantly think, HE HACKS, GTFO.
Jmo4267: LOLYOU
give him a pistol, youre screwed. Give him an AK, OH GOD
Nice tribes
Jmo4267: He's another one that does similar things to phoon
Walking along, bang.
IKR
You sit there waiting to process it.
Ohai guys
Yeah LOLYOU is mental.
FROM IVY, OUT MIDDLE, THROUGH OUR CONNECTOR, LIKE A SPEED DEMON.
^ ^ ^
I just went back to that part :D
The rage these guys create is just hilarious.
Jmo4267: LOLYOU and his head/flashboosting
ikr
the rage is delicious
It is.
so much rage
oni_link: THIS IS DELICIOUS. YES! YES!
[/mbison]
XAX: :D you win!
Wow, the handgun 1 hit kills?
The deagle yeah
God damn

Like 2-3 shots on the torso

Yes, it is free
Yep, Everyone here with a decent PC can easily play it
And it's like 4 gb's
It's like a shooter combined to a skiing simulator

Well that was quick.

hey its McGyver
Garrettbrony: dont tell me you didnt know there was a stargate seroes
dat canned lightning
no really, dont
Dark_Horst I did
McGyver? then alll they need to fix it is paperclips and a rubber band right?
McGyver'll fix the Stargate with a frying pan full of pancake batter and a weasel.
but they have no paperclips. all they have are advanced tools
Ohhh norse!
Mekapix2 ya the guy who played McGyer stared on Stargate\
mcgyvers technical skill works directly antiproportional to his equipment

Thor was an alien.
Petrified_Discord either you seen this epiisode before or this show is really predicable
whole of asgard was
Garrettbrony: the latter :)
thank you tealc
Predicatble show is predicatable. Place your bet to see how it ends
na they use a lightning bolt to power up
do clouds count?
they need 1.21 jigowatts
they need to 88mph
'back to the futur' style
Uhhh....NO.
the best way to fix something is to bang it with a stick. A fact proven method
Garrettbrony: i predict: they're home for supper. it's like star trek. the important crew never dies
00,10fuck your knolage danny boy Jack wants to be home in time for the simpsons
Except for daniel.
...well, except for that one running gag HE keeps doing but... oh well
Well that worked.
Pew
Hullo Meanwhile :)
Dark_Horst Unless the writers are told to be more edgy that is
Allo MadSurge.
Dark_Horst sometimes a part dies, but never the whole crew
Yeah, like old man and lady aren't main cast, so they're in jeopardy

oh shite
twilight vs walking is a realy dark game........ i mean look at this comment The floor collapses, and Twilight spirals into darkness, her body breaking apart as she falls... only to awaken from the nightmare and realize she is to be forced to repeat the cycle infinitely? This is... a really, really dark game. Why couldn't you have ended it with a nice cake instead?
I still want Metropolis or seven samurai for a Movie...
The neutrinos have mutated!
its ok. Season 3 is coming. Don't cry.
Sumica lets do that in december
Seven samurai is awesome :D

If those symbiotes are capable of redemption, then Daniel was wrong to kill them.
11,01I want an intestinal worm that grants me invincibility.
Kandarihu: agreed!

Reminds me of the Futurama episode Nit

And strength
*deseases

11,01flutter_spin: I remember that one.
couldn't they switch it back and forth till they reach the portal?
it also makes for great party gags
00,10good thing you cant hit shit with a staff weapon
the staff is a weapon of terror

They got denied for the role of stormtroopers

Flyboy: im 15 :p
flutter_spin: no just the first part
Dovah: So you're too young to get how the world works. Go back to Pokemon cards.
Dovah: Exactly... :|
I would stay as long as i could ( or i will stay) . With my Dad.
Meanwhile: Not even the japanese know what to play the pokemon card game...
Ok. Let's start with 18-25. During that time, we moved 5 times. My parents split up. I went to college 5 years but never graduated (transfer credits and all), and I have a min wage job & single

Lil_B: don't mind me my speach patterns are abit mixed in culture
11,01Is this Remix 10?
:/
Lil_B: i ment the sprite as that
I found out that there is an official 4Disc OST of this game... but appearently its so rare that the Internet hasn't got its hands fully on it
yup Nittany_Discord
Lil_B, what game?
Spectrum_Rush| oh :) thanks again
:)
CrimsonPhoenix Rhythm Fever Heaven
Lil_B: FFXIII-2 is 6 or 5 discs
dat remix
Fo' Sho'
id have no chance at this
all about you
Yeah this would be impossible for me
cachi01 no 4 Disc as well... but there are Collections of 18 Discs
Lil_B: wait
so many disc @_@
http://imgur.com/UoTnr
11,02@__@
AttackAndalite|Zzz your OC I presume?
Lil_B: oh yeah 4 lol
woooow
Fake fake out.
:o
AttackAndalite|Zzz that looks aweesome :3 (well done, I like the colors AND its cute :3 )
11,02Going to put on a show for now :3
Lil_B: Thaaaanks~ I"m gonna make a DP out of her. The coloring was surprisingly easy. It's just setting the actions
11,01The SuperBrony64 show!
is it strawberry shortcake? =D!!
Who's idea was this!?
well Lil_B of course it's rare, it's only in Japan
cachi01 I have it (not physiccly though) but most FF Games usually have alwayys 4 Discs
Lil_B: yeah i have it physical lol
not my best 80$
Yay, SuperBrony64 stream!
CrimsonPhoenix that has nothing to say, 90% of Video Game OSTs are Japan Only, and People Rip and Upload them like crazy, even the most absurd ones, believe me, its a miracle that isn't up yet

Hey Calcos323 :)
Hello Calcos323
hai Calcos323
11,02The movie SAW actually taught me that fact :D
hi Calcos323!
hai Calcos323
Heya Calcos323
Are we starting another trilogy tonight?
SuperBrony64: oh yeah lol
hi Calcos323
Who called me?
SuperBrony64: Liked the first one, then it went doolally.
SuperBrony64: the first SAW movie was pretty good. the others are just pure gore fest
If given hextend in an IV then about 12-15
I agree Bronysith
Oh wow
new trilogy?
you guys
oh i see, SuperBrony64 misstabbed xD
SuperBrony64, But that is wrong
FEAR ME EVERYPONY FEAR ME http://wtfbot.net/pix/2044.jpg
CCCP: I was just thinking, do ponies have swim champions? :D
Saws as a very deep story if you pay attention to what they say
Calcos323: i mean that plot twist at the end. MINDFUCK
cachi01 I fear the end result
cachi01: i'm not scared
It blew my mind
cachi01: :D we're doomed!
cachi01: My god...
Anyway, are we starting another trilogy tonight?
MadSurge: sea ponies do
Calcos323: i dont know what was bigger plot twist, that or the plot twist in Knights of the old republic
http://derpy.me/ftIoz
Lamped.
the plot twit in SMB
Rawr
Omg
The saw series is great cause it's a huge figuring out jigsaw
I love that Derpy
and his motive
CCCP poor derpy
WooOOOooo
Bronysith: Tough call, but I wanna go with the SAW twist. Are we starting a SAW trilogy tonight or something?
CCCP: D'awwww
sorry mario but our princess is not here ..... that sentence gives me nightmares
and his planification
Calcos323: nope
ooooooOOOOOOOOoooooooh
cute derpy
CCCP: idk if d'aaawww or :
is not in this castle*
What am i watching?
:D
Bronysith: Are we starting ANY trilogy tonight?
SuperBrony64: Bob's burgers
Calcos323: nope
If you watch saw only for the deathtraps you are watchin the series the wrong way
Supersaga: Bob's Burgers
Bronysith: Dammit
SuperBrony64: That was for supersaga sorry
Calcos323: SuperBrony64 just said something about SAW
Bronysith: Oh, ok
Oh
chat derped :(
Calcos323: i dont care for the other saws as much as the first one. the first one was more mystery then gore
and Saw isn't a trilogy
it has 7 movies
I agree
SAW is a saga
O.o
CrimsonPhoenix: Neither is Die Hard but we watched that.
saw is a fucking eightology or however its called
saw 23
pentalogi
I think
Nope
SAW is a Brainmurderology.
Are we gonna watch SAW? :O That would be pretty cool
does the model come with a little keeanu reeves?
I could go for some SAW 1
octology is 8 i assume7
cachi01, it's called a saga like Michael said
ah it does!
cachi01: and you could see only the first without losing anything :D
Woah.
xD
haha
lol
and it has 7 movies
never even watched this
MadSurge: xd
I was gona say that if it did not come wtih Keanu Reevs then it would of not been worth it, but it did.

CrimsonPhoenix: You saw me in that last battle, I've NEVER been MLG Pro :p

I'm not too sure why
Epic slow motion battle of destiny!!!
11,02So this is what playing Chess through the mail feels like...
slow mo
maybe because the controls reminds me of Kirby
SuperBrony64 im dropping out, its too laggy
SuperBrony64: :D
its so beautiful with the music
Lol.
pretty laggy bro
jigglypuff is high tier right?
oh...my

Marx: God help us all
SuperBrony64: well, maybe you shouldn't have thrown your cat at the tv

SO... MLG!!!! :O
Well, you know. The call of someone would likely sound like a song, no?
wat
MaxTheBrony: umm it looks best on pc , everything does
Bronysith it's not the games, it's who play them
there is no right stick on the wii
;_;
Pudge - classic controller
oh
11,02I'm using the Classic Controller Pro :)
I only like the very first Call of Duty... Everything after that disgusts me.
Pudge: for leftys
cratorkid: i meant this looks almost identcical to the PC version ... and its on Wii :p
11,02Somehow...I screwed this up...
is the classic controller pro approved by MLG?
gotta be mlg
Ugh...
:I
SuperBrony my friend code is 3525-8597-7706
11,02Everything is MLG approved

I hate the swedish dub
:)

Swedish spitfire is smexy
MaxTheBrony: everythings better in sweden
Pudge: spitfire is sexy anyways
SuperBrony64 is the only reason I'm still here.
Never heard any other dub...
Pudge: spitfire is sexy allways

im off now everypony, night
P4ngya: used to it , were always the badguys
P4ngya: russians are good
I really dont want to watch this. The controls are are just too painful to watch
nighty Mekapix2
CrimsonPhoenix: Well we know Dash isn't a changeling for sure

P4ngya: the bad ones are the terrorist
Night Mekapix2

Night Mekapix2 :)
11,01Them evil Russians.
cratorkid: im sorry ur the bad guy :(
Nittany_Discord: why are russians always evil now?
the government
O.o seriously how bad looking can a game become to be able to look the same on Wii as on PC
usa government is full with bullshit
11,01Bronysith: Probably a holdover from the cold war.
Nittany_Discord: i thought it would be chinese that are evil since they have a shitload and could invade anyone at anytime
Bronysith maybe it has something to do with being the lest known enemy all these years
*last
Bronysith: russians are the new nazis
BRB i will play some Ib
oke :D
11,01China is our new rival.
Spectrum_Rush|: no
cachi01|Ib: Ib?
Bronysith: swaht the media thinks
cratorkid: yep its an awesome freeware game
Spectrum_Rush|: nazis are pure evil. they did completely evil things and you can kill as many as you can with no moral conflicts
Nittany_Discord: should be north koreah
11,01I don't know if they want to nuke us.
MaxTheBrony: who cares about Graphics? a mean i play minecraft and it dosent bother me
Spectrum_Rush|: russians only had cold war with us
cachi01|Ib: no what is it?
11,01NK isn't much of a threat.
cratorkid: you are a 9 year old girl called Ib
Okay Ill give. When did we start streaming console games other than Wii games?
My cousin bought a plastic Batman Mask from the store.. I looked on the inside and it said MADE IN CHINA, I was like, " BATMAN's SUIT WAS MADE IN CHINA! "
/me cachi01|Ib nods " go on"
This is wii
Sagas this is on wii
cachi01|Ib weird concept
sagas: this is the wii version of mw3
cratorkid: you go to an art exposition but when you see a certain pic you realize you are all alone and the paintings changed into some creepy stuff
Supersaga: True i dont care about the graphics normally , but in this case im afraid i do :) And the gameplay of this game is not welldone at all :(
as you advance you meet with a girl called mary
and a guy called garry
Pudge: I dont think so. The Wii version doesnt have the crosshairs centered in the middle of the screen, but all over the place instead
better rev up that rider kick
sagas: I saw him start it up on the wii
MaxTheBrony: True, True. The Game likes to "F" with me alot, after that i play some minecraft lol.
>_>
11,02That slow guy got me ><
:D
mary is later revealed to be part of a painting and she wants to go to the real world but she has to replace someone in the real world
XD
Ded
SB64 ded :<
sagas: he is using a wii mote attachment that is like a Controller.

Bronysith: iknow just thats wat hollywood is into is what i ment

tango WHISKEY =D
Spectrum_Rush|: but. hollywood doesnt make games....
Whiskey!
Tango Whiskey? That must taste horrible
:p
Bronysith: you know what i mean
its made of tango blood
Spectrum_Rush|: no. no i dont
pretty sure hollywood still think playing games can make you a hacker
dafuq
11,01I wish I could play Spec Ops with SB.
how can MARIO TEACHES TYPING turn you into a hacker?
Nittany_Discord: when is ur motherboard arriving. i really want to game with you
11,01It ships tomorrow.
Bronysith: the game industry, oh we need an enemy for the US... why not russians again and again and again
11,01Should arrive this week.
what game is this?
Anyone of you guys going to be In the PlanetSide 2 beta next week?
Derpy_Hooves: MW3

CrimsonPhoenix but I like using the thimble...
CrimsonPhoenix: random....
JESmith71: doubt he will, brawl is naturally laggy too
at least it's something different
Nittany_Discord: why not?
Would Spec Ops The Line happen to be on the Wii?
Superbrony how did you get different sounds?
/me misses the Game Cube
the only ones not buying it might be government fANS
So it wasn't completely me?
^^
11,02Discord: Different sounds?
It was my first console
cachi01|Ib - the equivalent would be an Xbox game being made where Microsoft is the major villain corporation
"prepare...to kill your fellow citizens...like never before"
not goint to happen.
:OOO
Superbrony when you click the disk channel and stuff.
MirrorImage: and soooooooooo
YES
Ooh.
XENOBLADES FUCK YES
Best RPG this gen!
oooooo o.o
cachi01|Ib - Xbox is a Microsoft product...
Aaaaand this is?
;) nice
Id like to see a game where you are a single man and your job is to kill every human on the planet but yourself
Aw shiiit
MirrorImage: and soooooooooooo
they would NEVER let a game be made under that premice
wat this?
a great game for once
Behold, the Monado!
MirrorImage: those bitches gotta deal with it
xenoblade eh?
...or they can say "No"?
So whats this game all about
their console, their rules
lowfn: i am alive
:O
This looks JRPGish.
Meanwhile: Because it is
Hope this isn't boring.
it is JRPG
lowfn: destroy all humans
ohhh Xenoblade
Meanwhile - gee... i wonder why?
Im off to bed , Bye all! :D
Well there goes any hope I had of this not sucking.
it's because it is JRPGish
but I believe there's some action in it
JRPGs are hit and miss with me
bye MaxTheBrony!
OMG I LOVE DESTROY ALL HI,AMS
11,02Night MaxTheBrony :)
Bye MaxTheBrony :D
HUMANS*
Xenoblade is the best rpg of this generation
good night MaxTheBrony
loooooooooooong
I gotta go to bed guys, see you all tomorrow! :D
sagas even action RPGs?
Night MaxTheBrony :)
Full of shit
Nittany_Discord: Not going to happen. Britain is just as bought out
night MadSurge :)
night MadSurge
lol
pinkiepie: BOOORRRIINNG
and I was British.
bye MaxTheBrony
I hate JRPGs.
and died
Nittany_Discord: fund it
11,01To support a new civil war against the corporate regime.
cachi01:Ib: But those games you dont get to kill EVERYONE... alot of people but not everyone.... I want to get to kill 6 billiob people
which game?
11,01It would rock.
What if it just ended their O.O
Dken2021: I said JRPGs, Not ARPGs
smelled like crap
I mean, look at these things. They look ridiculous.
Then everything changed when the fi- *gets slapped*
good morning bronies :)
parry damit
Pudge: idk. final fantasy 13 was great. i mean the story was fantastic with good gampl BAHAHDSHAHHAHAHAHA. ahhh lame, i could not say that with a straight face
Meanwhile: JRPGs are great if done right, not that load of crap known as final fantasy 13
lowfn: uhmmmmmmmmm scribblenauts!!!
so what is this?
Morning derpy_pony :)
cachi01|Ib: :D
Pudge: Honestly, I have never seen a JRPG done right.
which game is that? assuming it is one
Bronysith: I own FF13 and I hate it
lowfn: just type great hydron collider and thats it MASSIVE GENOCIDE
bio vs mech?
over a cookie
Pudge: it is the worst final fantasy
11,01Lol Discord.
Meanwhile, what is a JRPG?
11,02i liek cookies :D
JRPGs are hit and miss. Final Fantasy missed and the Persona series hit
is a cookie
cratorkid: japanese rpg
then it wasn't a timeless battle
/me eats Discord
D:
CrimsonPhoenix: japanese rpg
Everything pre FFX are good final fantasys
SuperBrony64 Do You Liek Mudkipz?
let me rephrase
Looks like a japanese Starship Troopers
What's a JRPG done right?
CrimsonPhoenix: The Persona series
FFX was uhmmmm how can you describe it? oh yeah HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA
cachi01|Ib: But the game I want is a game where I want it to be personal.. as in killing each person with SMALL bombs, guns, tanks, not something the kills more than 1000 people instantly
CrimsonPhoenix: Baten Kaitos Origins
dem mooks
11,02Supersaga: They cool :3c
GRUNTING
I'm asking that to Meanwhile
HYEA HYEA HYEA... HYEA
Really, FFX would have been a great game if about half the cast wasn't in it.
-_- of course a guy with a sword
who made this?
And that's counting Tidus.
CriticKitten: and dat laugh......
:D
CriticKitten: yeah the acting is bad but the battles are fun
bad lip syncing
horrible voice acting
and the music <3
sagas: What do you expect? It's XenoBLADE.
poor mouth animations
bad avatars
hello obvious guy who will backstab me at the last minute
games didnt always have crytek facial mimics
= gunna be a horrible game.
Waaaht?!
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh, it's a Japanese rpg. Usually means a protagonist with a goofy looking weapon, stupid hair, bad dialogue, and half the game is cutscene.
Dat Voice Acting
RobertRevenge: I did not know it was that game
I mean if a game have good music that can almost single handedly save a game
And sure enough, this has all of those already.
Meanwhile, and that's a JRPG done right?
Whats there to control?
The combat system is fantastic. The sphere grid is admittedly not great but it could be a LOT worse. And some of the cast are really enjoyable.
YOU BEAST!
CrimsonPhoenix: There isn't one.
Meanwhile, that's why I'm asking, what's a JRP done right for you?
Chocobo de battle LOL
JPRG**
ok im back ... what is this
CriticKitten: Wakka is my fave
CrimsonPhoenix: Wouldn't know, because one doesn't exist.
Edward scissor hands?
Characters look like they belong in One Piece
Wakka annoys me.
cratorkid Xenoblade
inb4 he dies
Pudge: Well Sonic 06 had good music but it sucked >.<
Meanwhile, then you just hate JRPG in general
He borders between insufferably stupid and downright insensitive.
looks like ff
So its wrong to obey retreat orders?
sonic CD scares the shit out of me
Supersaga: besides that one, dont mention that pile of shit to me :[
CrimsonPhoenix: exacta.
Its wrong to want to live to fight another day?
Meanwhile, there has been JRPG done right
Pudge: Lol Sorry
It's like world of warcraft
Looks like Final Fantasy
NO
Supersaga: "It feels like a cheap imitation of Star Wars Episode II which was a cheap imitation of a love story. Double the fail for half the price!"
looks like WOW
Without turn based
but you just don't like the presentation, the cast or pretty much whatever's in it
FINAL FANTASY TYPE BATTLE STYLE SUCKS
that what i said
Take Wakka, Rikku, and Tidus out of the game, though, and you have a pretty darn good cast.
cachi01|Ib: This looks nothing like WoW
CrimsonPhoenix: name one done right.
I hate final fantasy battles.
so much grunting
Discord: Pokemon says otherwise
The only really bad final fantasy battle system is FF13
Meanwhile define done right
I like pokemon, that's the only kind I like
I mean come on, you only control one character and the others act on their own?
cachi01|Ib: Well, only a bit
CrimsonPhoenix: Not shockingly bad.
Really?
Meanwhile: Persona series
i wonder how FF versus XIII will be
Meanwhile, is it to suit your personal taste
CrimsonPhoenix: There's no such thing as impersonal taste.
cachi01: It won't be anything. They've cancelled it.
BUT WHO WOULD STAND THERE, TWO FIERCE ENEMIES, JUST STANDING WAITING FOR THE OPPONENT TO TAKE A TURN.
these robots must be duds
Discord: POKEMON SERIES!
guys what if...... KINGDOM HEARTS 3 HAS TIDUS IN IT :(
I like pokemon saga
Tidus isnt bad
he just needs food
cachi01|Ib KH1 already had him in it
Dken2021: yeah but as a kid
KH 3 is coming
Meanwhile play the last remnant
Meanwhile, are you implying the game industry should focus on what you like and what you think is good?
Dken2021: and as a kid he is not annoying
Discord: Pokemon is the exact same way? What real creatures take turns attacking each other instead of mauling each other head on?
Discord: it has that kinda combat
Meanwhile, that sentence was hypocritical
Well, I should say they've casually avoided saying the words "cancelled" but have completely moved all staff involved in its creation into other projects without trying to be public about it.
Discord: the games are awesome but the tv show is the mmost repetative crap ever
So yeah, Versus is very likely dead.
sagas I know, it's my only exception
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm saying it sucks. What it thinks of what I think of it is irrelevant.
So many reused voices XD
You could call pokemon a jrpg
/me 11,01dusts Discord with a pink, fluffy cloud.
it has many of the elements of a jrpg
talking about cancelled games did you guys ever heard of Eight Days?????????
There are JRPGs done right since it fits the critera that makes a JRPG
It IS a JRPG.
CAN WE JUST WATCH BLACK BUTLER ON NETFLIX?!?!?
these character are gonna be annoying
11,01Discord: Not unless SB wants to.
yes 3 guys kill dozens
11,02Why does it take me 5 min to beat one of these things yet now they are just slicing their way through like they were butter? O.o
Meanwhile, then you have no right in saying that you haven't seen a JRPG done right
SuperBrony can we watch Black butler on netflix?
SB64: Because plot convenience
SuperBrony64 that's the power of cutscenes
sooo... are their swords guns or are their guns swords?
SuperBrony64 cause cutscene ?
Wow, they sure improved...
CrimsonPhoenix: Fair enough, let me rephrase. JRPG's are shit. Better?
like it wast obviouse he was evil
and that's your personal opinion
Betrayal!
Did he say bannana?
oh what a shock
Meanwhile: Pokemon was a JRPG and not shit...
-50 Loyalty
Stupid coward!
SuperBrony64, the magic of the characters somehow being able to do things in the cutscene that they can't do in-game
dat nose
also FFIV didn't involve a cast of character with goofy hair
I wouldn't say that in general, Meanwhile. I think that some of them have some good elements, it's just that the genre's currently bogged down in what I dub "Twilight syndrome".
He's going to get a banana?
:D
sagas: Got bored of Pokemon around Gold. Nowadays it's just rehash.
as well as FFVI
well he's going to die
11,02I'm bored of this game :3
Discord : LOL
CrimsonPhoenix: Implying anything short of fact isn't opinion.
but you just started....
Superbrony can we watch Black Butler on Netflix?
Meanwhile: Im reffering to the ones up to ruby/saphire
CrimsonPhoenix: ffvi is tied with ffvii and chrono trigger for my fav game of all time
I LIKE YELLING!!!!!!
CrimsonPhoenix: lets put it this way, Meanwhile 's dislike of JRPG's is like your dislike of Rina-chan... maybe?
11,02Discord: I don't know...can we?
Meanwhile: And they are a new group for every generation
Otay, im back and what is this?
Epic pan out tiiime!
why would one dislike rina?
sagas: Wouldn't know how many that is, because I don't care about pokemon.
SuperBrony64...no no no we dont want to watch that
Superbrony May* we watch Black Butler on Netflix?
Spectrum_Rush|, I respect that he dislike JRPGs
who's Reina-chan?
whooooosh
Turn-based RPGs bore me. Kingdom Hearts I like because of the real time battles...and mainly because I'm a Disney fan
Discord: SHAME ON YOU....we are not gonna watch that..
I'm just pointing out how FFIV and FFVI had a bad-ass cast of characters
11,01SuperBrony64: Let's watch G3 ponies!
Have you seen it Shamroc?
11,02Hey, that sounds like a plan!
but it was good
D:
owloysius: voice-actress, been in some games and does an incredibly authentic twilight voice
What game is this?
not the g3s
CrimsonPhoenix: and i respect that you dislike rina-chans VAing
SB should totally go get Sengoku Basara and stream that. D:
11,01Yay!
oh, that's who rina is.
Discord...read a few of the manga...and my otauku freind...she...wont stop talking about it..
Oh wow...
Dark_Horst, she's just lucky that Tara is in her slim voice-range
Superbrony I wanna watch black butler D:
Meanwhile: Well to each there own then, but you would be the minority. Pokemon games up until Ruby/Saphire are usually accepted as classics
What game is this?
theres actually people here...
I don't particularly care for rinachan either.
What system is this game for...
Bronysith: Wii
CrimsonPhoenix: probably. sounds authentic either way
What game is this?
Eulshy: Xenoblade
Eulshy: Xenoblade Chronicles
11,02I'm done playing :)
RobertRevenge: why does xenoblade have to be for the wii...
SuperBrony64: so what's the plan now?
Doesn't matter now
and it's not exactly authentic
netflix
sagas: Whether or not I'm in the minority is irrelevant, you're asking me personally.
Superbrony black butler!

Sagas, this was the old version of the ride. They changed the ride film last year. I wanted the new one streamed. But SuperBrony hasn't seen it, so he won't run it because he doesn't want to be spoiled

now that we are watching game reviews.................. AVGN1!!!!!!!!!!!
MXYL what?
11,01Everyone would pretend to be a maid and stuff.

Seriously, that unfinished game actually doesn't look half bad.

Be a maid is cool :3
It's a real shame THAT game wasn't released.
Nittany_Discord..oh that would be AWESOME Nittany_Discord..too bad your not a mod..

RAWRity: AVGN a rip off of irate gamer? blasphemy i hope your joking

time for the talk again...
proton jon sounds like mike
Who else besides Shizuka is streaming the movies this week? Shizuka won't show them because of lag issues from streaming right off of YouTube. Maybe whoever else is running the stream this week can show Star Tours 2?
Pudge: note the :p
OH MY GOD.
Not enough "f*cks"

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?
^
who the fuck adds that to a game XDDDDDDDD
Prepare for eye strain folks.
/me Facehoofs
/me Is not a fan of Irate gmaer
RAWRity: derp didnt see the :P
If it were AVGN, he'd be going on his ultra-vulgar rants by now.
soo tiny
/me isn't sure if he should be laughing or crying
look at these next gen graphics
11,01AVGN didn't even get to stage 2 in his review.
Nittany_Discord: this is stage 5 :3
50inch monitor?:O
Nittany_Discord: yeah but he is funny :3
15
pfft avgn and irate gamer are ripoffs of Nostalgia critic :P
oh
50 inch would be crazy
no excuses for poor flight!
Nittany_Discord: Well he got passed the rings
Spectrum_Rush| AVGN came before NC
Spectrum_Rush|: nostalgia critic is a friend and fan of james
In other words, he's looking at a 2.6 inch game screen...
Spectrum_Rush|: james inspired nostalgia critic
11,02I sometimes think people watch the AVGN for the guy just to yell his brains out, regardless of what the episode is about than to actually show a game.
:D knew that would get aresponse
| PRINCESS.|
didnt AVGN and Nostalgia Critic do crossover?
SuperBrony64: duh
trolololoolololololol
11,01I watch for the games.
Spectrum_Rush| in 2004, he was the Angry Nintendo Nerd
11,01Pudge: Yes.
Mp.
Watch the NC vs. AVGN Showdown on YT.
11,01They had a fake rivalry.
SuperBrony64: actually i really love james i can hear him talk about anything for about 28042823802350845380453805 hours and i wont get bored
too fast

Who is what now?
11,01There was an Irate Gamer that was seen as a copycat of AVGN.
Nittany_Discord: yeah its all about the games
I loved AVGN's SwordQuest review, since it was very informative of that old Atari contest
Till the insult video.
whos AVGN?
Nittany_Discord: and he became the laughing stock of the internet
irate gamer IS A COPYCAT
SuperBrony64: i watch avgn to see all the raped game concepts. for the crazy yelling and funny comments, i visit NC
Pudge eeyup. They also had a Board James cameo in the TGWTG 2nd Year Anniversary
sagas: Angry Video Game Nerd
sagas: angry video game nerd
11,01He did?
Nittany_Discord, are you the one streaming?
11,01What happened to Irate Gamer?
Nittany_Discord: IG did.
11,01I'm not streaming.
11,02People can't make game review videos while pissed off without it being seen as a copycat of AVGN?
oh never knew that Lunar_Brony
Nittany_Discord: i dont even know who that is
^
Who is streaming?
11,01I just thought he was competition.
irate gamer isnt nearly as good as AVGN
Is SuperBrony64 streaming?
SuperBrony64: got it
/me glomps SuperBrony64 and then dusts his toes
SuperBrony64: to be fair, Irate Gamer was also god awful at it.
irate gamer does 45 second reviews of current gen games
11,02O.O
/me hugs lowfn back :3
11,01I know IG went to new games.
what is AVGN?
Pudge it's true. Board James showed the guys at TGWTG how to play Risk . . . I still don't know how to play
11,01I don't know if he still does his stuff.
Dovah: Angry Video Game Nerd
SuperBrony64: Could you argue that AVGN copied Zero Punctuation?
ah
Imgine 1 precent.
but james besides doing good reviews and giving actuall useful information he does a funny show while doing it!
Lunar_Brony: cool i'll have to look that one up
Nittany_Discord: I know Linkara did a parody of him for April Fools
Dovah Angry Video Game Nerd. He plays bad video games and swears alot
00,10dat minecraft server
DAH FUCK WAS THAT?
relics from the development process
So this whole game is basicly like a training level?
I like the one guy who uses his abination fingys
He's not even all that ticked off. He's played it before and enjoyed it in a warped way. If any adjective could be used to describe him, it's not irate.
Pudge just look up "Kickassia"
