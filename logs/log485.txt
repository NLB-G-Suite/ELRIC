Guys it's the new "COD" P
:p
theyre like antws
08,01but enough about my digestive system
My tv is moving faster than the stream
13I never had a proper eating pattern to begin with, I just eat whenever I feel like it xD
A ROCK?!
Pikmin needs to be more realistic?
wat
06xD
woah
Rock pikmin?
13my appetite is weird though
Rocks?
Hey guys just tuned in is this the first thing they are showing?
MY DESTINY!

IT WAS A BIG ROCK
RustyMeat yes
ROCK PIMIN? LOOKS NICE :)

It's not just a Boulder! It's a rock!
05this
thanks Dken2021_
13recently I've gone into the "hardly eating at all" phase
05this actualyl looks itnriguing to me
They will stone their enemies.
13what's your weight if you don't mind me asking? :P
:D Throw the Pikmin at enemies
Nintendo already won E3 in my book.
Wrek|Dusty: yes...feel the power of Nintendo...let it course through you
horray a game about stoning things
It ought to. Pikmin 2 is one of the best games ever.
0657kg
I am aware Pickmin was out way before, but this reminds me a little of Overloard.
I'm getting desktop ponies
Nintendo won as soon as I saw dat intro, soulrider95.
06im longer then 1.80M
WTF
THE VIDEO STOPPED
14o.o
Oh there it goes

HOW U PUT STREAMS ON?
3ooh~
GilDash: I've got one and two of pikmin. It was fantastic. This makes me so happy
Is anyone else watching on TV and stream at the same time?
now lag
FOUR
alexxm: That's what I said. -_-
LEADERS
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGG
PIKMIN F***ING THREE!!!!
4?!
Well, Nintendo isn't going to spend the whole conference talking about sports and Kinect. Of course it's better.
wat
sorry GilDash
No lag here
Is he translating as hes talking ?
4-player multiplayer potential?
inb4 multiplayer
13I'm 5'4" and I weigh 47kg
Sylandest: Well, I probably won't ever experience it, so... :S
FOUR??
RustyMeat: Yep.
/me begs :(
13I've always been a light person xD
He must be a baws translator
Yes, it's very annoying
11,02Do I hear Online multiplayer?
CrazyCherry: *Steroid pony* YEAH!
Where's Olimar?
At least Miyamoto has got more charme and enthusiam than all the other suits in the E3s in the last years
4 player coop? COOL!
RustyMeat: Damn right
RustyMeat yea, miyamoto prefers speaking japanese than english
GilDash: you never know! The nintendo bug might come out and getcha when you least expect it
SuperBrony64: i hope so :D
that would be cool
i observe that most nintendo games are mostly surrealistic.. thx to mario lol
He rehearsed his speech, he's not ever listening to Miyamoto.
Starweardo: :D
NO OLIMAR?!?! WHAT IS THIS FUCKERY?!
Sylandest: I'm not getting another console when I switch over to PC.
hey RainbowcrashNBurn hows your day been
Okay, I don't really like the idea of Wii U, but NEW PIKMIN!
give us multiplayer
Myamoto.
MULTIPLAYER
Dumb lag
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
alexxm: its been good :) you?
Princess_Molestia: A secret ;)
At least the Nintendo games are interesting.
GilDash: aww...fair enough though. You told me your reasons, so I understand :)
JELLY FLOAT!
Michael: we saw coop.
11,01Myamoto doesn't speak English?
i'm good RainbowcrashNBurn
14D:
NITTANY!
Kandarihu: good
Nittany_Discord: Not very good.
13I just ate cereal :<
HELLO!
Wait, I'm not sure if it's really multiplayer. Sorry.
My stream crashed....again >_<
So replay feature?
13ans that's actually heavier than I used to be LOL
Nittany_Discord: he does, but his accent makes him hard to understand. He uses an interpreter for simplicity
YES
Nittany_Discord he does... very VERY poorply :/
Sylandest: If money was no object, then maybe. But it is, and I need all of it for the PC. :D
14ADD BUTTER AND OIL
Nittany_Discord he can, though he prefer his own language
Nittany_Discord: No, he speaks Engrish
WHy are we jst lisening to a guy talking about a game?
13I used to be 45 I think
14:D
Did I miss anything?
hai RainbowcrashNBurn
Dude, Nintendo just won E3.
i grew up with harry potter for ps1 not pikmin
I would expect that Miyamoto only speaks limited English.
3yes he does Nittany_Discord, he just finds it easier to have a translater
Looks the same as Pikmin 2. SEEEQUEELLS
14heh
14I used to be fat
*refresh*
14then VERY underweight
/me CLAPS AND CRIES OF HAPPINESS

Hooves: Eh...It's E3 =P
Question: I've never understood this, what does the N in GCN stand for?
did i hear that right...they showing 23 games in this hour?
Then leave Hooves, it is what is on for a bit
Only gamers understand why E3 is important
*u*
O_o_O
It changes how you play The Game.
:O
Game Cube Nintendo?
my computer is like a minute behind my tv
Evil_Spike: GDC is more important
Oh, alright, thanks.

But the Wii had that shit too
:)
pikorar: Damn it I lost
awww yeah
I dont own any nintendo software.
But E3 is extremely important
im not really interested in that will thingy
When will he add Youtube to the 3DS?
YOUTUBE!!!!
Amazon Video...?

wiiii
hoof points
We get to watch it with my butt instead of my eyes? Nintendo4lyfe

alexxm yup
Wait, I did not see Hitler Mii
I guess so, alexxm. Of course Nintendo would know about it.
ONLY ON NEW FORM OF GAMING
Dken2021_ first i've heard of it
And then the Wii U printed money.
alexxm it's like hulu plus
Devote more time... and time is money...
Ahhh

I'm sad to announce...
MIYAMOTO IS CELESTIA OF GAMING
That's actually a big deal.
2 game pads!
wow 2 controllers?
I'm so excited, I have to buy two now! : D
Will Wii-Motes on Wii U?
|Master-Derpy|: u miss Miyamoto being badass
cachi01|E3 no... Luna
Two gamepads
Mah boi, this DUAL WIELD is what all true warriors strive for.
TWO! That's one more than 1!
Lambo: yeah

DOUBLE GAMEPADS!!! what does it meeaaan?
Let's see this gamepad
My cat has 4 pads. Wii U - 0 My cat - 1.

AlienEd27: It's so beautiful! *sobs*
Nintendo Wii DS.
Kandarihu I love that game

More like PSWii.
ZR AND ZL
Drinking Game : take a shot everytime he says Wii U or Nintendo!
YES
I AM SPEAKING IN A CANTERLOT VOICE BWAHAHAHA
:3
FPS games, Nintendo?
RUMBLE
Nice
I would really prefer the sticks were below the y b a x buttons and not above
Hooves: FUCK YEAH CANTERLOCK!
LOOOOOOOOOOOL
Headphone jacket on the controller- that is VERY NICE Nintendo. Good thinking
THis kind of reminds me of the old Xbox controllers, the ones that left bruises on the knuckles.
Wii is so advanced =/
It's a Nintendo conference, TrixieBaconMuffin. I'd be on the floor before he gets to Mario.
Rumbly bumbly.
Evil_Spike: I saw enough FPSs yeasterday
This has everything.
And spying?
Looks expensive
Rumble+motion control doesn't sound like a smart idea
WiiUTheMicrophone.
:)
Wow, that has a bit much stuff on there
05that volume control looked somewhat fragile
I DONT NEED A FUCKING MICROHPONE!! RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJ
:$
/me does not have money for such stuff
ekips wiimote has rumbles
God, those controllers have got to cost $200 a piece.
Hooves: Play Phoenix Wright and say that
So basically, it's the DS touchpad
why does every game have to have a social side now
im happy that i have my psp 3g wit cfw
I'd rather make sure that the camera and microphone have to be connected when not in use.
Who will use the fucking Microphone? Create a dedicated Nintendo Headset
pikorar: increase the price about 100 dollars
/me looks at the gun
mario!
No, me first!
ZELDA
MEEBERS!
pikorar: Which means in the UK they'll cost £250... :S
WOO
They need to announce Pheonix wright...
New Wii U , so many buttons you're bound to touch some by accident
Look it's a gun!
kongregate?
teh|PheonixWright, good luck with that
Derp
Er, I'd rather the camera and microphone can be physically disconnected when not in use.
that's Capcom business
f*@k the mainstream
DRAWING DICKS ON THE TELEVISION
Evil_Spike can you stop bitching around and actually pay attention so you don't get everything wrong?
I used the wii before it was cool.
Do I see DK?
wiiU
Lambo nintendo's been known to make periphials then don't use them, ie the wii heart rate sensor
Wii U's got a gun
Wait, if I draw a dick, it'll be sent to others! This is perfect!
for Mario!
this looks pretty awesome
Each Mii is sentient.
Dken2021_: That didn't even come out
Draw ponies

A big o cock
Wii U will prob be the best handheld console... why? It doesn't have any competent competitors
EMOTICONS? Nintendo wins
GilDash: I don't even know if I'll get the Wii U... My Wii is okay enough... I'll just play Super Mario Galaxy 30 more times, that'll keep me busy.

Hooves: how hateful can u be...

Because Japan has Ninjas.

/me 11,01takes 3 shots (24)
Derpy in link to the past? All of my money
IT IS ON LIKE DONKEY KONG!
Is it just me, or the graphics are getting worse with every game?
11,02This better not be their killer title
11,01Not 3 shots.
Nittany_Discord: I dont want to go to nintendoland, it reminds me of Captain N: The Game Master ;)
Yup. Zelda has yet to either stagnate or jump the shark.
Nittany_Discord: Dude, you can't even count now. Please stop. :D
Tech demo
Whaaaaat...
Takamaru is a Ninja from an old Japan only NES Game
Made by nintendo
SuperBrony64: I think this is their Wii Sports for the Wii U
Oh, I didn't know that.
Wii there be Zombies in this… uh… game?
*Samurai... not ninja
SuperBrony64: :D
11,01I cahi coutn finee rer
11,02mitamaking: That would make sense

These graphics!!!
This better not be their big announcement
lol
All I see is Equestria.
guys it's only been 1 hour
Malavolent eeee-yup
I wonder if they have a Pokemon one
The big announcement is the Wii U price.
need to ponify this
So Awesome! :D
11,01$9001
im actually dissapontent in these new games
11,01That'll be the price.
Wii U price 599 US dollers
If they don't mention the price, it'll be worrisome.
11,01Really?
ITS AN OVERUSED MEME!
I would guess about $200-$300
its over 9000$
FivehundretandnintynineUsDollars
yifle1: So am I.
wat 600$?
11,02Wii U will retail for $899 USD
Dken2021_, Welsh_Pony: If they want it to die
nah
oh god, little kids with god complexes? that'll be the future of the wii?

i'm more dissapointed with M$
I would guess about $200-$300
and all this awesomness just for the little price of 1000000$
11,011 million money.
05so the wii U remote is the game master. and the others the puppets
05OMG a D&D game for Wii
Were any new games actually announced here?
05FUND IT
11,01M$ was awful.
Internet killed itself. AGAIN. What did I miss?
nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine.
OVER 500$
that's what nintendo normally prices stuff as
11,01They weren't selling games half the time.
Nintendo Zone.
Wrek|Dusty: YES< DO IT!!!
I'm sure the Wii U will retail for a price that's competitive with 360 and PS3. I'm worried about the price of those controllers.
this is the best of all the E3 so far
Wrek|Dusty: Lawl, Maaaaybe
*Land, not Zone.
Where's my F-Zero and Starfox?
Wrek To Kickstarter *whoooop*
I would guess about $200-$300
or else :o
Malavolent :)
Nittany_Discord: Everything here is to try and show off the Wii U though... :S
They DIE!
what P4 price?
Pac-Man!
11,01But they've shown more titles than M$
this is basically pac man with mario isn't it
did i imagine it earlier, or is ACIII on wii u?
11,01.
yes it is
Nittany_Discord: What did Microsoft show? I missed their presentation.
RainbowcrashNBurn: It is
lol
RainbowcrashNBurn yes it is on WiiU
1 Ghost and 4 players? This is Madness!
awesome
Malavolent im more the old games
Malavolent: Less than this
what is the PS4 price?
looks frustrating as hell.
DitzyHooves: Haha, probably 600 at least
Can the ghost go through walls?
Huh... Interesting
DitzyHooves was that revealed in the sony conference?
yifle1: I usually like the old games better, though there are some bright expections.
11,01Malavolent: Sequels, Kinect crap, and new XLB services.
05i think most of this is to show what its capable of
Nittany_Discord: And in typical Nintendo fasion, nearly all of them have been sequels or spin-offs. :S
11,01*XBL
nah... Nintendo would never go that high.
and Usher
this looks needlessy complicated
Malavolent i know
05to give the game designers some ideas
oh ditzyhooves, i keep thinking i get messages
lol
11,01None of the XBL stuff was game-related.
11,02Wrek|Dusty: They did that last year though :<
Did that ghost just rape Wario?
Malavolent im still playing on my ps1
Dun dun duuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnn
they have never priced something really over $300
SURPIZE BUTTSEX!
lawl!
Ghost is Molestia
Nittany_Discord: It seems like E3 is all about Kinect and Wii.
LOL
RAPE!
Nintendo does't have enough goodwill in the West to sell a $600 console.
Malavolent and im allways playing ps1 games on my psp
Buutsecs
flashlight revival
11,01Sequels and motion controls.
/me hands SuperBrony64 soem of his nachos (its basicalyl what it is)
Malavolent: Wii U you mean
11,01Every year.
Wii U will cost around 300
PS4 around 600
So it's a cross between Pac-Man Vs and Left 4 Dead?
SuperBrony64: what did i miss during the 3ds section, my pc froze and got it back just as they left talking about 3ds
/me nomz popcorn
/me noms on nachos
mitamaking: Whatever the name, it's very similiar.
o_O
rpae
Nintendo makes the new stuff, and X box does the same thing but more $$$ and slightly better
RAPE
I say WiiU around 350$
That ghost is a bastard
yifle1: I used to have PS1 too, good times...
/me steals some nachos from Wrek|Dusty
8,6Luigi 4 Dead
11,02RainbowcrashNBurn: New Super Mario Bros. 2, Paper Mario Sticker...something, and Luigi's Mansion
11,01Is the ghost an AI character?
Nintend creates Wii first.... Xbox creates Kinect
how do you get that italic text?
Nittany_Discord, no
kirzstryfe: Thought so XD
this looks needlessy complicated
Malavolent yeah what games did you grew up with ?
Ghost is the pad player
the one having the gamepad is the ghost
11,01This sounds fun.
SuperBrony64: all 3 of those sound good to me, especially paper mario
Ghost is player 5.
Looks cool ^^
11,02Yeah ^-^
ths sounds awesome
Looks pretty good
Nittany_Discord: So many ways you can troll XD
Interesting concept
I hope they have a pokemon one
11,02GTFO GIMME STAR FOX
I mean it looks fun, but not killer app
DitzyHooves: funny how Microsoft's been more successful. Well, it would be funny if it weren't so sad.
it looks intresting
Smash Bros now?
woah, im hearing japanease in one ear and english coming out the other O_O
Japanese. Always so polite
I STILL don't know what this is.
hows it feel Hooves
0u0
Prease take a rook

Kandarihu: The Wii outsold Xbox 360 by a 3 to 1 margin
pwah
Pikmin?
now its the trailer for what we just seen?
COLOURZZ
pwah
a rook!
pwah
Are you able to kick Mascots in the crotch?
pwah
Hooves: That's called "Linguistic" :P
huh?
this reminds me of Captain N: The Gamemaster :)
I saw the Sony E3 vid. They have their own version of Smash Brothers.
11,02THANKS NINTENDO FOR MAKING A NINTENDO LAND AND IT'S NOT THE REAL KIND YOU CAN ACTUALLY VISIT
without the Wii I don't think Microsoft would have thought of the Kinect
i see triforce
Was that supposed to me Mecha Ridley?
yawn
Nintendo does stuff first.
Did they announce other games than Luigi's Mansion 2?
lol i hear lots of beeps and know im doing it
SuperBrony64: :D
yifle1: I always prefered PC over consoles, for example I remember playing old Apogee games, Duck tales, Doom series etc. My most favourite game on PS1 is Ace Combat though.
why r they showing equestria footage?
yes Hooves?
GAH OWIE MY EARS
Nintendo Land is going around in a circle over and over again.
I think i sa kirby?
maybe later... we will have a real Nintendoland...
11,02Nintendo Land: Nuts and Bolts
thats a lot of minigames
so.. a virtual theme park
:p
SuperBrony64 but this is for everyone at anytime for the nice price of FREE (or 60 for an lifetime-ticket)
SuperBrony64: Wii U looks awesome, if any of the games shown so far are launch games, im gonna preoder the Wii U :P
dont say hooves!
Now we just need a real theme park >.
>.>*
valoreins i hope so
it hurts mah ears!

allo MakerDusk

Hooves.
SuperBrony64: in all my life, I've only been to Disney World once. I wasn't even able to enjoy my time there fully because I was with other people and my time was limited. Nintendo Land might not be physical, but it can be enjoyed.
Malavolent where are you from ?
GRRR....WHAT!!?!?!?
hey MakerDusk hows your day been
Oh cool
viva piñata ? , oh wait its nintendo land LOL
since there will be no lines, it'll be easy to access it.

SuperBrony64: did any of these games have online multiplayer features?
alexxm: stayed up till 4am last night, so I just got up >_<
11,02NINTENDO NO, SHOW US STAR FOX

That's it?

SAY KIRBY!!
You know what I said about BG&E2 becoming better the longer it's in development? The same applies with Zelda.
Nittany_Discord: It is interesting, but far too gimmicky for me.
no zelda? :'(
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
WAT
And our heads are not that big.
No smash bros?
What's the price?
And they say MLP is girly.
pew pew
Started off good but that ending... wow
So, this is a Mii MMO?
Well this game will outsell almost everything
11,02WHAT?!
NO FUCKING KIRBY :(
this is how they end it
11,02NOT EVEN GAMEPLAY?!
Fire works =D
Wow, that was anti-climatic as fuck

Okay, time to try to sleep
Sony wins for me this year
11,02NO
cachi01|E3: maybe next year.

Still a better ending then ME3.
Let's go to nintendo-europe!
WOW!!!
I think there is more later or on the 6th.
11,02NO I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT
e3.nintendo
11,01Shouldn't expect much from Nintendo.
/me gently pats SuperBrony64
Dissapointing or WHAT?!
I...I looked up to this...
This was a far better presentation then Sony's.
HORROR GAME
pre-show again?
Fun Fact: E3 2012 is the most depressing, anticlimactic thing ever.
this was.. underwhelming, but still better then the other 2
ugh dafuq?
SOMEBODY SAY BOO
it was still better than Microsoft
BOO
So, Pikmin 3.
So what, only 4 or 5 games interesting me?
BOO!
lol in the audience
i didnt have a choice jappy man :|
lol asian talking english
So far Nintendo presentation was a rollercoaster ride. Constant change between "Fuck yeah" and "Oh, god, why..." - so awkward things
Looking forward to Pikmin 3 :P
11,01CrimsonPhoenix: Agreed.
On the 6th is the 3DS show. All the new 3DS games will be shown.
It was about as good as Sony's conference.
SuperBrony64: calm down, there must be more announced as we get closer to launch
AttackWithHugs: you need to be specific
IM VERY DISSAPOINTET IN THESE GAMES TO MANY MARIO GAMES
oh?
Tov: Nope. It was better.
SHUT UP :{

I can't hold all this nintendo
I do admire how the concept is with the Wii U
I need some comfort food now
hi Very_Silly_Filly
11,02Panorama View?!
I still need to know the price.
ubisoft was the best!
Zelda music!
Nittany_Discord: And Nintendo is a-okay to do this? :S
hey Very_Silly_Filly what have you been up to
GilDash: that bad, huh? I didn't get to see Sony
it is fillé
Hooves: racist
A'ight, I'm going to go. I'm hungry, but I'll be back on at some point later in the day folks.
Pokemon music?
im out.....SB64, ya still here?

Wait what?!
Ooh, is this the wee yoo? :3
Sony had their own version of Smash Brothers, and a Harry Potter game that uses PS Move and the camera.
11,02Hey Octavias_Pride :)
Shimmer thanks
Beautifull
oooh yeaaah eargasm :3
ITS TIMES LIKE THESE THAT IM HAPPY I WAS BORN IN 1995
11,01Everything was game-related with them GilDash
Happy family ads inbound.
Dude
dat acting
that's beautifull
White activities
Sylandest: The worst of the bunch so far. You could predict M$ sucking, but Sony hit a new low.
I HATE these fucking "happy family" ads...
DUCKS. BUT THIS TIME THE GAME IS REAL
11,02THAT'S NOT PILOTWINGS, GTFO
tech demo?
I GREW UP WITH THE RIGHT CONSOLES AND GAMES
08,01hehehe
okay, that's pretty cool
wwwwwoooooooooowww,...not the g8
Nittany_Discord: Onlyin relation to the new Wii.
SuperBrony64: :D
You can do that with the 3DS, why are they suprised?
yifle1: Nintendo?
this is beatiful i think imight get this for my mom
umm
GilDash: ouch. I'm sorry they dissapointed you *hugs*
11,01M$ was the worse.
11,01*worst
enough of the wiiu?
this is pilotwings sequel
what is going on?
fucking happy families agrreeing with heach other IT IS SO FUCKING FAKE LOOKING
we get it :)
are they playing duckhunt?
That's kind of the reaction that my mom gets from any depictions of water in just about any game.
I'M A FUCKING BIRD!!!!
I hope the 3DS show has Majora's Mask 3DS.
00,03So what did we learn today?
wait what?
WOOOOOOOOOOO
11,01M$ pushing Kinect and XBL killed them.
Hooray Nintendo!
11,02Nintendo was best...but darn...not by the long shot that I was hoping for
cool but bad acting
mitamaking pokemon and ps1
why do they never show a raging family? i'd lol
Sylandest: I'm not a particular fan of Sony anyway. :D
pony_2243: Damn right, OoT is alone
"it's a mii! wow!"
11,02Scoot-Scootaloo: They announced NINTENDO LAND
Scoot-Scootaloo: Nintendo never fails.
she had some big eyes
nintendo ROCK
s
I will admit that looks pretty cool
GilDash: hehehe :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: Last of us = Must buy, Lara Croft = Must Buy.
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: i could tell you what i learned, but you probably wouldn't like it
11,02NINTENDO LAND
nintendo was awesome :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: That purple pikmin is best pikmin! =D
they should do an advert with a realstic family
I can go outside and do the same thing :P
Scoot-Scootaloo: Pikmin is going to be good and Nintendo needs lessons in what to end E3 on
Take a drink everytime they said "Wow"
SuperBrony64: Sounds like a theme park
11,02Of all the things...NINTENDO LAND
Nintendo Land ^u^
Dat Sensor
three sensors
I don't even know what Geomagnetic means.
nintendo know how to market to a large audience.
Um, a Nintendo trailer... and people are oohing and aahing at graphics?
Scoot-Scootaloo nintendo needs to hold on the mario a few years
But it does open up many possibilities
STICKERS AND GOLD EVERYWHERE.
<----- Quiet, you!
Scoot-Scootaloo hold back *
11,02NO, I DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT NINTENDO LAND
DAMMIT
I DO!
SuperBrony64: yeh, Nintendo land was dissapointing, happy about everything else shown though
00,03I learned that Nintenod doesn't care abou Pokemon or Super Smash Bros. ;_;
11,01Sony failed with PS All Stars Cash-In SSBB Clone.
let's see :)
NOT ANYMORE NITENDO LAND
11,02What a tease
is it good that i screamed like a little fangirl when i heard oikmin 3?
Nintendo Land, it will sell great, just like Wii Sports
11,02WHAT A TEASE
They're trying too hard...
LOL
The biggest hype for Nintendo: Nintendo Land lol
Oh god, not another ad.
Imo, Nintendo are best, they are pretty much one of the few companys who do not give a fuck about graphics and polish
PACKEJ
11,01GilDash: I know.
cachi01|E3: sure.
I'd rather see G3 than this.
lol that asian look like a dick hahaha
Malavolent: welcome to E3?
Those stickers in the Paper Mario 3DS remind me of the powerup stickers in Smash Brothers Brawl.
Nittany_Discord you seen that screenshot of their youtube video with the ssb tags?
animal crossing!
I HEAR ANIMAL CROSSING
And care more for gameplay and tech
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS
This is where I sign off... later everypony!
11,01Dken2021_: Sure have.
Oh gosh... why...
they care about making something fun that everybody can have fun with
>implying families play the vidja
Run guys! It's Goofy time!
i wouldnt mind this actually
BORRING
SNORE!
nice music :3
Asymetric gameplay has so much oppurtunity
OH GOD
controlling two characters? oh dear
Haha
They're so embarassing
HARD CONTROLS <3
>families
>playing vidja games together
Show us your Zelda!
My brain hurts controlling with two sticks
HAHAHA
Guess it's for the family lol
IMAGINE if it were used in Hunger Games video game
family games
mitamaking: I wouldn't say a word if it was an actual trailer, but these fake actor families piss me off to no end.
If families made this much noise during this game, I'd force them to see the docs
11,02"Animal Crossing? Zelda? Mario? and more...all in one game?" *gets up 'OMG SMASH BROS.'* "NINTENDO LAND!!" *throws Wii Remote at screen*
COMPLEX GAMEPLAY
i would get it:)
Asymetric gameplay has so much oppurtunity
USE THE WII U AS A CONTROLER
IMAGINE if it were used in Hunger Games video game
SuperBrony64: Nintendo land looks like the Wii U version of wii sports, a launch game that shows off the features of the console
Malavolent: This is the triler
That girl is pretty cute
This is hardcore gaming
LOL!
x.x
messge of the game: obesity is bad
SO INTENSE!
Why he keeps saying that "he's coming" D:
00,03SO MLG PRO!
the hell is this?
who's streaming?
Pink... Elephant!?!?!?!?
Nintendo needs to release Mother 3. It's been ages.
SuperBrony64: You still need your Wiimote
Scoot-Scootaloo: IKR
Only listening to the sound....Sounds rude
I like this simulated family
so....casual...
I hope this NintendoLand is free.
THIS IS JUST BORRING
I want to see an angry family on these game ads from now on. Nintendo, make it happen.
FU SPIKE
That granny is such a camping bitch
pony_2243: I disagree. The legal cuts would rape what makes the game good
Scoot-Scootaloo: its not MLG until hyperventillating is involved.
Dken2021_: I know, right? where would ever we find a family that really is like this?
ahem, that's Squirrel has a name: Peanut
Overacting much?
i would get this it reminds me of mario party
LOL casual gamers
M$ / Nintendo / Sony is NOT the only game developers at E3
Imagine Luna in this
And then everyone died. the end
did she say shit?
I hope they make a mario party for the 3DS
casual gamers = $$$$$
oh how much fun she would have
I can't get the DS one anywhere
xddd ohhhh casual gamers
What about an English version of the NES Mother game. Nothing 'bad' in that one.
....
what's with that soundtrack?
DONKEY KONG!?
*sigh*
0.0
GilDash: see, its when content like this comes out that I feel disappointment for my console...lol
she was hiding in the corner

This actually looks interesting.

Wii U looks like a PSP, am I right?
I know. it's a shame.
Don't bring DK into this! D:
where are the barrels?
I can't stand this...
AnnoyingBrony: Yo dawg...
nope
AnnoyingBrony: Sims in a nutshell
this seems intreasting
PSP IS BEST HANDHELD
DAT KID
So, is that father a widower?
Sylandest: I'm just going back to PC and putting the blinders on. :D
Stop kibitzing
really? they need high tier microchips and electronics to emulate a game my grandfather had?
SPLAT!
DED
11,01I stopped watching. Also, I'm passing blood from the shots I took =p
"Will you shut the fuck up and let me play my game, JIMMY?"
It's a good thing these games aren't hardcore, a controller that expensive would be a helluva thing to waste throwing it against a wall when overcome by console rage
it has RUMBLE yay!
11,01So many drinks.
Then again, I'm happy with my 3DS atm
PSP is sooo underrated.
Radu, bigger screen and actual Joysticks instead of these Slide-Pads
And suddenly the boy asked "Mommy would like this." And this ad turns into a sad family drama about cancer and loss
Nittany_Discord: I warned you. :D
Now now, it does show a possible, oh say, Star Fox game for the Wii U :P
3DS > PSP ^^
Lambo: Lolwut?
notbad
the nds is fine BUT THE PSP IS BEST
conference wasnt that good?
hello friends
LOL @ Lambo
OHHHHH
NOOOOB
I wonder what part of E3 will have Valve. They said nothing that the fans did not know about will be shown.
MORE SCARY THAN DEAD SPACE
it was good
confirmed
Lil_B: Ugghhhh. PSP joysticks are so bad
scary,they havnt played amnesia
hey Derpy_Hooves hows your day been
i want starfox or f zero for this :(
Even the vita didn't improve on it
HI DERPY_HOOVES
Malavolent: A full 90 minutes drama. I would lol
Sundaysmile: that won't take a lot :D
"Fucking casuals" pretty much sums up e3.
This feature screams for a Star Fox game I swear. The moving, the touch screen, the 2 screens
hai Derpy_Hooves
to me the psvita is just a big peice if shit
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS DONKEY KONG?
Very_Silly_Filly thats because they aren't real joysticks :P
I want to bone that girl

Oh, hello everypony.:)
That was random

Bananas are good!

OOOOHHH Donkey Kong.... Bananas....
asywaht
I still have hope for Nintendo
alexxm: Been good, counting down the final days of my school year, 3 days left now, and you?
pony_2243: lol Was suppose to. That little phrase is now stuck in my head forever :P
so it was a test made into a game
eat , run and fuck
well you're about to go banana's
why were people expecting zelda? they release like every 5 years and we just got one
On the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOn
Give them credit, they are trying to revolutionize gaming rather than make it more powerful
i'm good TheRainbowDash got the week off
SuperBanana64: Why you a banana now?:D
Does this mean i need a new wii?
Yeah like you are playing with family and not friends
alexxm: Oh, lucky filly.
11,02TheRainbowDash: Fruit hour :)
Scarlet: Wii U
Scarlet looks like it
I still have DK 64 and both that and me N64 still work.
again a fun test
and Kirby? We had one VERY LATE on the Wii
I'll get one once the price drops
GilDash: I just want more proper games...move away from family games please...lol
SuperBanana64: Yes, a new tradition for Bronystate. Is toast a fruit?
SuperBanana64: Again?
I wish I still had DK64. I never finished it! >.<
I have a wii and 3DS atm, and fine with them
Scarlet: That is like asking if the PS3 is different than the PS2
i miss starfox 64
hey peeps
Sylandest but it makes them monies
Sylandest same here
And the guy that made the music in DK 64 made the music in Kingdoms of Amalur.
I still have DK64+N64... I LOVE it
and f zero gx
pony_2243: These old games took 200 hours to finish, anyway, haha
Sylandest: That's why I won't go over to Nintendo. I'm a hardcore gamer at heart, and all this motion sensitive crap doesn't appeal to me.
gah y ears
Star Fox Assault was awesome I think. Command.... Ugh
GAAAH
They NEED to make a new F zero game
GAAAH
dat name
MY EAARS
if they want to revolutionize the should cut out linear story driven single player campaigns and leave only sandbox type openworld single player campaigns.
we fit you
GilDash me to
U FIT ME
GOD DAMN!
I just wanted to know if the wii U gamepad would work retroactively.
I would honestly buy a Wii U JUST for that game
wii f*k U
I can't stay awake any longer x.x
We fit you
but you already showed that.
MAKE IT STOP
for real. i want it to be just like gx, but for the wii
yifle1: /)
/me thinks it sounds like a tailoring game.
11,02Oiy...my favorite Wii U title thus far...is a NON-NINTENDO GAME?! Whhhhhhhhyyyy ;A;
dat ass
GilDash: some of the motion sensitive stuff was good though. I played the Red Steel series, for example. It was great fun, and wasn't one bit family friendly, lol
Inb4 burning calroeis.
just got back to school
What the hay....
and multiplayer
*sigh*
luge looks difficult
The last F-Zero was from Sega, right?
pony_2243 yes, I think it was ether Grant Kirkhope or Robin Beanland
Sylandest: It's why I'm going to abandon the 360 too.
Hahaha:D
This started out great.
ASS RACES
ah, crap >.<
:D
I hate this family
lawl!
:[
lol
/me yay
pony_2243 yup

pony_2243: As a second party deal, yeah
It was Grant Krikhope.
GilDash (?
BUTT as you can see, It's ending horribly.
BUTT MUSCLES
family gamers are $$$

You know, I remember when they announced Wii everybody laugh
Wii Fit U, now burning calories while you're sitting on your damn ass.
Wow, this guy is so motivated.
CLENCH!! CLENCH!!!
Sylandest: And as my house itsn't plated in gold, I can't afford a PS3. :D
i'd wind up braking that damn thing if i sat on it
If I recalled. SSBB was not announced during the Nintendo Press conference but the roundtable.

11,02Rayman Legend is the best Wii U title >>

nope
CrimsonPhoenix well it was a ridiculous concept
Yeah..calm down there dad your not doing anything foreal.....
He reached 88.
Sonic ass races
Everyone used their wii fit once, and then never used it again, why do Nintend think its a good idea to release a THIRD wii fit game, it's just madness
he's supposed to have his feet off the floor though
i dont like ppl making fun of nintendo because they gave us our childhood cmon guys they are bound to make another great game plz dont put it down
SO INTENSE!
But look at what the Wii is now
GilDash i know im just having some problems with the computer
Soooooooo much carpet burn
pony_9996: Time to go to the future.
(\(^.^)/)
GilDash: remind me to get you a system from my shop. We have tons of consoles for much cheaper prices than the rest. Quite literally. The only downside is they are used, but they all work, lol
double brohoof
them fools cant be srsly >.>
He is beat guys.
fart racing
EVERYTHING follows it and the Wii brought great games later in years
TheRainbowDash who said they were a family perhaps they're just random people he locked in the basement

Scoot-Scootaloo so many sequels!
But of course, it's based on Bush era liberalism in that they were only for smaller government because their own people weren't in the White House. Then Obama took office, and they were all for a dictatorship.

Articuno
08,01not the crappy rock pigeons that hang around cities

Kids can be so stupid

I like how the back of the dump truck looked like a monster
The whole house shakes just from riding a matress down the stairs? O_o what shotty constuction
pony_996: What challenge?
08,01sagas: to be honest, i've never tried cornish game hen, and all i remember about the taste of the pigeon was that it was a lot nicer than chicken, which is one of my favourite meats
He is going to love it
08,01i love chicken legs
11,02pony_996: What challenge?
08,01not so much a breast person

|Discord| where did you get your information about Ghost not doing radio anymore?
pony_996: ...which one..:D
SuperBrony64|FOOD, TheRainbowDash: the same one Ninjazz was doing the past day or two
pony_996 someone here was trying it, never heard of him since
SuperBrony64|FOOD: I think pony_996 wanted to watch a marathon of Newborn Cuties
08,01|Discord|: indeed
00,03wha-huh?
every episone in a row no breaks
NOM
Sylandest: I really don't know what Ninjazz did, what was it really?
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: i want to eat your leggies
19 hours
Barbetos|AtWork: He said it on one of his private broadcasts
Dken2021_: Ninjazz did it, he completed it
I'd never manage that
That was pretty cute at the end
in the meanwhile I coded a proper website for myself in the course of four evenings.
00,03Sorry, i lost my legs at 'Nom
pony_996 I definately can't do that
OH GOD NO
Happy song.:D

it repeats
XD
^that
it sounds like a happy song
TheRainbowDash: Watch the entirety of seasons 1 and 2 of MLP back to back, without stopping, over a period of 24 hours
Scoot-Scootaloo: Way better than Winter Wrap Up.

Dat feel when your cousin in her early 30s sings the happy happy joy joy song with you :3
ooh, is this the one with the mob guy?
I don't know if I can remember this song.
oh god my mind
why Lambo
I think so Dken2021_

Sylandest: Holy hay, that is a lot of time, I'll try to do that right after the school year ends in 3 days.

Lambo: were watching it
alexxm: He doesn't get to go to the happy happy faire
MahBoi777: ಠ_ರೃ Indeed
08,01sagas: i'll go own to the local farm shops and see if anyone has
alexxm: I don't like the characters. And the style...
08,01Kandarihu: yup
Lol
Sylandest: Is GilDash back?
lol
08,01honestly, i prefer living in a city to the countrysie
Hay SuperBrony64|FOOD, can you turn the volume up a little more?
Some of the intro close ups in this show look far different from what they actually turn out being - I never would have guessed it was Spike's nose if you showed me a still frame
08,01but this is just where i live right now
CrazyCherry: nay, not yet. Still getting dinner, i believe
08,01have to live, because of uni
well hey, I *could* create accounts and comment systems and such.. but I don't care enough to do that yet.
Don't talk and drive idiot
08,01once i've finished my degree, i'm outta here
08,01going back to Edinburgh
Sylandest: FACK!!!
00,03SPAH!
also I haven't worked with MySQL much, only sqlite. Not that it matters much for such a tiny website anyway.
08,01finish off my teacher training there, maybe
TheRainbowDash: do not take the challenge unless you are fully ready. you better make sure you dont have any plans ahead of time, and that you're ready for no sleep at all
this is mlp
08,01i'm still not decided on whether i want to continue with it or not
A fat tire
Tyre, jesus
lol
08,01the choice at the moment seems to be "become a teacher" or "do a PhD"
Spike dog is the the best dummy bear
08,01sagas: exactly
I think we should stream the challenge...
Man...why is the little gurl such a bitch.
CrazyCherry: patience, hehe. Gil will be back in time
12Gotta go in 15mins ^^;
no jack
08,01okay, bronystate, you know me fairly well
http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-Derpy-Hooves-Custom-Handmade-Plush-Plushie-G4?item=150826563202 want :(
ok!
12But may have an idea of where the problem is so I am trying to fix
first I'll be making a content page, and ponder whether or not to include all posts in all language menus because I write so little.
08,01should i become a teaecher now, or should i do a PhD?
Britan's where it's at
derpy_pony: Oh, heavens, she's even got her scrunch-face!
derpy_pony: so much money :(
then I can start thinking about whether or not I want a comment system at all.
ah ^^
Elvies
ok
hi all
and good luck, Articuno
and enjoy your evening :)
suddenly elvis
My mom always used to read stock offering to me before I went to bed
08,01derpy_pony: financially, i don't really care
after all I did fix commenting on the texts sharing thing now.
Deformance.
:[ im going to die
then get the education
yes
Nothing with lasers can be bad.
Sylandest: But we were so close to *squee* and she left so rapidly.
08,01to be honest, both Phd and teaching are not really good for the finances
Jail Break!
the dummy bears and their deformity
:'( my mlp fetish needs to be satisfied
pony_996: maybe someday
i'm really looking forward to running off with that thing ^^; haha

pony_996 fetish?
I guess your own long-term confidence in the Pound should be a factor as well.
CrazyCherry: I wouldn't worry about it to much.
CrazyCherry: we'll be back into it as soon as she returns, wait and see ;)
i think you're doing really well :>
Whoah guys we have a badass over here

alexxm: like old times :D
If I could stream :) I would play the worst pony things I could get away with under current rules
alexxm and Magical_pablez94: What about old times and licking again?
I'd play an episode of MLP... On audiosurf.
like what Cypresswolf|Work
If I was streaming I would play minecraft tf2 CS:S
Scarlet: awesome idea.
Scarlet: That would actually be very interesting.
CS: S
AttackWithHugs: And I go!
Just ripping the audio and audiosurfing that?
and some other games(fucking super meatbot)
Iron_Edge: Awesomesauce. how much do I owe you?

I don't watch porn have sex btw Under 13 so I cant lololololoollolo
TheRainbowDash: when nothing is streamed Discord takes over
alexxm: since Newborn Cuties doesn't shock as much as it used to....and "that fic which shall not be named" being too much - hmmm...this requires some thought :)
Iron_Edge: the ramen noodle diet. I know that all too well, and I go to a 2year school lol

AttackWithHugs: I sense a few kicks a maybe, just maybe,a timed ban.
Scoot nice story in the gaming section....NOT! RARITY HATER!
Technically, my use of Danbooru would flag me as such, because it HAS porn on it. But I don't look at that sort of stuff there.

Patience.

U CAN NOT HAS MY WAFFLE
hai Ponies47
AttackWithHugs: That Pinkie sense.
Dusty_Nomad: of course you can eat waffles
It might be better to have no privacy-protecting extensions than some that only let bits and pieces out. Because I would have to personally put those back into context.

umad
I'm pretty much immune to primal fear. I know what true horrors are. And I don't see them in the fiction designed to elicit such reactions. It's of the reality that the darkest period of human history is right around the corner. Nothing that irrelevant to that scares me.
Tell im your a mod!

alexxm: Keeps derping, crashing, freezing, (squee) like dat :|
Start bleeding lemonade

+b *!*@p-526-94-258-774, he banned hknv-367-20-724-84.
pony_996 :| tsk tsk tsk

good idea to set FB to private/friends only
he banned a different Host from 996
Scoot-Scootaloo: Muffin0 and i are the ones making the vid. im organizing it while he is editing it all
03some of us have friends that are complete morons though so that's irrelevant

/me plays air guitar

AttackWithHugs: what did he do?
/me is dead by a Train
Chrysalis: its the ponychat host
Cypresswolf: yep a while ago
i think
Scoot-Scootaloo did you just ban the wrong person, the host for 996 is different to the one you banned
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: spamming about wanting to watch ponies
Scoot-Scootaloo: pinhead
Chrysalis: then where is pony_996?
AttackWithHugs: lol that warrent a ban defs
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: he got kicked a few times before
Bronysith: If I record mine, do I have to mouth the words?
Look at all those conversations
CupcakeWarrior: no
AttackWithHugs: when did he spam how long ago?

My parents don't really care either...
I'm British and I just can't at the moment...
I told my mom I was a brony. She thought everyone other than me was a pedophile
GilDash: wimp! xD
Espeically since my dad is against bronies
I dont tell my mom because it would be way too hard to convince her that its okay to be a brony
sterotyping
It's because a lot of parents are cockrockets about it.
I'm british aswell
:D My parents can't shut me up about it
hmm..... well im one of those people :$
RAWRity By the way, amazing work on the Meanwhile x Trixie fic. I await your next story.
I haven't told my mum yet either
still not actually discussed the hat yet
Me neither
My dad probably would banish me to a desert if he knew I was brony, he honestly hates it that much
Sparkler is best pony
Banished to the MOOOON!
My friend left his house at 15 because his mum hated him for being a brony. D:
That's why I don't tell
My mom has heard of bronies from others. She's said before that it sounds "pervy" to her.

GilDash: But you are obssesed with it >.>
And did various voices for him.
I have a NeoGeo, umad
Om: theres nothing wrong with that!
RAWRity: That's awesome.
Airpuff: To much of anything is a bad thing.
So he's not a brony.
Including a line as Raven from Teen Titans where she told him that if any kids at school bullied him, she'd kick their butts.
is it a rule 63 twin?
Om: ... pff. Lies :)
RAWRity: wut happened?
