Saturn: I don't think I could handle DS9. Too much drama. Elsewhere in the Trekverse might be nice though.
Hey guys
Oh, I remember this ep!
00,02Saturn, well it would be interesting, but yeah
05we jsut sub
08,01oh dear, a wheelchair episode...

*Tumbleweed rolls by over chat*
00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_%28unit%29 << partial explination of magnets
Dem magnets
08,01i could give an explanation of magnets
08,01depending on how in-depth i go, it could take a good few hours
00,02Saturn, help me understand magnetic flux?
00,02(kg*m^2)/(A*s^2) doesnt make sense to me
/me forsees a wall of text incoming from Saturn as he tries to explain magnets
00,02aparently magnets really are just that wierd
They're like... magic! 6_9
00,02Saturn, its the seconds i dont get
00,02i think the real problem is i cant visualize magnetic flux
00,02well, i am
00,02everyone else is waiting for stream
i just got back from physics :D
and goddamn i hate my recitation teacher..
00,02could you explain how a volt second works?
or my english homework
00,02bah, screw homework
00,02Jmo, Briliant!
I'm related to Einstein it seems.
I like science...always fun to read about or watch
00,02twilight_sprinkle, equal to one weber of magnetic flux

05isntead of having it loop on menu
00,02can do
guys, i'm editing a picture and need some good music to listen to. preferably pony music. any ideas? a playlist maybe?
a D&D/MLP Picture
i just need any songs, as long as its pony related
SHO BE DO?
:D
That's all I've got.
ok then
TO GLORY!
:P
Dat grammar. :P
IKR
Good cop bad cop
his name is odo and he's a changling. sort of
shapeshifter, is the term they use
Odo has wrinkles?
Well that explains that
Oh derp. Bad reading ftw
"there changelings remember"
*base
Cardashian empire lol
he has no wrinkles becasue that surpasses his maximum resolution^^
gah this is confusing me you guys
Empress Kim Cardashian
I imagine chemicals would reek havoc on Odo.
if theres no contact between the surface and the spring
then its actually just a point
if there is contact
then its a complex system
oh wow, icechat didnt auto scroll
buffering:'(
o.o
oh,
half an hour ago
lol
00,02Chrysalis, but the way he/she worded it, sounded like it was sitting on the surface
Now kiss me
00,02and now i know
yeah it was sitting on a surface
yeah, that would make a difference
if the spring is suspended or resting
but either way, the formula is the same
you just need to resolve it before hand
here is a picture http://panda.unm.edu/Courses/Price/Phys160/F37-1.jpeg
00,02oic
00,02twilight_sprinkle, acceleration on the spring would be lesser, otherwise identical
00,02assuming a frictionless surface that is
it is frictionless
00,02g
00,02derp
and i got to go again guys, my house has decided that it no longer wants to work
00,02twilight_sprinkle, g*sin(40) in place of g, otherwise identical
toodles?
Problem?
wow, not heard that one in a while
:P
00,02twilight_sprinkle, oscilation should be dependant on the mass and k, i'm not sure how much it depends on spring tension
well I best be off
???
;)
00,02twilight_sprinkle, i'm just thinking it through, i dont think the force in the spring changes with its tension
dem wrinkles
00,02twilight_sprinkle, therefor any constant acceleration cancles out
00,02yeah
Hmm... Watch the interesting murder mystery, or sleep?...
Murder mystery it is!
00,02if the systems are otherwise equal, including the pull, then it should be equal
dat Cardassian neck trick
Dat softdrink
00,02twilight_sprinkle, spring and mass
My neck is amused by this, Odo
Gul "the neck" Dukat

00,10yeah magic tricks with a cround of people around them.
an entire cround?!?!?
or you could just shoot in the air for help
0,5WAIT
13you never shoot in the air
13ever
00,10that's a diffrent ep
0,5If theres no gunpoweder in the bullets
0,5Why are the bullets firing?
0,5How?
00,10fireing cap
are they?
0,5?
00,10they still have the ingnition cap at the end of the bullet.
13yeah cars can kill people too but you can buy those
but guns are made to kill and harm
cars are made for transport
^
you have to have a license to buy a gun
difference is gun licenses are free
00,10permit is not a license
and that]
cars are being made to less harm the enviroment and to cause less damage to things, guns are being made to do more damage
0,5*gremlin panic*
well with security as an excuse you can have weapons
13i think you just proved you're ignorant of reality
^
and that worked out great with andeers brievick
13see the problem?
but if you had gun laws then there wouldnt BE any bad guys with guns
see the problem?
13bullshit
there are gun laws
^
AMERICA
AMERICA
00,10every one should be required to carry a gun by law
0,5HAHA
0,5Im laughing
NO GUN CONTROL FOR THEEE
13what possible logic is there behind that
they don't give a shit if there i a law or not
ok look, lemme explain in the long run
is*
0,5Im gonna go commit murder and break the law
0,5wait a minute i cant break the law cause id be breaking the law
PHYSICS
0,5<trollghost> but if you had gun laws then there wouldnt BE any bad guys with guns
13that is the single most ignorant thing i've heard todya
If i wanted to shoot someone, and guns were illegal, i would still shoot someone
13uh
13nope
00,10grant logic
that solves part of the problem
yeah... no
13you're assuming it's possible to remove guns from the world
13the tech and knowledge is out there
13you don't get to take it back
00,10give me a pony, you can have my gun
pepperspray, batons, tasers, firesim guns
i can beat you to deatn with a stick
0,5Especially from foreign countries
13you could hurt someone with those
0,5PNCLS R DNGERUSS
/me knows how to make a railgun
justice requires punishment like hurting for insentive of people not doing it
anything is a weapon
13someone could get hurt
13for that matter
no no no, KNIFES are not made to kill people, unless they were
xD
reading is a dangerous thing
you know whom read things?
13sb is right
its a lot more inconvenient to kill someone without a gun.
... knifes not ment to kill........
^
Stalin read books too
13BUT THEY CAN
0,5NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LIVE
13you could hurt someone with bricks too
0,5NOW NO ONE CAN BREAK THE LAW
13no more houses
why are we feeding trolls?
wat.
is going on.
;~;
ok lets see how many mass murders were caused by guns
I could Kill you with my hands, are those banned too?
all of them
13GRAVITY IS AGAINST THE LAW
13trollghost: uh most of them were caused by bacteria
the crusades didn't have guns
I can wound a whole classroom in seconds with my bare hands.
and swords
lots of swords
you can be killed by a pillow
lets see how many were killed by other modern day implements (excluding bombs, which are already illegal) minimal
13in that case most of them were caused by bacteria
0,5^^^
0,5No bacteria
0,5If you are caught with bacteria you die
13then we cease to exist
OK, well lets see. bombs, illegal, bioterrorism, all AGAINST THE LAW
masturbation
no, we are talking about man made localalised murders
/me questions the age of people here.
caused by americans, to americans from american gun laws

It's a dangerous place
they got polar bears
penguins
fucking moving iceburgs
13as the level of force you're going to inflict rises, it deters conflict if the other side could do the same
13thus, gun freedom
http://listverse.com/2011/10/22/top-10-deadliest-rampage-killers/ lets see how many were caused by guns
oh, look, all of them
sure, there were some other implements, but all in all, GUNS
13i think we've demonstrated you're a moron, go back to the ivory tower please
ok, if guns were never invented
a large amount, maybe a majority of deaths would not have happened
and we wouldn't be that developped

then people may have guns, but they would be pretty crappy guns, not even worht maniacs buying
13yeah that's even remotely close to being realistic
13except they would still work
13and now you have an entire planet that can't defend itself
13well done
also, nothing is stopping someone from making a gun themselves
its not that hard
13twilight_sprinkle: against the people that make their own guns
and if you outlaw all guns, how do you defend against them
13and completely ignoring reality
Tribalism is still too rampant for mankind to give up guns.
railguns are awesome
13then someone has to make guns
seen that navy railgun?
wait, now he's going back on his arguments from before
this is fun
13but you banned the manufacture of guns
simply through friction of the round
13you're contradicting yourself
0,5Think of it this way
0,5Someone wants to commit murder with a gun
0,5Illegal gun or not, they're going to commit murder
0,5Just like there are drug dealers
dont give fucking maniacs guns
hi everypony
13it's common sense
0,5And you know how Alchohol used to be illegal in the US?
0,5People illegally sold alchohol. Called bootlegging
yes yes illegal production of beer
c'mon man. i'm all for starting shit and getting people riled up, but at least have good points to back yourself adn don't contradict yourself when someone proves you wrong
age of prohibition
but come on, it would have been pretty shitty beer
have some tact
13and prohibition fails and fails and fails and fails with guns
fun fact: during the prohibition of alcohol in chicago, the amount of sold alcohol in the town multiplied
this aint cod
there are ALOT of themn
guns are not something you cfan easily hide if you are going to use said gun
oh man
i have a gif
you know? from the gunshot?
that i had saved
and the shape of large guns
Just count the weapons you can find in the room you are currently in
if only i could find it
the only thing you could do is stop selling ammo
0,5i can go on and on
The cigarette culture died in America. I hope that the gun culture is at least lessoned.
13Buytoast: was a anti-gun thing for schools iirc, a teenager pulls like fifteen guns out including a long rifle... and you know he couldn't walk at all with all that hidden on him
THE FIRING OF A GUN I MEAN
the gunshot is a giveaway
but stil, they were hidden
There was a group of kindergarteners playing cops and robbers, and they were doing gun signs with their fingers. They got expelles.
expelled*
brb
Ive already said, ill compise
Dont. Give. Maniacs. And. Idiots. Guns.
there is no compromise, there's only winning or failure
*common
they can get the guns themselvs
13yeah you have no idea...
13you are assuming all humans are rational
13they aren't
Humans are a most illogical species
We're the only species to cook our food.
why, i could probably go out, purchase a gun and slaughter my neighborhood right now
and i'm not a maniac
pfff
arrogance
hi
I hate arrogance a shitload.
13given a choice between arrogance and ignorance, i'll take arrogance
oh wow
you're even stupider than i had thought
ugh my spelling....:P
and that's beautiful
I saw pop rocks!!!!
sea ponies
shoo be doo
Thankies for the stream summi!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
*hums*
0,5well
0,5ive been convinced
*to it*
SHOOPEDO SHOOP
should find the entire episode of this
13twilight_sprinkle: saying something is illegal does not remove the problem, it just makes innocent people unable to legally defend themselves
Hey everypony! :)
ermahgerd sae pirnies, guess we should ignore whatwe've been talking about fothe past 30 mins, sorry it dont work that way
/me mons on it "thankyou
13that's the easy way
00,10yeah if I knew where to send it.
13they won't
00,10oh wait, i know

someone has a gun? use that..
But we have the right to bare arms in the constitution
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/IhfonX.jpg
13twilight_sprinkle: gas masks
0,5Screensnapr is actually working again?
0,5Ah
13tasers? armor that diffuses the taze
headgear
pepper spray doesn't always stop em
sometimes it just pisses them off more
or in his disoriented stae he starts fireing wildly
and pepper spray doesn't alays work
13you aren't allowed to use equal force
Coffee?
13you are at a self-imposed disadvantage
13in the words of sun tzu
13that's retarded strategy
theres no such thing as a totally non-lethal weapon
ever heard of bullet ricochet
tasers kill people all the time
oh man
this kid
tasers are overused
it's like mc donalds
http://electronicvillage.blogspot.com/2009/05/taser-related-deaths-in-united-states.html
i'm lovin it
13well done
on guns... then somehow nukes
are we still talking about weapons?
yeah
because the US goverment is a body of assholes i know
but it wont stop the nuke hurtling towards you
instead of facing the endless possibilities of reality
13because the enemy is not showing the same restraint
yeah I went there
13YOUR people can still be killed quite effectively
13you are wasting friendly lives
rubber
We'll get our guns from mexico. Simple/
rubber can still kill people.
Besides. Guns =/= nukes.
13why would this country do that, there's no benefit to it
when you shoot, you shoot to kill
13there is greater economic benefit as a whole for one prosperous country to not kill another
not to disable, not to cripple. TO FRICKIN KILL
13that does not apply to individual rationality
oh man, this is beautiful
on one side we have retard mc gee
on the other rational thought
and in the middle of it all a shitstorm over bullets
this has been a good day to not sleep in
13twilight_sprinkle: where do you put them?
http://derpy.me/tcM5-
13because criminals never share information in prison
you're*
13good
13what about the ones that don't
13you can't get them all
13the point is, civilian ownership of firearms is first and foremost a deterrent against force
a gun in the hands of a 90 year old lady levels the playing field against a homeinvader or burgler
And some people feel sfaer when they have a gun in their house. It's just a matter of preference.
ok, we in the uk have banned guns
let me tell you how many people get killed a day from public gun violence
1
13twilight_sprinkle: not if the populace is armed
you in the uk also can't put up shit to protect yourself because it might hurt the criminals
we dont really care
13see: the american revolution
I always wear kelvar when I invade homes.
http://narcissustattoos.deviantart.com/art/Queen-Chrysalis-Tattoo-301880835
AMERICA
13so we shouldn't even give them the most basic level of defense?
omfg
thats awesome
if guns dont kill people, but people kill people with guns, dont give people guns
13that is..
13wow..
thats why we have the national-guard. the 2nd amendment talks about a well-regulated millitia
And keep in mind that that's going to be a last resort. Civil disobediance is the penultimate option.
13people could be bombed therefore let's not even give them the ability to deter criminals
but are any of those methods as easy as with a gun
but as we're not continiously revolting against our elected officals, which the constitution also says is wrong, it also helps that the 2nd amendment addresses personal self defense.
Wow
Hello
i doubt it
00,10land*
MURIKA
Militias should have access to Surface to Air missiles.
00,10Buytoast, stop that line of logic right now
13TheMaster: and yet, second amendment
is for the states to form their millitias and for citizens to also protect themselves from criminals
has knive in jacket sleeve walk past someone and quickly slit their throat and continue walking.
hey look i just killed someone without a gun and it was easy as fuck to do
My Little Pony. My Little Pony. aaaAAaaaAAhh
:D CMC Astronauts :D
its not guns that are scary. its criminals that are scary.
13yeah it's getting old
you're blaming the wrong thing
would anyone be interested in roleplaying is magic?
13the base premise of the argument in favor of banning guns has been thoroughly destroyed
Any level of government can be corrupted. That's why there has to be checks and balances at every level. ONE of those checks are bound to kick in
but the constitution is fairly centeralized
Maybe we should move onto another subject.....:S
or debate
00,10no that was just the stupidity of lets outlaw things that kill argument you opend with
well, now that the rabble rouser is gone
its hard to say where it really starts Kawaii. All presidents build executive power off of previous administrations
No way, he left?
oh say can you see
roleplaying is magic? whats that anyway
i went for a round of tf2 and i come back to... this?
Comes to think of it, ew York is probably the most controlled state out of all of them. You can't buy fireworks here, menus need to have the calories on them...It sucks :P
Everyone peole drop the argument
why can't we have a discussion?
13in other news issac made landfall i believe
Nopony is down there, right?
13at least i know the RNC is gavelling in and out today to resume tomorrow
permaban him
FOR AMERICA
mabye the solution is to have a diffrent channel if you wnat to talk about it
how about we talk about my favorite theme: music
Even if some aren't the most logical.
Whatis friend ship is roleplaying?
in other news, no stream?
If we permaban someone for having bad opinions, the next person to be permabanned might be me.
13just look at reality tv
Three. Hours. Dungeon.

Mystcraft does some really nice things with portals
including portals of any size/shape
and ones which makes people going through drop all their items
13i think it's item 9
13or 10
cause then you can just use a chest cart
13yeah hopefully that makes carts work
00,10then again if you have build craft you dont need portals
00,10just lots of pipe.
00,10and the abilty to not explode the pumps

Hey luna

Part of me wonders if I could code a HTML 5 relay of the stream
yeah knida sound like that more
It's likely doable one-to-one but multistreaming would need more bandwidth than I could afford

bye
sorry
as well as a non-image link during stream which is also not allowed
:'( sorry i didnt know
Read Da Rulez

It's mostly vid links that invoke the ire of the mods
I was joking at the end
Read the rules or receive a boot to the face.
*head :P
No I definitely meant face.
goodnight
i<3rainbow dash
how are you today
:D
Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6.
Let's not hate any of the Mane 6. If anything, you can dislike them but not hate.
I must say Rarity has outdone herself http://fav.me/d5cmoat
Hate can be a very strong word.
I hate Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash just annoys me. She's a douche.
&)
Rarity is my favourite out of the mane six, to be honest :$
Rarishypie are my three favourites
._.
SOmetimes.
She's a douche
there's no best pony, nuff said
Everyone has their own opinion on the ponies.
...
Same thing.
I never say, "[Blank] is the [blankest] pony." 'Cause why bother?
This song~
lol
this song is lol
Now Pinkie Pie, that's a best pony.
Stupid grammar error.:|
yeah and part goat but thats not saying he's nibbling washing on the line
piccard pony is best pony
In this instance it does. Because we're speaking in a metaphorical sense.
:3
If we were speaking literally I probably wouldn't compare Rainbow Dash to something used to clean a vagina.
...interesting song
Her complexity, charisma and motivation is beyond interesting
^
I am the best pony, motherfuckers.
:P
<.<
Objection, Pinkie Pie is best pony.
well i'm leaving this page Goodbye
there's no best pony...

WTF LIEZ
Fluttershy is second worst mane 6.
^hehehe
everypony is best pony
^
:D
Objection, Trixie is worst pony.
Luna is best pony
Trixie is 3rd best pony, Rarity is 2nd
Fluttershy is my second favorite Mane 6
after that all ponies are best except fluttershy
Trixie's just a jerk.
WTF LIEZ
maybe Luna is slightly ahead of others
you missed best pony fighy
FLUTTERSHY IS AWESOME
Trixie is a jerk, but I still like her
LOL
MYAH!

Just out of curiosity, are they riffing as their MST3K characters or no?
I'm not one to read fanfics.
JAWS!
MLD is overrated cause it's considered the most popular fanfic when it doesn't reach to quality to deserve that popularity
THAT is why it is overrated
dem drugs
it might be decent, it might have made people cry but it is also overrated
Stamping on feet can make people cry.
GRINDYLOWS!
wasn't there a even more ridiculous long fic longer than FO;E?
it's the longest fanfiction currently

Behold
its glorious
The Looney Tunes Show is a steaming pile of shit
THE Looney Toons Show? eh, different, but wouldn't call it garbage, just the jokes are pretty mature for a kids show
Even if its not as "slap-sticky" as the old one.

Actually, Furries began back in the 80s a spin off of the phantasy and scifi fandoms, officially with a meating discussion of a character in a star trek comic. yes, Startrek created the furries.
YES, Taz was a pet in one episode
Let me repost that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN9a3WhCo-c
Let's not forget the infamous Chickenhawk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX5-bfLg9r0&feature=related

I don't really like the Taz as a bpet take, but I'll have to get used to it.
