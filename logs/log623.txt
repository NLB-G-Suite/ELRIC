Hey guys
Oh, I remember this ep!

DS9 is probably the most relatable part in Star Trek
ach, deutschland
oh, space cripples?
i got one of those!
00,02who is 'her'

Hay Chrysalis
that took a while.
08,01Chrysalis: i haven't

08,01Chrysalis: but, y'know, i was there
Wrek: sad thing is I'm german and I didnt realize -_-

i think this may have it
Stubborn "I'm not a cripple, dammit" lady
Welcome to Bronystate home of the Star Trek streams! :D

05they both have dicsk?
08,01Wrek: hers is bigger than julian's
maybe low gravity dicks grow larger
maybe need a pool stick to keep it in check
08,01hammer a nail into the end of it
so it don't float away like a st patrick's day balloon

oh fuck it's like some mary poppins shit goin down in space
must be six o bong
00,02Gold_Demona, ikr
Phase4 unless the low gravity tyhing is fairly new
Phase4: this is sar trek dont bring logic into it
and they have shields keeping the air in
Buytoast: *sings* I love to laugh~ Hahahaha~
so kids grow up with low gravity and a contained atmo
shit imagine if they broke that glas
they'd fly out like kites in a tornado
although, planet scale shields
think of the power requirements
Gold_Demona: and if something doesn't work, technobabble your wayout of it :D
MadSurge: Exactly
String a bunch of sciency-sounding words together and BS your way out of anything.
Odo is best changeling
Odo + Quark = Best bromance ever
05dat odo smile
It's always bad when Odo smiles. o_o
Gold_Demona but you forgot the really easy analogy
Gold_Demona: No, it's always bad for Quark when Odo smiles.
Chrysalis: Oh?
nevermind
i was turning the startrek joke into the futurama joke
Mmm Romulan Bricks

my internet derped can someone kick alexxm
alexxm1 you can ghost it
ded
where <nick> is the one you want to kick
and <password> is the one you registered
see, easier?
What id you never made a password? O_o
then you can't
youll have to get a mod
or wait for the 4min timeout
Gold_Demona, then you'd just have to wait for your real nick to timeout
I see
It autokicks itself out anyway
or you could MAKE a password then and there
considering how easy it is to register anyway
heh
dat effect
...that'S bullshit

Yeah, the Ferengi are sexist little bastards, but for some reason in their society it comes off as funny. :P

I shouldn't laugh, but it's quite funny.
PillowPoni: not really, it hit the corner of the door with the nerve and now i can't feel my left arm :S

/me revives chat
*Tumbleweed rolls by over chat*
00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_%28unit%29 << partial explination of magnets
Dem magnets
/me 08,01smells science
08,01i could give an explanation of magnets
08,01depending on how in-depth i go, it could take a good few hours
"Today's forecast: 70 percent chance of SCIENCE!" - Adam Savage
00,02(kg*m^2)/(A*s^2) doesnt make sense to me
too much science is happening! GAH
00,02aparently magnets really are just that wierd
They're like... magic! 6_9
i'll understand when i get to learning that kind of science. probably not in the school year i'm in now
Oh my god Series 7 next month ;~;
TV, Y U SO SUPERFLOUS?
00,02i think the real problem is i cant visualize magnetic flux
00,02twilight_sprinkle, Welcome, we're doing science
00,02well, i am
yay!
00,02everyone else is waiting for stream
i just got back from physics :D
and goddamn i hate my recitation teacher..
00,02could you explain how a volt second works?
or my english homework
Like this Phase4
/me slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
00,02bah, screw homework
00,02Jmo, Briliant!
Jmo: revolutionary!
I'm related to Einstein it seems.
indeed
I like science...always fun to read about or watch
also, morning, everypony
i forget what a volt-second is anyway
Mornin' Sylandest
hoi Sylandest
morn', Sylandest
and btw hi Phase4 :)
00,02ohai twilight_sprinkle :P
00,02twilight_sprinkle, equal to one weber of magnetic flux
hi again everypony
Hello Flyboy
i haven't learned about anything we're discussing yet! damn my school for not teaching me this stuff yet
Phase4: whats the point of it? cuz its been 2 years since that was shortly mentioned in high-school :P
and hi Flyboy
tommorow is my birthday. and i'm getting a new computer that actually runs my games
GAH, got only the Platinum God achievement left in Binding of Isaac
Ergo, FIND EVERYTHING
according to random internet site, looks like volt-second is just derivation
Yay more nightmare fuel! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33sf4G4JLmI
Well more just bad memories then creepy distorted music
than*
After F.E.A.R. I find music boxes really creepy :3
Yay I killed chat :S
Good job AdamTheDuck. Gold star.
lol
/me places the gold star on his hat. Yesh I feel special :P
Phase4: so i guess volt-second is just the units you get by deriving the flux, hopefully i wont forget that this time :P
rainbow factory........ that song is related to something i'm working on :3
my recitation math/physics teachers suck this term...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0o61_48-0o&feature=relmfu
This music kinda sounds Danny Elfman-esque
hey is enyone out there
trollghost: Ohai
Hi trollhunter
chat seems abit ded
We're just sharing creepy songs with each other apparently. :3
AdamTheDuck: hello?
btw Phase4 do you have any idea why the formula for the period of simple harmonic motion of a hanging spring is the same of one thats on an angled surface? formula is T=2pi*sqrt(k/m), altho i would think that on an angled surface itd be smaller
Sharing creepy music and talking about science while we wait for the stream to come back on. :P
sweet
beatles is good morning music
creepy you say like what
00,02twilight_sprinkle, was distracted, someone else trying to explain flux to me
A flux is like a muffin.
ooh you
hey ppl
Phase4: oh you need to explain flux? i cant do that
This is my alarn in the mornin' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OLJXVGh0ss
Hello there JakyBoy98
00,02twilight_sprinkle, and i dont quite get what your talking about, first is hanging like attached to the ceiling? whats the second?
alarm*
I need something fast as an alarm
is the stream on?
Phase4: second is like a spring on a surface which is at an angle to the ground, just a spring lying on that surface
JakyBoy98: Nope
:C
Phase4: but yeah, i can try to explain flux if you want
One does not simply explain flux.
Phase4: although i dont think ill explain it much differently from whoever is explaining it currently
trollhunter: But it's such a relaxing way to start a mornin' :)
anyone got any sugestions as to what i should draw?
Slipping out of bed to make a coffee while listening to this song coming from 2 rooms away
so soothing
00,02twilight_sprinkle, the person who was trying to explain it was my dad, and its been 30/40 years sense he was learning this stuff so he's trying to remember it all
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
COFFEEE
Phase4: "was"? if youre not busy with him anymore, i can try to
Phase4: i mean if youre not busy talking to him that is :P if you are, sorry or distracting you with all the pings :$
coffee and ketle next to my bed best idea I ever had
dat ketle
05back from my absense
yay
cut me some slack its late
dat absense
o.o
Never trollhunter.
Ohai Wrek , shall we continue our debate on whether stealth is better than power armour? :D
00,02Wrek, DAMNIT
Dat wakeup call. o.o
yay~
05depends AdamTheDuck on the purpose
XD
YADADADADADAD

Wrek: For fun Wrek, always for fun. :P
MORE RABBLE LESS TROUBLE
00,02Wrek, check skype
05a fear inducing frontline trooper with high firepower that can take as much beating as a tank without going down, and being more mobile than a tank
05nice morale boost
is this the doom guy
05aswell as being demoralizing for the enemy troops
we're talking about
alexxm: Eeyup
thanks AdamTheDuck
05AdamTheDuck: though i do not argue that stealth ops would be an effective mean.
Yes, I see advanced armour being a great asset to a war-time scenario but think about stealth, one could end a fight without the other side knowing who even initiated.
Or even before the war starts
I like using fancy words, makes me feel smarter than I actually am :D
indubetably
05thing is
Ooh what's this on the stream right now?
so Phase4 do you want me to try and explain flux?
cant promis anythin tho
00,02twilight_sprinkle, in pm
Another gold star for AdamTheDuck.
05the stealth would cover an entirely other aspect than the trooper
mkay
the hell is this btw?
05serving different purposes
05both would be great assets no doubt
05anyways gona lie down
05Phase4 will ninja after the EP
Huzzah~
Yeah I can't be stuffed thinking of more arguments at this hour :D
00,02i may or may not, its getting late here

Good cop bad cop
why does he look so happy here?
Why does that guy creep me out?...
Which guy?
The guy with no wrinkles
Rofl AdamTheDuck.
oh that guy
Looks so unnatural
his name is odo and he's a changling. sort of
shapeshifter, is the term they use
Odo has wrinkles?
Well that explains that
Oh derp. Bad reading ftw
"there changelings remember"
hes a changling, he lives off love?
his bade form is a puddle of orange brown goop
*base
Cardashian empire lol
he has no wrinkles becasue that surpasses his maximum resolution^^
he'S not hd-ready, so to speak
gah this is confusing me you guys
Empress Kim Cardashian
I imagine chemicals would reek havoc on Odo.
twilight_sprinkle why would it be smaller
if theres no contact between the surface and the spring
then its actually just a point
so the angle of the surface doesnt affect the spring
if there is contact
then its a complex system
oh wow, icechat didnt auto scroll
buffering:'(
o.o
wonder how long ago the message about springs was
oh,
half an hour ago
lol
00,02Chrysalis, thats what i was thinking, if its hanging from an angled wall it is a point
Chrysalis: because the force of gravity is acting weaker
00,02Chrysalis, but the way he/she worded it, sounded like it was sitting on the surface
Now kiss me
Phase4: he :P
00,02and now i know
yeah it was sitting on a surface
yeah, that would make a difference
if the spring is suspended or resting
but either way, the formula is the same
you just need to resolve it before hand
here is a picture http://panda.unm.edu/Courses/Price/Phys160/F37-1.jpeg
00,02oic
00,02twilight_sprinkle, acceleration on the spring would be lesser, otherwise identical
00,02assuming a frictionless surface that is
it is frictionless
00,02g
00,02derp
Phase4: well i would think that if the force and acceleration is smaller, that would change the period of it
and i got to go again guys, my house has decided that it no longer wants to work
00,02twilight_sprinkle, g*sin(40) in place of g, otherwise identical
Several people are probably staring at this chat thinking 'wat'
Phase4: well yeah, id think that because a weaker force is acting on it, the period for harmonic vibrations would be differnet
c yaa Chrysalis
bye Chrysalis
Toodles Chrysalis
Bye Chrysalis
toodles?
Problem?
wow, not heard that one in a while
00,02later Chrysalis
:P
00,02twilight_sprinkle, oscilation should be dependant on the mass and k, i'm not sure how much it depends on spring tension
well I best be off
Bye trollhunter
00,02later trollhunter
Phase4: well formula wise i guess it doesnt include it, but it seems weird to me. i tired to take a portion of the mass
bye trollghost
???
trollhunter:
;)
so many trolls
00,02twilight_sprinkle, i'm just thinking it through, i dont think the force in the spring changes with its tension
dem wrinkles
00,02twilight_sprinkle, therefor any constant acceleration cancles out
Phase4: they pull ait it slightly and release though
Phase4: "If the block is pulled slightly down the incline and released, what is the period of the resulting oscillations?"
00,02yeah
Hmm... Watch the interesting murder mystery, or sleep?...
Murder mystery it is!
00,02if the systems are otherwise equal, including the pull, then it should be equal
i missed the troll
alexxm: he wasnt a troll, his name was just troll
ah ok
dat Cardassian neck trick
Phase4: what do you mean by systems?
Dat softdrink
00,02twilight_sprinkle, spring and mass
My neck is amused by this, Odo
Gul "the neck" Dukat
I liek owning people in games. ^_^
hi everyone :)
Hello Lil_B
MASF123, so do I. ^_^
/me is a happy Lil'B
hi AdamTheDuck :)
Phase4: hmm well maybe, ill think about it some more
Y SO HAPPY Lil_B
Jmo ME IS SO HAPPY!
MESA SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU
NO FRIENDSHIP?! :[
yesterday I finished my entry to Remix War V and today I got my new Headphones :3
00,02twilight_sprinkle, try the first example, hanging from the celing, with different gravity
Hey Lil_B! :)
/me hugs MadSurge :)
sup MadSurge.
Wow my stream is really far behind :/
btw is something streaming? my connection is really bad atm
Lil_B: you mean musicbox Luna?
MadSurge yes
Lil_B: Yeah there's a stream on
Phase4: thing is that to derive the formula its ma=kx, and x and a are expressed through harmonic oscillations. but i just realized that in that derivation its missing gravity force, so i need figure out where it went
MadSurge did you hear the final version?
AdamTheDuck what is it?
hey everybrony
hi there HiImSpike
WallDives: hey! Gotta get everything in Binding of isaac... So tedious :|
Hello HiImSpike
Lil_B: nope, go ahead and send it to me :D
hey Lil_B hey AdamTheDuck
Lil_B: Star Gate I think, not sure because I missed a bit of the beginning
whos streaming???
MadSurge I once had a lot of stuff in Binding of Isaac, but then I eccedently deleted the safe :/
HiImSpike: Wrek is
MadSurge, what are you on about?
thnx
WallDives: Steam game, you know

Lil_B: We're enjoying the stream too much I guess. =)

00,02i think Wrek went to sleep
MadSurge did you get the link?
Lil_B: yep

Phase4 Did ya hijack the stream?
:O
Yep he did
00,02killerpony7733, yes but i have to sleep
Ah i see
What's this?
00,02i had something planed to stream tonight but star trek
00,02so thats for tomorow
00,02i will leave you to wonder what it is
I'll get a kangaroo onto you Phase4.
Teaser ;~;
Phase4: Is it PSo2? :P
Phantasy Star online 2?
00,02nope
aw.
00,02if any of you actually guess it i will eat my shoes live on webcam
Magicka
Smite
my hopes were up, too.
Guild Wars 2
00,02nope
Oh! I know! It's QWOP
00,02nope
Aw :<
star wars the old republic?
Phase4: Dust?
(random guess)
Ooh, that'd be interesting.
I think we're more desperate to see you eat a shoe then the 'secret' itself.
00,02nope
lol
00,02twilight_sprinkle, i wish, damned thing crashes
half life 3!
00,02nope
Phase4 is secretly Gabe Newell!
Hmm phase is known to be a indie gamer so idunno maybe something around that
00,02but that is technically the closest guess so fatr
o.O
00,02far'
Does half life 3 even exist yet?
That'd be something.
The half-life 3 is a lie.
Phase4: hmmm
Phase4 KOTOR?
Phase4: a prtal mod?
*portal
Phase4: perhaps that one with the prequel?
valves last game is counterstrike:GO
00,02your all horribly horribly wrong
are they actually kidding us
they didnt even have the decency to put a number in it
You're a monster.
00,02so tempted to stay up and show it now
;~;
Is it a movie?
keep guessing, we gotta make him eat his shoes xD
How about you give a sneak peek then run off to sleep?
there next game is gonna be half life 2: episode 2: part 2
Phase4: do it!
Can anypony give me a link to lottery survey?
trollghost: Yes!
lol
00,02you know what? dont need to be at school untill 2pm
Dark92Enigma There isn't any yet i think
Cuz we all know Valve can't count to 3. XD
or team portal 1 and 2
Oh.....HOW CAN I GO TO THE LOTTERY?
left 3 team portal 2.2
*left 4
or dota fortress 1 and 2
actually its gonna be portal 2:episode 2
then team fortress 2: episode 2
00,02now you guys get to see why you were horribly horribly wrong
Is it some old school movie?
team fortress doesnt even have much of a tnagent story to continue in a next episode but valve will prove us wrong
:O
Oh god
HAHA!
wut is dis
oh boy, chinese team fortress 2
wat.
what is this i dont even
i even know that shit xD
CHINESE TEAM FORTRESS2!
Damn i nearly forgot about this
lol never knew they had tht
i'd like to know why the soldier is a firefighter
also, MadSurge, con tournement. WallDrunk. lost in grande finals in skullgirls.
you better play the firebat one
that one's pretty good
00,02Buytoast, fine, one more
chinese team fortress?
WallDives: awww, did you get second at least?
00,02thats just wierd
why yes, chinese engineer sells fish
oh wait
that's the heavy xD
The Heavy is "The Fatman"
MadSurge, well, thats what was meant by "lost in grand finals". I got second, but played the entire tournament inebriated.
team jong yil
00,02Buytoast, :P
dat goosestep
I like how this game is largely 1% original made content
oh boy, time for the best one
WallDives: that's awesome, I'm glad you got back the passion :D
All else is just taking parts of some games mashing them together
00,02from what i've seen they actually do have some original content
time to rev up those feels
conventional weapons in tf? those chinese have really no idea what the fuck they're doing
so pyros a clown in the chinese version
00,02look what file i happen to have aquired
lol clown pyro
daw
Dat cat
He saved the kitty
MURDERERRRRRRRR
final combat, they call it
oh box

/me slaps twilight_sprinkle around a bit with a large trout
00,02so
00,02this will be interesting
Jmo: :'(
00,02um
Don't lie to us ;~

That guy is not getting sued by Valve apprently.
00,02ok, wrong button
Jmo: http://images.wikia.com/central/images/3/38/Okay_face.jpg
MASF123 I think it's several guys. or well i may not be right,
The Pyro is a Clown which is kickass
just keep clicking the buttons on the right
Phase4 Could use copy paste and try seeing if it can translate to english
00,02killerpony7733, i tried, cant select most of the text
Damn
00,02that was suprisingly painless
Try finiding that folder. XD
and then it turned out that Phase installed chinese facebook
What is this?
Who's streaming...Phase4?
Yep
Yes
This is Final Combat, the original Chinese TF2 rip-off
00,02one sec
Yay, desktop ponies!
Phase4: i wants to do a gmod machinima
Dat icon
00,02inb4 it wont do windowed mode so i cant stream it
:D
00,02everything is in chinese
Hey Phasepony!

Well I feel silly now lol.
You see nothing killerpony7733!

Hello MaxTheBrony!
Oh a play by play of whats going on, so doing your own commentry now Phase?
Heya MadSurge !
Phase4...you can't get it to work?
what language is that?
00,02MASF123, i need an acount first

00,02MaxTheBrony, its chinese
and I'm back :) hia MaxTheBrony
ah
00,02simplified han
00,02thats what google tells me
heya Lil_B :)
are you studiying chinese Phase4 ?
Phase4 is it free like TF2?
00,02the site broke
00,02MASF123, its knockoff tf2
00,02MaxTheBrony, no, just trying to play
I know but is it free?
Final Combat: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of Japanese Phantasy Star Online 2?
00,02i need a chinese name
00,02MASF123, as far as i can tell
Su Yung
00,02someone go get a chinese name
00,02Jmo, in chinese
Kandarihu, I second this.
Phase4, do you need a Chinese IP Address?
Sonova.
...look up some translator to Chinese you name
00,02Kandarihu, probably not
鱒魚?
should I play pso2 in japanese or wait?
00,02Jmo, that better not be some kind of insult
OO OO call yourself Phase Woo :P
LOL
HAHA
It's Trout in chinese. <3
Now I'm stuck trying to plan out my character growth. If I want to get the stats needed to equip all the best stuff, how much of it is going to come from SP spending and how much is going to come from my mag?
トワイライトスパークルは最高のポニーです
Good morning, everypony! :)
That's japanese >.>
Jmo: indeed :P
it is, I'm trying to read it.
Jmo: and it speaks the truth
Eh
I'm not gonna lead that on.
and not use giggle translate.
and morning RaveBrony
Giggle :3
I got it Phase4. Translated Phase Woo = 胡国兴法官阶段
Good Morning everypony
Dovah, great news about DS!
00,02da crap is an id number
hoi Dovah
Jmo: its $40 and not $70?
Na, a person has gone out of his way to create a mod for DS to make it 1080p HD textures compared to the old ones.
how you doing Dovah
And it looks damn sexy.
SHOW US YOU'RE A REAL CHINESE, SHOW US YOUR ID
00,02ok....
alexxm: I don't know, I really don't know.
00,02i dont know what that number needs to be
相4
what happened Dovah
00,02holy crap
00,02its a litteral id
The square means Phase
alexxm: not entirly sure on that either..
4 means 4.
00,02The input ID card is not legitimate
00,02you NEED a chinese id
o.o
Talk about information leech.
00,02this is disturbing
NO FUN FOR CAPITALIST PIGS
Ok I'm awake now. What's going on?
Hello!
/me glomps Vivix tightly
NOMTH.
/me huggles Jmo
What is Phase4 doing?
00,02i think that worked
Phase4 was trying to play a Chinese TF2 Rip-off PillowPoni, but he can't due to the fact you need a legit Chinese ID to play it.
相四 Phase4
/me hugs Vivix
Ooh!
But maybe Phase4 has worked around it.
Hi Lil_B!
00,02looks like it worked
/me huggles Lil_B aswell
How are you doing Vivix?
That guy will probably get a letter now, that his time in TF2 ripoff has been used up
I'm good, you?
00,02'axProtect initilization failed'
I'm grand! :3
can't wactch what Phase4 is doing, Stream won't load so I'm watching to boldly flee part 2 :)
Aah
wow, those forum members use giant text
Hey Phase4....相四 That should mean Phase4...but it could be wrong
looks like Phase4 to me
Look up a tutorial for it.
MASF123: iirc those symbols mean 'root' 'ear' and '4' but kanji are strange so it's probably right
Jmo why is Phase4 trying to play a ripoff of Chinese.....? Won't that mess with his computer somehow?
PillowPoni: Phase4 is trying to make the TF2 chinese ripoff to work
It shouldn't affect his computer at all
it's the official chinese ripoff
Mess with his computer? Not at all :P
back
相四 Search up on a translato online
PillowPoni: it will infect his computer with chinese propaganda :D
00,02actually its probably doing all sortsa wierd shit
The chinese government is gonna hunt your arse down now Phase4. :>
its scanning your computer to determine if you are a true communist
00,02and then xchat bugged
00,02also wont let you run if procmon is running
I love how I say that you disconnect o.o
I remembr trying to register on a chinese forum, and I had to put in my schoolgrades and ID
00,02XD
00,02i have to reboot to try again
Well if Phase needs an official ID.....*shrug*
D:
I know the chinese are strict but that is abit of an information leech.
MASF123: oh I didn't relise those first 2 were compound which also changes the meaning
Vivix: lol
heya you ponies :)
hoi Eli
Dat Chrysalis.
Heya yo Eli :3
hello Eli
Hayo Eli
to register into a korean forum your GPA needs to be at least 4.0
00,02yeah, this would require a reboot
00,02ohai Shizuka
!
twilight_sprinkle: do they say hoi where you oome from?
Eli: neh :P
Morning everypony
:P why is Phase4 looking at chinese stuff?
hoi StinkomanFan
twilight_sprinkle: they do here :)
Lol. I was right...it does mean Phase4.
hi StinkomanFan
00,02MaxTheBrony, why not :P
Morning StinkomanFan
True :D but any reason :P?
Eli: thats somewhere in the UK im guessing?
twilight_sprinkle: close. switzerland
ALL THE TABS
相四 comes up with many pages pertaining to a Phase4. LMAO. :D
StinkomanFan: Tab :$
Eli: oohhh cool, Roger Federer is from Switzerland! :D
00,02looks like its going to require a reboot
00,02MASF123, XD
00,02ok... brb
Copy and paste it onto Google
and translate it
twilight_sprinkle: he sure is. but we have other cool celebs
Phase4 is gone, GO CRAZY.
Eli: Federer is my fav tho :P

Dat Phase4 returns.
guess i should run now <.<
Everyone! Pretend nothing happened
00,02perhaps this was a bit ambitious
OH SHIIIIT HIDE THE PORN! :O
Mods are back everyone act natural
good news and sad news today everypony!
and so i shall. cya in a few hours!
00,02XD
/me acts natural
/me whistles
00,02whats goin on in this thread
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
I blame Vivix.
hehe
He started it.
I didn't do nothing, sir!
So...wat's up. *Coughs* Phase4
What's up valoreins
mmm seasons 1-2 of futurama box sets
He's lying.
the good news is, a brony and a pegasister is just in a relationship today!
Woo
Huzzah~
Awwww
the sad news is, it's not me....
Aww
bye
aww again
Bye twilight_sprinkle
valoreins Still think a girl brony should not be called a pegasister
bye twilight_sprinkle
00,02so
相四 means Phase4...will you use it? :)
valoreins Whos the lucky couple though?
i agree with killerpony7733
What is that game Phase4 ?
00,02i have no clue whats goign on in this program
I'm I supposed to say aww?
00,02MASF123, already chose something else
Am I*
00,02MaxTheBrony, 'Final Combat'
00,02Chinese tf2
How to do dis Vivix D:
just some pair in my facebok brony group
Ah :o
how do wat Jaymoo
valoreins Ah i see, that's good
Copy and paste it Phase4 and search it up on Google and Translate it it means Phase4 honest. :(
Vivix pls.
pls
Jmo pls
PLS.
00,02whast this other button
plsss
kllrpwny73 plss
problem is that the label brony is thrown around a lot and people mean different things by it
00,02i dont know what this is
/me hugs valoreins "don't worry, you'll find someone~"
00,02looks like chinese steam
Um...search it up on Google how to start Final Combat setup
00,02i clicked a button
xD
Alchemist True, But brony while it has a hint of masculininity in it's name sake it's still quite neutral
PillowPoni: i know, i know :(
valoreins, you've always got muffins in the meantime.
I'll look it up ok Phase4....gonna try to help you out.
00,02k
the bro in brony is from /b/ro
so its not really masculinity
Originally, yes, but it doesn't matter where it originated when words change
valoreins You will, Trust me i found someone due to BS hehe
but it hasnt changed
Phase4: buildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildinbuildin
killerpony7733: i share the same view as you, but many others say that because its a mosaic from "bro"+"pony" it should be applied only to men
it has, many people use it as brother pony
people just dont know the real meaning of it
valoreins You will eventually get there.
Etymylogy changes really fast
00,02huh
its internet slang.
00,02doesnt actually seem to have installed any persistant services
killerpony7733: yea tq XD
Either way, it is waht you want it to be, and that's it
killerpony7733: not to mention that many times have I heard that a brony is someone who watches mlp AND agrees with the term love and tolerate
00,02thats nice of them
Alchemist: well fine. but find another word than "pegasister" omfg
then why is it worth arguing about?
I'm..not arguing
the only thing thats changed about it is that it was originally a /co/ny
Vivix, quit arguing damn you.
Phase4 theyre not very persistant then
;~;
Jmo ;_;
/me glomps Vivix
KERBAL
/me takes a glimps in the chat, "Hi Eli valoreins and killerpony7733 :)"
Alchemist love and Tolerate is a bit silly, I mean no where is it mentioned but if someone wants to live by such a view point they surely shouldn't be stopped. Though some are just idiots about it
hi Lil_B
ohai Lil_B
Lil_B Oi
Well, brony is what you want it to be because it no longer really affiliates with 4chan. I've never been to 4chan, and I'd just say I call myself that because I'm a fan of the show, and it's easier to just say "yes" than to explain your terms
:o
Explain your terms Vivix.
:3
00,02so
I like the show, and... the fandom is nice to be in
yea because when people sent those death threats sent to a mlp writer when they changed the derpy episode, that was a whole lot of love and tolerating going on
00,02i have no clue what happened there
GUYS GUYS MLP IS ON THE HUB RIGHT NOW
00,02every time you try to monitor it, final combat just legs it
Pink3: its reruns/
00,02reboot time again
sorry Phase4 no luck but I'm still looking
!
Phase4 is gone again, trash the chat.
trollghost, I know that i just like the show :P
love and tolerate is a choise you must make outside of MLP
Pink3: taht would be awesome! if I had the hub channel
I chose it years before mlp
dat choise
:3
Vivix Welp i can be and most likely am just what a brony is except i don't use the name, I just say i'm part of the community and a fan of the show itself no need to give it a name for what fan i am
SLENDER PONYT
i like /co/ny more than /b/rony
is it safe if i ask for ponies in bronystate?
:3
/me kicks over a trashcan

hehe
/me turns himself back
i eventually tolerates G3 because of these people
killerpony7733: yeah true, I mean I am a fan of the show first, and part of fandom second. If the fandom crumbled- I'd still enjoy the show
Jmo: hey, nothing against my mom! at least not on her birthday :P
00,02it may be time to give up
bicyclerepairman: help my bike is broken and i dont know how to fic it

00,02Vivix, 01:10
Ahh, STAY UP FOR THREE MORE HOURS
MadSurge you know kids, they stay up as long as they can, saying that it's not bedtime yet, and than tehy pass out at 8pm
but to say that
Chrysalis: i was just playing on mvm and it only took 2 minutes, then again i was on mann up mode
I'm also just a fan of mlp. but i call myself a brony because I'm lazy, and i don't care if someone calls me a gay homo fag pedo :)
hehe
Lil_B: :D kids these days
i prefer /co/ny
its 1:11 am of the 28/8/12

Dat box.
Chrysalis which mouse?
00,02Chrysalis, D:
JRP: Phase4 is a superhero and doing that would comprimise his aninomity
Phase4, afaik?
00,02MASF123, as far as i know
this is going striaght back
What mouse was it Chrysalis ?
*crickets*
http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/touch-mouse-m600
LOL Dat mouse.
What on earth made you buy that abomination?
Well, it looks good
Chrysalis: it looks like a black apple magic mouse
00,02hmmmmm
It looks cool ;__; like a smooth stone
jmo it was the only mouse with more than 3 buttons
Question what are you having touble with Phase4?
which i hate
but--clicking sounds weird
00,02Chrysalis, ok idea, bad implimentation
00,02MASF123, 'Final Combat'
I'm using a Razer mouse- not too satisfied with it
00,02they really dont want non-chinese using it
not too satisfied with the razer keyboard either
i've seen it on display in a shop... it's like operating a macbook. it works, but it takes a lot to get into it
/me furiously and wetly hugs Phase4
yeah...but translations or...?
yeah
was playing heavy to test how it worked
spun up gun, cant fire
00,02oh god i see
wow-
Chrysalis wow, I was browsing on logitecs site, because I also need a new mouse... I think their "Cube" is even more horiffic
horrific*
Cube..mouse?
00,02it needs kernel drivers
00,02yeah, got a whole bunch of them
Chrysalis: it needs to come with pony stickers
That cube, is adorable.
Vivix http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/cube
00,02must have screwed up when it tried to install them
wow...
00,02om
00,02um'
Phase4: try deleting your system32 folder
00,02i clicked a button
kernals? Hmm....
Gold star Phase4.
:>
'oldmanvoice' : Colonel drivers!?
00,02its doing something
00,02i dont like this
"With its breakthrough design, Logitech Cube redefines the computer mouse with a shape that fits in your hand and will fascinate your friends and family, colleagues and clients."
im fascinated.
are all of you fascinated?
I think it's intention is --suited, you know powerpoint presentations
00,02its not doing much and its doing it slowly
and time to go out
again
because a brick is made to fit in your hand . _ .
this is starting to piss me off
Toodles Chrysalis
you hold it like a remote
bye Chrysalis :)
are all of you fascinated?
are you?
ARE YOU?
NO
hush...Phase4 is trying to think
YES
then that entire paragraph was bullshit
It's a remote! I'm fascinated beyond belief
Holy shizz valoreins.
valoreins: :O

trollghost I just watched the YT Video top rated comment "It's the﻿ Logitech Rectangular Prism." XD
I'm speechless o.O
Wow valoreins :O

Nice valoreins
00,02'analyze' not 'analize'
That's awesome valoreins
And that my good friends is what the word 'practice' does to thou.
thx! :D btw the swords has a bit reference to celestia and chrysalis :p
valoreins looks really good, the sword reminds me on Chrysalis Legs XD, but it needs more Cowbell
nice
Our drummer had a cowbell, he was not allowed to use it
lol
I wanna used the living shizz out of the cowbell.
would of^
valoreins a celestial sword and a more ''cursed/corrupted/unclean'' sword?
the noise is so horrible
PONK PONK PONK
hello
Bollocks Vivix, it's an amazing sound.
killerpony7733: yup
hehehe
They should use them in an orchestra.
Would fit in so well.
trollghost I think that's a bit too far to link that
you know what sounds horrible? Classical music with drums
You know what else sounds horrible?
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
That.
like some remix dude takes Chopin piano piece and ads a drumbeat
I know, that wet slap is disgusting-
00,02welp
00,02its broke
How do you know the trout is wet o.o

killerpony7733 I get jittery and stuff, so i have to be doing something, so when I'm not drawing I try to skate >.<

Oh, okay. I thought this was going to be a live show
0,5:D
0,5- /)
BaconMane: i Thought it was reminiscent of skyrim
BaconMane: I got it :(
BaconMane i got it xD
BaconMane: I don't play Skyrim. sorry >(
:(
why u no play skyrim
skyrim gives me bad dreams
apparently now i'm everypony's sword lol
MadSurge: Play one of the TES games
I recommend morrowind to start with
tes?
after playing skyrim i dream of zombies ghosts and other shit like that
The Elder Scrolls
And I am and agent of all of them 7 times each at least
Barbetos|AtWork: I played Fallout 3, that was enough :D great game
But Obsidian did that
0,5I do NOT reccomend Morrowind or Oblivion
They only used the oblivion engine
MadSurge: i love Fallout 3 lol
0,5Unless you have patience
TES is a different experience
twilight_sprinkle and then arrow to the knee?
twilight_sprinkle so basicly you cant play anything slightly scary
Barbetos|AtWork: I did what now?
BaconMane: good thing bronysith isnt here :P
Metal is Magic? :)
BaconMane: you recomend TES:1 Arena
I've never played a Bethesda game before.
0,5D:
MadSurge there isn't really much to miss when you not play Skyrim, you can always play the next Elder Scrolls :P
0,5Ew, third era ><
0,5Fourth Era is where it's at!
lol Obsidian I was talking about the Fallout 3 company under bethesda
BaconMane THOSE IS FIGHTING WORDS *takes off a glove*
Oh yeah
/me headbangs
abrony: i do anyway though :P skyrim just leaves an impression on my mind because of the first person
:|
Panda: i dont dream of horrible memes <.<
twilight_sprinkle then the fire nation attacked?
Wow this giant in The Amazing World of Gumball sounds like the Dragon in FiM
BaconMane: I blame you for all the Skyrim talk right now. XD
0,5Pff
/me attacks Panda with fire-bending
so who is exited for amnesia 3 :D
0,5I love Elder Scrolls talk
I didn't say that I hated it
0,5It's one thing to be a fan of skyrim
0,5Because lots of people like skyrim
BaconMane Krosis....
Fallout is much better series than The elder scrolls
0,5It's ANOTHER to be a fan of the entire Elder Scrolls Series
Panda: oh i have that mask!
Bronysith NO!
Skrim aka Dumbed down TES.
twilight_sprinkle krosis?
so who is exited for amnesia 3 ....anypony?
/me got to lvl 81 before fighting the first dragon in skyrim cuz i could
oh noez, Bronysith is here D:
0,5I've uncovered that experience by playing Oblivion
Amnesia 3?
lolwut?
Barbetos|AtWork: skyrim is just so hand holding
13oblivion is weak
QUICK Bronysith IS HERE, HIDE YO SKYRIMS!
13play morrowind

00,10what do you meen Kandarihu? Live show?
I can't wait for it.

Shizuka: IKR
Shizuka ok, i love you!

Bronysith: We had this conversation over a game of Dark SOuls =P
Amnesia: A Machine of Pigs , I'm excited for that game
^
morrowind>other TES
Bronysith btw I am sl 35 now
Jmo hats the dungeon :O scary shit
Sumica, the music kind of reminded me of the G3 Live Show.
hate
:P
Barbetos|AtWork: skype me my friend
Barbetos|AtWork: Damn you DaS speak!!!!
00,10oh that
0,5The only reason I had a hard time understanding Oblivion is because Skyrim is "dumbed-down"
Bronysith Later.
freaking Dark Souls... it won't run on my PC, even though my specs are just fine
i leave for a min and come back to music
Barbetos|AtWork: okey dokey lokey
BaconMane dont worry, oblivion was shit >.>
BaconMane: thats why you play oblivion first
lokey dokey okey
MORROWIND>OBLVION>SKYRIM
0,5Well I didnt know that and not many people know that especially the younger gamers
And fallout beats all of them easily
SKYRIM IS BEST GAME OF ALL TIMES BLWARGHHHH
/me murders twilight_sprinkle
0,5I admit I like Skyrim better.
here is a nice questions... what about Elder Scrolls 1 and 2 ?
BaconMane: what is 'younger'?
/me resurrects behind Bronysith and stabs him "gentlemen."
no....star wars republic comando :D
Bronysith no... no... no...
did anyone say hi to pearly?
0,5younger. teenagers
0,5kids
hi Pearly
Ok that settles it, It's that FiM dragon voice actor.
BaconMane you should play morrowind~
/me stabs twilight_sprinkle "mentlegen"
0,5Nah
BaconMane: but... im a teenager and I knows TES stuff
D:
0,5I'm not ready for morrowind yet
I saw someone mentioned me thought I didnt see things...
skyrim lacks challenge and difficutly
'Shy <3
thats why i play dark souls
abrony: You are officially awesome for even knowing of Republic Commando. /)
Dat Pearly
:O
0,5Dovah: Then you're one of a minority
but Morrowind has best Khajit~
Shhhhh Welcome to Dark Souls
Panda: Hiding, are we? ;)
Republic Commando? That game is awesome.
Gildash yup /)
GilDash O________________O wat
Jmo: You too. /)
Jmo yup
0,5Anyone who literally asks for a hello doesn't get a hello from me 3:
http://cheezburger.com/6539184640
Panda: Tsk, just because I've not said anything for a little while doesn't mean I'm not watching, dear Panda. ;)
BaconMane hellow~
/me steals a hello from BaconMane
Sumica: any chance you could stream " Dark souls general" on youtube?
Hey GilDash! :) How are you today?
sorry for asking just had the thought :P
Dark Souls is a creation of god.
I frekin love it.
Jmo: i wouldnt say that
hi there Panda and GilDash
GilDash O_________O wat... you be watching me?
i keep hearing about dem dark souls
Lil_B :D hiya
/me waves
dark souls sounds..emo
Panda: Tsk, I'm watching *everyone*. ;)
Jmo: it is indeed a good game, but it just as difficult as the older retro NES games of difficulty
Jmo I wanna play it!!! why does my PC hate it >.<
/me slaps twilight_sprinkle around a bit with a large trout
Bronysith: but... i didn't have a breakup... >_>
Lil_B, MadSurge: Holla! :)
Jmo: funny that you mention it, my download just finished
GilDash dem winks on every message O_________O
0,5Sumica will you stream something for me?
/me eats Jmo's trout
I've owned Amnesia for almost a year and I haven't gotten the nerve to open it.
Jmo: instead of bland handholding bullshit that is most mainstream gaming today
If you're going to play Dark Souls on PC, you need to use a controller.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/220/
Panda: You act like it's a bad thing. ;)
And then there was Dark Fall.
Or you'll end up crying in the corner.
lol Guitar went nuts on Pinkie's part. XD
Jmo: do you play wiht the controller on pc? whats ur skype and steam id? lets play
Tovler XD haha you should watch me play it, then you will die of hilarity and then proceed to play it
other question, that's a nice piec eof music
who mad eit?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/220/
Dark Fall is a MMO that was created in Greece. It is HARDCORE
Tovler, open it and finish it nao.
GilDash O________O I would ask how but, that would be telling.
0,5I turned on le stream for once
Gold_Demona: it's PINKIE, after all!
Panda: You know better then to ask then, don't you? ;)

Panda: I'd ask "Why the long face?" but I don't want to be lynched.

GilDash: at least they USE scientific data :D
i am party weapons pie, and this, is my weapon - it costs 200,000 bits, to fire this twilight.. for 12 seconds
it's still more intresting then most science...
trollghost: :D
Eli: aye
Eli: not for me
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/3760/
:o
poor germna plane
Eli: because this show isnt credible at all
MadSurge: Well, they do, but it's just not all that scientific. Not proper science... now, where's Zen when you need him?
Oh my....who touched.....Twilight? Who touched my pony?!?! D:
GilDash: still, great program
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERD http://cheezburger.com/6510385664
MASF123| I did~ innopropriately
WOOOOO MYTHBUSTERS
twilight_sprinkle: of course it isn't. i don't belive anything either, they just need a reason to destroy things. but sometimes that's fun too
Man, we need to bug these guys to do experiments with EMPs and Faraday Cages. They would enjoy the conventional EMP generators.
Bronysith|DnDarksoul: ew get your dbz out of my ponies
you know in the middle of every "meet the" when we see the character laugh maniacly
imagine pinkie pie furiously snortlaughing
twilight_sprinkle: thats from TFS
MadSurge: I never said it wasn't. I enjoy watching it regardless. :)
MASF123|: Some people think they can outsmart me......maybe. Maybe. I have yet to meet one person who can outsmart Twilight.
Jmo, indeedly do dat pearly
GilDash: :$
Bronysith|DnDarksoul: tfs/
Bronysith|DnDarksoul: *?
O.O
AJIsAwesome: i made the original joke y not reply to me ;_;
/me pokes Pearly
twilight_sprinkle: team four star, it is the guys who do dragonball z abridged, so funny

Bronysith|DnDarksoul: mkay
HAHAHAHAHAHA, YOUR COSTUME IS RIDICULOUS
Dat adam
/me walks in in pyro suit and burns AJIsAwesome
I love when adam makes those silly accents
Eli: Y u burn me?:(
Did anyone happen to SEE a red rarity walk in the base? No? Well red on me would look atrocious darling.
/me then takes off pinkie-vision goggles and sees AJIsAwesome covered in rainbows

Eli: YAY!
Eli: I actually saw a comic like that.:D
because hes autistic
AJIsAwesome: yeah, based it on that
Do you believe in magic~
0,59 yards?
in a young girls heart
MadSurge no no no!
yus
Not that song!
/me shivers
they spend 100,00s of dollars every episode on guns and other stupid things, yet they wont take the picture to forensic specialists, who would do it free for the publicity, to ACTUALLY disprove the myth
I belive in magic
:$
0,5trollghost that's cuz breaking and destroying stuff is funner
break all the things
24 inch pythons
BaconMane: but they spend 3/4 of the show just talking and not doing anything
trollghost: they dont get it to orensics, becasue that would go against everything the show is designed for
Also it makes for better television
trollghost: it would also be boring
0,5Thats too bad now ain't it :P
Need to get some work done. Bye everypony!
Perhaps they need to use some lasers?
but they could at least do it as a bonus because you can tell they know whether a myth is true or not when the show starts
just a little clip at the end saying wether they were actually right or not
It's things like this that make me love this stream :)
0,5Shouldnt his hands be getting cut?
oh man im missing mythbusters?
XylemTube: Me too.
have they tried deleting their system32 folder?
:'( curse you virgin media give me my internet!
AJIsAwesome hi aj
trollghost: I don't think they should do that.:D
its fixed every plane ive driven
BaconMane: propellers arent sharpened blades
*piloted
WILSOOOOOOOON
AJIsAwesome i said HI :|
XylemTube Gotta love that money
abrony: Hello! I said Hi earlier.
:O oh
13yeah
thats the norm grant
0,5"ya"
abrony: It's okay.:$
now this episode of mythbusters were gonna see if we can get blood from a stone!
:D good
Actually this myth is silly cause it's very possible, Bear Grylls showed it
1 hour later... well we didnt prove it but we cant disprove it so PLAUSIBLE
00,10why not watch all of it first killerpony7733
trollghost: not only do they spend tons of money on it, they make so many compromises that it becoems poitnless
killerpony7733: Bear Grylls solution to everything " I must Drink my own pee"
00,10and this came long before bear grylis was even a meme
Sumica Hey i am i don't watch mythbusters for nothing :P
bear gyrlls isnt a meme -_-
not everything people say is a meme
0,5I.....
0,5This is...
yeah, but the bow and stick method is widely known as working

00,10they would come in to a restraunt I worked at all the time for dinner after a show
areyouawizad.jpg
00,10they loved our chicken wings
Sumica: did they pull the table cloth from under the table without moving their plates
did they sumica
DID THEY?
his beard :D
00,10no but they did alot of upclose magic and telling jokes
Sumica: up close... explain...
/me pulls off pants
00,10yeah magic tricks with a cround of people around them.
an entire cround?!?!?
13that's what grant just said announcer guy...
or you could just shoot in the air for help
0,5WAIT
13you never shoot in the air
13ever
/me is glomped by Jmo "hey there Jmo"
00,10that's a diffrent ep
0,5If theres no gunpoweder in the bullets
0,5Why are the bullets firing?
Hai dar Pearly :3
0,5How?
00,10fireing cap
are they?
i dont live in the us where guns are allowed to be purchased so they may kill people
0,5?
so sorry Shizuka i wouldnt know
00,10they still have the ingnition cap at the end of the bullet.
13yeah cars can kill people too but you can buy those
but guns are made to kill and harm
cars are made for transport
^
but you have to have an license to drive a car :D
/me hugs Jmo "hi there"
you have to have a license to buy a gun
Invi: and to own a gun
difference is gun licenses are free
00,10permit is not a license
and that]
Spectrum_Rush, in the US too?
cars are being made to less harm the enviroment and to cause less damage to things, guns are being made to do more damage
0,5*gremlin panic*
so yea
Invi: well as Sumica said permit so it abit different
i think i just destroyed half the chat
well with security as an excuse you can have weapons
13i think you just proved you're ignorant of reality
^
and that worked out great with andeers brievick
13yep we just have to ban all guns, that way only bad guys have.... guns...
13see the problem?
Shizuka: yeah and what about drunk idiots with guns
How you doing Pearly :O
but if you had gun laws then there wouldnt BE any bad guys with guns
Shizuka: what about kids who bring guns to school and shoto teachers
see the problem?
13bullshit
00,10what did that titus guy say.
there are gun laws

trollghost: bad guys BREAK the law..
13why would a guy who wants to commit a crime with a gun not want to break a gun law to do it?
cops will be the protectors with guns
00,10every one should be required to carry a gun by law
0,5HAHA
0,5Im laughing
NO GUN CONTROL FOR THEEE
13what possible logic is there behind that
they don't give a shit if there i a law or not
School Shooting is a pretty good band though.
ok look, lemme explain in the long run
Guns save lives to just saying
is*
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Weekly Roundup Video / Music List 8/20-8/26!
0,5Im gonna go commit murder and break the law
Jmo, I am fantasticly good... You?
0,5wait a minute i cant break the law cause id be breaking the law
00,10any one caught with out their gun will be shot in the leg
13BUT ELSIE, IT IS ILLEGAL TO GET A GUN
BaconMane: YOU BROKE THE LAW!!!!
I'm good thanks Pearly.
PHYSICS
0,5<trollghost> but if you had gun laws then there wouldnt BE any bad guys with guns
BaconMane: Not on my watch criminal scum!
13that is the single most ignorant thing i've heard todya
If i wanted to shoot someone, and guns were illegal, i would still shoot someone
/me gives Jmo some tea and cookies
13uh
13nope
00,10grant logic
that solves part of the problem
twilight_sprinkle, eeyup I agree
Eulshy: you wouldnt Have a gun if they were illegal for civillians
yeah... no
13you're assuming it's possible to remove guns from the world
13the tech and knowledge is out there
twilight_sprinkle: no a dumb law is that in penn. it is illegal to shoot a whale from a moving vehical
/me noms tea and cookies gracefully
13you don't get to take it back
the next part of the solution is giving your cops, and people, NON LETHAL WEAPONS
Thank you Pearly :3
13to try to do so is immensely stupid
00,10give me a pony, you can have my gun
0,5trollghost people can make their own guns and then that will be GOOD for weapon dealers
anything is lethal
pepperspray, batons, tasers, firesim guns
i can beat you to deatn with a stick
twilight_sprinkle, If guns become illegal people will just use bows and cross bows
13you know we better ban pencils
0,5Especially from foreign countries
i can chock you with feathers
13you could hurt someone with those
ima go guys buh bye
so instead of KILLING them, they would be more scared of the pain those things would induce
welcome Jmo :D
Sumica, here, have Twilight. you can use her as a gatling :D
0,5PNCLS R DNGERUSS
fuck, i can shove your face in my ass and suffocate you
so many ways to kill
Eulshy: bows and crossbows are hard to make, and they dont do as muc hdamage
I remember when that one random guy pointed a gun at me then changed his mind or something.
I can slit your throat with a piece of cardboard
/me knows how to make a railgun
justice requires punishment like hurting for insentive of people not doing it
13you know we better ban all knives too
anything is a weapon
13someone could get hurt
twilight_sprinkle, not as hard as you fink
13for that matter
13let's just have everyone live in a padded cell alone
00,10wrap the world in bubble wrap
13that way no one ever gets hurt
anypony interested in roleplaying is magic?
00,10cause sharp edges
Shizuka: my cousin cut himself with a spoon, do whe have to ban those too?
no no no, KNIFES are not made to kill people, unless they were
trollghost, people always find a way to murder each other so it would be senseless to ban everything that could kill
thats all very funny Shizuka, but from personal experience i know of people whos friends have Died from moronic civillians with guns
xD
SCIENCE
11,02We should ban books too. Once a child learns the power of reading, the terrorists win.
what about knife guns?
reading is a dangerous thing
you know whom read things?
13sb is right
its a lot more inconvenient to kill someone without a gun.
hitler
... knifes not ment to kill........
^
Stalin read books too
0,5YOU KNOW WHAT
0,5BAN LIFE
13BUT THEY CAN
Spectrum_Rush, depends on the knife ;)
00,10also books are heavy and you can bludgen people with them
0,5NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LIVE
its a lot harder to kill with a knife
13you could hurt someone with bricks too
0,5NOW NO ONE CAN BREAK THE LAW
13we better ban all bricks
13no more houses
why are we feeding trolls?
wat.
with a gun you can get drun kand start shooting people
00,10oh hey Shizuka
is going on.
;~;
ok lets see how many mass murders were caused by guns
I could Kill you with my hands, are those banned too?
00,10we need to ban gravity
00,10cause gravity kills
11,02I'M FROM THE FUTURE WHERE EVERYPONY TALKS IN CAPS NORMALLY.
all of them
13GRAVITY IS AGAINST THE LAW
We are having to much fun finking of what to ban
trollghost, and how many by swords...
I don't like this SuperBrony64
Shizuka: dont forget witj=h rope we can strangle people, better ban that to
trollghost: Bombings
13trollghost: uh most of them were caused by bacteria
the crusades didn't have guns
they had god
I can wound a whole classroom in seconds with my bare hands.
and swords
13oh you mean exclusively human on human
lots of swords
you can be killed by a pillow
0,5trollghost you seem to forget airplanes flying into buildings and the holocaust poison gas things
lets see how many were killed by other modern day implements (excluding bombs, which are already illegal) minimal
13in that case most of them were caused by bacteria
better ban bacteria
Spectrum_Rush: by your logic we should ban pianos too
0,5^^^
0,5No bacteria
e. coli is banned
0,5If you are caught with bacteria you die
13but if we ban bacteria
We'd better ban water, too. Water can kill.
13then we cease to exist
ban all the things!!
RoboGerbil: that can kill ya too
OK, well lets see. bombs, illegal, bioterrorism, all AGAINST THE LAW
human nature. invent something and someone else will find some way to kill someone with it
13because you have about a hundred times more bacterial cells on you than you do your own actual cells
11,02I think if we brought maps to all the South Africans, it would help be able to affirm our alegiance to KFC and bring peace to those in Iraq by helping to identify the US on the maps.
we must Ban the Ban hammer becaus hammers can kill
Does it really matter? You can ban as many weapons and fings as you want, as long as there are two people on the planet, someone will want someone dead, and they will find a way to make it happen
trollghost: that doesnt stop them now does it?
what else can we ban because it causes death
masturbation
no, we are talking about man made localalised murders
that killed a guy
/me questions the age of people here.
Buytoast: food
Eulshy: that isnt the point, the point is that with guns ANYONE kill start killing people
SuperBrony64 WUT.
13see trollghost shows everything that's wrong with society today, if we just say THIS IS AGAINST THE LAW the problem will immediately go away and never return
Eulshy: *can start killing
Lol SuperBrony64
oh, ban antarctica
0,5lol
you saw what happened in stargate
13we better ban time
^
antarctica nearly killed those two assholes
Shizuka, that's how politics works :D
13everyone who is ever exposed to time eventually dies
and space
0,5isnt downloading music illegal?
0,5BETTER BAN MUSIC
twilight_sprinkle, Thats not a valid point, people used to kill people with rocks, anyone can kill someone with a rock, rocks are free and everywhere i could pick up a rock and kill any unsuspecting person
13right to everything, suspended
We should ban the sun, too. Heat can kill.:P
11,02Ban Antarctica, there's a plan we can all agree with.
pull a star trek NG "you stepped on the grass when the sign said not to, you must die now"
It's a dangerous place
yay the suspended is back
they got polar bears
13to expand on Eulshy's analogy in an actual logical manner, the point is that anyone can kill someone with a rock
penguins
fucking moving iceburgs
13so if you want to kill someone with a rock, you do so knowing they could do the same to you
13as the level of force you're going to inflict rises, it deters conflict if the other side could do the same
13thus, gun freedom
hell they even got some killer whales and those assholes don't give a shit who you are if you look tasty
http://listverse.com/2011/10/22/top-10-deadliest-rampage-killers/ lets see how many were caused by guns
oh, look, all of them
13who would you rather attack with a gun, someone who thinks guns should be banned, or someone who is actually armed
water can drown ban it
Eulshy: with guns its a lot more accessible and easier to kill with. how many students do you know that stabbed their teacher? i dont know any, whereas ive heard tons of stories where a kid shot a teacher. also if you get drunk, you can kill a lot easier with a gun
13guess what trollghost every single one of those cases were against people who were not armed
sure, there were some other implements, but all in all, GUNS
twilight_sprinkle, so?
13ah cherry picking
trollghost: stop being so, so very retarted, please? do i t for fluttershy. :(
13i think we've demonstrated you're a moron, go back to the ivory tower please
ok, if guns were never invented
Eulshy: that 1. the opportunity to kill is a lot closer and 2. if you get drunk, yo ucan go on a shooting spree
trollghost, then they would be invented soon ^^
a large amount, maybe a majority of deaths would not have happened
Shizuka: i disagree with you too, i gues s that makes me moron too?
and we wouldn't be that developped
twilight_sprinkle, the only reason they use guns is because their easy to use, with no guns those same people would still do it with something else
if guns were never invented people would just bash others to death with rocks
^
0,5lol u arent even making sense anymore
trollghost, we would have killed ourselves with swords and stuff like that
13if you believe banning guns will make all guns go away, i have no words for you
Shizuka: thats not the point of banning them, the point is to not allow such easy ways of murder too weak-minded average civillains
0,5oh god
13then make the civilians not so weak
0,5i listened to this while not looking
0,5><
say, you ban guns for every country in the world, just lets say that, all gun companies will be gone and outlawwed
oh fuck yeah rub that ice yellow fury
unless all countries in the world come together… yep it's impossible.
trollghost: so far this year 365,000 people have died from violence presuably involving guns, out of the the 37 million htat have died...
Hi guys
Anotherguy: Hello!
Shizuka: yeah good luck with that, its been 2000 years of just this century, people are still stupid
then people may have guns, but they would be pretty crappy guns, not even worht maniacs buying
13yeah that's even remotely close to being realistic
13except they would still work
oh im sorry Shizuka i thought i was being hypothetical!
trollghost: people die.. deal with it.
13and now you have an entire planet that can't defend itself
13well done
Eulshy: guns also allow a lot stealthier murder
also, nothing is stopping someone from making a gun themselves
What are you guys talking about?
its not that hard
Shizuka, the citizens can still throw rocks ^^
Shizuka: against who, aliens? oh noez
twilight_sprinkle, so do knives!
the pont is, there will always be weapons
13twilight_sprinkle: against the people that make their own guns
and if you outlaw all guns, how do you defend against them
i heard of a russian who built his own mac 10 on a workbench. it was working just fine
Eulshy: not really, as murder with a gun can be from a distance
13again, if you believe banning guns will make guns go away, you're deluded
if you ban guns, people will just build their own
Shizuka: thats what the army is for
Chrysalis: exactly i can make a railgun pretty easily and they are much stronger then your conventional gun
13and completely ignoring reality
but if we ban the worse weapon, crime would reduce exponentially
Tribalism is still too rampant for mankind to give up guns.
Ban cars, too
twilight_sprinkle your point was stealth not range
railguns are awesome
13but you banned guns, what will the army fight with?
To the London Rioters, baseball bats were the weapons of choice.
Shizuka: the army should keep the guns
im not saying to everyone, sure give your god damn police and military guns
Ban my fists
13then someone has to make guns
seen that navy railgun?
trollghost: this is what i want you to do, go to a war torn country, find a group of hostiles with guns, walk up to them and say guns kill they're are banned you cant have them, dont worry you'll be fine
Shizuka: or give them a bunch of taser things
twilight_sprinkle, and there are people who know how to throw knives!
but to the general public? doesnt cut with me
that thing sets fire to the god damn AIR
wait, now he's going back on his arguments from before
Shizuka: or those bullet pellets that dont kill
this is fun
13but you banned the manufacture of guns
simply through friction of the round
Shizuka: or stun gas
13you're contradicting yourself
Humans evolved to kill each other that is what we are best at
Shizuka: a billion solutions that dont kill
13Dovah: not quite, LIFE did
Spectrum_Rush: or get the military to walk up to them and take their guns off them
0,5Think of it this way
Eulshy: reaaally? what distance is that..
13that which survives longest gets to pass its genetic material on
0,5Someone wants to commit murder with a gun
Shizuka: eh you mean what I know
trollghost: but you banned the production of guns your military has none
0,5Illegal gun or not, they're going to commit murder
BaconMane without access to a gun, theyre just gunna find another weapon
0,5Chrysalis: criminals will get guns
0,5There will be gun dealers
ok, well, i see i cant convince anyone who hasnt had experience with shitheads with guns, so ill comprimise
BaconMane: there will be, but there wont be much
13when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns
0,5Just like there are drug dealers
dont give fucking maniacs guns
also, who needs a gun
hi everypony
13it's common sense
there are SO many ways to kill a person
Hi alfopony
maniacs will still get guns
maybe after 100 years of social media, others won't seem so "other" and maybe we can come to the table and hash out our differences. Until the, Gun.
0,5And you know how Alchohol used to be illegal in the US?
trollghost: i know right
trollghost: shit head with gun? solution: a bigger gun
People shouldn't die so easily
0,5People illegally sold alchohol. Called bootlegging
yes yes illegal production of beer
c'mon man. i'm all for starting shit and getting people riled up, but at least have good points to back yourself adn don't contradict yourself when someone proves you wrong
age of prohibition
twilight_sprinkle, skilled people can throw a knife succesfully as far as they could throw anything else
but come on, it would have been pretty shitty beer
have some tact
13prohibition failed with alcohol, prohibition failed with tobacco, prohibition will eventually fail with drugs
13and prohibition fails and fails and fails and fails with guns
fun fact: during the prohibition of alcohol in chicago, the amount of sold alcohol in the town multiplied
Sweet, I came in on something good!
Eulshy: youre actually comparing a gun with throwing a knife?...
even if you were to ban the production of guns
this aint cod
there are ALOT of themn
guns are not something you cfan easily hide if you are going to use said gun
oh man
i have a gif
you know? from the gunshot?
that i had saved
trollghost: pistols..
and the shape of large guns
Just count the weapons you can find in the room you are currently in
Buytoast: by all means show
if only i could find it
twilight_sprinkle Why not, if people can kill with them at a range, it's the exact same principle
with so many guns in circulation
some guy hiding like 15 guns in his pants
Eulshy: :|
the only thing you could do is stop selling ammo
I remember when the guy landed the plane on the hudson river. Now that was skill, and some luck of course.
0,5trollghost: trunk of a car, bed of a truck, inside of a vehicle, a suitcase, backpack
0,5i can go on and on
13Buytoast: was a anti-gun thing for schools iirc, a teenager pulls like fifteen guns out including a long rifle... and you know he couldn't walk at all with all that hidden on him
THE FIRING OF A GUN I MEAN
guns can always be concealed. during a test someone snuck a grenade, a handgund and a shotgun into a building. under his clothes
the gunshot is a giveaway
but stil, they were hidden
Tovler: After the aurora thing and the temple thing, I don't think so.
Chrysalis People will beat eachother up with unloaded gun
twilight_sprinkle, Your not wrong, if you sharpened a pencil and threw it right you could stab some one
There was a group of kindergarteners playing cops and robbers, and they were doing gun signs with their fingers. They got expelles.
trollghost: silancer.
expelled*
Eulshy: and think about the speed
Eulshy: and force
twilight_sprinkle, yipdee freaken do, people will kill people weather they have guns or not
silencers wont do that much use on a KILLING SPREE that will let a lot more people be able to hear it
brb
Eulshy: what does that even mean?...
Ive already said, ill compise
Sadly it was government that killed the cigarette culture. The NRA will never let the gun culture weaken ever ever.
0,5Im curious how old trollghost is
Dont. Give. Maniacs. And. Idiots. Guns.
twilight_sprinkle, it means that the factor of a guns range isn't usually the deciding factor when someone decides to kill someone
trollghost: black market
Tovler: It's not a goverment, it
there is no compromise, there's only winning or failure
Eulshy: nvm, the weather confused me...pot the pointi s that it wont be as ACCESIBLE AND COMON
*common
they can get the guns themselvs
Dovah: im sorry did you read what i just said?
Dovah, if they are idiots, they are probably too stupid to get them there ^^
13yeah you have no idea...
Tovler: *pressed enter at the wrong time* It's a bunch of fat cats running the coutnry.
13you are assuming all humans are rational
13they aren't
Humans are a most illogical species
We're the only species to cook our food.
Shizuka: why are people so very ignorant to the world? it makes me sad :(
why, i could probably go out, purchase a gun and slaughter my neighborhood right now
and i'm not a maniac
13Dovah: eeyup
pfff
arrogance
hi
I hate arrogance a shitload.
hay tigher1001
13given a choice between arrogance and ignorance, i'll take arrogance
you say that because someone disagrees with you theyre ignorant of life?
Kawaii_icybeauti: so Big Tobacco decided they wanted less money? Maybe it was because they're still making a fortune in Asian, but still.
Shizuka: whats the real difference when your wrong.
Shizuka: yeah well from down here it takes away credibility.
so wait, was that trollghost guy actually serious or just trying to start shit?
ignorance is bliss... sure that is TOTALLY true
oh im serious
oh wow
Tovler: If it wasn't for tabacco, this coutnry wouldn't be here. I don't get why the goverment had to take that away.
you're even stupider than i had thought
ugh my spelling....:P
Shizuka: and also, arrogance is very close to ignorance
and that's beautiful
I saw pop rocks!!!!
of course ignorance is bliss Dovah, you dont seem that unhappy being as ignorant as you are
yay seaponies
sea ponies
13you're assuming you're right and ignoring the mountain of evidence contradicting you, and trying to throw out little cherry picked tidbits that can be demonstrated to not actually support your position
shoo be doo
Thankies for the stream summi!
/me huggles Sumica :3
GUYS SHUTUP ITS SEAPONIES!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
*hums*
Sumica: Thanks, Sumica.
Sumica, thanks for streaming
0,5lol now im convinced trollghost is an idiot
0,5well
0,5ive been convinced
thanks Sumica
Shizuka: hardly, i provided a solution for banning guns and nobody came up with counterpoints
Shizuka, we don't need to prove this to anyone
trollghost: me? ignorant? :D that is the funniest thing I have heard all year!
tigher1001: You'll get used ti ut.
*to it*
SHOOPEDO SHOOP
We couldn't ban guns in this country. They tried alcohol, and look how that turned out.
should find the entire episode of this
I'm pretty much convinced that trollghost is a troll. Trying to get our goat.
13twilight_sprinkle: saying something is illegal does not remove the problem, it just makes innocent people unable to legally defend themselves
twilight_sprinkle the counter argument for banning guns is that there isn't a point
its Bacon and applejack
AJIsAwesome: i was saying yeah
00,10I have the whole ep RoboGerbil
it's faggot and applejack
/me slaps Maid_RainBow with a Seafilly
tigher1001: Oh. Okay.
think its megan and applejack
Kawaii_icybeauti: Tobacco, wut? If it wasn't for guns, this country wouldn't be here.
Hey everypony! :)
Shizuka: pepperspray, tasers, firesims, te police, have you never heard of these?
RoboGerbil, yes
Shizuka: wouldnt a solution to the argument be jsut to ban TROLLghost?
ermahgerd sae pirnies, guess we should ignore whatwe've been talking about fothe past 30 mins, sorry it dont work that way
/me mons on it "thankyou
13that's the easy way
Shizuka, but you know, stricter weapon laws are needed. no prohibition, but stricter laws
Tovler: That was one of the main exports when we were still a colony.
It'll be hilarious if Megan was a villain in MLP:FIM.:D
SUMICA : can you sent me that pic?
Shizuka: they will.
twilight_sprinkle: WROOOOOONG
00,10yeah if I knew where to send it.
13they won't
Shizuka: good offense doesnt mean youre protected well
00,10oh wait, i know
twilight_sprinkle, as long as people can make guns your point is invalid
Fine don't say hi :(
Shizuka: yes because you can shoot perfectly with pepperspray in your eye and being held down
Sumica: Can you post that picutre link in the chat, please?
lol that box says towels?
Ponies47: Hello!
Gawd, how the hell did we get into a gun control debate?
/me glomps Ponies47 tightly "HAI"
you'd be dead before ya got close enough to use a stun weapon
Maid_RainBow: Its on John Joseco's DA page
I see Peewee
Kawaii_icybeauti: I don't know.
hi Ponies47 *hug* sorry just to distracted by the chat
twilight_sprinkle, so are you
http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSwc3aC6BVkRM5EqP6yLFBMfqM-4xJm6_F-V0VU1AJz65rEUaDchg&t=1
13you're more dangerous if you can't aim properly, and i severly doubt a criminal gives two damns about fire control
00,10it's a JJ picture btw
Eulshy: hardly..
I love the idea of Spike joining the CMC on there neverending quest for cutie marks
someone has a gun? use that..
But we have the right to bare arms in the constitution
who is JJ?
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/IhfonX.jpg
RoboGerbil: ovously towels are very important in space
Sumica: not surprising he's good at cute
John Joseco! <3
Kawaii_icybeauti, we absolutely do
Shizuka: what about gas grenades
13and the right to bear arms in the constitution is a check against government power
twilight_sprinkle, YOU keep repeating the same nonesense of why guns should be banned
13twilight_sprinkle: gas masks
0,5Screensnapr is actually working again?
/me Hugs Jmo and NocturnalBlade back "And hello AJIsAwesome" :3
Kawaii_icybeauti: My wut still stand.
00,10yeah BaconMane, they wiped the system and started over
twilight_sprinkle, and you keep repeating it
13suddenly gas grenades don't work so well
0,5Ah
13tasers? armor that diffuses the taze
But nowadays, the constitution seems meaningless. I never actually noticed this, but when you get in trouble in school, you don't have Miranada rights.
tigher1001: dont yforget your towel
13pepper spray? eye protection
Shizuka: headshot?
headgear
Shizuka: ok lets imagine this situation, you have just managed to pepperspray someone by whatever means, imagine how easy it is in his painful disoriented state to disarm him and put his chin to the ground
Seriously, hundreds of thousands of people went thousands of miles to california to look for a shiny metal? lol, humans
twilight_sprinkle: how would banning guns solve the problem?
im not saying how they peppersprayed them, but if they did
RoboGerbil: a towel is the most important thing to a hitchiker
how the hell is that not a solution?
13trollghost: you seriously think the guy won't start blasting his gun as fast as he can?
pepper spray doesn't always stop em
sometimes it just pisses them off more
13someone who needs to be pepper sprayed doesn't care who he hits
or in his disoriented stae he starts fireing wildly
Shizuka: bullet power can be modified to harm but not kill
and now you have to fight off an enraged fucker who wants to tear you asunder
and pepper spray doesn't alays work
13and you think criminals would willingly do so?
Shizuka: not the criminals..
13then what are you supposed to do against them?
...the hell is Spike holding?
Shizuka: HELL BE FALLING TO THE GROUND how would he hit anywhere near a person?!?!?
13you aren't allowed to use equal force
Coffee?
pepper spray fades after a little. The guy would just chase you, even if you get a 5 second head start
Shizuka: like i said, modify so it doesnt kill but stuns instead
13you are at a self-imposed disadvantage
StinkomanFan: A drink?
Shizuka: stuns, harms
13in the words of sun tzu
i want someone to steam dr.who season 2 (with the 10nth doctor)
13that's retarded strategy
theres no such thing as a totally non-lethal weapon
trollghost: why would pepperspray couse him to fall?
ever heard of bullet ricochet
tigher1001: I'm still on the 9th.
TheMaster, tasers are non-lethal.
no, they're less then lethal
Shizuka: why would be a disatvantage if its enough to take the enemoy out
oh ok Shizuka when a country nukes the US why dont you just nuke them back because that will solvee everything
tasers kill people all the time
oh man
13pepper spray makes you close your eyes and try to flush with tears, in the meantime you squeeze that trigger as many times as you can before you're taken down
this kid
is getting so angry
twilight_sprinkle, you can sya whatever you ant about banning guns, ban them, either people will still get ahold of them, or they will use a new means to kill, it's that simple
tasers are overused
it's like mc donalds
http://electronicvillage.blogspot.com/2009/05/taser-related-deaths-in-united-states.html
i'm lovin it
Kawaii_icybeauti: Than we shall watch the 9nth
13now instead of a standoff resulting in one dead criminal, you have a detained criminal and many friendly gunshot wounds
Eulshy: im not answering you until you say something new.
tigher1001: Not to sound like a jerk, but they'll request when they want to.
13well done
on guns... then somehow nukes
trollghost: that is exactly what will happen
are we still talking about weapons?
yeah
/me pokes Vivix
twilight_sprinkle, then you say something new and i can
Syn_Virtu: yes
Syn_Virtu: Yep.
because the US goverment is a body of assholes i know
Cockhead Mc Dumbass is still assessing everything to what he wants it to result in
but it wont stop the nuke hurtling towards you
AJIsAwesome: i know i was joking around
twilight_sprinkle, your spouting the smae repetitive things over and over
Shizuka: again, what difference does it make if the bullets are strong enough to wound the enemy but not kill
trollghost: at least they are doing a better job then you could ever do.
tigher1001: Ok.
instead of facing the endless possibilities of reality
13because the enemy is not showing the same restraint
00,10yeah guess what baning guns still requires an honer system to bring them in.
Eulshy: *you're
yeah I went there
the human races is a body of assholes
13YOUR people can still be killed quite effectively
13you are wasting friendly lives
how would you modify a bullet so that it doesn't kill someone if it hits them?
00,10guess what, i would not bring mine in.
rubber
We'll get our guns from mexico. Simple/
13just because you don't want to actually kill someone who intends to kill you
rubber can still kill people.
Eulshy: read your last comments and notice how theyre all identical and just say "yorue wrong"
Shizuka: then wage war on the UK, do it, i dare you
trollghost, any country that WANTS to nuke us nowadays would do a midair detonation. It would destroy our power grid and all of our electronics, preventing us from retaliating.
again, its not a 'non-lethal' weapon. its less-then lethal.
Besides. Guns =/= nukes.
/me thinks of the gun rebates that black churches do to take guns off the streets.
13why would this country do that, there's no benefit to it
twilight_sprinkle, read all your comments and notice how they keep implying your right
when you shoot, you shoot to kill
high velocity anything will kill something if it hits the right way
13there is greater economic benefit as a whole for one prosperous country to not kill another
Eulshy: im discussing my opinion.
not to disable, not to cripple. TO FRICKIN KILL
trollghost: the US has many, many nukes if it came to that well, Fallout
Kandarihu: guns =/= bricks or cars or whatever the hell your logic dictates your side of the argument to say
13that does not apply to individual rationality
Shizuka: like i saaaid, if the bullet is modified to wound and take out the enemy, its the same thing only doesnt kill
twilight_sprinkle as am I
Dovah: yes, BUT IT WOULDNT STOP THE NUKE WIPING YOU OUT
twilight_sprinkle: the point of a gun is to kill
/me scoots into the corner and sucks thumb
and theres no such thing as shooting to wound either. Theres nowhere on the bod that a bullet doesn't do extremely seriously damage.
Eulshy: but youre not providing any points, youre just saying that im saying nonsense
/me cuddles with Kawaii_icybeauti
13twilight_sprinkle: what good does that do, now you have someone who still wants to kill you, you're just going to detain them forever and ever?
oh man, this is beautiful
on one side we have retard mc gee
oh look, ive been shot and am about to die, lemme just use my 10 guns against this one guy with 1 gun
on the other rational thought
twilight_sprinkle, your calling basic knowledge nonesense
oh wait im still dying
trollghost: yeah but the atlantic ocean would and the fact I live nowhere near a prime target for a nuke
and in the middle of it all a shitstorm over bullets
0,5trollghost my foot is going to go so far up your ass
Jesus, it's an all out debate. I never actually witnessed any of these because the people I'm around all the time are too stupid to think of this.
this has been a good day to not sleep in
Shizuka: why not
Kawaii_icybeauti: IKR?
13twilight_sprinkle: where do you put them?
Eulshy: i never said the word nonsense
trollghost, Guns kill individuals, and can be selectively used to prevent innocent people from coming to harm. Nukes kill entire populations and innocent casualties are completely unavoidable.
wow, so it comes down to petty insults and threats when you have nothing else to say
if theres ever a nuclear war the first thing i'm doing is running towards the nearest blast
inb4 USA is renamed Touhou due to bullet hell.
because living through a nuclear war is just a recipe for misery
http://derpy.me/tcM5-
Shizuka: jail, where criminals go as it is. not many criminals get killed immediately
Kandarihu: yes im sure that the batman killer carefully picked out who in the audience he shot
trollghost: there is nothing else to say, your being unrational and thats the end of it.
Kawaii_icybeauti: trollghost isn't using logic while the others are using rational thought.
13because criminals never share information in prison
Shizuka: majority of them go to jail as it is
you're*
13good
trollghost, no he didn't. But the cops who gunned him down sure did.
twilight_sprinkle, because it is nonsense, what makes you think that if we ban guns people will stop using them, what makes you think that?
13what about the ones that don't
AJIsAwesome: Ah.
13you can't get them all
gun ownership is intended for small or frail people who otherwise couldn't defend themselves.
13the point is, civilian ownership of firearms is first and foremost a deterrent against force
a gun in the hands of a 90 year old lady levels the playing field against a homeinvader or burgler
TO BAN GUNS is fucking stupid, that just makes it harder for people to protect themselves
Shizuka: im saying that most criminals today go to jail as it is, not killing them wont make much of a dfference space-wise in jail
13both from criminals and, principally, your own government
And some people feel sfaer when they have a gun in their house. It's just a matter of preference.
ok, we in the uk have banned guns
TheMaster: if a frail person were to fire a gun, their arm would break
TheMaster, do you understand why the U.S. Constitution allows citizens to keep and bear arms?
Shizuka: the government can find ways to take ove ranyway, withotu guns
let me tell you how many people get killed a day from public gun violence
1
trollghost: good for you?
13twilight_sprinkle: not if the populace is armed
you in the uk also can't put up shit to protect yourself because it might hurt the criminals
we dont really care
you guys are avoiding the actual argument, which is that if you ban guns people will kill people less, which is a rediculous claim
I always wear kelvar when I invade homes.
and guns arn't that dangerous to people. i'm not talking about a little old lady firing a .50 cal machine gun from the hip.
chrysalis tatoo?
Shizuka: yeah, if the populace is armed too. people dont have tanks, bombers, and they didnt have thse during the revolution
13so we shouldn't even give them the most basic level of defense?
omfg
Buytoast: lol
thats awesome
TheMaster, a lone individual with a gun couldn't take on the whole military. That's why a lot of people have to come together to form a militia.
if guns dont kill people, but people kill people with guns, dont give people guns
RoboGerbil I WANT ONE
Buytoast: lawl
Shizuka: why if it doesnt change anything since they can be bombed
take your crumpets and serve them up your ass.
13that is..
13wow..
thats why we have the national-guard. the 2nd amendment talks about a well-regulated millitia
sure there will be other forms of killing, but it wont be as easy as with a gun
Shizuka: yes? anything besides sarcasm youd like to say?
13i can't even begin to comprehend what would lead you do that level of delusion..
trollghost: knife, sword, axe, chainsaw, rock, rabies, i can go on and on
Shizuka: so polite, so...above me
And keep in mind that that's going to be a last resort. Civil disobediance is the penultimate option.
13people could be bombed therefore let's not even give them the ability to deter criminals
but are any of those methods as easy as with a gun
Shizuka: forgive me, Your Highness
but as we're not continiously revolting against our elected officals, which the constitution also says is wrong, it also helps that the 2nd amendment addresses personal self defense.
Wow
trollghost: yes.
RoboGerbil: That's amazing.:O
Shizuka: i alread ysaid what to do with criminals
Hello
Kandarihu: But civil disobedience is peaceful.
Shizuka: complacency
00,10lets compare populations and lad mass size there trollghost
hi Malk
can someone go into a liberal teens camp and stab 81 people? or hit 81 people to death with a rock
i doubt it
00,10land*
Malk: Hello!
So trollghost, maybe if you had some of these guns, hitler wouldn't of made you have to come crawling to the PATRIOTS to save your sorry crumpet butts from doom, eh?
MURIKA
Kawaii_icybeauti, that's why it's prefered over military force.
if the framers and founders of the constitution intended you to plot to overthrow their government they wouldn't have given the president the power to suspend habeus corpus in times of revolt if he wishes.
trollghost, if they know what there doing yes
Militias should have access to Surface to Air missiles.
Shizuka: anyway im too inferior to keep this up, andi have classes, goodbye
00,10Buytoast, stop that line of logic right now
13TheMaster: and yet, second amendment
Kandarihu: I could see how that could actually work.
let us join together and sing the national anthem
is for the states to form their millitias and for citizens to also protect themselves from criminals
has knive in jacket sleeve walk past someone and quickly slit their throat and continue walking.
the national guard is basically what the framers intended.
ok dovah go do that to 81 people with noone noticing and running away
hey look i just killed someone without a gun and it was easy as fuck to do
My Little Pony. My Little Pony. aaaAAaaaAAhh
TheMaster, yeah
Someone was freakin shot under my window when I was a baby. Guess that's why I'm scared of loud noises to this day.
:D CMC Astronauts :D
00,10war torn thirld world country has noting to do with this trollghost
TheMaster the united states was ment to be more like the eu or greek city states than a huge cenrtalized national government
Shizuka, I'm fairly certain that if these types of arguments come up, we should just not go with them, ban the people who started them for a bit and not have these arguments on this chat
its not guns that are scary. its criminals that are scary.
13yeah it's getting old
you're blaming the wrong thing
would anyone be interested in roleplaying is magic?
Kawaii_icybeauti: I would be scared too O__o
man, trollghost is grasping for more straws than the scarecrow when he was fucked up by them flying monkeys
trollghost: ok just make sure you pay my bail. and all the law suites because eventually I will be found
13the base premise of the argument in favor of banning guns has been thoroughly destroyed
Sumica: but according to you cars, rocks, pianos and other heavy impliments do
Any level of government can be corrupted. That's why there has to be checks and balances at every level. ONE of those checks are bound to kick in
I disagree. if you read the federalist papers the founders make a strong case for a centralized government. maybe that argument could be made for the original confederacy made.
Dovah: i wont
MadSurge: There was a storm this morning, and I'm practically as scared as my dog of thunder. It's wuiet depressing actually.
but the constitution is fairly centeralized
Shizuka, time to end this conversation
or debate
00,10no that was just the stupidity of lets outlaw things that kill argument you opend with
brb guys gonna go get a drink, give twilight_sprinkle your bullshit for a minute
But thanks to Woodrow Wilson, he pretty much handed to coutnry to fat cats.
trollghost: then i cant do what you asked, well i could but there would be no benefit to me
trollghost: twilight_sprinkle left, had class
well, now that the rabble rouser is gone
Guys can we just have a policy that if people start these arguments to just ban them for a bit
its hard to say where it really starts Kawaii. All presidents build executive power off of previous administrations
No way, he left?
oh say can you see
roleplaying is magic? whats that anyway
AJIsAwesome: Do you play videogames? And if yes, what's your fav genre?
TheMaster, the constitution gives the federal government very limited powers and requires that the states take care of everything else.
i went for a round of tf2 and i come back to... this?
what is roleplaying is magic?
MadSurge: I do. I don't have a favorite IMO.
Eli: thats bronystate for ya lol
Eli: replace that with Braid and that's me :D
Eli, the topic is trying to be changed
well to be honest if you look at what came before the constitution it was a huge expansion of federal power.
Ya what is roleplaying is magic?
perma ban trollghost? all in favor say 'I'
TheMaster, drop it
Eulshy: there is a policy, it wasnt broken yet
Comes to think of it, ew York is probably the most controlled state out of all of them. You can't buy fireworks here, menus need to have the calories on them...It sucks :P
Everyone peole drop the argument
13Dovah: i would but it's better to take the moral high road and let people discredit themselves
why can't we have a discussion?
13in other news issac made landfall i believe
nobody is mad or flaming
Eli, I think the gun debate is from a part of an episode of Mythbusters that Sumica was streaming, that was talking about a theory about starting fires with guns by removing the bullet.
Nopony is down there, right?
Shizuka: you and your mod logic
Kandarihu: Yep.
13at least i know the RNC is gavelling in and out today to resume tomorrow
I completely disagree with just about everything that trollghost says. But I'm against permabanning him.
permaban him
Can we all just calm down? We all have different opinions.
mabye the solution is to have a diffrent channel if you wnat to talk about it
how about we talk about my favorite theme: music
Isaac Hayes is best Scientologist.
Even if some aren't the most logical.
Whatis friend ship is roleplaying?
in other news, no stream?
If we permaban someone for having bad opinions, the next person to be permabanned might be me.
13Kandarihu: ditto, would be undermining our own argument... after all stupidity doesn't go away just because you ban it :3
13just look at reality tv
AJIsAwesome: ikr, gun debate is just flame wars bait
Kandarihu: fine 3 hours ban?
Three. Hours. Dungeon.
Shizuka: Ikr :D
Whatever. Back when I honorbanned myself, I started with much worse.
and yet it didnt become a flame war it was aheated debate at most
Kandarihu: an opinion can't really be "bad"
Shizuka: Point.
Earl of Lemongrab returns tonight
Eli, true
Dovah: ONE MILLION YEARS DUNGEON!
Kandarihu: it's just your opinion. if you say your own opinion is bad you're doing it wrong
AJIsAwesome: is that from Adventure Time? I don't watch that o__o
coconut pie ish good
I want this: http://tonyrogers.com/images/weapons/metalstorm/metal_storm.jpg
MadSurge: Yep. But it's okay. You don't have to watch it if you don't want to.
You cant someones opinion is bad and it be a fact its just your opinion
13need longer range radar on the east coast
im back
oh beautiful
how you doing trollghost

13can't tell if isaac fell apart or if it's just satellite storms hitting florida atm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BbRffBCeYw
and you know what, you guys have made me realise how good it is that guns are legal
ya dont say
and how i can shoot someone because its so easy
What Is Friendship is Roleplaying, i heard someone say it
AJIsAwesome: eh, not really...
Shizuka: I was watching CNN earlier, and I saw that it was aiming more toward Louisiana. Florida only got this one piece of rain and stuff.
trollghost: ok, just drop it dude
and how even though they are illegal i can buy them at my local gun delaer
oh boy, here comes the big boy IM GONNA SHOOT YA ALL threat
Eulshy: I think it's a fanfic where the mane 6 play Dungeons and Dragons :D
so tommorow, im gonna buy a gun, and im gonna go shoot some people
13i can almost make out what might be the northern edge of the spiral in the gulf
thx guys
13but the radars barely make it out there
trollghost I can buy them from walmart
trollghost: We stopped talking about this a long time ago. Stop.:|
00,10right that's the last nail

trollghost see ya
I think I've forgotten how to take a gun apart.
man, he just gave right up at the end there

00,10trolling kills we need to outlaw that too
aw yeah. ttgl time
Shizuka: that means it died down a bit, right?
Sumica: oh u
Shizuka: yea thats good, i think it was comin towards my state so i'm glad it dropped
13looks like landfall will be louisiana
:o
Isaac is gonna raise oil prices and kill people I don't care about.
weather kills, ban it
Eulshy, I speak my mind because oftentimes, I feel the need to voice them. That's debate. Trolling is saying things just to get a reaction. And it's very broadly categorized nowadays.
Shizuka: oh, now its louisiana? last time i saw it it was goin more north
13i get the feeling it's pushing warm air up here though cause minnesota is like upper 80s all week
Sumica can we ban laws too ? they kill people
A lot of good arguments are spoiled by some fool who knows what he is talking about.
But being as serious as I am when I debate can seldom be confused with trolling.
13the purple probability range is right around louisiana, but of mississipi
i have no idea whats going on
13bit of rather
Shizuka purple range?
Alchemist: it not important anymore
Hope those people in louisiana are prepared, especially new orleans

is that a game?
Kandarihu: The fact that you express your opinions with rational thought is fine by me. I'm glad you openly express yourself, even if people don't like your opinions
13doesn't look like any rain will make it up here this week, probably all the warm air getting pushed up by isaac
Brony: yes it is
Brony: Hello!
ah so anti spiral campaign is happening
i like rain
Yay bring on autumn
Brony: Are you new here?
For instance, I honestly wish Issac WOULD hit Florida, and the RNC would just hold the convention through it anyway. That way, the OWS Black Block wouldn't be able to do JACK to them.
and autumn
00,10the down side to time bans, having to figure out how many min in a day =p
13that too
but OWS doesn't exist.
AJIsAwesome: uhm yea
Dat evil moon
13iirc they're gavelling in and out to make it official, just postponing til tomorrow, so it's kind of there for solidarity
oh so you're fighting the anti-spirals now?
Sumica: 24 ÷ 60?
well then welcome Brony
does this mean that the final boss of super robot wars is the anti-spiral?
00,1024x60

Whoa, Yoko :3

this is just one of the gurren lagann missions

I don't remember all the details, but in this dream episode, it was centered around this race or something. Derpy was assigned this one job relating to the race. I can't remember what the heck it was...
Balloons are fun :3
gaogaigar was in a previous one
ok Caramel
Well Marx, get to animatin' :3
00,10he said that is not a valed keypress
00,10so I said oh sorry i though that was the go fuckyour self button.
13clearly you have a girly voice :3
how about streaming TTGL. ever do that Sumi?
00,10I have thought about it but I belive Val was showing that
That reminds me of that game Wrek was playing yesterday.
I was, yeah
I'll be back later, everypony. Going to a memorial service
00,10val being Caramel
I'm out
oh val is playing this game again? :3c
Anypony up for MvM game?
00,10where did he just pull that sword from?
his ass, Sumica :p
So they have their race. I guess it was a pegasus race. They do the race, but near the end, something happened that caused all the racers to crash into the ground. Derpy noticed it, and she tries to fix things I think? Idk, but what she did was I think somehow pick everybody up, fly to the finish line, sort everybody out before the finish line in a totally random order, and then Derpy proceeds to take 1st place.
he pulled it from...his heart
hot bloodedness is always the answer
now i remember why i pirate films
cause buying them is a PITA
harro
PITA?
Pain in the ass
00,10voltron?
is that some voltron?
It was kind of a wierd dream, but yeah. I don't remember if there was a lesson at the end.
...
why does everyone call GodMars Voltron?
make love to me :D
00,10hehehe
seriously, pirates get such a better experience with films
Whats with the voltron force?
Derpy counted really fast though. Even I had trouble keeping up with her.
gonzal3 are you man or woman
00,10cause it looks like voltron
I fuck fish anyone wanna join and where the fuck are the ponys D:
I wanna mlp fim ):
00,10and then it's setsuna f gundun,
Stupid Sexy Flanders! D:
I want fim too
13oo you can send entities through nether portals in the new snapshot
there already is one, gonzal3
MASF123 wearing nothing at all
what, Shizuka?
thanks rain :D
13rain rain~<3
6_9 love derpy
So yeah, thought I'd share my crazy dream. Maybe something like that will happen one day? Or someone maybe just got inspired and they'll make a fanfiction out of it?
are you playing teh minecraft, Shizuka? :3c
13you can push cows and pigs and stuff through nether portals and they'll come out the other side
loe derpy too
13just reading the details of the new snapshots
love
Yay Mole for lunch :p
Chrysalis...nothing at all...nothing sat all...nothing at all.... D:
that sounds awesome, Shizuka :3
:P
all that for less then 7000
00,10do portals have to be vertical?
there's also invisibility potions in this new update.. that you can throw at creepers
Sumica vanially ones yes
I can't hear this guy's voice and not think Franky
vanilla ones*
00,10bah
00,10I want portal traps
^
Mystcraft does some really nice things with portals
including portals of any size/shape
Shizuka you can push items so if you buil an automatic wheat farm you can pick up everything when you go to the nether
and ones which makes people going through drop all their items
13no no no better, have like two nether portals and a canal between them in the nether
13wheat goes in one, pops out half a km away in your house~
Shizuka except no water in the nether
00,10that was one thought I was having too Shizuka
13if you hax the water tile into your inventory you can~
13i think it's item 9
13or 10
Now that's an awesome idea Shizuka.
Shizuka could be but the point is if you are not in the nether the items do not despawn
wonder if carts work
cause then you can just use a chest cart
13yeah hopefully that makes carts work
13that will be awesome
Chrysalis: cart's doesn't work through portals, not yet at least
00,10then again if you have build craft you dont need portals
00,10just lots of pipe.
00,10and the abilty to not explode the pumps
13i might have to put tekkit together
13when minecraft gets boring for me... it's sudden and massive...
Shizuka if you want i can just give you my pack
lots and lots and lots of pipes
pretty much tekkit, with a few extras
and someof the boring mods taken out
and multiplayer
Its always Caramel and his japanese mechs
00,10yeah i have trouble keeping my systems cool when using pumps
still 1.2.5 though till later next month when the bigger mods hit
Hey bronystate. I'm kind of busy fighting of a shadow that chased me through an entire castle, but I can talk. :3

:\ I think I like Gravity Falls more than MLP
So I've been seeing the talk about this Minecraft update their apparantly working on.

I
00,10just how many attacks dose this guy get?
Tovler: thats okay, i actually like the smurfs better then mlp

Sumica: You asked for it.... OVER 900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000!...
9001 to be exact.
:3
yeah, but smurfs has nostalgia value
Well, I think you killed it.
and you haven't even seen his strongest attack yet :P
NEIN!
13THIS ISN'T EVEN HIS FINAL FORM
Tovler: what do you mean?
Shizu, hold this. *Hands orange*
I don't even compare MLP to 90s shows my 12 year old self loved.
did kitan even do this in gurren lagann
And that attack failed.
I love FiM moire than Smurfs
more
we all got opinions of which is better, but doesnt mean we hate mlp

/me laments that he's no longer good at roleplaying
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

SlurryMoon, even if you're not too talkative we still like you :)
It's all about giant robots this generation...back in my day we didn't need giant robots, we only needed our tiny remote controlled ones.

Lil_B: oh, cool. same here :P
Hey uh, SlurryMoon, do you happen to know how Luna is doing?
Lil_B: I played some Braid :)
DYNAMITE EXPLOSION!
is that good or bad Obsidian ?
03 Yes, I do. She recently broke up with me. So I'm in a bit of a slump. She should be back online sometime in the future. I don't think she's going to leave you all behind.
Dynamite! Dynamite! Dynamite EXPLOSION once again!
EXPLOUSION!
00,10damn lulu
I think he meant the other Luna
code geass robot
SlurryMoon: Sadness, but dont worry, there are other fish in the- other ponys in Equestria.
03 LunaTheBeloved
Kandarihu: they exploded twice (overused joke, i know)
Eli: Good, my workplace sucks and I don't get paid enough to care if I muss a few hours.
Eli, lol
can you explode twice?
Only bad if my house loses power at any second
Howdy y'all!
Alright. Now it's time to work on balancing.
Its kinda slow here at the moment.
/me hugs SlurryMoon
Thats cause its a monday. :)
^
SB, can I ask you a favor?
A drill like that would suck to us in space. Everything would just bounce off of it
manic monday
to use*
Eli: Yeah, but I'm too far inland for it to cause any real damage where I live.
SB, hold this. *Hands a bomb*
Whose streaming atm?
JacknAppleLover: Carame-l is.
look at the pony in the corner
that should answer it for you
Caramel probably
Obsidian: good. i'm still worried about the people who aren't...
Caramel: but i dont know ur pony :\
....
that's Caramel -_-
everyone knows Caramel
lol
Not sure if trolling..
he's canon
I know Caramel
Same here, I've got a few friends who are not as lucky as me, but I'm hopeing for the best.
man... OCRemix had to cancel the FF6 Remix Album Kickstarter because of Square Enix, now they have the allowence, but Kickstarter can't restore the project so they have to start over again >.<
thumbs up for TTGL
Eh
oh wait i cant type in jappy can I or i'll be banned, herp derp.

JacknAppleLover: i don't know how to do a thumbs up here...
(Y)
<36_9
That bust
Boom baby!
so is there a trick to finding slime?
sounds like someone could use a prescription of "Calm the fuck down"
What the hay are you talkin' bout?
Caramel: its a cup,
/me holds on to the bomb o.O
I'll say ;)
PillowPoni: hey, why cant i pm you?
11,02Why am I holding on to a bomb D:
perscription, because one cup would not be enough
It's a "Calm the fuck down" bra, not cup.
SuperBrony64: i said "here hold this."
/me diffuses the bomb that SuperBrony64 is holding
SuperBrony64: its better to no ask questions at this point.
SuperBrony64 can you check the time on the clock your holding I think it's set wrong
Its like a thundershirt for humans.
:D Loving these attacks.
Hi everypony!
hi tSparx
Hello tSparx
hai tSparx
11,02My clock is set at 12:00 and keeps flashing.
hi tSparx
Howdy tSparx.
Howdy tSparx
Why does it look like streamer's playing TTGL tactics?
SuperBrony64: Don't do what Johny did, and assume time has frozen. it won't end well.
SuperBrony64: I just hope you don't fall into the same trap as Johnny Bravo and believe time has stopped.
SuperBrony64, that beeping...that means it working? Or is it an alarm? Hit the snooze button will ya?
voice for BlazeAngel
?
11,02The beeping and vibrating means the thing is about to hit 500 degrees.
Wait, is this a TTGL game? I didn't know that existed.
...500 degrees?
SuperBrony64: beep the fuck boop - SivHD
Sounds strange yet, sexy
Seems legit
tSparx: i think this is the ds version, but ive never seen it so might be wrong
MASF123: it turns almost one and a half times
SuperBrony64: I thought that only happens to microchips implanted in the brain 6_9
hi tSparx
JacknAppleLover: I just didn't know they'd ever made Gurren Lagann game. I was very confused.
Heya everypony!
........
Hi Maidwhite

:P
hi
SuperBrony64!!!!! :O
Howdy MaidWhite!
Hello MaidWhite
hi MaidWhite
11,02MASF123!! O.o
tSparx: unfortunately none them were ever that good, and TTGL isnt popular outside of Japan so never got outside Japan releases
Hello SuperBrony64! MOOO
Huh. Where is Nittany?
Did you...say......BOMB?!?!?!?!? :O
WAAAAAZZZZZUP EVERY PONY

tSparx im off to play some mount and blade and I shall ride twilight sparkle
....like the Mask?
Malk Better ask politely first ;P
oh wow, that chrysalis is now at £167
11,02Darn, that flying circus tent just got owned.
TTGL such a good anime, i love it
yeah, nearly 3 plushies, or one custom blindbag?
tSparx she said it was cool
i think im gonna go buy 3 plushies
Malk Kk then ;)
just okay too
Have it entirely downloaded and still watch the ending episode every now and again
SuperBrony64: it's got so much health!
SuperBrony64: Please, Anti-Spiral Flying Circus Tent
SuperBrony64 is NOW offically a ticking time bomb
tSparx she wanted to know what its like to be a pony in my army.:$
I've been meaning to watch Gurren-hen and Lagann-hen
I always wanted to say that. :)
tSparx: watch it man
So whats on stream, I've seen this game before, but its name escapes me.
tSparx: but, dont gtive up on the first 3 or 4 episodes, which i admit are TERRIBAD
JacknAppleLover: Aren't they really just rehashes of the series?
SRW Z2: SaiSeiHen
i don't watch animes... i prefer reading
JacknAppleLover: No I'm talking about the movies. I've watched the whole series twice through.
MaidWhite: Super Robot Wars, but I dunno which game
MadSurge: Danke
tSparx: ah didnt fully read comment, i see now
tSparx: if u mean the OVA's they are kinda like musik videos
Eli: I usually prefer manga to anime, but I don't think the TTGL manga's really that good
tSparx: the movie is just a recap of each season yes
I like both western and japanese cartoons... if they're good.
^^
dat
http://xkcd.com/1099/ <- MUGEN WIIIIIIIIIIINGS!
So that weird thing is from Gurren Langan?
CODE GEASS BITCHES
MadSurge: Aye
is Hero still in this game? and wing zero
yes
Welp, one hit and it's dead
Finish him off!
MISSED :D
Oh wow that was a wall o' text haha my bad
I was hoping you'd cherry tap him, but overkill is nice too.
GURREN LANGAN TIME
GIGA DRILL
that pleased me
DED
I love dubs. I can look away for a second and still follow the story.
tSparx: sometimes it's a good thing to have a crazy mind like mine. Mangas are completly alive in my head. that's more than I need, screw animes :P
NEW OBJECTIVE
/me pokes Pearly
So where did some of these new chars come from? I definitely don't recognize everyone and their ganmen, but I just watched the re-watched the series like two weeks ago.
just re-watched*
Is that a character from an anime or a Super Robot Wars OC? :D
OC
Thanks Caramel
lol
only 10 pts
10 Crit Damage
lol all that effort...10 damage
ENEMY PHASE
Wall spirit command
makes the next attack do 10 damage
useful for mechs like Ganleon that don't dodge as often
So who's streaming, and do they know Japanese?
Caramel: Ah, that's awesome :D
like this time
it'll do actual damage
since my wall activated on his first hit
tSparx: caramel is streaming and i dont know if they do
again 10 Crit Damage i bet
Oh noes!
Well someone got nailed.
:D she's so happy
He was NAILED. Get it? GET IT!?
Wow Barbetos|AtWork >_>
Barbetos|AtWork: YES I DO
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Tail: A Story of Time and Forgiveness
I tell angry jokes
YOKO! :D
yolo?
They didn't get Yoko's VA from the anime?
YORO, you only ride once.
JacknAppleLover: You only read once?
Everlasting_Joy: now why would i only read once? that would be the death of Twilight
JacknAppleLover: And Rainbowdash
JacknAppleLover: :).
Rainbow Dash*
tSparx: true but she would break the rules anyway
POLO- Ponies Only Live Once
JacknAppleLover: True :)
POLO - a game i play with ponies
HECARIM - the undead pony of death and tower dives
YORO sounds like a bad writer name...
Go Nagai time! :D
Opops
Hope those planets he it weren't important.
HOLY SHIT
MLG - Men Lacking Girlfriends
Dear Princess celestria, Why are you not a Queenie?
Tovler: :D
Barbetos|AtWork: I was thinking the same thing.
Why would you cut through the planets, that would decrease the strength of your attack
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT AWESOME
MaidWhite: It's TTGL, don't question it. If it's awesome, it'll happen.
lol
and if yoro is "you only ride once", ohoho believe me, when you're riding skills are as bad as mine YOU ONLY RIDE ONCE
...True
MaidWhite: you forget he has WILLPOWER!!
that wasn't TTGL...
that was Getter Robo...
MaidWhite: Anime Logic, the more awesome it looks the more damage it does
MadSurge: and the louder you scream
JacknAppleLover: that too :D
Caramel: I'm talking about the anime as a whole, you don't even have TTGL out, do you, it's just GL.
Wah, I was using normal logic, silly me,
what? I have all of the TTGL characters out...
SING FOR YOUR FRIENDS! :D
I'm back, darlings
this is the TTGL second to last mission...
Howdy Vivix.
OH FINALLY Vivix
Hiya
ONLY TOOK YOU SEVERAL HOURS.
MadSurge: BECAUSE SINGING GIVES ME STRENNNGGGTHHHHH!!!
Yees, JMO
'BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES'
Caramel: Oy. "It's TTGL [The show] don't question it." "You don't even have TTGL [the ganmen] out, do you?"
How you know I was playing ;__;?
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Something has bothered me everytime I have seen you play this Caramel. Why are they all level 99?
;~;
KING KITAN!
Barbetos: because you didn't watch me when I first played through it
/me throws a sadine at Jmo for no reason
this is like, my 10th newgame+
Hello Rain! :)
soon I'll have hardmode unlocked
Ah. Okay. I was curious if that was why.
Almost dead!
And then one more with a lot of HP.
Caramel: I wish TTGL didn't refer to multiple things so that it were less confusing, haha.
Caramel: 日本語 bitch do you speak it?
MAZINGER TIME
does anybody think next season they just have a simple love sotry between big mac and cheerlies relationship?
Somebody broke out Bullet Punch.
Superretroworld We don't know.
Scissor used bullet punch? op
Well
superretroworld: And if we did, we wouldn't be at liberty to say.
DED
superretroworld: BigMac and RD :P
I kinda hope not, but if they do
OH COME OOOOOOON
Rarity and Spike is all you GET
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
;__; stopeet
A FEW MINUTES YOU SAID.
Unexpected visitoors
ITS TOOL TIME!
we went sightseeing in La Noir
Vivix: you smell like fish.
Oh right, fair enough.
/me nomths Vivix
baka52 THE BAND!?
Eli: big mac and fluttershy would be epic too
/me smells like fish
Feeeeesh
I hope canon story stays the hell away from shipping.
I personally hope there's just as little romance in ssn 3 as in prior.
superretroworld: Is Fluttershy drunk again?
Barbetos: that's the first logical/non crazy thing a brony has said to me all day
Barbetos|AtWork agreed, mostly because shipping freedom, but also because shipping just tends to--complicate and kill series
superretroworld: that with RD was a joke :) I have nothing against the idea of her being hetero, but i don't see any stallion in the story that would match her
Barbetos|AtWork: or at least ambiguous shipping like it did until now
what an annoying voice
JacknAppleLover: shes that shy isnt she?
magmablock: who, the guy or the girl? :D
MadSurge: The girl
Eli: thats true
Eureka
magmablock: heard worse
is the final version of Nirvash on this?
WUT, QUESTION MARK HEALTH???
yes
ooo awesome
and I will not deploy it
baka52 Are you talking about Tool the band?
because that shit is a blight upon what was an amazing show
u dont like the final version?
only because it mostly is in the movie
Caramel : is Hero still in this game with Wing Zero?
whereas it has a very BRIEF moment in the show
ok, i didnt watch movie
MadSurge: it has confusing amounts of health.
Maid_Rainbow: already answered that. Yes he is
i dont usually like the movies of series already made
Barbetos|AtWork: oh, I see :D
Diddent see that Caramel sorry
Caramel: u speak japanese then?
it's possible
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/825
For the Empire !!!
Vivix, I knew what you were doing cause I'm psychic.
During Euro movie-night I was thinking about how much time we spend on chat repeating information for people -- this is especially true on movie night xD
;~;
Caramel: why you didn't reply earlier then? :\
Caramel: meanine :c
Jmo the medium, crystal ball and all
unless you didn't realize, I'm a bit busy
JacknAppleLover: He's busy saving the world.
^
I'm actually saving many dimensions as well
tSparx: doesnt the almighty caramelhave time for his bitches?
but that's not till later
Caramel : why are these Japanes games os Awesome?
because they are
japanese *fixed
Ha! He missed, he needs glasses.
JacknAppleLover: Not when he's fighting anti-spirals!
DODGED
tSparx: those bastards! D: whatever will i do
MadSurge: if you can dodge a planet sized laserbeam, u can dodge a wrench.
Hey look, it's a gundam!
im gonna watch that again, i love that movie
A head-on body slam only did 10 damage.
Marx: whenever you see one of my mechs take 10 damage, it's because I used the Wall spirit command
which makes the next enemy attack do 10 damage
Ah.
Another gundam!
I now really want Gundam and TTGL to be the same canon haha
ok lovelies, im going to watch Dodgeball, i just really want to watch that movie
Bye JacknAppleLover :)
Take care JacknAppleLover.
tSparx: byeee
cya

Huh, music sounded like SNES Sector Y for a minute.
superretroworld: nah, the robots are too distinguishable and there's no annoying stereotype!
Panda|DrawingPoni: woah, youre a ninja-glomper? O.o
twilight_sprinkle yush!
Or I think I mean Sector X. One of those two.
Panda|DrawingPoni: awshum!
MadSurge: That, that is so true.
MadSurge: yeah good point
Almost dead!
MadSurge: Hm, surely there's gotta be *some* annoying stereotype in TTGL.
i just got back from my math lecture, it had so much earrape. the teachers mic kept feedbacking and it was so painful, but fun
MadSurge: Well, consider him dead now. GIGA DRILL BREAKER!
/me pokes Jmo

I like the things you do. Hey Pearly! If I could I would glomp you.
UBER DED
I think you killed it...
Ahaha, MadSurge: until Ssn 2, Viral was a pretty stereotypical, annoying rival for Kamina then Simon.
OH COME OOOON
tSparx, sure go for it
I mean, I love him, even in ssn 1, so maybe he's not an annoying stereotype... hmm...
Pearly: Well I meant in person. Of course I can glomp you here! *glomps*
00,10that sounded like that one mussled pegisis
oh sure in person would be nice
BARELY SCRATCHED IT
tSparx, where from?
Pearly: Mostly I just wanted to finish out that reference.
Pearly: Where what from?
If you mean me, I'm from St. Louis.
Hows it goin everypony :)
Which is in MO, midwest USA
00,10Caramel, you gonna need a bigger mech
so, caramel
Sumica What he needs is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
sumica: there are always bigger mechs :P
hmm
ahh I am from california
the chat seems to be a victim of 1st degree murder.
hmm
THAT WAS MURDER
o-o
Not yet dead
Dont let the flame die out.
I like this slow pace, opposed to the insanity of live episodes
heh
MadSurge: Holy crap, movie night was awful. Like, I enjoyed it, but I can only do that once or twice a week, haha
Why is there a suomi bronystate-
/me nomths Vivix
/me likcs Jmo's teeth
Whats this being streamed?
tSparx: :O it's not awful!
o.o
i have to hit the hay everypony goodnight
/me is one of those cleaning fish
00,10dont know Vivix, but they are not bronystate
Night Maid_RainBow
so every week do we have differnt shows on or soething?
Night night Maid_RainBow!
night Maid_RainBow!
night Maid_RainBow
MadSurge: I mean the insane pace of chat. I'm pretty introverted, so all that talking is very stressful, even in digital form.
Night Maid_RainBow
Night Maid!
goodnight
bye maid_
tSparx: wait until you see the pace of live episodes...
tSparx, I tend to stay quiet or just shout out "Haha!" or references, or trivia- the chat is way too fast to converse during movies
or well- sometimes everyone focus on one topic, which makes it doable
it's more than just a gurren lagann game...
superretroworld: Depends on who's streaming, or if there is anyone willing to stream at all
it looks pretty cool
Didn't realise it was 4:33AM. Hm.
oh
Caramel: Oh, well I didn't know that. Explains why there are gundams haha, i thought they were just ganmen that looked like gundams :P
no, they're each from their own shows
MadSurge: Oh Lord. lol
tSparx: it's all giant robots in a big crisys crossover
There's even a capslock channel
/me plowing through channel list
/me plows Vivix over
ADVENTUUUUUUURE~
!
Almost 1 quarter of his health gone, and still we can't see its health?
MadSurge: Ah, good good. I've only been here since this fight started, so I didn't realize.
/me likes what he sees
and its a 3 day event :D
Vivix: I have a good time on movie night, but like I said, it's stressful, or I guess tiring's a better word.
tSparx: it started with its own characters, but as the franchise grew bigger they managed to insert other famous franchises :D
I like how LaserPon3 is already planning to attend again.
brb guys
stressfull for you?
Laserpon3 again?
we have to MOD the channel during it...
Nope Caramel :D
Yep Applejack2012.
Applejack2012 i hope so
tSparx, yeah, that's about how it feels, fast chat often is
hes pretty cool
Caramel: I'm an introvert, all social interaction is tiring. I'm not trying to compare here :/
'Guaranteed I will be at: Bronycon, EFNW, Equesticon and BUCK'
So is this goth mecha just a distraction?
Healing song! :D
But chat is so much easier than f2f, because I don't have to worry about what to do with my hands, or to make sure I'm wearing the right expression, etc. So it takes a lot of volume to bring it back up to normal levels of stress, and movie night certainly did that to me.
whoa! Caramel O____O how are you? havent spoken to you for a while D:
I'm good
Holy crap!
HORI SHITTO
Caramel ^^ thats good to hear!
tSparx, I'm in therapy for social anxiety, and some of the people I met there with mild social anxiety described it much like you do there, it is very tiring to have it like that
Of course, it's different from person to person
/me pokes Vivix
/me chews on Jmo's finger
;~;
hey everypony
Almost dead!
gentle chewing ;__;
Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony!
the chat goes wild under certain episodes
11,02Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :D
Vivix: I don't think I rise to social-anxiety levels -- it's not like I'm worried to make a fool of myself or something. I have a ton of friends, and can enjoy parties, and what not
11,02I eat cookies :3c
/me nomths SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: what kind of cookies?
Vivix: It's just that social interaction wears me down, and being alone charges me back up :)
tSparx, yeah, it is very different from person to person, and for some it's not a big enough problem to be-- labeled, you know? It's just a personality trait
/me is nomths D:
whats a good IRC client?
misses with a 75% hit chance...the RNG really hates me in this game
:3
11,02MadSurge: Chocolate chip ^-^
Vivix: :)
/me munchs on pizza combos pretzals
For me it makes it difficult to get a job, so I decided it was best--that way
SuperBrony64: YUM
tSparx: that's called being an introvert
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
/me screeches
Pucker up princess o.o
hehe
Vivix: BronyInstrumental that's what I've been saying earlier: I'm an introvert. One of the reasons I like T-Sparx so much is that I can relate to her :)
i'm an introvert too :)
noms pizza too
not sure who that is- but yeah, everyones different
Does anyone have a good IRC client recommendation for windows?
05asparagus soup with egg noodles
05every sick mans dream >.>
/me eats chili chips with chocolate ice-cream
SuperBrony64: how you enjoying the new mario game so far?
I'm using HydraIRC, but being a total noob- it's difficult
11,02superretroworld: Awesome :3
soulrider95: If you use Firefox, I enjoy Chatzilla. mIRC's good too.
This attack better work.
It's chicken or turkey noodle soup for me Wrek :), but to each their own.
SuperBrony64: If only it was Wario collecting all those coins :D
cool
I want it to look the same as webclient, because I use that during stream watching and..stuff, but this one has almost no menus yet
Vivix: You don't know who who is?
11,02MadSurge: Would make an awesome Wario game :P
tSparx, T-Sparx, it's a character ?
I already have 1,000,000 coins. I feel cheated
Vivix: 'Swhat I call Twilight Sparkle :)
Ooh
13Wrek: you are a sick sick man?
Nice nickname
DED
Anyone knows Satan in Steam?
I relate the most to Fluttershy, because it's just about the same level of freakedoutness as I get, ha
T-Sparx = Twilight Sparkle, tSparx = me. I use pPie as a handle when I'm in a P-Pie mood. I never call her P-Pie, but i type her out that way a lot.
ah yeah
is this a game we are watching?
yo
05Shizuka: i seem to have, in my absense contracted man-flu
And T-Sparx + P-Pie = My favs <3
hi
TwiPie, I love that
Wrek: :(, get well soon!
Vivix: I relate to both 'Shy and Pinkie :D I start out shy and when I get cooking I get as talkative as Pinkie :D
did it just growl
Hehe, yeah, I do that too sometimes, wiht my friends I am hyper and- loud and weird, even in public
Alchemist: Super Robot Wars
Ew, TwiPie sounds like a ship name. I don't really ship in MLP (or in much, really). But if you like it, I'm happy for you :)
I relate to AJ and Rarity
but I break down- easily in social situations without people I know
Vivix: i can't relate to any pie shipping... imagining pinkie in something as serious as a relationsship... no way
I love applepie
MadSurge: Oh...And who can read kanji to play it?
I like her show persona, as seen in--baby cakes, I think most fics user her as a joke instead of a character
Alchemist: Crml apparently
so I love shipping her as a char and not a joke
Alchemist: apparently Caramel can
Nice! :)
/me Defibrillates Chat
AJ/Caramel got killed
It appears he has Mermaid Man's belt. Why doesn't he use it to shrink the boss?
Vivix: How do you connect with HydraIRC to this chat?
Uhh, just a sec soulrider95
Marx: he tried. he got wambo
BronyInstrumental: awww, he gave me a free ticket so I HAD to thank him personally :D
I can't even consider going to BUCK, I wouldn't be able to go in the door. First day of community college I locked myself into my room and had to call for help
tSparx whats going on?
Jmo: i would'a been too shy too regardless :)
I wish I had a Twilight Sparkle that could help me break out of my ep1-Fluttershy shell.
MadSurge: he offered me a free ticket but alas, shyness :D
That man needs to be pampered.
Vivix: let's go there together, I'll drag you through the door :D
So it really does have 200,000 HP!
soulrider95, first you create an identity, just your nick and..stuff, and then you press eh new server and use "irc.eu.ponychat.net:6667" adress, and then type /join #bronystate
Malk Not much, just enjoying Crml's stream, talking about introversion and T-Sparx :)
MadSurge: doesnt sound like a good idea
I'd be too busy sitting on Vivixs head. ;~;
Finally, its health is visible! :D
It's a bit- confusing, this is only my third time using it
and I got my posters from SuperBrony64 :3
Why haven't you guys ask him yet?
MadSurge, ooh, yeah. It would be best going with someone who could egg me on. and Jmo is welcome to my head
I must depart fillies and gentlecolts.
SuperBrony64
Bye
byr Everlasting_Joy
SUP.
Alchemist: exactly, I'll be there to pump you up with courage :D
That's how we roll.
Cya Everlasting_Joy
Cya later Everlasting_Joy
Vivix: if you came i would happily help you through, too :)
The Simpsons game...now or later? SuperBrony64
ima go to BUCK on Vivixs head and he'll like it.
cya
Aww Yeahh
11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Yay \:3/
Y'all talkin' 'bout BUCK?
but yeah, if I were to go to buck or similar, I would have to have someone there I'd known for a long time, no first meetings, and such. As my psyche is now at least
Vivix: apparently I'm brave enough to play the Pinkie if there's other shy people around me :D
tSparx Im a pony girl in a brony world:$
Yeah got the IRC client working!
SuperBrony64...
Malk: Is it done yet?!
MadSurge, aah, I love people like that, I met a guy during community school kinda like that, and he helped me meet people and play music and stuff
MadSurge: if by courage you mean alcohol or sedatives then okay :)
(excited !?, not angry !?)
tSparx still working on it
11,02MASF123: I'm actually going out to eat soon :<
tSparx havent worked on it since last time
soulrider95, woo! HydraIRC was a bit confusing for me, but- I like it. Especially the event log, the only thing that bugged me was that ping wasn't default
Malk: Really looking forward to it :)
I'll eat you in a minute SuperBrony64 o.o
ok
Alchemist: you can have alcohol, I hate the stuff!
11,02o.O
om nom nom
how do I enable ping D:
Souls are tasty :3
You'll EAT him out? Oh my :(
tSparx I really wish I had people helping because its hard to come up with new lines
lol
I'm usually fine in social situations, and if I know I'm gonna have a hard time, there's always a certain herb that can help me out.
soulrider95, I eh.. I'll query you what I did, it's a bit lengthy ish
I'm gonna join next BUCK :) luckily the date fits right between the many birthdays i have to attend in august
SuperBrony64: what restaurant?
Wish I could go to BUCK
hai everypony :)
soulrider95: just type part of a name and then press tab, that way you'll ping people :)
hey Michael
Malk: You should feel free to send me what you had, I'd love to look over and help :)
hi
I'd attend BUCK but the flight there would be $2k. ;~;
tSparx thanks
tSparx ill find a way
hugs back
Jmo: it's barely 300for me... where do you live? must be quite far away...
Malk: I can be emailed at G_O_T_R@sbclobal.net, or you can just /msg me the info.
MadSurge: I drink very rarely too. Maybe about on 1 occasion per month at most. Im just saying that when I drink, I dont become more brave, I become less self conscious. to an outsiedr that means he sees no change in my behaviour, but I get a bit more relaxed :D
Australia maaaate.

soulrider95 test
Alchemist: but then i realised it's freaking stupid
11,02Shizuka: For Gryffindor!
tSparx: spiral is simply evolution and will
Michael: The anti-spirals were spirals who wanted to stop themselves from accidentally growing too big and destroying the universe, so they stopped their own growth and became anti-spirals.
Soulrider95. test
Michael: Oh I thought you were asking what anti-spirals were, my bad haha
tSparx: i know, i watched the series like 20 times
and the classic soulrider95: test

SRW Z2: Saisei Hen

Thanks for the stream Caramel!

Michael: Or are they both called Dai-Burren?
tSparx: it's a fusion between gurren lagann and the ship that "rossiu" made for scape from earth
probably stream some nostalgia until another streamer signs up
Dai-Gurren*
awesome Hissatsu to end the stream Caramel
I havent seen Caramel stream before , but thanks for streaming it :)
Michael: Yeah, and isn't that not Dai-Gurren, isn't Dai-Gurren the fusion of GL and the Dai-whatever fort from Ssn. 1?

TheKatPony: One of these days the stream'll give me a heart attack
No kidding ^^
I gotta admit, I wish that straightenedhair!P-Pie didn't equal sad/not-funny-insane!P-Pie
It's a cute hairstyle
So here in a minute, I'm gonna go catch Keldeo.
I like her mane
I personally like the sad/mad Pinkie.
Well, I mean, that insanity is funny, but she's not enjoying it.
I like it, in that episode, but not so much in fics yet, most tend to overplay it
^^
Me too
TheKatPony: I hated to see P-Pie sad, but the scenes where she threw a party with the inanimate objects is one of the funniest scenes in the whole series xD
yeeah
LOL yeah

...
What?
my eyes ^^
ahem the hell? it cut off a portion of my copy
otakon: hitting up in the type section would of been easier
Probably for the best.
You know, I seriously think EileMonty has proven herself better than rina-Chan enough
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mML2fPec7xU waiting music :)
Spectrum_Rush: I do not know that
/me looks up
ya cant see, bt ya see
i dont get why your dealing with "better than"
they are both fantastic voices
and doing it for free
Chrysalis: you're*
hiya Chrysalis
Chrysalis, Rina-Chan has no voice range
ohai Chrysalis
EileMonty has done plenty of voice accurately
CrimsonPhoenix far more than you could ever muster
Michael: that would be good for intermission music
Might as well crank on some Sonic Generations music or some Kingdom Hearts music
twilight_sprinkle: IKR
and yet we hear Rina-Chan EVERYWHERE and EileMonty nowhere except that video AtC did
needs some intermission music
^^
Applejack2012: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYxbSRpVJ3s&feature=watch_response
Chrysalis, I am sorry but I am convince with this opinion and you cannot change my mind
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK_sgxY4SUA&feature=relmfu
everyone is entitled to an opinion
but its a dick move if you insult someone for what they are doing for free
yay stream
the hell>
oh
I got voice but no picture
A one a two a three?
I'm just sick of the attention she's getting
I hear the incomparable GigabitHarmonie
I would love to hear many more people perform
ohai Gigabit :D
CrimsonPhoenix: well there is no point of doing that
The Great And Powerful GigabitHarmonie !
CrimsonPhoenix then do work yourself and offer the VA to other people

GigabitHarmonie: You got skype?

GigabitHarmonie: Could you also post the title of this song in the chat, please?:$
violetvanilla is best dj ;)
otakon: eeyup!

Ryunosuke violetvanilla and Gigabit are best DJ
good point otakon :p
13vivi ist bestest pony
Violet's got some nice jams. :)
13there ist no debate
Never heard her
suddenly shizuka
Shizuka: I never said she was a lousy pony
Objection, no one cares about your opinion.
Vivix: she's the resident music expert around here
Shizuka: Well yeah, because it's a matter of opinion. Can't debate opinion!
I know who she is, but I never heard her stream
also, Shizuka has a big crush on her
hehe
OBJECTION!
otakon: Despite of late not actually being around.
lol
Meanwhile: yeah that kind of sucks
GigabitHarmonie is best DJ on Bronystate!
question: who DOESNT have a crush on vivi is a more ... answerable question :p
"SPIKE HAS A CRUSH ON RARITY!"
/me wishes he knew Vivi
tSparx: tsk-tsk, and you were doing so well
tSpark DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
She was here more when I joined, but I never talked to her
tSpark WHAT A TWEEEEEEEEEEST
tSparx: spoilers!
I don't think we have anything in common
Personally I'm with Dark92Enigma.
tSparx: what a surprise...
This music, it's, it's causing me to, to transform...

Vivi's voice <3
SpikexRarity!
I'm pretty sure that'd be pedophilia.
Meanwhile: Who knows how many dragon-years makes a pony-year
Spikes too ... something
Meanwhile: Maybe it won't be pedo by ssn3/4
He's a kid in dragon years
tSpark My Little......SPOILERS! (ok, this is the last running joke i put here)
for now
DJ-Gigabit: Not to be too demanding, but could you post the tracks you play on the chat, please?:$
I used to wonder what spoilers it could be
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Yellow / Alicorn Wave - Blindbag Codes
Applejack2012: I'm pretty sure SpikexRarity is R34.
VioletLynnScraton: Not all of it is R34. I've seen SpikeXRarity that's more romantic than R34.
Same
true
AJIsAwesome: Meh... true.
true
I'm not a Spike fan, but there's tons of non R34 spike ships out there
hello DJ-Gigabit

But how should I know, I'm really into shipping IMO.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DERP, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DERP, HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR DERPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DERP
:)
I also broke my bass' neck once-
Heres muffins, punch and cupcakes
happy birthday Derpy_Hooves
Yay, happy birthday! :$
I have a story for you guys. I was exploring my campus's various halls when I came a certain hall. I saw a painting with various images, and Derpy Hooves was on it! Today has been a great day.:)
get the muffins!
Happy annual celebration of a certain number of days since your creation, Derpy_Hooves!
Derpy_Hooves: Happy Birthday!
Yes, happy birthday Derpy_Hooves!
Hope you're tuned in!
AJIsAwesome, Cool! I was at the town hall here a few days ago, and they had a Pinkie Pie in the windowsill
/me drops a truck full of muffins over derpy
Happy birthday Derpy_Hooves ! I hope your day is filled with muffins and bubbles!
Vivix: That's great!
AJIsAwesome: So my dormitory is currently Olympic-themed, and my floor is specifically volleyball themed.
Dont click this, but song link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHWwKC8WjU
It's fun to find ponies. The painting was like a wall murial?
Inb4 Derpy_Hooves is actually afk and will miss all these messages.
AJIsAwesome: There's a sign on the hall that just says, "SPIKE!"
./).(\
!
There you are. Happy Birthday Derpy_Hooves.
AJIsAwesome: And I need a picture of Spike (or of Twilight yelling (for spike or not)) to put under there xD
/me lies at the bottom of a gorge still "adventure...!"
DJ-Gigabit: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY APPLAUSE!
DJ-Gigabit: that song has been copyrighted you dont have the right to sing it :P
In the basement of the dorm I was in we had grafitti eveyrwhere, and everyone would sit in the corner and play ping pong and mariokart
if I had been there THIS year, I woulda painted mlp reference somewhere
finally!
it had goddamn copyrights on it before
dat Derpy
so CUTE!!
Metronome: That's an awesome picture..
Musical works don't enter public domain until 100 years after their coypright-owner's death.
I thought it was 75
Same as most things. (Some things enter public domain earlier, having trouble coming up with an example.) In the US of course.
but if someone renews the copyright BEFORE expiration, it gets another lifetime + 75
Vivix: I mispoke.
Oh okay, I'm not too sure what the actual year was, so was just asking
It's 100 years after the original publication, or someodd (I guess 75) after the author's death
Aah
Whichever comes first. Usually the former, obviously, but.
Gah, gotta use the lavaritory.... be right back.
VioletLynnScraton: You know, IN THE BATHROOM!
good night yall!
Goodnight Alchemist!
Alchemist: Bye!

I'm getting double events when I get pinged-
08,01"tv not working"
Damn, irc, y u so hard for noobs
/me hugs Bronysith|DnDarksoul.
08,01"is it plugged in?"
Alright, I've calmed back down now.
08,01"are you sure it's swtiched on?"
DJ-Gigabit: thank you, dark souls is so hard
08,01and in the end, how did i fix it?
08,01turned it off then on again.
08,01FM.
08,01*FML.
Hehehe- oh stuff
Are there any non-mod streamers?
08,01yes, me!
No.
08,01oh, wait
08,01never mind
Pfft.
'Cause I'm not seeing Giga in colour, and I didn't see Crml in colour earlier
Do they just not use colour?
Indeed.
DJ-Gigabit: Could you please post this song in the chat? It's kind of catchy.
I'm a staff member, but not a mod. I can use colour if I want, but usually don't.
....
well taht was odd
otakon: What was?
Colour is for those who like beating standards with sticks on IRC
hey everypony
ohai emerald
Dumorimasoddaa: Your name looks very familiar.
hai emerald
hi
Ok. So must all mods use colour, then? Or is it optional for both mods and staffmembers? Cause I like being able to tell who's a mod and who's not that easily, 'cause my client doesn't show user-modes next to handles
hi emerald
Most mods use colour, I think Caramel is the only one who don't?
Hello Emerald
Wrek got his back
There's nothing saying mods /must/ use colour, they just tend to for sake of ease.
how are you all
DJ-Gigabit then you must know me from some place
Kk, thx for the clarification.
It's a unique to me string
gerat emerald thanks for asking. how about you?
hreat*

This song is not going to be a hit, but it's catchy and funky.
It's even Quebecois
oh, neat DJ-Gigabit

Fancy!
DJ-Gigabit, I LOVE IT
anyone seen that college humour take on bronys
Dumorimasoddaa: Lol, gotcha
CrimsonPhoenix: Glad to hear it! :)

It can acess files on a disk and that's about it
emerald: I have. It's just to be a joke, though.
MY STREAM IS SPEAKING IN FANCY!

applejack096: You're*
Part of me wonders if I could code a HTML 5 relay of the stream
yeah knida sound like that more
no ive been here for a while aj
It's likely doable one-to-one but multistreaming would need more bandwidth than I could afford
yes emerald is kinda new he's my big bro
Thats ok DJ-Gigabit :) So who here lives in England??
Sup Polydunami !
Oh hey tSparx :3

Hi Polydunami!

Good night applejack096
applejack096: Bye!

luna_pony: No one be mad
as well as a non-image link during stream which is also not allowed
:'( sorry i didnt know
luna_pony: ... yet :P
night applejack096
Read Da Rulez
CrimsonPhoenix: Be nice :P
^
It's mostly vid links that invoke the ire of the mods
I was joking at the end
Read the rules or receive a boot to the face.
*head :P
No I definitely meant face.
hi thelonepony
Right. Boot to the head was in my will, never mind :P
hai luna_pony :)
Ok, so I got Keldeo just now, and I'll tell you this because you would never guess it otherwise: To get Keldeo to learn Secret Sword, you have to go to the Moor of Iccirus.
goodnight
i<3rainbow dash
how are you today
:D
Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6.
love Dash too
I love all of them, oh so much.
Meanwhile: :S
Let's not hate any of the Mane 6. If anything, you can dislike them but not hate.
I must say Rarity has outdone herself http://fav.me/d5cmoat
Hate can be a very strong word.
I hate Rainbow Dash.
:S ;)
Besides, Sweetie Belle is beast pony anyway
You're going to love me!
Marx you sure we're talking about pokemon here?
Alright, so I don't use the in-site client, and I just realized that's what this is: that :S smiley becomes a pony-emoticon, yes?
Rainbow Dash is still better than Rarity :| But Twilight is best pony.
Pokemon is best pokemon
Rainbow Dash just annoys me. She's a douche.
&)
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Rarity is my favourite out of the mane six, to be honest :$
But Rarity and Sweetie Belle is best
rainbow dash is best pony and love and tolerate
CrimsonPhoenix dear celestia, more sweet pics :D
/me anti-brohoofs Polydunami
Meanwhile: lol
Rarishypie are my three favourites
Meanwhile: She's just brash and oblivious to the ponies' feelings, that's all.
._.
I just post what I can find
That's what I said
SOmetimes.
She's a douche
Discord Is best Pony
Sweetie Belle is best pony
there's no best pony, nuff said
Everyone has their own opinion on the ponies.
Sweetie Belle is best pony
...
Q is best pony
Meanwhile: Douche is being a dick, she's just a jerk sometimes.
discord is a dragonaquis not a pony but still he is cool
Discord best draconques
It's pretty wierd you have to visit the Moor of Icirrus for Secret Sword, considering there's no apparent history of the area... Ohhhh, now they explain it.
Same thing.
I never say, "[Blank] is the [blankest] pony." 'Cause why bother?
Sorry lowfn, but the character of Rarity grew on me over time :P
This song~
luna_pony: he is part pony
lol
this song is lol
But she's not my absolute favourite.
Now Pinkie Pie, that's a best pony.
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Meanwhile: Not really. JUst because words are similar doesn't mean they're are the same.
Solaire is best in Jolly Co-op lol Dark Souls reference
Twilight sparkle is best pony
Stupid grammar error.:|
yeah and part goat but thats not saying he's nibbling washing on the line
piccard pony is best pony
In this instance it does. Because we're speaking in a metaphorical sense.
:3
We all know Dumorimasoddaa is best poni
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Dark Souls :|
People who oves Rarity knows what's up
So stop the bickering
It also helps that I love all the Mane6, so my least-favorite is still beloved :
If we were speaking literally I probably wouldn't compare Rainbow Dash to something used to clean a vagina.
...interesting song
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Scootaloo FTW
Her complexity, charisma and motivation is beyond interesting
wtf steam
Dovah yep :) gotta get my ps3 fixed to play it again though :(
scootaloo is best children
Sketch_Toku_Brony: pc version.. i wants it
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Scootaloo is best chicken.
^
Secret Sword aquired!
chicken i mean
chicken you mean emerald
To be honest, I do despise the chicken joke on Scootaloo
I am the best pony, motherfuckers.
:P
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Pinkie Pie is best chicken
CrimsonPhoenix: Same here. It's been beaten to death.
<.<
Objection, Pinkie Pie is best pony.
sweetie belle is best robot
Sweetie Belle is best pony
I belive the best pony is john de lancie, he said so himself
well i'm leaving this page Goodbye
Eulshy: We heard you the first time, haha
Dovah yeah it looks pretty good on pc,hopefully the dlc will release in oct or so
The chicken jokes have gone a bit.... foul
there's no best pony...
luna_pony: Bye.
:|
only fav pony

Sketch_Toku_Brony: dcl? wut?

I adore her, but in Real life I'd be so constantly annoyed at her
Now, here's the thing: Keldeo's a Water type (along with Fighting), and the Pokedex says he can glide across water and stuff. Not to mention, Keldeo looks like a pony, so does that make him, dare I say it, a Seapony?!
i love trixie
My little ponymon?
I adore Diamond and Silver too- so I'm ... odd? I dunno
Friendship is kanto?
AJIsAwesome: agreed
and it sounds like a depressed guy that just lost a relationship
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I know omg I want it so much! :)
Friendship is kanto?
Keldeo: Pokemon's equivalent to seaponies.
My little ponymon?
Why the hell would anyone like Diamond Tiara
XD
All we're gonna do talking about best and worst ponies is hurt feelings. No one's gonna be swayed to love your fav pony. Our opinions'll be set, at least until there's new char. development in ssn. 3
mikebond3401: dat game
I like DT too
Vivix: well they are children, so i cant really hate them
?
tSparx|Reading, true
I want to throw Diamond Tiara in a well.
tSparx|Reading: Agreed.
pm Michael
XD
Spademagnes[R]: People can like her in terms of being a rival.
/me hugs AJIsAwesome and tSparx|Reading
*cough*fluttershyisworstpony*cough*
:/
At which point I'd find these convos a little less silly.
WTF LIEZ
tarra strong is best human :)
tSparx|Reading: you must love fluttershy tho, otherwise she will kill you :[
Hmm? :|
Lol emerald

That's a funny way to spell everypony...
I did enjoy RD more because of her char dev, so I like that there is char dev
Fluttershy is second worst mane 6.

^hehehe
everypony is best pony
^
Dovah: you missed me

Objection, Trixie is worst pony.
Luna is best pony
Meanwhile: stopt that
Friendship
otakon: No.
Rarity...is ready! http://i.imgur.com/jtD4Y.jpg
Trixie is 3rd best pony, Rarity is 2nd
Fluttershy is my second favorite Mane 6
after that all ponies are best except fluttershy
and now i have food wut did i miss?
Trixie's just a jerk.
WTF LIEZ
maybe Luna is slightly ahead of others
Well, we know who likes unicorns :);):|
you missed best pony fighy
FLUTTERSHY IS AWESOME
Trixie is a jerk, but I still like her
LOL
MYAH!
Vivix: Agreed.
Polydunami: nah thats not why
Polydunami: altho unicorns are OP
:d YEAH POLY
:D:'(:P pegasusai
On another thing, I don't know how both of the Keldeo I got ended up with the exact same nature, one that lowers Sp. Atk.
:)
ohai everypony :)
Vivix: trixie's special talent is being a jerk, she cant help it
Dovah: I love all the Mane6. Not equally, but I do. Rarity's my least fav, and I'd still love to bro with her.
I wish I had a Keldeo :(
So many french~
Hehehe

Bad luck or what?

His wand is augmented.

His parents are deeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
Wow, way to be a jerk Ron.

OhGod this b****
Oh, yeah THIS woman.
I truly despise her with all my being..

and they NEVER EXPLAIN RITA EITHER
Freefall29: I've never read the books, so I really have no idea. Jelly is just my guess
no Rita Seeker bypasses the nrmal censor laws n principle
ok hold on is this commentery live
dynamo2814: it's a synched recording

oh ok

Thankfully.
dynamo2814: you haven't heard disembodio yet
yeah true Shizuka
13and you won't, dis is removed in this sync
She's still number on my list of hated characters in Harry Potter.
disen what?
Shizuka: a'www
Because Rita Skeeter showing up as often as she's meant to in the books would've induced brain hemmorage.
*number 2*
I like Disembodio
Just me and you...in a closet...no one else....not much light....
oh god
Lets.....write a story

Shizuka: would you kindly make this? http://cheezburger.com/4710771456

LunaTheBeloved: I should get out of the kitchen then. But

Shizuka: i always wondered why girls went around in flocks....... thanks for the advice
Evening all. How are we?
Geez, this is really over two hours long!?
which is worse giant wman r lady gaga?
Reikim: LunaTheBeloved is here
hey tigher1001 /)
Reikim: Nearly 3 hours
Reikim: okay man, watching harry potter rifftrax
Lady gaga aint a woman Lunac
13otakon: silly filly, in dodgeball we travel in packs because boys are too scared to throw a ball at us
He's got hoes in different area codes.
Cello Reikim
13in return we can pelt you with your own balls :)
Huh
/me throws a dodgeball at Shizuka.
Kinky
The infamus snape hed shve
I got two nonsensical responses, a description, and a cello. Well, at least the last is useful.
Shizuka ouch.......
/me 13dodges
Clearly you've never played in England.
/me plays melodious tunes on his cello
/me throws dodgeball at Meanwhile
13silly meanwhile i have guaranteed nat 20s in reflex saves
/me throws a wrench at Meanwhile
13ohairei
/me can dodge a wrench but ironically not a ball.
/me attacks Meanwhile s moustache
Shizuka: that didn't stop the guys in my school they aimed at groups
I used to be the dodgeball KING
Bronysith ITS TURNING!!
Or not
/me can dodge chuck norris kick
Bronysith, NO...It might trigger a Mustach Attack!!
it annoys me that everyone can say "during highschool" when i still have a few years to go :(
i want someone to attack me :(
If you're playing dodgeball expect to take a ball to the face.
Shizuka: I kept trying to tell them to split up and make smaller targets but NO! don't listen to the chubby kid
Actually I dropped gym after the first year, because it was stupid and getting in the way of fun stuff like math.
/me "USE THIS!" gives Bronysith a shotgun
sleeves then shove
best Snape scene
ooh, a rifftrax of goblet of fire
I played the dodge role, on account of being a lot more nimble back then.
Meanwhile: You also present a much smaller target.
Exacta.
Meanwhile: back then? Your a goddamn sprite now
You're*
Reikim you don't move much do-- then again, gym's is pretty useless
GAH! Buffer!
Meanwhile: you must have been a wisp back then, if you turned sideways you'd be nearly invisible
I hate teenage rmances in films, they butcher it so much
I was more dodge and catch, considering the fact I wasn't really that good with throwing.
Man. Gym sucks. But Math? Best class ever.
Oh thank god! Harry is NOT gay! I was worried. This scene reconciled my worries.
Reikim: lucky. i have to do it for 2 more years, and have had to for 3
hells yea Reikim /)
AjIsAwesome same here
Dken2021: (\
REJECTED!!
Reikim Agreed
Barbet fanfic disagrees remember
13DENIED
yeah! fuck Harry
I know that feeling, Harry.
and cockblocked
DAT DEPRESSION
Reikim: and math? only fun when there aren't a**holes sat behind you, literally pouring water down your back :'(
i know that feeling as well
I don't get this scene
Most relationships end at "You like ponies?" for me
Lying there depressing hlding an egg= perfect metaphr for teenage sex
I just get it on the table right away.
Math is great. It's easy. It's rote. It's the only- well, one of the few classes I can sleep through (legitimately, sleep through) and still come out with nigh-perfect scores
Reikim: I hate math. Then I threw my mates pencil case out a window, and it got better.
lol
13i thought the patils were in ravenclaw
WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO THE DANCE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Meanwhile: But Math's the best class for sleeping.
Shizuka: they were in the books
Meanwhile: I gotta try that method some time
I slept in German.
13or one of them was
Shizuka: but THAT WAS CHANGED for the goddamn movies
i sleep in German class
I often slept in nap class
You had to do German? Why?
BronyInstrumental: /)

Meanwhile: (\ and i get perfect scores in almost all my tests too :D

cocain is a hell of a drug
I repeated i hate emma watsn's hermine
Shizuka: same here, I was the high school pariah. I had such a infamous reputation that FRESHMEN came up to me, kids I never have seen before saying "Hey Cody".
once a year. Maybe. No more
dat guest list
also, anyone notice in High School that the Freshmen just kept getting shorter and shorter?

my friend has this song on her ipod
THE BURST INTO FLAME AND INTO A PILE OF ASH!
So. If some one made a polyjuice potion of you, what do you think it would taste like? Mine would probably be whiskey and smooth cigars.
reminds me of "Dancing with Myself"
13nanoo nanoo?

/me throws glitter on otakon
HA
OH GOD IT BURNS!
otakon my teacher showed us a video called use sunscreen today lol

my math teacher used to hate me because i went a year without doing any homework, to make a point. no joke. my point didn't get across, but it was pretty awesome to hear her rage :D
BronyInstrumental: that would get you failed, unless you aced all of the tests
in fact, all dogs DO go to heaven

That fic focused on Hermione after that issue with the polyjuice potion in Chamber.
This house has a maze going to the front door.
Meanwhile: Hm? What?
They're real and spectacular
Meanwhile: oh God no
Reikim: I was making a joke about the joke.
What joke?
(has no stream. Again.)
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Monument

Harry Ptter nw with 50% mre sexual tensin
dat spying ghost
Now how to register this...
Harry: i need an adult
And many Harry X Myrtle fanfics were made that day.
Haha
Don't forget that Myrtle is technically around the same age as Hagrid.
Harry she;s a ghst it wn;t effect her
Nickname registered.
Meanwhile so GILF fanfics?
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.
R63, anyone?
I should really register each new permutation of Reikim as I use it.
.
borderline porn
Mytrle reminds me f Maud Moonshine frm Worst Witch might be the same actresss
Oh you guys are on that scene?
what did i just see
Harry Potter. Now with 20% more sexual tension.
He dreamt the bath ghst porn? whw
You saw Myrtle sexually harrassing Harry.
ok im ggoing to bring up something way out of left field...uhm who here cried whilst reading my little dashie
dynamo2814: not me, i haven't cried in years
because i sure did
I didn't, because that fic is bad.
dynamo2814: I didn't, but that's because I didn't read it.

Inb4 MLD is overrated people
TRIVIA!
MLD /is/ overrated.
Meanwhile: Everyone has their own opinions.
13mm gravity resistant trees
Seems to always come up when that fic is brought up
nothing like that ussually makes me cry like movies or what not but that actually made me cried
what is the point of gravity resistant trees?
JESmith71: it's not as weepy as I would thought really. Now, the Married Life scene from Up on the other hand...:'(
AJIsAwesome: Funny that Harry should say "No offense but I really don't care" because it's exactly what I was about to say to you.
13MLD is meh
tartan scarf neville? really?
why mention oscar wilde?
13i've read better written bathroom graffiti
Shizuka, I love you
great author though
otakon: And Jessie's song scene from Toy Story 2, and the ending to Toy Story 3
JESmith71: oh God yes :'(
Toy Story 3
I see vampires
so goddamn good
and there goes Filch permaturely again
JESmith71, and yea MLD is overrated
KFC Double Down!
Shizuka: Wow, the ladies' room must have really nice graffiti. In the men's side it's mostly really bad representations of phallic objects mixed with crude vernacular and the occasional...more extensive drawing.
MLD is okay
FINALLY!
THE ONE TO KILL HIM!
my video is behind about a minute if ur already at the cannon fire
Neville, you're a murderer
13Reikim|Streamless: not really, mostly it's fanfics of twilight
You're a murderer Neville

Shizuka: Oh. Oh. In that case, I'll stick to the men's side...
dem fish
Back. Chat derped.
13yeah..
ok nevermind
Yeah...
13PREVIOUSLY ON FISHING WEEK
Shizuka:When you say fanfic of Twilight do you mean the vampires or the pony?
dynamo2814: clear your cache, refresh the stream and check your internet speed.
so who's streaming tonight?
Zamer: Shizuka.
You're a seabass Harry.
Is there really still another hour to go?
well i can tell you right now my internet speed is crap
Meanwhile: eeyup
damn commy spy
Yay Emma Watson was drowning for a short while! YAY!
Meanwhile: Yup.:D
because my computer is crap
Mmmm...no can probably still make it.
DAT BAD TOUCH
Honestly though I like Crioton's stuff much better that MLD myself
they're practically naked
dan their creepy
Just out of curiosity, are they riffing as their MST3K characters or no?
you know what they say about big feet....
I'm not one to read fanfics.
JAWS!
sharks in a lake?
MLD is overrated cause it's considered the most popular fanfic when it doesn't reach to quality to deserve that popularity
13clearly kevin forgot he had that goblet of fire from cabot
WindWhistler: enope
THAT is why it is overrated
WindWhistler: just riffing
yay a student is shark bait
dem drugs
it might be decent, it might have made people cry but it is also overrated
LSD is a hell of a drug
CrimsonPhoenix: have you tried Fallout Equestria?
Stamping on feet can make people cry.
CrimsonPhoenix: That's what I say about most fanfics. Especially Cupcakes.
otakon, WAY too long for me
WindWhistler: Everyone else from MST3k who isn't on Rifftrax
CrimsonPhoenix, I never read it anyway
CrimsonPhoenix: you should though, it's legitimately good
AJIsAwesome, Cupcakes isn't overrated it's complete utter shit
GRINDYLOWS!
CrimsonPhoenix: ikr? TL;DR?
wasn't there a even more ridiculous long fic longer than FO;E?
Dken2021: enope
otakon, also I never was a fane of Fallout
it's the longest fanfiction currently
CrimsonPhoenix: oh well then it might not be for you then
time to eat some calamari
i hate sad things, mainly because i cry to eaisly to sad things
otakon, that's what I thought
otakon: How long is Fallout? Never looked at it
I never was into Fallout to begin with, so I probably wouldn't like it.
May I mention a fanfic that does deserve some praise?
free harry!
LOL Dken2021
CrimsonPhoenix: Sure.
JESmith71: it's 39 chapter, it's 2000+ pages(8x11, 12 point font) at over 65K words.
well yeah
You guys know this picture right here? http://fav.me/d4r821l
did my chat die again?
Heya Bronystate.
Flootahshy: Hello!
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm saving that one
Hallo Flootahshy
hiya Flootahshy
otakon: No. Just slow.
haha
CrimsonPhoenix I've seen sketches of those way back
well there's a fanfic based on that http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22925/Tales-from-Mystika%3A-A-My-Little-Mages-Book
Post all the fan fics?
but it's unpopular due to I believe human being the cause
but it's very well-written and well-pace
I also love the action and the suspense in it
CrimsonPhoenix don't matter with me, thanks for linking it
as well as the dark atmosphere it gives
bugger all
post all the fan fics?
I don't read much fanfic myself, but I do like Crioton's stuff like Sunset and For Want of a Dawn (Is there anyone here who's heard of him)? His stuff may have flaws, but I like his writing style. Like he does some good grimdark stories, but they end on good notes
stupid USB adapter keeps going out
JESmith71: I followed both of those
JESmith71: Sunset, isn't that the one with Twi and a secret she discovers?
otakon: Yep
Ooray.
WERE A COUPLE OF MISFITS WE'RE A COUPLE OF MISFITS
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
My favourite fanfic - my absolute favourite - has to go out to The White Room.
Nuff said.
The White Room?
Reikim|Streamless: What's it about?
by definition i'm a misfit :(
Reikim|Streamless: What genre?
damn
ima fismit
A black house?
Um
BronyInstrumental: technically everyone is a misfit
my fav (even thought i've read a few) has to be the one that has general patton in Equestria
are there streams like this everyday
a wee bit sharp
To be honest, I'd be hard-pressed to actually describe The White Room and actually do it justice...it's one of those things you have to read, really.
dynamo2814: not all the time, it's random
my eyes hurt. I just read all rules of the internet...
hmm ok
Dovah: you poor poor bastard
dynamo2814 it varies betweeen other streamer
otakon1: technically, everyone IS but most people try not to be. and why don't you ghost your name?
otakon: yay?
BronyInstrumental: bc I'm tired of doing it every goddamn 10 minutes bc Netgear makes shitty USB Wifi adapters that bork out randomly for no damn reason
Dovah what rule did it scare you the most?
And he doesn't just do dark stuff like those two, he did a fun one where Celestia and Luna have a prank war, a few stories about Twilight and Trixie being sisters, one where Derpy takes in Dinky after she loses her birth parents, etc
I'll just wait until it ghosts automatically
also, going to Hogwarts I would touch NOTHING EVER
you're dead harry
thelonepony: possibly 899
seriously NEVER TOUCH ANYTHING IN HOGWARTS
If I went to Hogwarts I'd touch /everything/
i would as well
Meanwhile: and you'd be a dead moustache
Okay, sorry, the fanfic I was talking about was White Box. And it's........
Think of the fun things you could find.
I still can't properly describe it.
you may find the potion that turns you into a pony :D
otakon1, we're a couple of misfits
aww, I can't touch the stone of pain and suffering?
HEY THATS MY LINE :[
oh Fez_Quick_Thinker got it way quicker than I
ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Reikim|Streamless: It's called "The White Room"?
CrimsonPhoenix: we're a couple of misfits, what's wrong with misfits? Why don't we fit in!
Reikim|Streamless: Well, can you tell what genre it is? I.E. Grimdark, Sad, Normal. etc.
Reikim|Streamless: what's wrong man?
Flootahshy: Nope, it's called White Box.
still one of the greatest classics

I will link White Box, because I think it is a good read. You can choose to read it or not to, and whether you do is your choice entirely. I cannot give an indication of what it is like, because it speaks for itself.

Shizuka: they take getting used to, I actually like the hacking minigames alot
Whats trackmania?
08,01i generally don't play games without cheats
Spademagnes[R]: ah that track. so calming
08,01i don't find them very fun anyways
Spademagnes[R]: spent many an hour listening to that
08,01and i'm not too good at them
i just did someting stupid
Eulshy: what?

Sure is quiet.
08,01hey SB, what are you gonna stream?

Eulshy, don't worry it's only a book
13http://youtu.be/kc1SH5hWMLE also plug
Huh, why is there a video linking to Mystia's theme?
Shizuka: Omg, mod breaking rules! :P
About sparkly vampires... xP
otakon, I stabbed the bottom of a soda can with my knife and drank it down from the hole
i want to play mvm please
Whats this i hear about MvM?
13what there's no stream atm
Eulshy ooh, so hardcore you
Eulshy: you cut your lip didn't you?
otakon no
Shizuka: advertisment thingie ruley. ;)
Vordox: mods break rules all the time
well that's good
and i wanna play MvM!
Vordox: it's not advertising
dammit! people only ever feel up for MvM when i'm on my laptop and it's 4AM! :[
So... have you guys seen this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXkk7c4MZ88
Shizuka: But just kidding. =3 Love those videos, you always had a good knack for music.
BronyInstrumental: dem's the breaks!
can i play otakon
Oh god, Scoot-Scootaloo I've seen that one :S
otakon: Same here, can i get in on sum MvM?
otakon: Nuh, you're going to play Alien Swarm.
nope
I don't like it
otakon, i wanna play MvM
Why not, otakon? It's fun with friends.
plus for some reason it runs slow on my PC
Not to mention the games looks fun. <3
I'll be back in a minute
Scoot-Scootaloo I think someone misplaced a joke in translation
Reikim: it doesn't run at a good speed even of the lowest settings for some reason
otakon: wanna add me on steam regardless? sometimes i feel up for playing at slightly less rediculous times
FLUTTERSHY SHOULD NOT SCREAM
otakon, you have to have friends and fix that. Hold on.
sure BronyInstrumental
what's yer tag?
otakon take a wild guess
um
Octavias_Plot
:P
otakon close enough
otakon: Try running it windowed. If that doesn't help, open Task Manager. Something else is eating up your processor time. (that or your PC just sucks even worse than my laptop)
did stream derp?
Soooo no more stream?
no stream for mow
*now
Reikim: well let me put it this way, TF2 runs FINE for the most part
Reikim: How does one run it windowed?
LOL Scoot
okay then I shall take my leave and head to toonami aftermath.
13run what
13tf2?
no
otakon: Then AS should run fine. Something else is messing with it.
Alien Swarm
13oh
Shizuka: Alien Swarm.
13it's source
Reikim: I don't know
Reikim: Thanks TF2 is really slow for me also
13so set launch options, -window -noborder
well it slowed down ALOT during the elvator on the practice level
Shizuka, I don't think he knows how to do that.
otakon i can run fine tf2 but can't run alien swar without it being slow as hell :p
I mean single digit frames
scratch that...
otakon: That's normal, it's the baddies spawning. Even I get that.
I do dammit
i can only play TF2 on thursdays, saturdays and some sundays but nopony ever wants to play on those days and i get ronery :(
oh well then it's fine in that regard
Hey WindWhistler, about Fluttershy not screaming... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwp60eYuie0
Hello everypony im back
otakon: Oh wait that's extreme. Single digit? Yeah, your computer just sucks.
Reikim: it's got a intergrated card, what do you expcet?
hai Malk how ya doing?
Polydunami|DW: I meant when she's NOT crazy...
so, who is up for MvM?
hallo there Malk
Too bad otakon's computer sucks, I was looking forward to having someone else to play Alien Swarm with...
good thelonepony
SOoooo....whowants pie?
otakon me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1uJ5k-htCk I remember that quote from bronycon
hiya Malk from Texas
otakon me too
otakon: No, even I can run AS, and I've got an integrated card on a bloody laptop.
I should be working on my story
mine sucks with alien swarm for some reason
Eulshy: Protip, stay away from Bstate. Really bad for productivity
Reikim: well I don't know
ayway MvM Reikim ?
Hm
Hmmmmm
...

Gimme a sec.
Um where are we gonna meet for MvM?
oh wait

bugger
11,02Moo ^-^
otakon you going on the bronystate server?
otakon: I'm coming on, jumping off of Trix.
Malk: I think so
YAY! An SB64 stream!
Reikim, I once pissed off a mod on a chat by saying Protip: Nobody cares for your protips, everyone on the chat found it funny
SB64 stream hell ya
/me glomps LadyCanary :D
want to play Shizu ?
it's ...applebloom.ariscop.net
<3
/me is starting to thing SuperBrony64 has some mental issues
The mod banned me for doing that
13yeah
STREAM
otakon wanna play on thursday? sorry if it's inconvenient :$
11,02Dovah: Why? ;~;
can we wacth Party of One now? :)
Oh, I was going to post the part where Fluttershy cheered at the sonic rainboom ._.
otakon i am enforcer1252 on steam
BronyInstrumental: sure
SuperBrony64: just a hunch
spitfirecolt2: just add me, it's easier to remember. otakon17
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/24662 the one time i ever hate fluttershy and rainbow
otakon but yeah i'm BronyInstrumental on steam
Hooray, Team BState is GO
Reikim, meh
also, meet those playing in applebloom
We should play Advanced.
BronyInstrumental: I know
So what shall we watch today?
otakon Is the great and powerful trixie playing with us?
11,02No, I'd like to know your evidence to support your claim. That's a pretty negative thing to say about someone you barely know.
Derpy_Hooves creepy one
Derpy_Hooves eh, it's not that bad, seems kinda realistic
Malk: I think so
Also I hate it when my computer auto shuts down when it gets too hot
After all, with a Shizu on our side, we really can't meet a challenge without Advanced.
13except decoy
13giant pyros on wave 1
13so much pain
it's 4AM. Why am not tired?
Dken2021: keep it on your screen and watch the faces
Can't stop watching Fluttershy yay in other languages
Shizuka: you meeting us in the room?
/me isnt paying attention to chat.
You kow whatm I would love to see someone streaming theirselves playing Paper Mario and the thousand Year door
Clearly this is a thing we must do.
11,02Dovah: I'm waiting for your answer.
Derpy_Hooves, when they look at you, push Esc >:3
I think your computer is telling you that "DEAR GOD, STOP RUNNING SO MANY THINGS ON ME ALL AT ONCE! I'M BURNING HERE!!"
any map is fine for me
Decoy, Advanced. We will find the optimal combo.
SuperBrony64: didnt hear the ping therefor you said nothing :P
...
otakon invite sent
inb4 kick on Dovah.
/me stops a crapload of stuff in my task manager
Paper Mario TTYD <3 , im on my way to the second crystal star
Derpy_Hooves ......oh
should i delete all my friends on facebook?
11,02Dovah: I'm not going to be a happy person until you tell me why you would say such a thing.
why?
also 'Moo' seems.. odd but then again this is the internet so i sowwy :P
hey everypony
otakon you otakon17 or just otakon on steam?
Thousand year door is the best game ever

Dovah: Not cool, dude. Mental issues aren't something to joke about.:|

Pokemon song :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_411G29lfy4&feature=youtube_gdata_player
Zamer, wait what?

Zamer: its still sad though
Twewy doesn't need a sequel
$20 for it and the Phone/Pad is seperate games
No! No Eulshy. You don't just pop in here with a story and leave!
man square enix is really goin downhill
it's good enough as a standalone
Dat "Pokemon Crystal Battle Music"
Oh yeah... That Twewy mix edition
cachi01|mobile: Never found Lavender Town creepy.
^
Its meh
Hold on
well Crimson all the pieces were there, the creator hinting serveraly at wanting to do one, then we get TWEWY cast in KH:3DS

I find lavender town music. Soothing. I'm weird. :D

then we were given a 7day countdown timer which turned out to be just for the ports
lol. Dat tower.
I like hypnos lullaby
yeah i did like that the twewy cast was included to at least acknowledge them
PinkiePry i always enjoyed Lavender Town's music as well
It's just so calming. xD

I've heard enough This Day Aria remixes, IMO. To be honest, the song is better of being itself instead of a remix.
*off*

Good God.....who else thinks the Looney Tunes Show sucks!?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSiur8XNeiU&feature=BFa&list=PLC3AC72FED412E3B7
Dark92Enigma: The Loony Tunes Show had The Wizard
All arguements are invalid
Dark92Enigma: I actually kind of like it.
i meant The New Show
Dark92Enigma: do you mean a spinoff or the classic?
It stands for
superretroworld: the sitcom spinoff
Penis Man
Dark92Enigma: It's a good sitcom based off the old Looney Tunes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oe7Q8OCm5I
Behold
its glorious
oh, ive only seen alittle bit of it, and jokes were not funny
The Looney Tunes Show is a steaming pile of shit
THE Looney Toons Show? eh, different, but wouldn't call it garbage, just the jokes are pretty mature for a kids show
AJIsAwesome: I just watched an ep. That one with Daffy Bowling
Even if its not as "slap-sticky" as the old one.
/me throws a Mine Turtle into the chat
Unnr: I FREAKING LOVE THAT ONE.:D
/me steps on Mine Turtle
The new one with lola? I rather like that show.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bebSxF0rr5I who remembers this
/me explodes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDoS25kP2OQ&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397&index=19&feature=plpp_video
Lola is..... something
Yes... something
Unnr dear god, that intro animation
XD
well somepony get the mop Petrified_Discored isn't gonna clean himself
I have came to the conclusion The Loony Toons Show is an alternate universe to where the Loony Toons lost to the Mon-Stars in Space Jam and this was the result after major brainwashing
Zamer: OMG YES!
/me cleans himself
=o
What now, thelonepony :P
Zamer im watching it right now
Its hilarious
ponies?
Yes.
do me a favor and NEVER get facebook
AJIsAwesome: maybe i'm being too harsh with that show......but some episodes were dissapointing IMO.....the one i sorta liked was the one with Bugs and Daffy going to jail
horses?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSq8D_cQlog&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 I love this track for some reason
Everyone has different opinions, okay? Some people may not like what you like, but that doesn't mean you should insult their opinions.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BcmszvitGc How can you not like Lola?
are u nuts, i'm a horse!!
Hi everypony!
ello Kawaii_icybeauti
thelonepony: Are you sure?
I have a facebook but only because Mike
ey Dken2021
well also it depends on how much you grew with the characters
hai Kawaii _icybeauti
Ello Kawaii_icybeauti
hey thelonepony and HoodyNinja
lol
Rex_Mundi: I actually like the creepy stalker take they did with Lola.
ok
Spademagnes[R] i got an orgasm the first 5 seconds i listened to that
AJIsAwesome: I'm sorry......i just watched an ep, and ended up frustrated :(:'(
Zamer: http://www.fimfiction.net/blog/57742 :P
o.O
for me I can't stand the multple different cgi/art styles they did for the roadrunner segments
Lola, IMO shouldn't be a sex symbol like she was in Space Jam.
AJIsAwesome: Me too, I love that shes a cloud cookoolander too.
aight you fizz heads, I;m off to bed. Y'alll behave now, ya hear?
Daffy kissed Celestia?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc-YMUWvA1s
and don't get me started on the songs with Marvin
New Roadrunner sucks
But the looney toons show is awesome
Remind me.. who was Lola again?
By the way is it true that there's a WIZARD (the movie) themed episode
00,03Night y'all!
cachi01|mobile: Agreed.
Later Scoot-Scootaloo
take care scoots
Night scoot!
nitey night Scoot-Scootaloo
cya Scoot-Scootaloo
Marvin Martian http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUpm1mWe39I
night Scoots
00,03Qnd lola was the bunny that turned people into furries
Okay, I'll be back in a couple :P
^*
^^
So who's taking over now?
I thought we agreed Balto was the reason why people turned into furries
Scoot-Scootaloo: I tried to say something clever, but i derped
Scoot-Scootaloo pretty sure some disney animations helped
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 This is still my favorite boss theme ever
Scoot-Scootaloo: The face that launched a thousand furries XD
^^
Nope, Maid Marrian from the disney Robinhood
is the original ship that launched a thousand furries
well Maid Marrian was ...yea every kid fell in love with her
Spademagnes[R]: Ah...for the days when megaman -wasn't- on ios...
I got the derpy shirt today 1
Ok.....i'm sorry if i've been harsh with that show.......the thing is that i didn't like the episode i just watched.......so i unloaded my anger......
Kawaii_icybeauti: Sweet!
Unnr: That movie came out in 1973 though...kinda early for furries, don't you think?
Dark92Enigma: It's okay.
Spademagnes[R] stop giving me eargasms
but to Maid Marian's help she was a Vixen
AJIsAwesome: Hot topic also had crystal pony toys and pony keychains.
Mynstomach just made a dying whale noise
Speaking of Lola from the new show, here's the President's Day song:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN9a3WhCo-c
Dat song is hilarious lol
haha
ikr
Actually, Furries began back in the 80s a spin off of the phantasy and scifi fandoms, officially with a meating discussion of a character in a star trek comic. yes, Startrek created the furries.
AJIsAwesome: There were some good episodes, like the one with Bugs & Daffy going to jail and the one with Taz as a pet.....i cried with joy at the end......
Rex_Mundi lolwut...
Rex_Mundi: Sweet mother of Celestia...it was Q!
YES, Taz was a pet in one episode
the one where Daffy spent Porky money on a yatche was pretty funny
Let me repost that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN9a3WhCo-c
I think this is my new favorite nirvana song, thoguh it's a cover. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a79t3s5yig8&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=1&feature=plpp_video
Im BATMAN
Let's not forget the infamous Chickenhawk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX5-bfLg9r0&feature=related
Last one the link got screwed up
I don't really like the Taz as a bpet take, but I'll have to get used to it.
