and then there was the cartoonnetwork show
Ghosties: it Does sound like it, and i love sigur ros
As if. I'm not leaving.
11,01Yep.
Tom doesn't work in here?
Seriously though this movie was the most adorable movie I've ever seen. Possibly all because of toothless
Dragonborn/10
There is a huge pony episode marathon!
seriously, GTFO. 570 is way too many people
One of my favorite movies
Yeah, this is a great movie
ITS OVER 9000 out of 10
What language is this?
im half expecting the server wont be able to handle that much traffic
10000000000000000000000000 out of 10
04Sigur Ros is a good intro into post-rock
That awkward moment when you think +m is still on, and it isn't. xDD
IS the show any good?
but...I need sleep somehow
I cant wait for How to train your ponies.

Or he's just slow, whatever.
Azuredragon: Let me guess...it sucked.
Come for the dragons, stay for the ponies.
Toothless is a great creation.
Bring on the pony marathon
i love dragons but i also love ponies
Tovler|Drunk: pft wait til tomorrow
04Though I think there are far better post-rock groups out there
Meanwhile: I see Tom in this room.
Tovler|Drunk: wait til ponies tomorrow O_o
Give the noobs the 'Shoo be doo' diet

Jump: English there was an Icelandic bit
Jump: English
Yeah, I was NOT expecting Sigur Ros in a Hollywood movie.
11,01We're a capitalist country (still). Advertising drives our economy, so there's tons of it.
Spimds like Icelandic mixed with English.
Lol dragon.

You know what would be the absolutely worst thing we can see after this? Sintel
I need to pay more attention to the TV show now...I never noticed Hiccup with the missing leg, nor did I catch Toothless's bad tail.
DAVID PLAYED SPITELOUT.
oh interesting, I hear icelandic is a very difficult language
I see david tennant!!!
Buytoast: why is sonic in a car :S

Oh wow yeah!
If only adblock worked on tv channels.
Wow, David Tennant was in this movie
Whoo hoo! I LOVED The Jetsons!
Same for me, I saw Tom
some places have ponies like equestria
i knew jonah hill was in this
Tennant/10


04Post-rock is like that, it evokes really warm, awesome feelings of awesomeness
Yeah I see him but he was slow to respond.
IM THE DOCTOR!!!
It sure isn't over!
Who did David Tenant play?
I never even knew there was a TV show!
I got to go guys, it's 2:33 am over here
Best theme EVER!!!! :D

11,01DVRs can skip commercials I think.,
Ghosties: what other post-rock groups would you recommend?

For anypony who wants to play Minecraft later, hit me up I'll be on all night long
/me Loves The Credits Song Thats Playing Nao
fluttercry: Yeah, like all of them...
Meanwhile: I thought they were nothing but a cheap knockoff of the Flintstones. Especially in the Crossover. It wasn't made well for me.
Given that they were the same company I wouldn't really call them a knock off...
04Guys, please stick around if you can. We've got The Jetsons movie later, Suited for Success next, and the Ticket Master afterwards. Plus, we're doing a top 10 FiM mareathon later!!
jetsons movie is 5.2 on IMDB... not sure if
Also this movie could have bore 10-20 minutes without being indulgent. Its good, but I could name like 3 instances that could have used some expanded quiet emotion.
Rarely do cross-overs work. As a matter of fact, I don't thing they have ever worked on TV.
I am not leaving.
Remember they have blueberries so if your allergic or don't like wait until the banana ones are done
:)
More like, Flintstones...IN SPAAAAAAAAACE.
no episode now/
...Not...like Shrek the Third or Forever After...
I'll Be Here All Night <3
YAY JETSONS

I've only seen the first two Shrek movies. They were good, but I do hear Shrek 3 is real real bad.
Tovler|Drunk: Shrek 4...is worse...
if people want to listen to a good song while waiting go to mae awakening on youtube
<3
I haven't seem the Jetsons movie in years! I own it on VHS
Is it animated or live action?
:S
in the words of Scootaloo: IM STAYING UP ALL NIGHT!!!
1:38AM here in Scotland (aye, we be vikings!), but I'm sticking around!
Kanda|How2TameUrCat: will hate Jetsons: The Movie.
And I've heard mixed reviews on Shrek 4
ObLiCody: This movie event happens every Friday. The special marathon event we have after the movies will be five hours
Well, i was never a fan of Jetsons, but i'll give this movie a chance. Maybe it's one of those
:O
Ryu: animated.
<_<
ME TOO I MISS DERPY
im going to goo get some hot donuts brb
meh, something about dreamworks' style just doesnt let me experience any feels with their movies
what?
Ninoyiya_Ryu: Animated
0_0 there's a top 10 ponies later... God damn it's already half one in the morning... Do i want to pull an all nighter like i did for season 2? Yes, yes I do.
Tovler|Drunk: 3 was good, and 4 was good, but neither lives up to the first two
VenHur: I heard Shrek 4ever after was better.
haha, NiceDay, I think I heard that song on an animation once
SirGanjalf: all i can remember from that movie is out dated CGI
I would stay up, but I have a party to attend tomorrow after ponies.
Come on credits.
*-"so-bad-that's-good" movies.
DERPY! NOW!6_9:P
Go away.
Ohhhhh, okay I thought that they made a live action version
WHO WANTS DOUNUTS
4 was better
bronies are best fans
I'm not a big Dreamworks guy, but they hit it out of the park with this movie.
dounuts :D
Yeah, I agree, 4 was better...
derpyderpderpderp1: duh
SirGanjalf: Like babes in toyland?
I'm gonna watch the Discord version of the "See you out there" scene from TNG's final Episode "All Good Things..."
i heard a ping, did someone need me?
BlazeAngel: you still dont have + hat on :D
Really? I was thinking of hitting the sack early since the premier's at 3PM.
cool Jump, i think its a great song
Such a beautiful soundtrack :)
Sticks and Stones.
oyi im going to have to get used to the faces
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Oh, it was made in CGI era? ...:|
Dr_Fumbles: Well, Shrek 1 was overrated and shrek 2 was almost too good.
flutterlove123: meh
thelonepony: Shaddup.
I thought 3 and 4 were stories that didn;t have to be told
...Speaking of, is it me? Or it is the 3 movies that is always the bad ones of the bunch?
kodak
hot hot hot
also turning the dragon into a kitten was cheap, might as well just play kitten videos from youtube
hot food
2010?
okay :>
OH GOD TRIXIE FACE X_X!?
SirGanjalf: yes, like just when it was becoming so
YAY PONIES

MALLL!
Elroy didn't have any friends
what I like abnout this is that theyre not singing the song, it's more like the family is listening to the radio. Not bad movie. Not bad.
Interesting steering wheel - 3 buttons

;_;
05,15I met him for 30 seconds!
Just call Cosmo to go over to the mall.
Total drama space
Shizuka: and forgetful about his dad FAILING TO GET TO THE GAME!

Shizuka: THEREFORE...........the game was a BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT
HARVEST MORE MINERALS
04"Here's some more CGI for our time!!"
Still better CGI than Titanic 2

A fantastic movie rendered in real time on a Playstation One.
Get a room, love birds. :D

fluttercry: I think she's pissed she got a random date with some big name singer and had to miss that once in a lifetime chance
05,15Wait...did she switch sides in the car?
Zerg Rush!!!!
And that wonderful pan shot ate up the entire animation budget of this movie
So 3 Dimensinol.
So NEW JERSY
It's not a Big Lipped Alligator Moment. It's mentioned after the scene
is this Sonic CD?
dat 90s cgi!
Dimensional.
2200
the CGI at the time was amazing
Then again this was in 1990 so the Cgi being weird is excusable.
fluttercry: they keep doing that
13century 2200, SUCH ORIGINAL JOKES
lol century 2200
According to a wiki entry, George previously worked one hour a day, two days a week.
Seriously. The cel animation is bugging me more than the CGI
intergalactic what states?
It just looks silvery and bland. Not fun at all.
wut
pfft, furniture
Rhomega, you mean the whole dancing on random song?
Shizuka: therefore, i'm wrong with the YEAR 3000
looks like a giant kiddie tube gym
13WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING YOUR OWN FURNITURE
Aren't The Jetsons supossed to be.....funny?
Where's everything.
