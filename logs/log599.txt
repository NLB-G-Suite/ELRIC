it's scary that i might actually be accurate
01,11Huh...that's TWO songs where they reference Newton...
08,01it's all vapid and vacuous crap that plays like it's been put together by a 15 year old
Saturn: You didn't see the airing last night did you? There are a LOT of best parts.
Saturn: The best part is watching hey ocean interviews instead.
needs more Indan Stallone
my ears are bleeding
Saturn: for some reason everyone loves it
Saturn: not me tho
08,01maybe i'll be back in it's third hour
08,01*its
i just got earcancer
suddenly: celtic rhytms?
Pfft
This film is brilliant
Saturn: its just terminator at that point
04Chitti is right
still great works being made, of course, but yeah
...or Kollywood
08,01Chitti: no, i just don't like bollywood movies. they remind me of how much i hate indian culture.
01,11Now you sound straight up racist.
Grapes are pretty sour though
no, he's part indian
hate
lol
damn this location looks nice
oh, thanks
08,01Chitti: it's from being exposed to a lot of it growing up
Kinda is
yeah, kinda
i understand regular people act like that but not a MOD .......
/me dies on the inside
wanting to change a culture because it's different is racist, simply disliking is not, unless you lack respect for it as well.
01,11It is when you let that opinion stem into hate that revolves around anything related to the subject.
Saturn if you dont like i why you sill here:)?
I agree with Saturn on this.
stop please
ît only starts getting racist if you think of others being inferior du to... well, race
hai, good afternoon everyone
08,01as in, i don't think it's wrong, or they shouldn't have a culture. it's just not to my personal taste.

08,01oh, alright, i'll stay for a while longer
08,01it does look like it's picking up
I'm not into Bollywood either, but i find this movie surprisingly enjoyable. Despite it being 3 hours long.
Hypocrite
Saturn: why do they keep switching to english from time to time?
XD
Saturn, be warned there's a lot of musical numbers
Roboda~
08,01but i just want to be clear that i'm not anti-indian culture; i just don't personally like it
Chorus is best

Saturn, understood.
01,11Saturn: The story isn't anything innovative, but it is certainly interesting.
Mebbe

But truth needs to come out =P
It might seem strange to you, but it's not there.
I blame the people taking pictures of her
04Just because it's fine here doesn't mean that it's okay in other cultures
Nakedness, could be avoided by giving her a simple cloth before photos, this claim is invalid
08,01not everywhere is like that in india, but that community looked like a very... old-world one
That's really sad, honestly.

11,02>has robots

that part of the community

01,11It's a traditional culture, hence, they took it real seriously.
>Bollywood.
08,01there are a lot of them in india, and they take religion, their culture, and their social status very seriously
08,01remember that in that kind of community, there is a cast system in place

08,01it may seem odd to them in the west, but it's perfectly reasonable for them

04Keep in mind that India is technically a democracy, too
04So Saturn could be very well right

04It could have just been an old world community
I am quite aware of the caste system. I agree that it is completely wrong.
Saturn: reasonable, or just normal/acceptable?
01,11Montage, but not a music vid.
Saturn I understand....But it's just so...insane to blame the rescueer
04Because most of India is very Western

The thing is, there's a difference between different cultures and a culture that divides people into classes and targets one side for oppression. Castes, Social Justice, these things are wrong.

OVER THE LINE
OVER THE LINE!
01,11Yknow, when this episode first starts with the shot of AB, I keep thinking it's a fan-made thing. XD Don't know if that's a compliment on the fandoms artists or an insult on the show...
I've never gotten over one time where I got my finger caught in the ball and introduced my face to the lane.
lebowski:D
lol
dat Walter
STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERIKE
Whenever I go to the bowling lane, I try to spend as much time as I can in the arcade section.
stupid earth ponies
01,11*used to be in a bowling league*
Walter Sobchak is best pony
I haven't bowled in over 10 years! Yaha!
But come to think of it, that's a bad idea, since I can't even have the time to play the games anyway.
01,11flutter_spin: There's a national and international bowling league. I actually had the option to go to Australia for mine...
AUSTRALIA!
i luv my little pony ^_^

Rarity's passion is not gems...it is beauty. Thus her job as fashionista, and abilities when it comes to finding gems. She is attracted to beauty, and she has great skill at drawing out beauty.
