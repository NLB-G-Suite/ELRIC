01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: After Scott defeats Roxy, the fourth evil ex, he can be briefly seen wearing a shirt with the Fantastic Four logo on it in the next scene at band practice. It is the only time in the movie he wears a number other than "zero." The shirt also has a very small '1/2' written into the logo, making him 4.5, which director Edgar Wright stated on the DVD commentary was
1,11a reference to Scott reaching the brink of becoming yet another Evil Ex.

Even though Applejack is the least developed character, she's my favorite. Why do people dislike an episode for an undeveloped character if it adds more character to them.

Actually, how does a pony rodeo even work? Do the ponies ride other ponies? Ponies riding bulls?
clap clap clap*
Even though Applejack is the least developed character, she's my favorite. Why do people dislike an episode for an undeveloped character if it adds more character to them.
Last Roundup/10
Hi bronystate.
:)
Derpy/10

Silverstick: becuase rarity is STUPID PONEH!
DERPY/10
Silverstick: she needs all her magic just to keep herself sane.
hai FillyFlam
she cant use the amount of magic as twilight do
Silverstick: her magic is fashion based. moving carts is not fashionable
Raincloud/10
11,02INTERMISSION TIEM
@Silberstick fuck logic! :D
Silverstick: she doesnt seem to be as powerful as twi
Silverstick: No energy? :s
Dark92Enigma : oh that cancer episode :/
04Because people like to joke that AJ is a background pony or some nonsense
:)
love this song
04But AJ is always best mane pony. Always.
Dark92Enigma: I want a Rarity/Dash episode where Rarity still holds a grudge for that :D
Woohooo
more mlp? :)
GUYS ENJOY THIS INTERMISSION WHILE IT LST
CAUSE THE B MOVIE IS LONG
dat monty python
Silverstick, maybe her magic doesn't work like that
AJ is pretty well developed: she just isn't that complex.
WARNING
huh?
But it is a good B movie
THE B MOVIE IS 155 MINUTES LONG
moar dings

I got myself Batman Arkham City Collector's edition :3
k
first time I bought a game twice
OHH YEHAH
Is it the one that was on this morning
OK......everypony, a little question: Somepony told me AVGN reviewed Scott Pilgrim............IS THAT TRUE? and if so......can we stream such review? PLEASE :(
:O
Kandarihu: there are like 10 musical numbers that are at least 3 mins long. that plus all the unnecesary fight fillers and talk fillers and such
(if that's ok with you)
once was in sale with arkham asylum and all the expansion of arkham city
twilight_sprinkle: its like 3 hours long :|
Dark92Enigma: So i herd you like scott pilgrim...
and the other as half-price in collector's edition
c
Technically, this isn't Bollywood. It's from another film industry in India called Kollywood.
As long as the movie is, it could actually still be going (or at least at the pony episode) by the time I get back from my walk
Crono_brony: Crono-trigger related name?
twilight_sprinkle, fight fillers and talk fillers?
Kandarihu: XD
Yeah it started at 9 and ended at like 12:30

01,11Pony 2: Baby Cakes (MrChang). We look forward to seeing you there!
Kandarihu: yeah. there were two identical scenes with loud music, several poitnless fight scenes, two rape attempts,
Crono_brony: I heard its awesome.

NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS

Fallout is best on computer, when the inevitable Bethesda bugs come, console fixes most of them
Dat random english
Dark_Horst: it's not a cost thing, it's a "Can my PC run it?" thing. From what I've seen it SHOULD be able to run it fine on medium settings

Fallout graphics don't, but their PCB load is pretty heavy
Chitti: Also, what happened to the movie trivia for this movie?

Okay, NOW we have a musical number.
Kandarihu, it has Indian propaganda written all over it.
then music?
Big lippped alligator moment
Wish You Were Here.jpeg
I started playing Fallout in 1999 I think. It's my favourite RPG game ever made, it ruined JRPG for me
suddenly: music video
Lucid dream there, guy.
08,01okay, i think i've had about as much of this film as i can stand
08,01time for work
indian guitars look just like ours
01,11PONY: Please explain this to me...
08,01see y'all
pony, what propaganda?
xD
This is to silly
08,01CriticKitten: it's bollywood! there *are* no best parts!
it's scary that i might actually be accurate
science love song is best song
otby the way, if you ever wanna upgrade your oc, consider switching to geforce graphics card. they're just better^^
01,11Huh...that's TWO songs where they reference Newton...
how is this even a B movie?!?!?
08,01it's all vapid and vacuous crap that plays like it's been put together by a 15 year old
dat dance
needs more Indan Stallone
my ears are bleeding
^^
08,01eh, i'm not a fan
The effects in the final battle climax are really good
Grapes in Honey > Peaches & Gravy
08,01maybe i'll be back in it's third hour
08,01*its
i just got earcancer
I play on buying a new gcard soon, probably nVidia, but not sure what brand
Chitti, second is the random clips of nice stuff in between this scenes... like this one
suddenly: celtic rhytms?
Pfft
Spoiler: she can sing like Fergie
Yo boys, I am sing song.
This film is brilliant
Soup Song
04Chitti is right
well, im gone
04Some really good stuff is indie work
Chitti: indeed, Hollywood kinda went stale in the 90s- sort of
Chitti, then the hypnotizing dance
still great works being made, of course, but yeah
Chitti word up :)
There ARE a lot of awesome parts. This is just the low point of the movie for those of us who aren't into Bollywood.
Chitti, Bollywood has it's reputation
I'm not a huge fan of the long songs, but this film is really awesome.
...or Kollywood
08,01Chitti: no, i just don't like bollywood movies. they remind me of how much i hate indian culture.
i never thought i would say this but, THANK YOU BUFFER. THANK YOU SO MUCH
grapes in honey? that's fucking disgusting
too sweet
Kandarihu: What's Kollywood?
01,11Now you sound straight up racist.
Flyboy you lucky bastard
Grapes are pretty sour though
no, he's part indian
hate
lol
RoboGanjalf, the Tamil counterpart to Bollywood.
damn this location looks nice
oh, thanks
08,01Chitti: it's from being exposed to a lot of it growing up
Chitti, disliking a culture is not racist.
dis coversation. /me thinks twice before picking a black B movie
Kinda is
yeah, kinda
04Bruce Campbell said it best: Hollywood blockbusters, so called "A" movies are actually B movies these days while true works of originality and inventive ideas come straight from indies
08,01hey, i'm allowed to like and not like what i want to. it's not racist to have an opinion of a culture.
i understand regular people act like that but not a MOD .......
/me dies on the inside
^^
Ghosties: <3 indie
wanting to change a culture because it's different is racist, simply disliking is not, unless you lack respect for it as well.
stop please
08,01okay, maybe hate was the wrong word. dislike is a better word
04And let's hold on for one second, I don't like the emo or hipster cultures...does that make me bad?
ît only starts getting racist if you think of others being inferior du to... well, race
if only death would come quickly
hai, good afternoon everyone
08,01as in, i don't think it's wrong, or they shouldn't have a culture. it's just not to my personal taste.
hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
xD
Ghosties: And it still feels cheesy as a water bottle filled with dairy milk lactose!
Anyway, back to the film
oh gosh this part
Screwdriver
Ghosties, according to the ignorance here... YES.
Oh....my....celestia....its THIS film...
dat cop
01,11Then why did you call this movie utter crap when it's merely up to your personal taste? there's a huge difference tehre.
is worst cop
silly literal robot
xD
Shitty
Its about to get EPIC in here
08,01i mean, it's very much a personal thing, because it reminds me of the things i don't like about my mother, who is indian. but i don't really want to go into that right now.
when i see JB, i want to break out my fluttershy, where fluttershy is a machete
Playstation
PS?
Chitti, calling something utter crap IS an opinion
04Oh god, he's Pinkie Pie

This is so weird
thats so hard to notice
:D Knew it!
Einstein and Isaac Newton in pop music? Yep, this is a foreign film.
That is totally possible.
Vivix: Nothing is too weird, just further from the track =3
Chitti: what would BMC do though?
Everyone knows Battlefield Leverage is best film we'll ever show
I'm still not sure what BMC means.
Hehehe
woohoo random mines

But yeah, the ending blows all of this out of the water.

Oh for fuck sake....

OH what the
lmao pwnt.

omg
bai CCCP
GO DIE
THANK YOU
08,01oh right, this
...
>.>
this is so wrong
04HAHAHAHA
naked>dead
04OH LAWDY
I didn't mean it...
NO HE HASN"T
that was her fault
Not litterally...
08,01okay, so in india, they take reputation very seriously
I'm insensitive to other cultures so I find this bullshit and illogical.
yh she just commited suicide bc she was naked in public
GOD DAMN IT, STUPID GIRL!
01,11SB64: SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS HIS SKELETAL FORM LOOKS LIKE A BLACK GUY!
oh
Quick interview the dead girl
11,02SHAMEFURDISPWAY
08,01there are things that are taboo, like for a woman to be seen naked
Chitti: it really does
Chitti: Oh no it totally does.
11,02Chitti: :P
08,01it's considered so shameful that they would be disowned by their families
Chitti: Agreed
If only Chitti just let her die in the fire, she wouldn't have been humiliated.
Chitti, it looks indian imo
04You uh...you can't exactly teach a machine culture
It's stupid goddammit
Kandarihu: Culture. Go figure.
her suicide?
SuperBrony64: You are so random! :D
08,01Deadlypon3: you don't understand. she would have been ostracised from her community. she'd have to live as an outcast, basically.
May I show something SO wrong here, it's a historical image
08,01WRITEity: basically, yes
she didnt commit suicide. she ran out in trafic like a dumbass
Meh, cultural difference.
04Deadlypon3, culture is different
11,02You can teach a machine how to look like Martin Lawrence :3
It most likely might mean a ban
DAT FIRE WAS A SPY
01,11Think of it as complete and utter public humiliation for your entire life.
Impossibru
That was helluva culture shock...
But truth needs to come out =P
It might seem strange to you, but it's not there.
I blame the people taking pictures of her
04Just because it's fine here doesn't mean that it's okay in other cultures
It is the girls fault she's dead. THE END.
Exactly what dari said.
Chitti: still stupid
Nakedness, could be avoided by giving her a simple cloth before photos, this claim is invalid
01,11It actually makes perfect sense to me.
08,01not everywhere is like that in india, but that community looked like a very... old-world one
That's really sad, honestly.
08,01a traditional community
11,02>old world
04Though
11,02>has robots
3rd world
>film
that part of the community
:P
01,11It's a traditional culture, hence, they took it real seriously.
>Bollywood.
08,01there are a lot of them in india, and they take religion, their culture, and their social status very seriously
no it don't or you would have get her a dress before saving her Chitti
Chitti: About this whole "nude = not going to live"
08,01remember that in that kind of community, there is a cast system in place
sell it on eBaY
dates are delicious
08,01*caste
argh stupidity!
Meanwhile: INB4 manup.jpg later
dates>raisins
I'm pretty sure all the fabric in the entire place was on fire anyway
Chitti you made a mistake , put all these people back in the burning building and start over
On offense, but cultural differences isn't a good enough justification for ostracizing a person for being naked when their house caught fire.
so he wants to give an allpowerful robot to the army so it can kill people? sounds smart
*no offense
08,01it may seem odd to them in the west, but it's perfectly reasonable for them
So unless she wanted to wear some burning drapes and die horribly, she didn't have much of a choice.
dari: Inb4 a thousand "Wat" lightbulb.
so much buffer
08,01*us in the west
so much goddamn buffer
Sup
04Keep in mind that India is technically a democracy, too
music vid time?
04It could have just been an old world community
I am quite aware of the caste system. I agree that it is completely wrong.
01,11Montage, but not a music vid.
will this movie have any english :P:P6_9
04Because most of India is very Western
:P
Oh WOW, Trying to make a robot feel emotions.
/me nods.
therainbowvortex: it has smal bits of it :P
Movies almost always blame the wrong guy
08,01Ghosties: from a lifetime of growing up with that kind of crap, and having been there myself twice, i can say with a reasonable amount of certainty that i know what i'm talking about
It's still so sad. :(
read all the books!!!
:|
04Then I would have to agree with you
software hormones!
so much buffer
Michael: BOOKS!
Hey twilight_sprinkle thats how you read books
Software hormones
pony!
it would have been preferable to drop her in the middle of nowhere that happened to have cloth
Hey Poneh :P
moar books
horse!
I find it harder to understand why everyone is having difficulty understanding the whole "other culture" thing than the actual event.
[Scootaloo]: yeah, im a robot too :3
hai Poneh
Culture shock, that is all. Move along people.
o.o
dat lightning
Lightning rod.
Random...
Chitti: It's not about understanding. It's about valuing chastity over human life.
out of nowhere
01,11He just got the Johnny 5 treatment.
Lighting
and then DEUS EX MACHINA!
04OH SHI
LITERALLY!
Now that's some cultural SHOCK
Speaking of culture shock...
04He never asked for this, dammit!
I did it first :3
./)_< twilight_sprinkle
heheh
They can rebuild him
dose this mean just gessing it will go rouge
08,01aye; i don't agree with it, but it's there, and it happens. it's the same sort of basis for "mercy killings", like when a girl is in love with someone of the "wrong" caste, and her father kills her
They have the technology...
Ghosties: he wasn't prepared for this
okay is anyone else getting constant buffers?
it needs love
Deadlypon3: >whitty oneliner
08,01this *actually* happens, and it's horrifying
is it just me or is this movie very cliché
:D
Rikku: it is
MarePlayUK: aye
Rikku: very, very cliche. this is just the beginning
01,11Rikku: as I said, nothing innovative in it. But it's just so f*cking awesome.
Ligthning gave him feeels
so yeah, hit your toaster with a lightning to make it experience emotion
well back to my dashie
So, is everyone else getting constant lag?
then emotions!!
otakon: Nope
OH SNAP
"You're not my real dad!"
He mad
08,01anyhoos, enough of that. if anyone wants to continue discussion of this, we can do so elsewhere, but i think we should move on in here
01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: Pretty much. XD
otakon no one else is ever lagging when you are.
I'm not and I have my torrent running
otakon: ever.
No lag here, on my terrible 0.67mbps
:O
MY GOD.
Shit just got real
oh god. destroy it before it's too late!
otakon: not once has it ever happened.
11,02So wait...did they kill the girl for being naked?
SuperBrony64: ...
:'(
thanks for the info though
Wut SB
SuperBrony64: she killed herself
No, she just ran in front of a car.
Weren't you watching?
haha
01,11SB64: technically...she killed herself.
04And now after he walks through nature he becomes a human, awwwwwwwwwww
Vivix: okay the FUCK then. are you sure it's .67? run a speedtest please and share it
otakon: It's just you. Forever. Always. Until the sun consumes the galaxy and the eternal darkness blankets the universe, only you have lag.
I have bullcrap NC internet and I'm not getting lag.
SuperBrony64: she ran away in humiliation and was hit by a truck.
04Will he cry, too?
11,02Oh
She went ahead and killed herself for being rescured to live another day
SuperBrony64: like that scene in Mean Girls
Chitti: How can you be here and in a film at the same time? You sure are amazing :3
Suddenly babby
11,02I didn't know :/
04Does he cry real tears?
yeah I'll run a speedtest, last speedtest was 0.67
This part...
wtf
Vivix: I'm usually get 2.00 mbps and goddammit I'm getting lag
which reminds me, we should watch Mean Girls around here some time.
01,11MarePlayUK: Swag. that's how.
it will be lower now that I'm streaming while taking it
AFK
The thing is, there's a difference between different cultures and a culture that divides people into classes and targets one side for oppression. Castes, Social Justice, these things are wrong.
we moved from central area to rural area, and internet is absolutely HORRIBLE
This is why she shouldent have cheated -.-
inb4 doctor robot

Seriously, Mean Girls for A Movie!

Lol Ghosties
Aww, they are dumping electronic waste, bad people
Yeah, real smart not do make sure he was dead...
Well, robots can't go rogue..so I guess..this is needed
I can read that, it said "Trashyerd" in hindi
Ghosties: oh God that horrible line
Chitti: HE DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM
my grammer is sucking today -_-;
Vasiri having an obligatory salvaging moment with the roboda.
Chitti: to be fair, it's Vasiri's fault for giving him the ability to love.
suddenly english
How about... a simple format and incideration, instead of that.
Well, if he could disobey, he could kill people
And then military found him and made Skynet
Chitti: He was to one who gave him feelings...
Chitti: he was a once in FOREVER thing that he made and he killed him basically
he wasn't just a machine

Lil_B: How day you suggest they ruin their artistic vision by getting high?
Dark92Chitty: I thought that was the Mosquto scene?
PONY: WTH is what?
Most of the film's budget was the opening CGI scene and their travel budget.
I can easily imagine a techno remix of this song.
Dark92Chitty: But this also qualifies...
...
that song
GilDash|Busy, do you happen to have the stream open?
And blatant euphamism.
I have your skin instrument... its not unlike a flute

08,01techno king kong
Wait a minute guys, we gotta stop hyping up the ending. Even though we're not even spoiling it, I'm worried that we're raising Ghosties' expectations to such a degree that he'll be disappointed by anything.
And now it gets even realer.
that'S right, completely ignore the hostage and keep shooting
erm... she isn't ded?
AWWWWWWW YEEEAAAAAHHHH
lol
yeah she's IN THE CAR
GET REDY
Epic Swag Incoming!
o shit
Chitti: i knew youd say that, and no. the matrix actually explained how Neo did the impossible, as for the irl machines, they just had a float unit, thats the only unreal thing about it, and its more scifi than unreal
uh oh
and they're SHOOTING THE FUEL TANK
Can't wait for "Endhiran: Reloaded"
1000 millions guns
AIM AT THE CAR

:O
multiple automatic weapons -> no one hits the girl o-O
All the guns at once
oh shit

08,01otakon: no, the bare clip
I take back what I said about evil not having swag.
dat terminator scene
No blue eye
and terminator
01,11this movie explains it as well. ALL of Chitti's abilities center around his electro-magnetic technology, which have been amped up to 11 with his upgrade.
not triple wield like mega uber duper wielding
WWWAAZUUUUPPP
Best song Ever
RED EYE
11,02Best part yet? :3
Ghosties: wait...

Best part? It's only just started
08,01so who here doesn't get the diwali joke?
Bitch please.
SuperBrony64, not yet
Well, it's FUNNY, but it's terrible
Problem: guns aren't magnetic. Neither are the vast majority of motor cycles.
I dont
08,01diwali is the hindu festiaval of ligh
08,01*light
oh yeah the insanity has only begun
Because he's about to light them up?
Even then, magnets don't work anywhere near that way.
00,10whole last hour is best part
08,01they set off loads of fireworks
08,01and there's fire and stuff
Yeah, shit gets better from here.
YOU GUYS WANTED A MURDER MACHINE NOW YOU GOT ONE! SO MUCH HYPOCRICY IN THIS MOVIE
08,01lots of light
i like how 2.0 is still playing
Chitti: only the magnetic stuff. what about how he changed his hair?
Vordox: good point

08,01GUN
LMAO
Ghosties, maybe it would be better if you stop trying to rank each scene by it's awesomeness and just follow the story. So what if that chase scene isn't as awesome as the mosquito scene? It's awesome in it's own right.
GUN
best currency
Best payment option right thur
Women = Cause of all mayhem =P
gun is best money... wait
we need guns,lots of guns
Gun is best credit card
that will be 9001 guns please
gun is best currency
Cash or credit? GUN!
take all the shoes!
Bitches, PUH-LEEAAASE!
that shopping
Vordox: Ind33d
take ALL the things!
04Because everyone's like OH IT'S GONNA BE THE VERY BEST THING EVER
I pay in gun all the time
Yeah-
04You were right, people hyped it up too much
01,11twilight_Sprinkler: It was a wig. He could have easily been given the option to style it however he wanted to maintain that "Humanoid" aspect.
Ghosties: Hyping = Benefits with doubts
wait this was the climax?
cash and credit can kiss my ass! Chitti pays with gun!
Kamsko: It's over 8000. 9001 is not enough!
Vivix: no
problem?
WHAT?!?!
ouchies
Oh good
and then SWAG bending
Vivix nowhere close
Theres no way it can be right
http://derpy.me/8LZki
Chitti: ..how, how do you style hair like he did? thats not magnetism
just watch
is he building a speceship? I have no Idea what he is doing!
He just shook his head and it changed
Ghosties: Pfft, we hyped it up because it's so ridiculously over the top, just wait.
NOT THE NAVY
It's well, this movie is anything but serious or well thought out
Ghosties, the best part is still comming up
Dat rocket
twilight_sprinkle, metal filaments for hair, perhaps?
well… shit
well that's that
The end.
08,01fuck, india
not a bright idea to be driving in trucks with canisters on them, whilst the police (with guns) are on you.
Michael bay approves
Chitti has been stopped
08,01you arm your coastguards well
It's like those TV action seriies where noothing makes sense, not even the plot
Kandarihu: but what about the colors and such
Anyone know when its done?
Never miss with india, the coast guard is HARDCORE
DUDNUDNDUND
I still love how unrealistic this movie is
lol that music
That's not him
indian coast guard... watch out for rockets
08,01why the hell would a coastguard need a missile?
TheMonstaMuffin later. Much later.
TheMonstaMuffin: about another 30 minutes

OH SHIT

Cataclysm: always a bad sign
01,11You ever see how a balloon interacts with your arm hair? that's static electricity. workable for a complex machine like Chitti
otakon Okay :/

Chitti: that only works if theres a balloon above your head
head shot
Ew. Mac.
out of control? BIG FUCKING SURPRISE
Chitti: to be fair, that doesn't explain the different color and length
01,11Twilight: Did you forget that the company was attempting to build the army int he first place?

twilight_sprinkle, the most important difference was in the Neuro Schema that Bohra was never able to get working.
DUDE
fail
oh bad idea
CR65536 is maximum!
very VERY bad idea
should have just slit her throat then and there
08,01by your command
01,11Twilight: He built one. that one and he built another and so on. As Chitti explains. they built them based off of the Professor's technology, which was only missing Chittie's mind scheme
uh
HEADSMASH.

SPLAT! Like a watermellon....
:O

and SPLAT!

Weird, he had his head during the scene with the body :P

08,01Tovler: go for it
Hmm, One Winged Chitty 1-part grenadine, 1 part dark rum, 1 part cinnamon schnapps, do as a bomb in a glass of kingfisher, but rim the beer glass with curry powder?
Messy.

Vordox: He sure did.

Oh...
/me splays recording of Meanwhile

twilight_sprinkle: The professor had pre-built most of them.
"A seven nation army can't hold me back"
shana: thanks

Ghosties: that's one chitti army
Kandarihu: EMPEROR
04If they all break out in song, I will acquiesce and say that it's the best thing ever
nuke them from orbit it's the only way to be sure
lol
This army is totally...*Puts on shades* Chitti.
We said it gets better. We meant it gets better.
Ghosties wait for it.
LAWL Ghosties :D
lol Ghosties
those who advertised this cliche... we are still missing a good Chitti to fight all the others
lol Ghosties
CriticKitten: i alrdy said that those robots were completely different
I like Chitty's jacket. Tis badass.
Nice place XD
00,10Ghosties, later
thats quite a chitti army
An army of swag bots
so...100 Chitti's is like a standing army of 100,000 men?
they're all slighlty different height
Chitti. Chitti. BANG BANG.
then she wants sex
holy shit
need imperial march
use orbital friendship cannon
Ghosties: In that case, GOOD NEWS EVERYONE.
Actually, CRs. Chitti is no longer Chitti but instead Citti Reproduced. C.R.!
"Me... me... me..."
SEXY TIEM
Ghosties: that would be awesome
otakon best math
candied rose petal ripped up and sprinkled in the beer, instead of the curry powder?
Vivix: extra's but what are you gonna do?
"SO WOMEN NOW YOU GOT THE WHOLE WORLD YOU HAPPY NOW?! ""No"
O.O
WTF
hehehe
01,11...what part of "He doubled up and used the company's already made robots" didn't you get? Twilight, the point is that you're doing whatever you can to discredit this film simply because YOU don't like it. I'm sure if we sat down and watched the Matrix movies I could spend hours pointing out plot holes. I'm ending this now.
Canadian_Brony: 100 x 100 right?
So the only odd number is 1.
"In ALL ASPECTS."
why the rest of the aint jealous
all aspects? do you have a dick?
Chitti: youre making it personal because you cant prove your point.
luv this movie
otakon yeah . . . oh my gawd
The movie is pretty dumb, plot and cont wise, but it's still funny
suddenly robot baby births
is my math wrong?
01,11I just proved my points.
Robosapiens.
Go ahead my evil robot offspring!~
Chitti, where is a good Chitti to fight the rest of them?
08,01HERA!
robot sapiens
Chitti: that's basicall what twilight_sprinkle does for every argument.
evolution?
01,11You keep rejecting them and replacing it with a different complaint
Chitti: Yeah, what WRITEity said. Don't waste your time.
:O
cum
oh god
08,01but he can't do that! a human-cylon hybrid needs *love*!
twilight_sprinkle: The professor had a large stock of robots, and the earlier scene clearly showed Chitti was using those as his framework.
lol, baby
Chitti: i can say the same thing, you dont want to accept that the movie is too ridiculous to be good for being awesome
CUM
more human machine love? I get Flashbacks to Metropolis again >.<
and she did
cum cum cum
she came
xD
oh
and she died
awkward.
I really don't like this Chitti
And she came
Did he just call himself the king?
cum cum cum cum
Bad time
11,02Dat haircut
wtf
lol
she didn't came\
Chitty just tried to load the bruce_Campbell module, but it was corrupted
08,01why
I do believe that confirms his status as Elvis.
she came?
I was wrong
08,01why, oh WHY
twilight_sprinkle: He built robots with a robot factory
So implausible
The movie is too ridiculous to be GOOD, but it's funny. I would never rate this with plot heavy movies that I already love
math off the top of my head
Smart....
always time for a haircut
08,01is *this* the correct time for a haircut?
Elvis Terminator Sithlord indeed.
08,01oooh
08,01i see
it is
08,01he's disguising himself

I'm a idiot, it's equal to a standing army of 10,000

otakon: You had that grammatically right the first time...
cant a robot read bodyheat or something?
lol
Noob709: it's just the translators not doing it right
what in celestia are we watching
can someone tell me the name of this movie? :)
its chitti chitti bang bang
01,11I never said it wasn't rediculous. I'm saying that your nit-picking is countered by a lot of the explinations. If you want to say that it's outlandish and over-the-top, then I agree, but the "Plot holes" you're pointing out are actually covered in this movie and thus it's not as bad as you make it out to be.
And suddenly monkeys
....wait.
stock chimpanzee shounds
oh
lol this started as something cpmpletely else
PONY: yeah but why bother? they don't switch to special vision modes unless they have to
He's replacing unit 42?
The most amazing thing ever. That's what we're watching.
No matter how many films their are saying not to build machines or they'll rebel against the creator. PEOPLE STILL DO IT! WTF?!

....is that a coincidence or did the film just blow my mind with a Hitchhiker's referenece?
*reference
Chitti: to TS, anything he doesn't immediately understand is a plot hole
This movies does a pretty decent attempt at covering plotholes.
ICE CREAM!
Endhiran. Apparently it's due to get BMC.
WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM
WRITEity: Or personal.
CriticKitten: coincedence i think.
wait, SHE'S ALIVE?
NOW SCREAM :D
Quick_Thinker: uhh thanks
i know right
String_Shredder: Nooo, you leave davy jones out of this
WRITEity: When was the last time we had this argument with him?
Ain't no party like an Ice Cream Party
>Eat all the Ice Cream! So that no other CR may eat it!
Chitti: the only actualy explanation is "science", which is a pretty cheap explanation. magnetic fields arent as easy to manipulate as you think
otakon: I think so too, but it's a HILARIOUS coincidence.
"Psst, it's me, Leclerc!"
spike:
Reikim: couple weeks ago I think?
LAWL
THAT CHITTI IS A SPY!
"I speak 32 languages" "very English Good"
Owned
oh come on
hey everypony!
any danish here
hi Allegr0
01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: Science that's actually EXPLAINED in the film. And isn't that the EXACT SAME explination used in the Matrix movies?
laaaaaame
hi
Man, he's so emo for her.
Allo Allegr0.
^
WOMAN FOR GOD SAKE
WRITEity: Which movie was it? He was pretty vitriolic about it...
true love
Canadian_Brony yo
08,01if it bleeds, we can kill it
hai Allegr0
He did that a butter knight? King of emos
twilight_sprinkle: they've got a robot that feels emotion so it having super powerful electro magnetic generators isn't aht much more far-fetched in comparison
People occasionally claim that anime makes no sense, even though it often relies on plot holes that are intentionally created from the beginning and then filled in later in the story.
Reikim: can't remember.
Er skandinaver her
Better love story than twilight.
ALL DEM CHITTIS
disturbance in the forc... grid
04And now two Chittis will fight?
Chitti: they just said it was magnets. in matrix the point was that they lived in an artificial world with bendable rules
oh no...
CR 42? Your human emotions are going off.
twilight_sprinkle: If you're asking for the science behind the electro magnets, you might as well ask for the science behind the fact they have robots
POW! Haha!
OH NO!
It's sci-fi for a reason
Ghosties: more like Vasiri will try not to get murdered by Chitti
Because it doesn't exist
otakon: which reminds me, being hit by lightning and then emotions?
Electromagnets totally exist...
March of the chitties.
And isn't explainable in that sense.
ded
he forgets the problem
aww yeah
xD
But they don't function in anywhere near the way he uses them.
the fun has been 100xed
twilight_sprinkle: it doesn't really matter when it's this kind of film.
LAWL
DAT SPY SKILLZ
So, he's a sithlord.
centupled
Late on the gun, there.
ITS MAGNETS!
01,11Kandarihu: that's why a lot of people don't watch Avatar: The Last Airbender after the first season. All the plotholes and seemingly pointless episodes get filled in/used in the other 2 seasons.
I hear ya but, it's just not worth it on this film
SHUT, EVERYTHING. DOWN.
lol
Ooooooh
I was busy grabbin' food
We're getting up to, what I think is, the last musical number in the movie.
xD
Ohhh yeeeaaah
twilight_sprinkle: it's cliche, something about the "spark" of the creator or some such. Under normal circumstances it would just cause a short circuit really.
uh oh
twilight_sprinkle, are you trying to argue physics in an over-the-top movie?
Kandarihu: thank god
MAGIC
> Shut down entire power grid to have sexy time
SONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
here you go ghosties
I like her dress.
Musical number indeed.
because it's not possible to just shut doen one small blcok along...
Oh god no
I can't believe I said that
please explain Scott Pilgrim then twilight_sprinkle
otakon: thus why the same thing was used in the movie Short Circuit
i have the strangest wing right now...
twilight_sprinkle: there I completely agree, this movie is funny but not good. In my opinion
What is this?
Smooth
CrimsonPhoenix: thats different, it had its own world and rules
hahahaha
Hey... Rarity
Emotions.. Maybe. But I still don't get the physical attraction part, how does Chitti regonize his gender after all?
Can we stop debating cinema and go back to enjoying the movie?
All the sudden English in this movie...it is ridiculous.
Good part/ bad (srry spoiled)
CrimsonPhoenix: hell, you could just say it was a game
WRITEity: eeyup and I elect that A movie next week
Meanwhile: Feel up to kicking TS?
CR command forgot that all CR loves Sana equally.
twilight_sprinkle, and you can't imply that in this movie?
twilight_sprinkle: Well that's fair enough, you don't think it's awesome, I'll agree to disagree, because just about everyone else thinks it is. It's not awesome in the same way that someone might say 'Citizen Kane' is awesome, but it IS awesome in it's own right.
Chitti/Kandarihu: And that's why, if something's entertaining, I will pretty much utterly ignore the holes in it. The whole point of a film medium is immersion and enjoyment. :P
LETS WATCH SILENT HILL
NO PROPOSE on advancing to the plot, eh movie?..............GO ON
Reikim: Why would I kick teamspeak.
05inb4 obtuse.
Meanwhile: I dunno, maybe because you're bored.
I think it's funny, but not awesome
00,10Citizen cane sucks
I've never seen Citizen Kane-
Reikim: But I'm not bored, I'm watching the movie. :3
Have you seen the movie to the end?
that ring does not belong on a guy
<Ghosties> "If they all break out in song, I will acquiesce say that it's the best thing ever" here it comes
ooooooooh sweet baby jeesus
By the end, you'll agree that it's awesome.
ERm
SONG TIME
Vertigo > Citizen Kane
this is the loooongst movie
now that was kinda scary
This movie brings you ... Robot Lions..... ROBOT. LIONS!
0_0
This movie
sweeeet jesus
BAM SONG
SONG
Oh no -.-
Ghosties: What was that about breaking into song?
LAAAAAAAAA
HERE IT COMES
I'm scared.
Screen driver crashed for the first time on this laptop
Here we go.
uh oh
Guys. Guys I'm terrified.
ROBOT LIONS
Thus, fine, there may be holes. On the other hand, I'm having way too much fun to give a fuck. Thus it did its job properly, it's a good movie in that respect :p
Robot lions
I know, I'm scared too
oh yeah this bit
Sumica Citicen Kane just isn't a Movie for everyone...
creepyness is to the max
Plus robolions.
Song=Sex
:D
So does Chitti get to bang?
i hope viagra... or what's his name... knowswhat he's doin g |:
robo lions
LOL
yeah the biggest WTF has yet to come though
04They all have to be singing
Chitti-Chitti Bang-Bang?
The truth is, some stories just require a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief. A good sci/fantasy story requires that. The Academy of Arts and Sciences seems to have very little of it.
CriticKitten: I do that occasionally too, but generally I will acknowledge if something's a plot hole or the like. A lot of people seem to think that if there's one element that somebody dislikes about a movie, they must hate it or think it's awful.
so get comfy
This song exudes power.
Will we ever watch Citizen Kane here? I've been meaning to see it for years
Ghosties is this the best thing ever now?
This musical number reminds me of flash gordon...
What they make the actors/actresses were.
Ghosties: XD
Celes_Chere: Chitti Chitti bang bang
it will hit LUNA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Crash
Ghosties, they arent?
Ghosties: See, they all burst out singing. Admit it's the best thing ever.
I for one welcome our Chitti Overlords
04Alright, now I'll aquiesce
its chitti chitti bang bang
This movie makes no sense
clones... clones everywhere
EPIC WIN!!!
11,02Best part? :3
You just know they found these guys at an Elvis impersonators club.
01,11twilight_Sprinkle: yes, just using "science" as a reason is a poor excuse, but this movie actually explains the science, which actually covers teh plot holes.
SuperBrony64: not even cloes
not yet
Herostar: Viagra doesn't know jack about what it's doing.
is this movie a musical?
purple. She's Twilight now?
DANCE DANCE DANCE :D
pinkyspice: close, it's bollywood
BUFFERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
pinkyspice essentailly, yeah
This movie's conclusion is a legally viable replacement for Viagra.
Evilyn?
wait 24 hours O_o
Herostar: It's Ecstacy that know's it's action.
Yeah eat day hpney
i think the song just porned slightly
twilight_sprinkle: suspension of disbelief of 100 is required to enjoy this movie, you only have it at 25.
am i the only one who'd have the comon sense to, i don't know, THROW damn bucket of water on him?
Ooh, Chitti's gettin' his sexay on.
this is possibly the weierdest movie ive ever seen
wait, he a robot that loves that woman right?
Reme-Not-Rome: eeyup
00,10and yes this is a metaphor for sex
01,11otakon: lawl, pretty much that.
Chitti: i dont consider 'magnets' a sufficient explanation for a robot that can do the things chitti does
so... much... swag
pinkyspice: eeyup
Seriously, people approaching this like it's 2001: A Space Oddysey in terms of its scientific accuracy.
Herostar-Discorded: Supposedly he's waterproof.
04Still, the misquito scene was COMPLETELY out of left field and I had no idea it would happen...I have to say it's a better part of the film for me even if it's not the *best* part
pinkyspice eeyup.
lol. Thank you Sumica.
pinkyspice: Perty much.
I still can't forget the part when that dumbass girl runs into the road and commits suicide.
This is so akward
04Actually, no
Reme-Not-Rome it gets even awesomer just be prepared
yeep
xD
Ghosties: that was the TRUE BLAM! of this movie
04I just can't
04I can't say that this is better than the misquito scene
01,11twilight_sprinkle: and yet it's a reasonable explination for the sh*t that Magneto of X-men can do?
twilight_sprinkle: I don't think it's that kind of film where they have to explain, it's not the sort of film that really has to be plausible, and maybe you could write a similar script, if you can actually get it made into a film, it might be good
uhhhhhh
04That whole scene was absolute perfection
Ghosties: the mosquito scene was a reference to a russian movie Day watch
WRITEity: Yep. If you think about it, this is why people say that they like films like Moulin Rouge. That film has its holes, but it does one thing right: it entertains them to the point where they don't care or don't think about the holes.
Ghosties: just wait
This kitty of mine keep pawing at me. She wants my attention.
did he just lick her blood?
just wait ghosties
too high voice!
Reikim that is bad.
Ghosties: Still, just wait
Kandarihu: pet her!
Ghosties: save your 'best scene' title til you're done with the film.
i quess this is only recomeneded for people who smoke illegal stuff
Kandarihu: give her love!
00,10it realy was one of the most wtf moments Ghosties
uh...WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!
Chitti: maybe not, ive never watched xmen
turtlegod98: It's dumbass on account of her becoming an outcast, and at the lowest tier of all humanity in her culture.
hiya Sumica
01,11ah.
Chitti: do you bang her
Two point Oh is my favorite scene so far.
turtlegod98: a very very odd film
ROBOT
dem lions
Reme-Not-Rome: it's never an necessity
Ghosties sit tight.
turtlegod98, Lady Gaga, Indian version
There we go
robot lions ftw
ROBOT LIONS
:)
a*
Chitti has such swag outfits. And an army of clone-bots. He is swag.
ROBOT LIONS
and wait
00,10hi otakon
Robo lion
Tiiiiiitle Drop!
Sumica: oh. i gusse dancing would make sense snice he doesn't have any equpiment nor does he have any way to actually procreate
o god no.
turtlegod98: *sarcasm of course*
ROBOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Vivix: lol
04The misquitos even *huddled together like a group of friends and planned what to do*
I'LL FORM THE HEAD!
1000 lions.
That outfit makes him look like the Gold Zeo Ranger.
04Seriously
he's equal to VOLTRON!
Chitty secretly stole Ming the Merciless' wardrobe
i bet snoop lion's there somewhere
I still say just wait
If you need to do something to enjoy something it's not enjoyable in the first place
Best and most WTF sequence upcoming
STAR WARS
LOL
00,10you missed the part where he said he made ajustments for that pinkyspice
suddenly darth chiddi

Darth Vader for a moment.

I told you guys.
He is officially a sith lord!
Chitti is the King of India, and this is his lifestory
FUCKIN LIGHSABER, MAN
He truly is a Sith
Problem is though, she's one clingy cat. I petted her, and she still wants more
Elvis Terminator Sithlord.
Darth Chitti
04Funny, yes. The lightsaber bit was funny
they did perfect the scene with yhe mosquitos
Ghosties: i gotta say, i laughed my head off at that bit, i did not expect it at all
the hell? star wars?
Sumica: wait, he can have children now?
CriticKitten: eeyup. Personally, I dislike Moulin Rouge because it's just too much being thrown at me constantly, and I never get to sit and enjoy a scene or shot before it switches away to something else. But it certainly has tons of energy and passion in it, and I totally understand why folks like it.
Mosquitoes needed a bigger role in this movie
I won't say no to robots... *cough*
this is totally innacurate
Chitti, I have already explained how this movie fits and qualifies for propaganda
I WON'T SAY NO TO MUSICALS
the book was better
00,10yes, he told here that he was going to have robosapins
The only thing left over after eating are dirty dishes....
01,11I guess I missed it...
"His stature is so tall it will hit the moon." I'm not the only one seeing that, am I.
01,11WRITEity: is that how you feel about this movie as well?
ROBOT. LIONS
O.o
Chitti, also, Brainwashing
f tiger blood i want lion blood
Sumica: you pulling my leg?
Horray for robot lions, that, there, proves chitty's level of swag
all the sana
dat copy paste
WRITEity: Aye. This film, for me, is so over the top, so absurd and so....well honestly, well thought out, that I don't even find myself bothering to look for problems in it.
01,11PONY: I don't see it. At all.
Reikim no you're not
copy pasta
04She reminds me a bit of Mila Kunis
lol
PONY: she's playing along
WRITEity: Which in my opinion means the film did it right.
he should have made robots of her
must be made by apple
Ghosties: it's the eyes I think
in the first place
00,10keep watching pinkyspice
About this 7th Sense talk. The Hindus believe in a 6th sense and the sensory organ for it is the 3rd eye.
Clunk.
no power
Sumica: You've got a point there! Perhaps "androids" would be a proper term.
SABOTAGE
water is poison
11,02So...did the robot guy snap or something?
Lol

Not quite yet
You mean Chit, right?
so yeah, why not solar panels
here it comes
This...might be a problem.
Chitti: nah, this is a bit different. This film's very frenetic, but its length and pacing better allow for the insanity and OTT stuff to be better appreciated.

01,11THE BLOOOOOD!!!!
*Robocalypse
00,10so just think somewhere in the background they had a catapult set up for tosing cars
Blood!
04OH SHI
Oh shit!
01,11...how didn't they think of cleaning that up...?
AB -? NO!
Chitti, you are blinded by it! That's why you are so eagerly defending this film... No escape from reality. Open your eyes, look up to the skies and seeeeee! I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me...
DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
I think i have some epic glasses aroung here somewhere? . . . aha!
04AB-

Good morning everyone.

Who's Abbie Negative? And how is she relevant?
now he makes the connection

04If they got the help of the mosquitoes...
Wait!
hahaahahaahhaaah
No way?
here only?
It wont end in mosquitos will it?
cheating wife
Meanwhile: Debbie Downer's cousin?
lied
Wait a minute. Speaking of the Mosquito scene, it was one of Vasigaran's assistants who had the AB- blood. Now that's a plothole.
<3 that him X
what's this "we" business
04If it ends with the mosquitoes helping the humans, my god
It will end in epic robot battles
look what I found: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/318844_3646678160893_488235194_n.jpg
Kandarihu: hmm you're right I think
OR SHE WASN'T?
I hope it does end in skeeters saving the day
lie detection obviously ain't working
yeees
Kandarihu: More than one person can't have AB- blood?
01,11Pony: Yeah, no. I'm usually a skeptic person when watching a new movie which is why I so balancly judge films. I don't see ANY propoganda in this film, and I've actually had to watch propoganda movies for several Cultural Diversity and History classes. I just don't see it.
Dat Trojan
THAT would make me like the movie
use macfee
A TROJAN!
Shitty Firewall
or maybe norton

Well, it was said to be a rare blood type.
He needs norton
WRITEity, you bastard.
heh heh

It's the middle finger because fuck you.
It's the rarest of blood types mostly due to the fact that few people donate it.

Hand-made handgun. Pun pun pun.

01,11That's not propeganda, PONY, those are movie cliche's, and they exist in almost EVERY film that's been made. It's a stable of story-writting, and if you go by that, you can claim that every movie that's been made in the past decade is propeganda in some way, shape or form.

nice user interface there
Chitti: they didn't have access to Chitti's new network yet, they needed a direct line in through one of the new bots.
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SUNS TO BURN THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and that's a good thing
ded
ha
DED
wait, wouldn't it be easier to have him self-destruct all robots?
DED?
I like how robocop had to fight all those enemies which had , despite his powers, the force to stop him by weapons, even so they themselfes were just humans, while this movie has the exact opposite
Chitti is nice chitti now?
ded
delete
RED CHIP, so specific
Chitti: btw this is how Neo defeated Smiths. he infiltrated one, and blew up the rest
01,11otakon: good point, except that the network could have been acessed through ANY of the clowns.
chitti is gonna feel SO much remorse
flutter_spin: not when they're ALL ON THE GODDAMN VAN
Hundreds of murders.

^^ But it would be so much cooler, otakon
And now the good doctor is put on trial.
iF YOU SWALLOW THE BLUE CHIP-----------
You know, Robocop was pretty damn fun, I wasn't expecting that
Chitti: they only JUST got access to the clones though
IF you swallow the RED CHIP--------

He's not alive. Still dead.

Boy that changed quickly.

Bye Lil_B and Noob709
Lebowski
Meanwhile I only like it because of Cosmic Bowling and cheap food.
dat Walter
STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERIKE
Whenever I go to the bowling lane, I try to spend as much time as I can in the arcade section.
stupid earth ponies
Meanwhile...that image is now in my head and you will never be able to remove it.
thanks Dark92ChittyV2 ;)
01,11*used to be in a bowling league*
Walter Sobchak is best pony
So...what good is a bowling cutie mark?
Reikim: http://i.imgur.com/Qz0kC.jpg
I haven't bowled in over 10 years! Yaha!
But come to think of it, that's a bad idea, since I can't even have the time to play the games anyway.
Meanwhile: thats a good pic of you mate
flutter_spin: beats a spoon
^^
01,11flutter_spin: There's a national and international bowling league. I actually had the option to go to Australia for mine...
Bronysith: Because you haven't used that joke a hundred times already.
Vivix I can't remember the last time I bowled. Years and years ago . . .
Meanwhile: nope. only 99 times
AUSTRALIA!
i luv my little pony ^_^
mine was via school, and I kept stepping over
same
I mean in Equestria. Seems kind of odd.
soo what i likey
01,11Local bowling leagues could exist in Ponyville...
Scootaloo is best CMC
plus not all ponies have cutiemark in their jobs
01,11nope.
yup
01,11Sweetie Belle is best CMC
PARTEYEH
going to sleep goodnight everypony
like how bonbon does oddjobs and that berry cherry works with trash-
lol Pinkie
cupcakes!
See. Parties are something.
dat hat
night kamsko
no it wont!
I agree with Chitti, SB is best CMC
HOW CAN YOU SAY NO
I love feathers
Chitti I call my little sis "Sweetie Belle".
YAY :)
Yup. Scootaloo was just flying
no!
dat voice crack
love her voice cracks
01,11Canadian_Brony: Does she know the reference?
Is this the cutie pox?
Hello everypony.
yeah
I love how her mouth hurts
instead of just--boink boink
01,11The voice cracks is a clever personality trait of Sweetie Belle
ow ow ow
ouch.
ouch
i watched it when i lost connectoin XD
flutter_spin: Try to keep in mind that cutie marks aren't like pieces of equipment. They're visual representations of the one activity/hobby/whatever that you absolutely love and that you have considerable skill at. They represent your passion.
zecora the dentist?
Chitti: Sweetie Belle also has best singing voice.
yeahm what Reikim said
Meanwhile: if you haven't beaten a joke into the ground, you haven't used it often enough... >_>
Notice with BG ponies and some of the mane six how their cutiemark dont represent their job, but their passion
I know I know. But bowling?
he loooves bowling
suspicious bloom is suspicioos
well...I'm gona stay as a blank flank for the rest of my life... :(
he'll probably be a desk clerk
What the CMC get wrong every single time is that a cutie mark is not earned or gotten. It is found; it is discovered based on the pony. The pony makes the cutie mark; not the other way around.
dentist of a century
/me still prefers Scootaloo
01,11Vivix: That's the same with Rarity. her cutie mark is her passion for gems, but her job is being a fashionista
yeaah
Question: What does Zecora's cutie mark represents?
So you are saying, Reikim is that there is no pony
lol
when will the little poines get there cutie marks XD
Reikim: when they realize that they'll get their marks.
01,11Zecora's represents her mixtures and the ability to combine nature with the needs of life. :)
i guess season 9
Pikachu: when scootaloo gets an episode
Just seems a little odd to have a 'bowling' cutie mark. Lightning bolt, hammer, or giant star....
Chitti: Actually...Rarity's mark represents her ability to find beauty that is hidden. Art thing.
so never
Chitti she did, but she asked me a month ago why. I told her she reminded me alot of Sweetie Belle: as annoying as she can be at times, I'll always love her as my sister. She even called me her BBBFF yesterday.
alchemy FTW!
ooh, symbolism
can somepony explain Zecora's Cutie Mark and why Donkeys, dragons nor cows don't have one
oh XD
this episode she dose then it gos XD
PONY: See Chitti's comments.
01,11PONY: see my above comment on Zecora's cutie mark.
It's a pony thing, bascially. Zebras seem to have a variation on it
Patience is a virtue. A lesson that cannot be taught.
you go, you go
amethyst a flower...
Hello everyone.
Chitti, yes, but wtf is it?
Herostar-Discorded IKR? It's a jewel.
hi
hi FUS_RO_yay
01,11A Zebra's cutie mark is more obscure, that way Zebras still have to figure it out for themselves even after they get it.
hiya turtlegod98
Evidently, only ponies get cutie marks.
hiho FUS_RO_yay :)
ah yeah- that would make sense
it's the ONE RING!
Tron Disk?
01,11*sigh*
Chitti LoLz, that makes alot of sense
/me hugs pikachu
THROW HER IN MOUNT DOOM!
Chitti, riddles, riddles everywhere
wait, they never get their cutie marks
dat Twisp
/me throws otakon in mount doom
no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
am i drunk right now?
I'm saying hi to FUS_RO_yay
otakon: she can simply walk into mordor
Rarity's passion is not gems...it is beauty. Thus her job as fashionista, and abilities when it comes to finding gems. She is attracted to beauty, and she has great skill at drawing out beauty.
THE PRECIOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
01,11A Zebra's cutie mark is that of a sun, but the swirling center is that of mixing potions. .
Zebra's have a variation on cutie marks, as far as we can tell by zecora
Chitti: link the zecora card
the cutie mark crusaders never get their cutie marks
coming from a pony with a tiara as a cutiemark...:P
Reikim: notice how she is obsessed with incorporating gems though
and yours is being a snot, are you really one to talk, tiara?
amethyst flower ----> http://img4-2.sunset.timeinc.net/i/2010/07/amethyst-flower-0710-l.jpg?400:400
/me hugs Pikachu (cuase hugging yourself is sad)
but yeah- her passion is beauty
01,11Zecora's cutie mark, I mean
lol
it my plush
Oh, hey yeah! I can see that now-
Chitti, okay, why donkeys don't have one?
Why cant humans do that?!
Vivix: Personal style. Artistic flair and all that. And not everything incorporates gems; her true "art pieces" barely use any, i.e. the Gala dresses.
hello everyone
Chitti, (riddly or not)
Bronysith: http://images.sodahead.com/polls/001470501/37336280_mordor_xlarge.png

Chitti is one of our mods. prepare for awesomeness
TITLE DROP
dat trolling
01,11Zecora's cutie mark is that of a sun, but the swirling center is that of mixing potions. It represents her mixtures and the ability to combine nature with the needs of life. There.
Vivix: Rarity takes inspiration where she finds it.
Loopty Hooping. Seems Legit.
otakon: nope
otakon LoLz
Bronysith: what nope?
Ohai Herostar-Discorded
truee-
Jmo, good to see yall
otakon: nope, no one simply walks in there
Chitti: nice analyzation
whos streaming?
OWNED
Bronysith: go and try it thien
hai friends
ancientblood: it's SuperBrony64 I think
Reikim I think that's right, but it's related to gems in how she found it and use it at times. Though it's not as narrow as that
showoff.
inb4 http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb409/bitchpleasefuckit/The%20Main%20Bitch/hoopla.gif
hello SweetieBell have you read the rules?
hi SweetieBell
Chitti: might wanna keep that on a hotkey
otakon: okay "Walks outside, walks into mordor simply" I brought back some random swag that gollum gave me
/me gives otakon a doughnut
So cutiemakrs are just an indication- so you're not forced by the Celestia tyranny to work within your cutiemark etc. like some fics
"advanced"
RoboGanjalf relevant
ooooh, doughnut
HOOPLA!
...That moment when you suddenly realize how deeply you've been considering the psychological. philosophical implications of cutie mark mechanics.
oh right there was a background Filly Derpy in this episode :$
HOOPLA!
HOOPLA>
HOOPTICOPTER!
better at flying than scootaloo...
/me noms upon Mordor Doughnut
*psychological and philosophical
weeeeee
^to the moon!!!
Welcome, Sweetie Belle......have you read the rules?
HOOP-*brick'd*
lolwut?
Ooh, ponies are on!
Sounds like alot of HOOPLA!
And Chitti I never saw what Zecora's mark was until you said it now
WHAT CHOPPA?
FUN FACT: applebloom was able to fly before scootaloo
and TAKE OFF
earth pony flyyyyyyyyyyyy
owlicious: oh God
The mark has been doubled!
sup everypony
sounds like alot of HOOPLA!
owlicious: oh, snap!
Dark92ChittyV2: Tony Tony Choppa
I love Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
This poses the question. Is there a pony with two cutie marks?
/me throws a brick to turtlegod98
Vivix: If it is a true cutie mark then you should not need to be forced to work within it. Cutie marks represent your passion; you're going to WANT to work within it.
01,11Vivix: exactly. You discover your passion, and then find a job that has that passion as a part of your job. For example, a bowling cutie mark can lead to somepony actually OWNING a bowling alley.
it's possible
Says the one with a totally useless mark
flutter_spin: not known but my guess is no
yeah- totally. Much like us I figure
Shes a Clown in a circus.
flutter_spin: Unknown. Probably no.
she's a witch, burn her
Chitti, or maybe it's a tattoo, which would just simply make it a Zebra tradition to tattoo their speciality after discovering it, instead of actually getting a magical one like ponies *Conspiracy Keanu*
Be a fun episode to impose upon
sweet jesus
Sounds like alot hoopla to have two cutie marks.
I'm still trying to figure out what my cutie mark should be.
Canadian_Brony: A maple leaf.
mine's a pixelated cake.
01,11PONY: considering African traditions, this could easily be how it works for Zebras.
Chitty and that pony from earlier wasn't implied to OWN the bowling alley?
dat sleeping RD
my cutie mark would be §§ :/
DAT RD
spongebob quotes ftw
Unofficial rule of canon: Zebra "cutie marks" have not been explained, thus there is no canon. Have fun speculating though!
Canadian_Brony: A canadian flag?
01,11Rainbow Dash: Not giving a sh*t
O.o
dat mane
SPike loves Rarity for her mane
Dark92ChittyV2: wasn't the pony with bowling cutiemark a foal?
Spike's confirmed for hair fetishist
SPIKE has a mane fetish
there I said it
I like pie.
MONTAGE!
INCOMING PIE!
Chitti, exactly, and it would also make my question regarding donkeys and it's complexity irrelevant
Sleeping RD........no way that's gonna be a meme
nobody invited spitfire
Reikim FUS_RO_yay being a nationallity isn't a special talent. Besides, I somethimes go by the name of Lunar_B rony
otakon: Nonono, as seen in "A Dog and Pony Show" he's obsessed with her jewels.
WHere's Soarin'?
hi
Canadian_Brony: Twas a joke.
Vivix Point taken.
there was pie but no Soarin...
EEEEEEYUP
Reikim wasn't very funny
How they suddenly go to the table for pie
noep
NOPE
dat charliehorse
NNNNope
01,11Vivix: this is an interesting concept...and makes so much sense.
Reikim: lol
Charlie Horse on a pony
hahahah
Canadian_Brony: dunno, i could never be a canadian. a steryotipic one anyway.
Is it bad that I forgot what I said?
equineception?
01,11Charlie horses hurt like a f***ing b***h!
Vivix: yes
Street Light
Chitti: yes
o noes
I never knew what spry means
stop clopdancing
clop clop clop
EEEEEEEEYUP
Vivix: I can't find it in chatlog, so...
Do you mind explaining Ditzy's Cutie Mark?
oh no
01,11STOP CLOPPING!
ugh, this ol' joke
Apple Bloom's too young to clop
Dat Dancing.
FAPS
Me neither-
I hear clopping
>Doorknobs
CLOPPING?
ohsweetjesus
If thats how you clop, you're gonna hurt yourself
HELP ME!
hyperclopping
FUS_RO_yay being a stereotypical isn't a talent, but it's damn fun at parties!
01,11Shooie: Read the Bubbles fanfic.
/me facepalms
>No opposable thumbs to turn them
"Kill meeee..."
le slap
DUNDUNDUNDUN.
Canadian_Brony: Lol, i could see why.
ugh. Couldn't get through Bubbles fanfic. A little too grimdark
AJ is so cute without her hat
she's unstoppable!
01,11Vivix: agreed. I wish we'd see her without it more often.
flutter_spin: still, if its a story ho derpy got her cutie mark, then she mustve survived
dat hidden joke
Shooeie: Supposedly Derpy is just bubbly. That no matter what happens, she'll always face life with a bubbly spirit. Or something.
It was night a second ago. Now it is day.
dat music
YOU kinda do.
01,11The trots
hehehe
well it's not like ponies can't have mutlple talents but three cutie marks is not possible
DUN DUN DUUUN
SHUT UP MEG
shut up spike
shut up elmo
kick
Spike is new meg
I'd like to theorize that ponies are happy and joyful. They would never do what happened in that fanfic
AIDS
I think multiple cutiemarks is either super rare or impossible- but multiple talents? Probably not too uncommon
AIDS
NO CURE????? (Dramatic Twi)
FLEUR DE LIS!
She's speaking in fancy!:o
dat Fanceh
FANCYEH
dat french reminds me of Louisiana.
FANCY!
Fancy - the official language of Fance
en francais? Sacre bleu
Applebloom would win All the events at the olympics
Fancy
Whelp, I now know to stay away from "Bubbles". Forever.
I flunked french!
Vivix, I believe Cutiemark simply represents your best talent
RoboGanjalf: Prance
fancy is spoken in seven nations
I wonder in french its in english
Reikim same
IN FANCY?????? no way that's gonna be a meme
ze cora
yeaah, that's a good way to put it PONY
01,11Vivix: multiple talents like Fluttershy being able to sew while her main talent is her way with animales?
yeah
I hope they go to Prance someday
FLEUR DE LIS! the sign of the saints! -grabs his phone- gat, we got a problem!
inb4 Zebra sense
Chitti: Less of a talent and more like freaky random knowledge.
dat pony venus
Fluttershy is apparently pretty good at sewing too- like really good
Bon-Bon
yeah Reikim. They posted it on EQD and everyone was like "this is a little too dark"
or aphrodite
sculpting would be a nice talent
and then she must CREATE!
anypony know what was the fancy language in French translation??
Taking pleasure in some pony else's pain Spike
O_O too much cutie marks
flutter_spin: ...That's an achievement.
01,11FENSING!
fencing
PONY VENUS.........no overtones?
Dat Olympic Fencing.
NO THUMBS
01,11I totally spelled that wrong
cursed
hehe
the horror!
HOW DO THEY HOLD THE SWORDS?!
it's funny cuz the Olympics are on
stay away from "muffins"
I love the flower trio! THey're soo cuute
01,11otakon: magic
So its aids?
and then hazmat suits on
CUTIEPOX
Smooth move spike.
PONY what do you mean?
Really smooth, Spike
SHUT UP MEG
Dark92ChittyV2, Venus?
SARS
that was easy
PONY point taken
Spike is new smooth
Also, all of AB's Fancy is grammatically correct, simple as it is, and pronounced fairly well. Just noting how much I love this show~
Once again nice job Spike
Seriously, is it me or do the Ponyville residents panic WAY WAY too easily?
They're pretty skittish
is it ok if i can make a flim on u tube
CrimsonPhoenix, wasn't that french? what did she speak/spoke as a second language in French translation?
it makes them extra cute, it might just be a pony trait in general?
Her Spider sense is a tingeling
otakon: have you seen that granular bag video?
01,11otakon: a trait of ponies/horses as a species. They are startled and frightened easily.
Zebra sense a-tinglin'
otakon dramatics are funny tho
otakon: Actually, this is supposedly IRL horse behaviour...first reaction to danger: PANIC RUN
PONY it is french
She said exactly
hmm good point
yeah-
otakon: the one with the mechanical arm holdign stuff
What is this? I'm talking French?
dem hazmats
twilight_sprinkle: um....what?
Hazmat ponies, yay!
...Is it just me, or is the picture stretched?
CrimsonPhoenix, what is her second language in French translation then? English
otakon: gimme a sec
twilight_sprinkle: no send me a pm
Prehensile tail
Reikim it's just you. Refresh
Funny how in a whole day it took 3 cutie marks but now they're coming like shit.
Truth. Its so hard to speak.
back
PONY oh you mean THAT
Pinkie pie will save Applebloom
pro planting
love this part :D
^^ Pinkie Time
CrimsonPhoenix, Yes.
and that's THE TRUTH! THE WHOLE TRUTH! AND NOTHING BUT!...........THE TRUTH!
It's probably speeding up the sicker she gets
Go Pinkie!
I ATE THEM
I'll need to take some research on that
01,11AJ's suspicion of Zebra sense is understandable when you remember that AJ also accepts Pinkie Senses.
yeaah
...Nope, the stream's still in widescreen. All the ponies are short and tubby.
deer lord no :o
indeed
cause WE DON'T GET FRENCH PONIES IN QUEBEC
Come on tell the truth !!!
I stole 10 cans of Coca-Cola! ARE YOU HAPPY?!?!
3?
CrimsonPhoenix, I hope it's spanish... It's gotta be spanish
6?
3?????
right on time ^_^
LIAR
9?

11,02Zebras are not Pinkies, STOP CONFUSING ME ;A;
Lol :)
PONY well giving the fleur de lis symbol
Hey guys? where did the "That's four tens and that is terrible?" come from? I can't remember it
01,11I STAYED HOME FOR HALF OF MY DRAWING CLASSES IN MY THIRD QUARTER!
I rage on gears of war 3!
it's very questionable
lolwut?
I THINK FLUTTERSHY IS BEST PONY!
Aah
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, That's as many as four tens. And that's horrible.
telling the truth is fun
SuperBrony64: But what if...what if Pinkie was secretly part-Zebra...thus explaining Pinkie/Zebra sense? :P
and i'M NOT HER FINANCIAL ADVISOR
I for some reason thouht it was from this episode
dat hazmat pony
Jim i know he is evil
gross
SuperBrony64: permission to post a youtube link explaining how pony hoofs might work?
I wonder if somepony has a hazmat cutie mark?
EAT DAT PLANT!
i wouldnt eat a plant
Apleblooom
and now she will never get a cutie mark
the hazmat suit had a Nuclear symbol on the flank
:P
DAT SQUEAK
some fanfics say earthponies hold with inate pony magic
I eat plenty of plants
I say--TV DID IT, and leave it obscure
I'd love to eat plants.
Vivix: Confirmed by Faust.
But back to Derpy's cutie mark. Didn't you guys read Ditzy's Dismally Derpy Day? In that fic the explanation was that Derpy observed bubbles and dust and stuff as a filly and she used to it to learn how the air made them move, and how she could move the air.
Really? cool
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Err...no >>
I also like Fetlock grip
Vivix: Lauren once said that Earth ponies are magically attuned to nature
or hock grip- as is the front legs
Zecora has the best smile i;ve seen <3
SuperBrony64: :<<<
ah the fetlocks
01,11Vivix: They do in a way, as they are the only ponies that can sucessfully grow crops.
LIKE A BOSS
UNSHORN FETLOCKS
Pikachu: Pikachu, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be with Ash?
11,02But on that note...
where did Zecora go?
yeah- but you know the inate magic lets them hold stuff like sticks with their hooves without the hock grip
hello everypony
no i quit with him
she disappeard
hi roronoa
hiya roronoa
hi roronoa
11,02We'll be doing YouTube requests today :)
which isn't too far fetched I figure
Chitti: Well, not the only ones...Earth Pony-tended fields just grow better, easily outgrowing fields tended by, say, a Unicorn.
01,11Vivix: good thought.
roronoa: you are a tad bit late
applebloom can you write a letter to the most important pony there is? "Oh yeah, sure i can! no problem!"
yay requests :$
YAY YOUTUBE REQUESTS!
I read it somewhere, but yeah I like the idea
SuperBrony64: is vinyl scratch channel open?
TO YT!
SuperBrony64 AWESOME!!!
SuperBrony64: Radio Graffiti, please.
i'd flip my shit\
lol
You would Herostar-Discorded.
SuperBrony64: LIKE AVGN's REVIEW of Scott Pligrim?
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-?
pika ^_^
Canadian_Brony: If it would stop radiation, it should work against diseases as well
/me face-books
dat Voice crack <3
01,11Reikim: which is why in the olden times, Earth Ponies were the main source of food for Unicorns and Pegasi.
SuperBrony64: oh you have no idea what you have unleashed
awww its over :(
welp i waited long nuff!
Sweetiebells talent is clearly voice cracking
METH LAB
ALCHEMY level 1, applebloom has a long way to go.
I love pony lore
AAAAND they still havent learned
TO THE METH LAB!
RoboGanjalf I was just pointing out the symbol.
11,02Remember the rules though: 1.) Follows our Rules 2.) Less than 5 minutes (to save on time instead of 7 :)) 3.) No multiple parts 4.) One request per User
Chitti: Essentially, yes. Unicorns couldn't possibly hope to feed everyone, as their fields wouldn't grow enough.
Canadian_Brony: i know
As a wicca i really know alchemy..
OK.........that was the LONGEST MOVIE NIGHT I HAVE EVER WITNESSED
-big boom-
Alright. I was laying around for too long there.
AND IT WAS AWESOME
SuperBrony64 does that mean it's open?
and it's not easy T-T
Lalalalalala~
nice drawing
01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: actually, the voice cracks are a foreshadowing to Sweetie Belle having a talent for singing, as she doesn't differentiate her singing voice from her speaking voice yet.
...
WOOT
This is new
Chitti: dont all kids get voice cracks?
SuperBrony64: where are requests going?
hmmmmmmmmm
who's streaming?
I like them space ponies
11,02The request room is #Vinyl_Scratch , head on in there, once the room is unmutted, you can post your requests :)
it's SuperBrony64
not all kids twilight_sprinkle it's most common in boys, but it's a different cracking sound
.
б
SuperBrony64: I AM WAITING WITH ONE FINGER ON CONTROL AND ANOTHER ON V
Sweetie's voice crack is really common in female singers- people like the sound of it
lalala
01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: yes, but in Ponyville, the only character who's voice cracks on a regular basis is Sweety Belle, which is why it's so unique.
SuperBrony64 how will we know when it's unmuted?
Well, it's been fun and all but I'm gona get some shut eye now. It's 1 am so Good night everyone!
11,02I'll post a message :)
g'night turtlegod98

SuperBrony how long will you be doing request tonight? I'm trying to get one uploaded but it'll take over 100 minutes. If you could only take Dailymotion requests I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of getting back on YouTube
I thought it was that Chitti.

SuperBrony64: goddammit less than five minutes? dammit
Parents love that show. Never bothered with it myself.
Chitti what is that?

Canadian_Brony, it's not exactly a remake... Just Tarantino version of the original
damn pretty well done
11,02Requests are now closed :)
ah
NOO
these are requests btw
not the pony!!
Canadian_Brony, whole different plot and stuff, only the name is same
NOT THE PONI
so we're done exploring sb's crazy videos :P
I see
This is awesome
I see he's not shooting.
Bring it on!
lol
dat line
Okay this is odd but...neat
I know of this, but never saw this version
so...
SuperBrony64: so mine wont be streamed? :(

oh come on
more AVAST PLOT?
Major: well then it cant be streamed, chat is cloesed, your suggestion didnt go thru, sry
that's not loving or tolerating....but I like it
all BS movies should be slightly edited to have some pony stuff in them, for example characters appearing in corner... for example Twi spotting false facts, stating "Actually... *the fact*", Pinkie yelling party, Vinyl wubbing "AWWWWW YEAH" etc... just small little fun things, like some of the sound effects.
That was amazing
11,02Requests start now :)
/me plays the harmonica
SuperBrony64: theyr'e starting again?
YES
SuperBrony64 is this the first request?

You can break obsidean. You mean bedrock.
im sinings irl :D
Allegr0: obsideon? i would have gone with bedrock :3
FUS_RO_yay: you cant pick up bedrock
Pudge: Ive seen it done before.
and then
eww dubstep
I slapped my cat
obsideon is a cuzin of bedrock
Don't get me started on that crap.
Dubstep is not hardcore enough for my tastes
NOW put block around spawn
GigabitHarmonie: favorite part of the new update?
LOL
FUS_RO_yay: obsidian is just as good because it would take forever to break through obsidian with you rfist
fist*
[Alpha], what is hardcore enough for yourtastes?
Pudge: But bedrock NEVAR breaks.
Nothing
fancy stupidity?
Pudge it's about 3 mins of punching to break an obsidian block.
it breaks in creative
FUS_RO_yay: well that would be cruel
