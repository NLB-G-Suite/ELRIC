otakon: Yep, the one that Roger Ebert HATED
otakon North, the 1994 flick with Ellijah Wood.
Bye, VenHur! :)
seeya VenHur

cya VenHur :)
Ooh Freakzoid
RAWRity: ......yeah....no
RAWRity NONONONONO!!!!
Welp, there's a possiblity to get banned if you pick Twilight
Uh oh, it's storming out
I'll just get the opposite as per tradition :P
no
depends on which Pokemanz you can get
Spell-of-Gaming: .........fuk
RAWRity the entire saga should be WMC'd
Sparkle for A movie
cachi01: seeing as it's one of the most financially sucesful franchises in film history, it's an A movie.
I can't let you Do that Starfox, I can't let you brew that Starbucks, I can't let you do that *moonwalks*.
heh
RAWRity That's only because it's made millions.
the character designs and pokemon designs look borderline retarded to me
Can we do Twilight + Rifftrax?
don't know why
Dammit I need to change my name
^^^^^^^
That doesn't instantly make it good.
OJ: the ONLY way we're watching it
That's like saying How Stella Got Her Groove Back is A. Twilight isn't A to us dudbros.
Helloooo, nurse
13i will personally smack whoever votes for twilight >>
:D
/me hides
linsett: I never said it was good. but it IS an A movie
Shizuka: that would be someone in regulars
OJ only if they did a rifftrax
that and basing a map on freaking NYC......that's just not Pokemon lol
it's a pipe bomb
The designs are pretty bad
Has BronyState ever done Rifftrax?
OJ: a shit load
are we talking about shiny vampires again?
many times, OJ
Shizuka: I forget who though
Canadian_Brony: They did
Shizuka: YOu don't mind if Akira is okay for BMN, right?
owloysius Good idea, but it's waaay too recent.
I thought most of the pokemon were okay
dat date rape
again, with people equating "A movie" with quality.
oh yeah
OJ: Has BronyState ever done Rifftrax? Oh yeahhhhh we have
Like
Shizuka: what if i accidentaly picked it for b movie? :I
minus the ice cream ones...
Me too
AJIsAwesome: Akira for B is fine with me
dat grab
13i'd love to see akira
I know it's suppose to be in a whole different zone on the planet
OJ we did transformers 2 just the other day with rifftrax
13A imo
wat
And the garbage ones
that was just weird
ADULT SWIM!
OJ: Shizuka randomly plays them through the week
OKAY
otakon: It's a B movie?
TETSUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
nowhere near the original places
Hunger force lol
send the kids to bed. ;)
OJ then you may want to ask Shizuka. She's the one who streams riffs
OJ: Sometimes
13since it was one of the major breakthrough animes over here
OKAY YOU HAVE I GET IT
Oh Adult swim
Wait, isn't Akira considered an A movie?
there'd be too many rape jokes
But i really liked archeops
akira has to be a
The original SeaLab 2020?
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leobr7Z7mO1qchw13o1_500.jpg --- for those who missed it earlier :)
but it just looked lke they made it and knew people would buy it despite how dumb it looked
it's like the same thing and no one complained about that
AJIsAwesome: eh kind of if only because limited theatrical release
oi kiddies of to bed
otakon: AH.
which people will do of course
Archeips was bamf
off*
since it's pokemon
LMAO
13nah the dub is just fine
the early days of Adult Swim

...Animaniacs. :L
the original Dub for Akira was cractastic
Fuck yes

If your looking for me check under the sea
I love this shit

/me Dances
:D
Oh lordy this
:D
CUPCAKES

I didn't like mul either
Shizuka: have you HEARD the original dub?
/me dances as well
Good job house :D
dufuq?
13oh wait there were multiple
I once wrote a Rifftrax to the first episode of MLP. So there
TETSUOOOOOOOOO
I get enough enjoyment out of Heartgold and Soulsilver
KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
wonder if they have gangnam style
I mean, as long as the game's still fun, the designs don't matter that much
/me TIL diabetus cures cancer
13yeah that one :3
go House go
Heartgold was awesome
House has style
at least not to me
Yeah
okay brb need a drink
is pewdiepie a brony?
mfw no one did KANEDAA when I did TETSUOO
Ooooh yeah Goldfish!
Uh, the announcer got the title of Sealab 2021 wrong... unless he's referring to the one episode that was a 2020 episode with ONE edited joke at the end and nothing else
It's like people complaining about graphics
meh
aaand this one's new for me
I agree Evan
superretroworld: Doubt it.
owloysius they probably did that for every song that exists
superretroworld: no
Vinyl Scratch is best pony
oooh, Electroswing
o
^^
13ohhhh i see
Couldn't care less as long as it's fun
I felt they were running out of ideas for BW
she cannae take much more wub, captain
I can't help it...I gotta groove!
13i have the 2001 dub which is pretty good
so just made up whatever they had left lol
it entertained me for 15ish hours and that's all I asked for
what song is thus?
And I feel something, watcha feel boy
dunno, but I like
/me dances
Shizuka: Would you prefer the english or the Japanese dub?
I still think they shoudl remake Generation 3
Love this band
Well yeah, that goes without saying
13it varies
DAT RD :S
13sometimes dubs are bad, sometimes dubs are BAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
holy buck...what video is this?
That should be the next on their agenda though if they're going to keep following the pattern
/me Dances around the chat
You know the biggest problem I have with this fast-mode for PMVs? Knowing when it's over.
I still haven't played that one
13sometimes they're amazing awesome like bebop and gits
:(
perhaps
Shizuka, then there is 4kids
good morning
they remade 1 and 2... so they've got to do 3 next
13and then there's 4kids
They already broke the pattern
Hi, DaringDerpy! :)
Oh god, 4kids
sparkarez It's a PMV with Fort Knox by Goldfish.
I would love to see one that puts like, all three of the first generations together lol
UGGH
13which has its own circle of dub hell
It hurts.
With BW2
4kids
Shisuka can always use some bebop
Boo
13anyway the 2001 pioneer dub for akira is pretty good
Okay. Thanks. :)
AJIsAwesome never mention that god awful company again
aw poo. I have to wait 2 years to pick Madagascar 3 for A.
I still havent forgiven 4kids for the yugioh movie
linsett: Poison Suction. :D
Shizuka: Then there's dubs that spoof the original or go in a whole another direction like Shin-Chan
13a few of the cast went on to do standalone complex so :3
I like how 4kids got so butthurt quickly by the gun episode
I hope they don't just go straight on to 6th generation though...
you can leave out Sinnoh I didn't like it that much
Pioneer, in general, did some good dubbing.
Pinkie Pie, stop being so adorable this instant.
that would be way too many freaking pokemon
Pokemon's gun episode.
:O
Sumica: What's the name of this video?

SodiumSodiumSodiumSodium Batman
did anyone know dat chuck norris is in his 70s
yeah

owloysius, Na
00,10this reminds me of a song from Jet moto
NewSuperBronyU once you've done can you tell us the name of the level so we can play it for a general amusement
?
fine, something else. What's the chemical formula for nitric oxide?
i just found dat out

owloysius, NO^2
11,02fuuuuuuuuuu

x.(\ drawing same size eyes is such a pain for me
DAAM SON
You can do it!!!
atleast you made a checkpoint, eh?
chalenging much
wooow xD thats hard xD
XD
Canadian_Brony gotta Party Hard even down there :P
Canadian_Brony: Festive lights
this is almost battletoads hard
owloysius, oh wait, nitric, i think that has something else in it
why does this remind me of a well textured super meat boy
I need to get this game. In the words of Scoot-Scootaloo, "MLG" .
Dang
11,02It's only $20 now >>
Yes!
taoumi because Saws... Sawn everywhere, and jumping off walls
Wrek, you there?
okay, last question. What's the chemical formula of sodium hypobromide?
yeah that's be it Lil_B
oni_link *sigh* unfortunately
Hydrogen, Argon, Molybdenum, Nitrogen, Yttrium...
owloysius, Na(some other things)
Canadian_Brony: ?
H3B or somthing like that, I'm not sure
05always Phase4
Nah, bro :P
Nitric Oxide is NO (I think) and I'm not sure about sodium hypobromide.
00,10ffs level
i mean sodium hypobromite..
/me Und dann no one guesses what I just did...
This game is such a troll but thats what is drawing me to it ...
Wrek, should i research astrophysics and get another planet or save up for the 4th level of hyperspace drive?
00,10this is like battle toads level of fuck you level
XD
Having fun? not anymore you're not
do ho ho ho XD
11,02I see what the game is trying to do, but I can't get it right ><
NewSuperBronyU, yeah, timing is a little tight
Polydunami: fine, i'll do it myself.
NewSuperBronyU it's because you aren't 13 anymore
oni_link I loathe MLG players. They think they're cool and then rage when they play anything besides CoD or Halo.
NewSuperBronyU, i think you need to bounce of that things head and hover
Scoots wreaks of MLG
or not
ignore me
00,10cant ledge grab at all
11,02Phase4: That's what you need to do :)
Phase4 I'm not ignoring you.
You can do it SB !!!!!!
Canadian_Brony: DOesn't he say MLG to make fun of MLGs?
Canadian_Brony: Ohhhh, yeah. LOL. but oh well to each his own. I just play for fun
oh wow, i see
i ment the earlier one but thats cool
meh...not getting to sleep anytime soon - another insomnia spell :S
00,10you ledge grab you loose
Cypresswolf: I know that feeling. :(
imperfect performance? YOU LOOSE
^
theres no chance for recovery here, have to perfect it
Cypresswolf /me casts insomnius maximus on Cypresswolf
At least it's unlimited lives.
AJIsAwesome I would ask him myself if that's the truth, but being Scoots, I can already tell he'll deny even the thought.
Very Super Meat Boy esque
Cypresswolf: same here :(
00,10was thinking the same thing oni_link
Well this IS the hardest level in the game.
usually happens when Im under great stress
Some games it's play through another 70 levels if you loose all yoru lives.
made it
Or if anyone remembered, I wanna be the guy.
oni_link and this isn't even his this Level's final Form, yet!
bravo goodsir
Lil_B: oh gawd
spikey hat
oni_link I never got past level one of IWBTG :/
Your perfection must reach perfect levelsof perfection to compleete this level.
00,10IWTBTG had levels?
Lil_B: Its sitting in a folder in my desktop, collecting dust XD
/me tries to remember if DKCR was this hard
Sumica: eeyup also theres a beta for the sequel
CComplete this to make asian Dad proud
I always hated platform jumper games
Avoid th woman.
Sumica: IWBTG had more then one screen? :S
00,10hey Phase4, use your leet hacking skills and figure out how to get video out on the PS vita
SHe'll ALWAYS hit you.
I know DKC 2 hadf rather insane parts in the later levels
11,02This must be the final you take at Medical School.
IWTBTG: Gaiden I think
at this rate, Ill the meet up plans at the Ren Fest for tomorrow - I can still go sunday, but Ill miss out on the burning pony tomorrow night

11,02Night owloysius :)

Just because I've been hearing this song long enough, I must make a looped version. When I learn the name that is.
Sumica, seems sony is very actively fighting hackers on the ps vita
Cypresswolf: Okay. I was very close to getting to go, but my father has a business trip to attend in Denmark.
Sumica, unless theres a builtin app to play video your probably stuffed
Sumica, oh wait, video OUT, i'ma derp
AJIsAwesome: There's Oni Con next weekend in Galveston
Cypresswolf: Nice! I'll see what I can do. Thanks. :)
00,10and yeah they are fighting it and failing Phase4
Sumica: Isn't there an option for that by connecting to a PS3?
00,10a developer released an ISO reader app
00,10that dose me no good oni_link
Sony always fights really hard so people don't use their Stuff in ways they didn't intend to, even if it was legal what they were doing :/
Sumica: Yeah, I'm just trying to remember. I think there was a video out cable one could buy. Unless I'm thinking of the PSP now
/me pictures SB raging and storming around his rom
Sumica, looks like theres no internal video out, probably he cpu
dero
derp'
Lil_B: Like Linux in a PS3?
and i couldn't fault him for it
oni_link yeah , that's the best example
Oh wow troll fire
SB64 just went MLG Pro there xD
bu bumbum bum bumbum bumbum
These Flames look so good... gotta love this Style >.<
this game reminds me of mega run
NewSuperBronyU: Veer to the far left instead of hugging the wall.
00,10yeah there is mods for the psp Phase4 that lest you use the USB port as a video out
That way you can get poast without getting crushed.
Sumica, use the what now?
*past
psh. Rayman Legends had better be harder than this
btw, the whole western Style music of this level is in one SDong in the Soundtrack called "Rayman Origins Music: Land of the Livid Dead ~ Nowhere to Run" I reccoment checking it out later if you like it : )
00,10on the PSP the micro usb port can be used as a signal out
Lil_B thanks
00,10the data port is the only port besides the.5mm jack for sound
no prop Mutterguy
yep totaly rage quit out of killing floor there
well i believe im a bit OP in paper mario currently
well... the floor is pretty much Lava ... and the wallss and the ceiling
Land of the Livid Dead ~ Chasing a Dream is my favorite song so far :3 in Origins
00,10it has like 5 card ports but just the data port for actal in and out signals
Lil_B: TTYD
05sumi
05whens the servers gona be back up?
00,10It even has a damn Sim card
00,10not sure wrek
00,10what time did it say?
Sumica it had a Sim slot??
and we hear real music aaaaaannnd it's gone
05it didnt
00,10yeah oni_link I can use it as a phone
Wow.
Yay I love this music
AJIsAwesome: well you know the boss Macho Grubba? i managed to beat him in 4 turns....
I think it's strange that the memory Card Slot is litterely just a SD Card Slot, just with swapped Pins, so they can charge you extremnly high prices for it :/
AJIsAwesome: also managed to deafeat Rawk Hawk in 2 turns :D
00,10it's usealy 5 hours wrek
Rayman, meet bullet hell via fireballs
Sumica, theres an unknown fujitsu chip oposit the screen connector, it MIGHT handle video and if so its not imposible theres video out on the usb port, but i'd need access to an open ps vita to check
?
WTF is that thing?
Ladies and Gentlemen: The SUPERBOSS of this game.
what in the name of god
11,02Big Mamma
Kill it! Kill it with . . .
she's...very big
Just kill it!
Johnny Bravo would still hit it
Canadian_Brony: Kill it with pliers
Sumica, i'm actually not sure what ports what, the one next to the headphone port
:D
00,10Screen Connecter Phase4?
00,10that's the data port
Sumica, the internal connector for the lcd
00,10it's the only one it has
da faq is that?!
Ahahaha! It's painting its nails :D
Sumica, really? theres another connector on the other side of the motherboard
Well, that was a nightmare
00,10well yeah it has 4 ports for card readers
The way the boss moves reminds me of Yoshi's Story
THE EYES!
HIt the eyes!
alwewqa+
ddamnit...
always on the eyes*
Well, evidently, this creature needed an ungodly amount of eyes...
Oh, evolution. Why you so silly? :P
If I hear that damn thing sing one more time . . .
O____O
Sumica, nvm, i'm completely wrong, that was the cammera connector i was looking at, hard to tell from just images taken on awkward angles
:D
Wait, this thing is singing?
/me flips Phase4
XD I love its singing, it reminds me of the Gremlins
00,10ahh
00,10yeah it's got 2 cameras

11,02You should get this game on the PS Vita Sumica :)

00,10I might
Sumica, i heard about that, sounds interesting but also like its going to be abused by developers
cant make it out - *attempt to stand on head*
you should Get Retro City Rampage on the Vita :)
11,02Going to sit here for a minute :3
Such beautiful singing
:D

GAH

I heard Leons story was suppposed to be more like the older ones
D:
Not sure, the movies were all about action... God they were horrible movies...
Spectrum_Rush: but i dont have a head D:
After Resident Evil Revelations, it looked like RE might still remember what they were.
Anyone gonna answer my question?

oni_link so you mean it once actually had zombies in it?
so there
/me licks AdamTheDuck back :3
TheRandomkid321, define "tradtional"
traditional*
SUPER MEAT BOY :O
11,02Dat Dramatic Prairie Dog theme
AdamTheDuck like Dawn of The dead and stuff
TheRandomkid321: RE Zero, 1, 2 and if I remember 3 as well.
AdamTheDuck well I mean like 28 days later
I dont care what anyone says, the Gamecube remake of RE1 is the scariest game in the Resident Evil library
NewSuperBronyU I hate that they cancelled Super Meat Boy for the Wii, because the Game was too big, the maximum for WiiWare Titles are 40MB aand the lowest they could get was 42MB and Nintendo said NO
Lil_B: wow
2MB >.>
/me remembers the bathtub scene from Eternal Darkness
/me has not played Eternal Darkness
11,02The new limit on the 3DS is 2 GB
Whoa
oni_link so it didn't have all those tentacle ridden things and whatnot?
for memory?
AdamTheDuck I mean the games
TheRandomkid321, heh, not sure then. :P ponyshrug.jpg
NewSuperBronyU SO are you done streaming?
11,02TheRandomkid321: No o.o
11,02I'm streaming right now
o_o
TheRandomkid321: I can safely say that there were zombified dobermans, actual zombies,(not gun toting parasites) a chemically altered tree or giant plant and the hunters and eventually Tyrant.
Oh I got it now
00,10How odd, the lower bar on my firefox where noscript and AB+ is no longer showing up
Emmie finally found the Binary Tool, now I would only need a Binary Ereaser xD
00,10ah I see, some how disabled my addon bar
make the change to IE today >.>
After seeing soem of the games PETA has made I can safely say they are all fucked up phsycopaths.
Well everyone, I think Im off for the night. Thanks for the tips Sumica and thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU :)
ya don't say
bai oni_link
11,02Night oni_link :)
nite oni_link
g'night oni_link
good night oni_link :)
00,10hey cool they have an offical wiki for planet side 2 now
Goodnight oni_link
If I still did dress-up, I'd go as PETA-Ash
I have not yet played their pokemon agme. BRB
IE9 is actually not bad, it may not fully hold up to the others, but it can do everything, is quite Tweakable and can be vbery secure if you care to take a Look into the options
but I'll stay with Maxthon 3 xD
whining about SM3DL's Tanooki Suit 20+ years after it was first introduced. Now whining about Pokemon 15 year after the fact
...
I wonder how many people at PETA actually played some of these games, because I dodn't think it's a small percentage
Its funny because BW raises the exact same issues PETA has in its story
i'll just say this, Peta is still relevant?
I didn't even knew they existed xD
wat
Tovler: more like Animal WRONGS Group amirite?
PETA still does the sex-sells thing even though that gimmick died 10 years ago
I hate my controller, I found out I can't beat the second last stage because thge delay of me pressing the button and the game registering is just too big >.>
at least the music doesn't reset when you die
itd be cooler if his body skidded down the spikes instead of exploding.
There actually is a Psoido-3D Super Meat Boy Game
pseudo
thanks i didn't knew howe to spell it :/
In the Arcade in Retro City Rampage is a Bit.Trip Runner and a Super Meat Boy Game both again with remixes of their original music
hey
this game is for masochists
Hello DaringDerpy
hi DaringDerpy
hey DaringDerpy
I would have ragequitted half a minute ago ^^
oh. so that's how you pronounce Regina. o_o
I'm back and PETAs pokemon game is dumb. They obviously have NEVER watched or pokemon.
11,02FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
PETA?
and you said this was easy, eh?
so I was just browsing Memebase when I found this nice PETA releated Picture :/
sounds like it's loaded with political propaganda and not much else
Peeta from Hunger Games
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/11/NUfEs-Z-CkawvQk4QGfCdQ2.jpg
political?
maybe it's tl;dr
Tovler please please PLEASE tell me you read the books first!
If at al!l
Oi!
What's up?
I'd never read books about Regina.
"The Hunger Games"
Lil_B: DAT TROLLING :D

the last bit of this level looks like real FUN
I really don't get it; do you stick to the ceiling?
Evidently not :P
Also, this reminds me of the underground theme from SMB2 at points
/me says hi for the first time even tho he's been here for 11 hours

Wait, not that. I mean the Desert Land from SMB3

Maybe even 2
Well, my Tetris CD finally arrived, and it sounds 90's xD nothin special, but I can dig it :)
Sorry, I hate myself right now :P
N4X That's odd. I'm on here often. And I have been for several months.
I may come across as a prick at times
Really?
TheRandomkid321 : Maybe we were online but to different times
I'm not sure
Am I the only one who gets aggrivated by flutterchus randomness? ironic isn't it?
No you're not alone TheRandomkid321 :P
But I believe I saw you atleast once in the chat,but again: I only believe
Flutterwho?
:3
But aggrovated is a bit of a strong word
N4X Now that you mention it I may have seen you once.
I'm more midly annoyed at the random pictures he/she keeps linking
It's a possibility
But sometimes they're not random.
Want a tissue diddums?
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
/me licks Jmo :P
The only person I definitely know I've talked to at least once is XAX
Oh you
Where's alexxm?
As Jmo would say
Kiwi! :<
N4X: Oh hi there.
ew kiwi
sif you'd talk to him
Hey!
I don't like Flutterchu's attitude sometimes, but so far there have been no fights or serious insulting so I'm still neutrrral to everyone :)
Yeah, I've been here going on ten months and I don't remember and N4X :S
*any
Lil_B : Is Flutterchu another user or what?
N4X yes
N4X, yeah.
No problem Polydunami!

Since when
yes it is
TELL ME NOW
I need to know
Link me
JRP they said "We are currerntly developing a Game for the WiiUZ which everyone wants us to do" and since all they did so far was Metroid Prime and Donkey Kong Country it's rather obvious xD
11,02Donkey Kong Party
But
It has to be made by "retro studios"
Donkey Conk Country Returns*
ah
copo;
They had a great engin
cool
sorry

Game engin I will scream

damn that moon song is stuck in my head now

Net split
you guys want to knwo what I literally cannot stop listening to?
thishttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIwV23ta3I
umm
and now i'm whistling it involuntarily
this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIwV23ta3I
there
/me stops
Don't say the fucking song name
If I know what your gonna say
buggy keyboard
Canadian_Brony, :$ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Jfctt1b8o
O_____O
Obligatory "dat intro"
yeah
and suddenly full-on choir
oohhh, that Rainbow Factory violin sends chills down my spine
are these samples? because it sounds amazing
"This is a symphonic cover of multiple songs by WoodenToaster, also known as Glaze."
Glaze/WoodenToaster makes amazing music
Rainbow Factory, Beyond her Garden, Pinkie's Lie, Awoken, Nightmare Night to name a few
and those are only his brony songs
Hey listen awoken its pretty badass song
I got the underlying meaning first time I heard it
NewSuperBronyU: no zzz
TBH, I was biased towards the brony community at first, but I never said it to anyone.
I hate listening to songs artists like this, gets me as a new guy in mmusic all envyus xD
anyways, back to Minecraft
11 years as a musician and I'm kinda envious
I sing and that's it
Wirisme when did you start to compose?
I can't remember, I think around 14ish, but I don't really do it anymore
I really should get back into it
I think I started about a year ago now, my music isn't that good but I try my best
Wirisme do it, it's fun to share it with people :)
:) you're probably better than me actually
probably not, do you want a sample?
I'd love to hear :)
ok :) I'll PM
I have a huge problem of making everything more complicated than it needs to be, so it just ends up a big mess in the end :p
I sang in a school choir for 4 years, but I was dissapointed to find my high school didn't have one as well. I haven't sang in public for almost 3 years
I'm definitely not a singer ;p
:p*
my voice isn't what it used to be, but I can still hold a tune. Heck, I agreed to sing at my local hospital next week during my volunteer shift.
"Come Little Children"
hoping to get musical accompiament, otherwise it will be extremely difficult
as if it isn't hard enough, me being male and the lead singer being a female in song
-runs down hall, four zombiedogs chasing him- Penumbra, why did I invest in this mess!!!
Canadian_Brony Hope it goes well, would love to hear you sing :) maybe get a mic to record it
all I have is a 3DS, which doesn't take very good audio or video, and a webcam, which isn't the best either
-gallops down the hall again, 12 dogs on his hind this time- I DIDN'T DO IT! that was not my jerky! I did not smack you with it TAT
/me has become dog food
STREam
*STREAm
dah
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu goed scared me

08,01i literally found this card
streamception
08,01so basically, i replaced the original wifi card in my laptop, because i run Mac OS on it, and needed a Mac OS compatible wifi card
08,01but twice now, the card i've put in has failed
08,01so i replaced it with a cheap, crappy card
im back with snacks :$
08,01but that card went buggerup when i unplugged the laptop from the power
08,01making me lose network connectivity when on battery power

08,01and there were a few broken imacs

08,01and the wifi on them is a laptop mini PCI-E card
Aw man. I want to play Mc again.

MadSurge, you know, you asked me who my favourite pony was but I never got the chance for your opionion. :P
therainbowvortex: someone wrote up on a whiteboard the youtube address of an episode
and i was hooked
flutterbutt: awsome
Ohai flyingace11
i spent 3 nights blitzing through bother seasons
Colt_Brovakiin MadSurge AdamTheDuck Thanks!
*both
AdamTheDuck: Pinkie! But Fluttershy comes to a real close :)
fluttershy is best pony
Pfffft
I'm partial to Twiley.
Spike is best pony
I am the best pony :3
so whens season 3 out
TWILIGHT AND LUNA ARE BEST PONY
:)
i can identify with fluttershy, because when i was younger, i was quite shy
But I love them all.
But there can only be 1 best poneh :<
And when I say "partial", I mean that I have a list of the Mane 6 in order of which ones I like the most, along with descriptions of why.
There is no best pony, it is all down to personal preference :)
AND relatability
Lies!
Spike is best poneh!
also, i'm terrified of dragons
ALL ARE BEST PONEH
AdamTheDuck: their is no true best pony there all just as good as each outher
discord is the best pony :3
urgh, i hate saturdays here
there's nothing to doooo
Well it is 7:30
/me lives in a tiny little town in scotland
Wait a month or two. Then you'll see just how great Saturdays are.
Kammerjunk: who's top and bottom?
need music
OOOOOH
that works
all there is to do here is drink alcohol
flyingace11: east coast?
FUN.
Yeah, Miami
and lounge on a freezing beach
MadSurge: Twiley and Applejack, respectively. Honestly, AJ and Rarity should share the spot, but then I would only have 5 entries.
and find men
flutterbutt: when i 1st became a brony i beat up a good friend for laughing at me i feel bad :(:(
That's not to say I don't like AJ or Rarity, though.
but they are usually drunk
I just like the other ones more.
therainbowvortex: it's okay, you did it out of love
Kammerjunk: just your least favorites
FUN BLEASE PHASE
MadSurge: Exactly.
flutterbutt: oh lol
*+Phase4
flutterbutt: But yeah, you'll probably come to like Saturdays. That's when new episodes come out.
don't call them punches, call them love landings.
?
Damnit Phase4, I was about to link a song :$
Fun.
too late :P
pinkie pie is so awsome i just want to hug her
Ok :$
Kammerjunk: even RD has her moments (my least favorite)
Pinkie is my second favoruite pony
i love happy bouncy people like that
^
Dashie's actually second on my list with Pinkie being third. I don't know, I think I just consider her more adorable than awesome.

11,01Hey Bronysith.
SO MUCH DEAD
so where is everyone
how was getting violated by molestia alexxm ?

11,01I wonder if most everyone is still asleep.
11,01Or distracted too.
mostly distracted
i was playing tf2
it was good Bronysith
i'm awake. did i miss stuff?
well the chats mostly dead Dark_Horst
oh look, a tumbleweed!
uh... here is a cool song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcUJ1tDqDA
GEMA appearantly doesnt think so

who the hell are GEMA and can we kill them
Good morning
Afternoon.
Its afternoon
how are things Ponies47
It's morning here
Not in all parts of the world.
Ok alexxm. You?
i'm good Ponies47 did you draw that picture yet?
nice
Manes are very difficult to draw ._.
Dead Bstate is dead
>.>
<.<
NEKKID TIME
o u
Bronysith: No -_-
YES
no
Nope.avi
Hey everypony
ah, a new person to sortof talk a little
Hey RainbowPie
also hey, RainbowPie
lol not normally much on stream this time of week so naturally very few peoplep talking.
Lunac: by this time of week you mean the morning on weekend?
is anyone good with computers here? :3
RainbowPie: probably
No early afternoon anytime in the week
GMT of course
Ponies47: its like 9 am here on the east coast
RainbowPie: Phase4 is pretty good with PC's
Well im looking for bootmgr, but its not in my C:\ .. any idea where it would be?
cowvarkian: Little past 8:00 AM here
RainbowPie, its stored on a different partition, why are you looking for bootmgr?
11,01Maybe it's hidden.
11,01Do you have your hidden folders shown?
11,01Nvm,
Phase4, Ive looked on all my partitions its no there
Nittany_Discord, I was going to customize it. I did it for my last laptop
What is with cats walking up on computer equipment? ._.
Anyone streaming? It;s a hame we can;t just input a You Tube playlist and play it.
Nittany_Discord, sorry that last message was for Phase4 haha yeah i'm showing hidden folders
Keyboards are so damn comfy.
RainbowPie, system partition, its normally not mapped, i can tell you how to get to it but would like to know why first
Phase4: Im customizing the boot up screen
that can break everything, but if your sure
RainbowPie, in the start menu, type 'computer managment', should come up with one result
I did 'bcdedit' in cmd and it says tha path is in "\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
thats an nt native path, useless to you cause windows is in the way
ah okay
Phase4: So i open computer management
RainbowPie, once you get computer managment open, there should be a list on the left
click disk managment
yep
RainbowPie, from there you should see a partition called 'system reserved'
ok.....i'M Back! who's on Skype?
you see it?
uhm nope
ok.... i'm not sure where you are then
windows 7 right?
theres my 2 hard disks and a "(EFI System Partition)"
yes
Do you have team viewer? maybe you can take a look for youself
you might see something im not seeing
ok, does the efi system partition have a drive letter?
i'll start teamviewer if you want
okay
Ill Private Message you the details
Thats a new shipping I never saw before
Rainbow X Pinkie
hehe
/me Slaps DerpyMuffins
No -_-
Whats wrong with that shipping?
Applejack + Pinkie Pie = ApplePie
twiluna is great shipping
Twixie is where its at
also great r34 *COUGH COUGH COUGH*
DerpyMuffins: This.
Also, I kinda like TwiShy.
Flutterjack is non-existant
Yup
They just dont go together
i like twiluna the best
Twilestia is better
twilestia was a very good clopfic
Wait, why are there so many Twi shipping?
I don't like r34
DerpyMuffins: Because adorkableness.
Twilight is like otakon
imagine everyone trying to think of a canon time Flutterjack were together.
I don't care about R34. I just ignore it
08,01i do.
Twilight X everyone basicly
It doesn't ruin the show for me but I just don't like it
08,01but no r34 talk in here
fair enough
08,01or else i swing my massive, hard, throbbing banhammer
oh my
Throbbing?
O.O
Its waiting to explode and ban everyone
hallo everypony o.o
08,01throbbing.
Yeah, let's not go there.
08,01you heard me.
hello LightTrooper105
08,01it throbs.
how?
I dont want to know
08,01LightTrooper105: it's made of meat
^
even Pinkiedash existed in Griffon the Brush off and Party of One
08,01living meat
tmi
08,01inb4 gasp
That reminds me of a TF2 Bat model+skin I once saw.
Hello LightTrooper105
well that just plain disturbing..
08,01it's basically like a Leviathan from Farscape
08,01except it's a banhammer
Well, I don't recall Leviathans throbbing much. They're kind of biomechanical anyway.
ok..
YAY, downloading Wakfu
This chat takes such lovely turns.
indeed..
08,01and now, a stream
test
08,01hi Alister|Asleep
a stream? o.o
lol..
Uh oh.
It's just an external drive, right?
probably stolen by garden gnomes
haha
the kill your family show <3
Ponies47: hes intelligent
08,01this guy is AMAZING
huh what is this
11,01cowvarkian is eating frozen Indians.
aand suddenly Bagpipes Oo
wut
that, my freind, is a bagpipe
Nittany_Discord: totally
hmm brb
11,01Mmm. Dark meat.
08,01this is ancient instruments being played by an awesome dude called David Munrow
08,01who is now, sadly, dead
If in heaven you have a harp inhell you have bapipes
08,01but he was a right character
what did hw siw of
08,01and an absolutely fantastic musician
what did he die of
Bagpipes are mis treated
08,01alexxm: he committed suicide
Miss
my dad loved the german anthem yesterday in the soocer match VS Irland
because it had Bagpipes :)
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks bagpipes sound pretty good
08,01so these are all ancient instruments from different parts of the world
08,01and ancient tunes
In some circumstances, at any rate.
I really like the jew harp
if that's what it's called
08,01all from generally about 1400 - 1650
Lil_B: >.> for some reason I dont think its called that anymore
Reed pipes?
hello everypony
hm. so that's what a clavichord is
cowvarkian but that's the only namw for it I know :/
Lil_B: meh, i dunno
08,01this is a french/celtic harp
08,01also known as a clarsach
A french harp?
Well, it's still called a jew harp.
Lil_B: maultrommel. there, now you nhave a new one^^
But it's also called a jaw harp, mouth harp, or even trump.
Dark_Horst xD but it's hardly a Trommel xD
08,01cowvarkian: sackbutt, and i think so
08,01unless i'm thinking of a different video
Viola?
08,01these are insturments called viols
alexxm: Not bad, plan to watch Expendables 2 this evening.
08,01they're more like guitars and double basses than violins and cellos
08,01i actually used to be in a viol consort
How was it?
Lil_B: not really. but hey, they named stuff funny back then
08,01i got to play a few 300 and 400 year old viols
Isn't a viol just any one of a family of that kind of instrument?
Dark_Horst "Dudelsack"
08,01Kammerjunk: yup
08,01these are two tenor viols, i think
Lil_B: for instance
Lil_B: thanks for making me spit up my food
cowvarkian wut? xD
cowvarkian: that's the word for bagpipe, btw^^
08,01nah, actually, i think it's neither
08,01i've no idea what that is
I need to show these to my music teacher who knows nothing about music
08,01Lil_B: aye
Its a lyre if I remember correctly
08,01but mandolins are double stringed
08,01String_Shredder: maybe
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350092970628.png
Bronysith: have a heart attack, because something impossible happened
the Zither :) ... I love it in the Third Man xD
suddenly i feel like im playing Legend of Dragoon
/me 08,01wishes he remembered more about his medieval music
08,01i used to specialise in baroque music, actually
08,01hence the viols
08,01Bronysith: aye, he was absolutely awesome; i'd have *loved* to meet him
i like this style of music
Bronysith: good
man, that's a big tambourine
He is rocking this instrument like crazy xD
inb4 gif
08,01Bronysith: he actually made a series about medieval music; i'll see if i can get hold of it and stream it
i think i saw those horns on medieval paintings
dont remmber where they came fromt hough
Bronysith: I remember that...
wizard...
silly word
08,01oh, also, i'm a a bit obsessed with bells
08,01i find bells amazing
05andrew bell
05harr darr
Wrek: ohai wrek
08,01because they don't produce a note, they produce (essentially) a chord
Dat weak joke
I like Bells, but I can only Find Tabular Bells Samples, I want really big Church Bell Samples
hi Wrek how goes the plushie cuddles?
Wrek: I'm assuming I shouldn't mention the conversation we had last night about shipping otakon
is that some sort of organ or a mellotron he's playing in the background?
05the plushie cuddles are errywhere
08,01there's an instrument called a carilon, which is a load of bells with hammers attached to a keyboard of levers
08,01you hit the levers to play the bells
String_Shredder: mellotron... that sounds like a bad transformer
08,01i got to play on one in a church in amsterdam when i visit my boyfriend last month
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350100365388.jpg
08,01String_Shredder: it's an organ
and bronysith still placing out of context pictures
08,01String_Shredder: melotrons weren'yt invented until the 60s, i think
that looks like a bagpipe, but different
No one has made a NMM Plushie yet surprisingly
I once saw someone trying to make Jazz via a Bagpipe, it didn't work... it just didn't Swing
I would kill for one
Yeah, but they could have one just in case they couldn't find threal instument.
08,01so far as i remember, a mellotron is an electronic insturment that uses tapes
*the real
08,01medieval music is really fascinating
08,01or buy David Munrow's series about it
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350107949861.gif
he's going hardcore into that recorder
playing it quite well
08,01Lil_B: David Munrow
08,01also, i don't think people appreciate how awesome recorders are
08,01in the UK, we're forced to learn them at school
....i think we once had that string instrument he's playing there once in our cellar
08,01in primary school
was hopelessy broken though as far as i can remmber
What in the blue hell is this
there we go
08,01but they're actually a legit and awesome baroque insturment
08,01when i was at music school, one of my friends was a first-study recorder player
if a "Recorder" is a Blockflöte in Germany, than yes, most Joung Kids in Primary School who play an instrument play this particular one
SuperSanjitenks1989: mediaval music
08,01Lil_B: blockflote, aye
/me 08,01can't type umlauts
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350111977863.gif
killing and dying and stuff
Yay crimmus
oh, those. i aced them in music class. as far as the standart went. meaning i was just the least bad player in the room xD
and this is why people suck
How's it going evepony :D
08,01aye
whats the black dudes ability?
08,01cowvarkian: >.>
Lil_B: to be an asshat
simon begins
no wait, everyones an asshat on this show
we just witnessed sfw porn
Lil_B: he can rewind time
hey, latin
i don't like that\
Lil_B: not travel, just rewind
work for money
good song
Dark_Horst ah... I don'Ät quite get the concept, but ok :/
Zapped by lightning and got super powers.
easy concept
:>
<.<
Kandarihu: thats what you think
:D
Lil_B: instead of travelling back with all the paradox bullshit of parallel timelines and meeting yourself and whatnot, he just rewinds everthing
Lil_B: like a magic remote
a bearded man, a virgin, and a horny donkey
SuperSanjitenks1989: a porno?
Dark_Horst so we can say, he does something and X happens, he can rewind everythin, and do something so X doesn't happen?
yep
so drink water, beer just dehydrates you
he still rmembers it happened though, which makes it usefull
I'm back!.......who is on Skype?
cowvarkian, but the live episodes are coming on the HUB next hour. Sumica's been streaming it live to get used to it for when S3 premiers
so far it only actuvated when his friends died though
or drink destilled water, it will dehydrate you even more xD
Kandarihu: I know
Lil_B: >.>
08,01oh
Hello?
Kandarihu: I wasn't actually being sincere
just drink saltwater
08,01Kandarihu: he is?
cowvarkian also, in the medical times, it was safer to get your H2O via Beer than water because the Breweries mostly got fresh water insetad of the infekted Waters elsewhere :P
why did I even bother to write this?
"dont wanna poke the baby in the exe"
08,01Kandarihu: what's he streaming?
*eye
Lil_B: no clue
This show looks really messed up
sex
alexxm hello? you're the only one i can speak to......
sex everywhere
08,01Kandarihu: he's not on the stream queue at the moment; if he's got something planned, i'll vacate
Pony episodes as they air on the HUB
what happend Dark92Enigma
thats one awesome power company
08,01oh okay
Unless he's not here this morning
I'm not sure if he's even awake right now
they are approaching the Matrix Movie or what?
ah, a power
not the power
6Hey ^^
6How you doing?
alexxm Is it me.....or chat is moving too fast when i asked who was on Skype
i don't think so
Lil_B, the movies of The Matrix? I liked the first one. But I hear that the sequels weren't so good. >_>
08,01well, i've messaged him
08,01i'm not sure if he's actually around, thoug
Guess he must have overslept this week
Kandarihu: i haven't watced the II OR the III for that matter
Kandarihu I only knew some scenes here and there, I somehow missed ALL the classic Movies everyone knows
Lil_B: lion king?
OH, NO......THEY''RE DOING HAND SEX LIKE IN FERNGULLY!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
Dark92Enigma: o u
cowvarkian ok, excewpt Disney Movies >.<
Dark92Enigma, neither have I. I even skipped out on it during the Trilogy Event.
Dark92Enigma: I get that obscure refrence

Lyra`: I hear you're also a person

I'm doing great, and you?
"He touched m,e and then it was gone!" that could be a lot of other sthings
I didn't see you here for a long time
Lil_B: >.>
this show has a minimum of one sex scene per episode.
cowvarkian <.<
08,01Lyra`: some don't!
Lyra`: didnt we already fill that quota?
Kandarihu: oh.....and what it followed next?
11,01Hi Lyra`.
name 3.
maybe I just wasn't online that time
oh hai Nittany_Discord
hey Nittany_Discord :)
Maybe I should have told Sumi something like "See you in the morning" last night when he signed off, then he would have said something to me if he wasn't going to be around this morning
I can't be too gung ho about this. He knows about my fasting.
<.<
11,01Hey Lil_B.

6Nah..I just didn't have a computer,that's why :P
super star
HEY........that's Criss Angel's TERRITORY
LOL
haha
Yep
However, considering the fact that Hasbro just gave out a number of promotionals for Season 3, the chances of an ad for it announcing the premier date is considerably higher.
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: must be me streaming?
/me hugs Jmo and Lil_B
AND HIS FRIEND PETER!!!!!! WOOOO!
mind freak
and then he falls in
Was he Jesus?
must admit, this show has ... whhere did the scene go?!

Dark92Enigma: duh
cowvarkian: must be a side effect of the HAND-SEX
>.>
This show is fucked up and in more than one way
08,01DerpyMuffins: it really is
DerpyMuffins: hmm
08,01but it's also wonderful
fair more experience loover
he's so nice :D
This guy......is like Denny from The Room....
such a nice guy :3
So Santa is giving out condoms?
I don't really like this show much :/
he seems to have no mental concept of "too much information"
but it has quite the greyscale
08,01DerpyMuffins: cough sweets
What's the name of this show again?
08,01really, really strong cough sweets
08,01called Fisherman's Friends
didn't have computer? was broken?

Jesus was also a very sad looking guy. Have you ever seen a picture of him smiling. And I am not talking about buddy Jesus
Zombies are less of who they were when they were alive.
Budy Jesus rocks btw
Barbetos|AtWork, you're talking about the artwork.
I have one very old pc (but I don't use it) and it is broken all the time.
Yeah. I suppose "official" art
no but there is a guy calling himself jesus
There is a lot of fan fics out there about him.
and fan art.
Often it is because of HDD.
XD
yeah but what if there is a general zod
Okay I am goign to stop.

BRB
i was working saftey on an artillery exercise a few weeks back
Lyra`: >.>

and this 12b was chewing on a blasting cap.
That's just me >.>
im reading a book in the back of the FLA
oh i see why she did that
Lyra`: oh dear... i see where this is going...
o_o
and i hear a BOOM!
She does not want him to die
08,01what's a 12b?
people start screaming for a MEDIC!
and she saw them losing their powers as a way of saving him.
Lyra`: dude, i've seen what the Japanese did to captured soldiers in Iwo Jima in pictures, i've seen the products of vicious predator attacks, i've seen a man being DISINTEGRATED.

Hello There
FlutterMEDIC: have you actually seen it, or just seen it in pictures
Tanks guys <3
so i jump up, start running, and i see a group of people huddled around a guy
all i can see is the legs
cowvarkian: LOTS of pictures
oh hai mark!
FlutterMEDIC: I don't think that exactly compares
i start pushing people out of the way, and when i get a good look at him, i see that hes blown off his lower jaw, and his face was split up the middle.
i could see his esophagus and tracheal tubes.
Lyra`: damn.
08,01Lyra`: did he died?
his tongue was hanging by a scrap of muscle, but still twitching.
now is this really nessecary this conversation
well, yeah, eventually he killed himself.
08,01eventually?
i must have sat there packing quick clot gauze into his wound for a good 5 minutes.
Lyra`: damn
Lyra`: killed himself?
he just wouldnt stop bleeding.
Lyra`: where were you
yeah, he survived.
ah he's billy numerous
so, what is a 12b and how did he thing chewing blasting caps was a good idea?
Lyra`: I know it was just an excerise, but was it on the field, or at a base
but he didnt have a face anymore, and he looked like a monster out of dead space.
so 3 weeks later, he killed himself with his own IV tubing.
Lyra`: damn
a 12b is field artillery opperator.
it was on post
Lyra`: which one?
id rather not say, never know where stalkers my be :3
Lyra`: heh, alright
08,01Lyra`: i'd stalk the hell out of oyu

Before anypony starts to object, that's exactly what people thought about tobaco back then. There was no awareness of carcenogens, and smoking was seen as a harmless-- and sometimes benificial-- habit.

I like ponies :3
Ponies47: we all do
wat?
People like ponies?
Thats a thing?
Ponies47 never would have guessed XD
to be~
Ponies47 That's why you're here
or not to be
LordDerpington yeah :/ way of making fun of people I guess
Ponies47 hard to imagine
OR NOT TO BE
When ever I see this, I think of Dan Bull's King's Speech rap :D
MKAY
"To talk. Or not to talk"
That is the question.
To watch
or not to watch
so is the issue that he can't read aloud?
how long is this movie?
to read or not to read
To pee or not to pee.
Hi tech!
to ship, or not to ship
high tech
Evening gentlemen.
not to ship
LordDerpington: Just like dyslexia is hard to spell for people with dyslexia?
headphones?
to watch ponies or not to watch ponies
"It's gonna make pirating music much easier."

Hello Combustiblelemons

Remember when SuperBrony64 trolled us by playing his old SNES games poorly and ragequitting?
thats it
Indeed, Kammerjunk
hi Combustiblelemons
I want to be rich
and now for some classical music~
rdibp|evil wins
hi Combustiblelemons
Hi, Combustiblelemons. :)
The Prince isn't used to this. At ALL.
headphines in the 1800s?
11,01Princess?
hi Combustiblelemons :)
Princes
Kandarihu, I still despise that
tis not the 1800s
rdibp|evil: It's in the 1930s.
1930s, isn't it?
rdibp|evil: 1800's?
WITH THE LEMONS
was using headphones, ears just died a little
it's the 1930s
This isn't the 1800s
This will be fun
it's after WWI
it looks like the 1800s
its 1934
thats why I never turn my Volume fully up :P
not much
It looks nothing like the 1800s.
its england, everything looks old
Guess who loses the bet.
00,10you know I bet it was't clasical to them
POCUS
Well it isn't
woah rdibp|evil you need to revise your history
1800's would look more like in Sherlock Holmes movie.
00,10they probably called it new age
this is not the 1800s, and headphones were invented in 19 century
1800s think what blackadder the third looks like
Sumica: beethoven lived 2 centuries before them though
dat yay
yay
11,01~yay~
yay
rdibp|evil: He was talking about the recordable gramophone.
louder!
This is sometime between 1925-1936. Headphones were invented. Headphone rape wouldn't come until a better part of a century later... on Youtube
The frames
Because sound recording wasn't invented until after 1900s
what.. is going on?
He spoke wonderfully.
1934

Conyst: in spite of his wings.
CrimsonPhoenix: True, but there's a difference between being stupid and not knowing.
i am the champion of unova
Incoming

Lil_B, I am whole ear :D

Best part
"Did some one ask for pony in here?"
it's the scottish play
XD
CREEPER!

DAYUM

Invi: i think the expression is 'i am all ears'

Here's Barbossa!
Thatsssssssssssssssssssssssssssss a nice
ohai
Dat image needed a buffer lol
I have big thumbs.
BronyInstrumental, wait, that is an actual english expression? :D
gif moment
wooo Geoffrey Rush
There is nothing wrong with being an egghead.
Gah dad
Invi: yes, it is. it means you're listening :D
13unless your head is literally an egg, in which case you should see a doctor
BronyInstrumental, yeah it's also a german one ^^
I might buy a car today
Invi I found a name, a name I used since years now and even my YT channel is called, KonsolN
Shizuka: imma doctor
BronyInstrumental, but with just 1 ear ^^
The world as we know it will be destroyed by then, probably. Question is, will it have been destroyed 76 years ago, or something like 50 or 30 years before such a year.
Lil_B, KonsolN?
08,01i donj't get you guys sometimes
You guys need to sort out your elitist attitude towards new visitors. Theres no need for it.
Invi: well that's cool :)
08,01even the mods
yay
Invi yes
eggheads have better life
what's the matter egghead?
I'm new if that helps!
I never got me.
It's old but seems pretty decent
Awesome, you know which car your gonna get
08,01just because someone asks if ponies are going to be streamed, doesn't mean they are complaining
Combustiblelemons: Who're you calling egghead, eggface!
?
I only know I'm insane.
08,01people in here seem to get really agressive over the issue
That's mama luigi to you Kammerjunk !
It's a 2000 Honda Accord

Next episode air time is unknown.
we want g3.6!
I always end up fixing crap.
^
d3rb, SHUT. UP.
thanks Tom :3
I was definitely surprised that a site called 'bronystate' wasn't all ponies all the time...
My dad is with me because I know nothing about cars so they'll probably rip me off
/me sings the egg song for the eggy people.
[19:45] <Malmortius> Oh for god sakes, ive been coming here every day and not once have i seen my little pony
when I first showed up
That is complaining
C D PLAYER = model car
anyone seen nyria latley?
11,01Malmortius: Wait an hour more.
Not "Are you guy going to stream MLP any time soon?"
Now remember, Malmortius is NOT whining.
Tassadork, we aren't your typical bronies
I discovered Bronystate for the live new episode streams, but I stayed for the movies. And the chat, of course.
i'm with dari on this one
Tassadork: well, not everyone likes ponies 24/7 :)
LordDerpington, me too
theres always a negative connotation around used car salespeople.
Suddenly, a flamewar.
:P
My father died recently dum dum dumdum...
LordDerpington: Same here.
dumdumdum
"Complaining? I'm not complaining. THIS. Is. Complaining: <complain here>"
MadSurge: exactly. the diversity of stuff actually works out much better
Malmortius, the question gets asked that often that it gets old, if you had browsed over the about page or rules you would know about the frequency of eps shown
His first comment
People always come here and think im out to rip them off, even though I sell new trailers.
Malmortius, dont take it personaly
/me waits for Sumirage
Do dah! Do dah!
While I still believe everyone should read the FAQ, I still think it's better for everyone if the situation is calmly explained.
Five minutes till the first fan made ep starts
I guess he hears some noise in it or something so we're getting it checked out now
twilight_sprinkle, both have
hah
doctor who?
J_E_Smith71: Hmm?
to be honest no one reads the FAQ unless they're asked too :l not a good argument. i doubt most of you here read the FAQ to begin with.
I have the feeling that someone will be kicked....
Doctor Barbossa
Darn my sixth sense.
Smith71 what are you talking about?
Ok guys can you put this argument to a stop and enjoy the movie?
remember guys tolerate... oh also possibly love as well
Sing for us
*J_ESmith71
This was fun in the 30s?
btw is this movie based on real events?
Shouldnt we be enjoying the movie instead of arguing?
Malmortius, fun fact I did read FAQ, rules and the About Us when I was interested in the site
i mean the stuttering before the speech
twilight_sprinkle: yes
Combustiblelemons: chasing girls? sure
This is always fun.
DerpyMuffins, yes.
Love is more important than tolerance
personally, i dont love and tolerate. just ignore everyone
The movie is based on real events
no reads the faq unless asked to... I READ IT THE FIRST DAY I WAS HERE
twilight_sprinkle: yes
glueing planes together SirGanjalf :S
okay
08,01okay, well even if someone comes in and complains, that doesn't give anyone the right to blow up at them about it. the thing to do is to calmly explain that this is a brony streaming community, not an mlp stream
Malmortius, all this aside, welcome to bronystate, we are nice 90% of the time
Combustiblelemons: well some people, find this entertaining even today, so yes
Ooo modeling :)
Which is what most people did do?
08,01*not specifidcally an mlp stream
He sounds´
twilight_sprinkle in the words of the movie 300 "THIS IS" historically incorrect :P
Really drunk
think ill just watch from now on, im out.
ALRIGHT THAT IS ENOUGH! lets just watch the movie and put the past behind us OKAY!? :[
pot80 :D
pot80: wait so its not historically correct?
Also: 30's - when left handed people were worst people:(
*worse
left handers unite! woo!
We-don't-al-ways-stream-po-nies. Do dah Do dah
I tried putting a plane together once. The parts fell apart due to the glue :/
oh man I love reading this Youtube Comments... wait... this sin't youtube, this is Bronystate
twilight_sprincle it isnt exact events though some have been dramatised
[19:47] <CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously Malmortius explore the website a bit and you'll see what's Bronystate about
[19:47] <d3rb> Malmortius, only so many pony eps, it would get old
[19:48] <AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: It's not really an MLP site, more of a streaming site.
i heard error
shhh
Chucked it out of my bedroom window when it was done, fell like a stone.
[19:48] <Kammerjunk> Malmortius: No, this is for bronies who like watching films. What is currently streaming is movie night. When new episodes air, they will be streamed live here.
this scene has feels
Fun... not really at all.
Most comments seem fairly civil to me.
Combustiblelemons: you need strong glue for those
dem dari colours
:(
Man, this guy can sing.
yay, i was civil!
I feel quite important now
when did bronystate become youtube comment flame wars?
Lil_B: this is the internet
And that is missing the point.
Chat-is-get-ting-dis-stract-ing, oh the doo dah day
you're just filtering out all the negative comments.
Oh well.
i feel a banhammer-a-brewin'
Since when did this become 4 chan?
BronyInstrumental, so do I
Lil_B: :D
:O
Wow I thought my connection would be better back in the cities
inb4 censorship
BronyInstrumental, I can feel it in my back
ASoftFluffyThing: QUICK! To the bunker!
Kandarihu /)*(\
Malmortius: People explained to you that we don't show MLP all the time.
Guess I wad wrong :/
Lil_B: according to the movie we're in the UK :S
in before +m
inb4 fcc
*was
yes, and i said nothing more prince.
twilight_sprinkle it isnt exact events though, some have been dramatised (sorry got ur name wrong on first try)
why is this movie so quite?
inb4 inb4
inafter inb4
also remember what your buying… it is almost 13 years old.
/me hides in the bunker with BronyInstrumental
08,01also, Malmortius: people are explaining to you what we stream.
.... what the hell did I walk back in on???
rdibp|evil - GabeMoist: Dat timing.
Spectrum_Rush tuché
stralya
08,01don't get upset if that's not what you expected
/me hides in the anti-ban bunker with ASoftFluffyThing
when I was selling my '99 Rav4, people were looking at it and pointing out flaws like it was a new car
Hello Panda
I got the point long ago, guys... long ago. Like, within the first 3 sentences.
Lil_B: *touche :S
inb4 mod rage
hai Panda :3
Panda, a shitstorm. Here, hide in the bunker with BronyInstrumental and I
people just kept on at it.
Conyst, Invi, hello there...
Spectrum_Rush, touché
inb4 hai Panda
Spectrum_Rush that... too...
:D
08,01Malmortius: they're tryign to be helpful
I told them to go across the street to the toyota dealer if they were looking for a new car, because this one was 13 years old.
pot80: heh its ok, thx for explaining :P btw press tab when typing a name for it to autocomplete
Geoffrey Rush is an Aussie, isn;t he?
/me huggles Panda
THEME TIME
*isn't
Well, let's end the conversation and watch the movie shall we?
ASoftFluffyThing: Wait, let me in too!
dat hat
Lil_B :3
I agree with lemons
Invi btw you haven't commented anymore on the name, do you think it's ok?
Oh I definitely don't expect perfection lol
Fluttershy falls
You can only love and tolerate so much
Panda: it's an anti-ban bunker
Panda, the anti-ban bunker. :3
poor trees ;3;
ASoftFluffyThing: i want to get in
I eventually sold it to a nice young couple who knew what it was and what it was worth.
thanks twilight_sprinkle
Fluttershy?
scottish cock?
One more thing Malmortius if you knew my reason why I picked this specific movie you would feel a small bit of MLP in this movie
I just don't want it to break down on me
/me scoops thelonepony and MadSurge into anti-ban bunkt
Invi: scheisse	
thats the risk you take with a 13 year old car.
But hondas run forever.
Lil_B, hm, ya it is kinda okay ^^
if a fluttershy falls in the woods, and nobodys' there to hear it, does a brony squee?
The Yuke of Dork!
CrimsonPhoenix, really? Why did you pick it?
Spectrum_Rush, wieso?
08,01>.>

/me is confused while trying to find the anti ban bunker
Yeah that's what I've heard

Yeah, trust in Hitler:|
Malmortius: You should've been here for the Derpy episode. Chat went absolutely bonkers.

Heck, even the side channels are a blur.
Nittany_Discord, you feeling alright? ^^
does anyone ever do stuff like skype on movie night?
aww, i feel i missed out. I became a fan too late.
^^^
I see a lot of those on the road.
The main channel is shut down as a matter of protocol during episode premiers.
But some lady took it to show her husband
Id go with honda or toyota though if it has lots of miles on it.
wasn't the church he's head of started because of divorce
Malmortius: Don't worry, it all starts up again next month.
who's in the bunker?
Yeah they're really common
