08,01any religious folks in here?

:p
Saturn does atheism count as religion ?
Saturn - how religious?
*almighty
religion is believing in SOMETHING
Pondooo
08,01i'm just curious
VMware, stahp
religion is ONE thing, but faith is another.
you* can't*
13i'm deist
thought you were starchy
/me backs away slowly...
Saturn: dude if you're talking about that whole "world ends on 12/21/12" it's bumkiss
oh well
guys
but I DO believe there is SOMETHING out there
I hate ponies.
the universe is too vast and infinite for us to be alone

13yep
13that and i like manyworlds
I actually have to go to school in a vew seconds -_-

This reminds me: Moonstuck ended :'(
I don't know if I'll go
GASP
WUT
13there is a universe exactly like this one, except i'm drinking a dr pepper and not a pepsi
13if there are infinite universes, there must be one :)
(and then Shizuka's drink was Dr. Pepper)
i dont believe in anything infinite
13and actually
13if there are infinite universes
08,01if there were infinite worlds, by strict sense of the word, time would not exist in any of them
Saturn - that's the only problem with the Many Worlds theory
it doesn't scale very gracefully
ok screw this I have to go to school
xD
08,01infinity is an ugly concept
darn it
I hate school
WRONG
no one's awswering my quistion
oh no it's over boo hoo
13infinity is where math says FORGET IT I GIVE UP
Saturn - infinity itself isn't terribly bad
Tea is best drink
08,01it's fine for mathematicians, but for physiists... we tend not to liek it
^
http://woonastuck.tumblr.com/
13and then cantor had to ruin it and go THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF INFINITY
math isnt an exact representation of the universe though
Saturn: you a physicist? I thought you were a mathmetician?
math was created by humans, it has its flaws
oh lord THIS ONE
0_o
whut
08,01Shizuka: you mean the difference between coutnable and non-countable infinities?
08,01otakon: i'm not a mathematician, no

hello everypony
and since charges are conduct by metal they travel from metal to metal
like the power rangers
lol
or Constructicons
Uuuuh, I found a coral monster
I liked power rangers when I was a kid. Now it's just good riff entertainment
Power rangers!

hmm... I don't get it
if you screw something up you can undo them
I just understood is something a programmer do
hmm
my brain just did a 180
yeah, if you're several people or use several computers, it's pretty helpful
/me listens to link
yeah, with more than one developer source control becomes a must
and it reminds me of a local band- but..who
/me interprets the climax as pain (but isn't too sure) 6_9
vocal climax*

If only I knew the lyrics :$
hehe
there's a partial translation in the top comments- I think
yeaah- it's
eh touching, I like their lyrics
how I've stopped my reflex to scroll down
hehe, me too-
Bah, I shouldn't have stayed up last night.
Not the best thing to do.
I once fell asleep during group therapy
everyone was looking at me when I woke up-
ooh yeah
I have that CD, really enjoyable
Which album was this again? Humbug?
yyeah
I need to start listening to more Arctic Monkeys agian >.<
hehe, I haven't heard them in a while either
And she wrote it out in letraset

Hello, everybody.
As is per usual on a monday

Danke schÃ¶n.
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/61498/1/A-Rainbow-Dream/To-fall-into-a-Dream
ooh, lets have a look see
hey guys
hi
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-FM-j8FA0
they did?
yep they just aired it today
there airing it again i guess this afternoon
thats actually a pretty pleasant little ad
I'm impressed
yea not bad, i heard balddumborat at the end too
well the ad isn't as bad as it could have been
And there's the EQD confirmation, lol
So......the brony-thank-you-project GOT GREENLIGHTED?
well they had to apy a fortune just to air it
pay*
yep
I mean, i've heard about this project and it seems self-promotional to me
Unfortunately ^
Don't get me wrong
has it been aired already?
but i think the hub MIGHT get the credit instead of us
wasnt that the point?
yes the aired it like 30 minutes ago
to give them credit?
:3, thats because youre not a hawt gel
/me is humble
sucks~
everybodys inbred around here
i am being nice
and empathetic
seen the ad, and I cant help to think...meh.
its not great but iits ok
Haven't seen it
/me is lazy
^
lol
kaaai
not bad
/me has no issues with that
and glad they included kids, we don't want to own the show to ourselves
/me is still sad about dream yesterday
SANCTUM CRAP
/me never got accepted to army, was a free man
put up*
You didn't get accepted into the army cause you're a wuss veeveex.
:P
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/61498/A-Rainbow-Dream
thats the dream i had
Mhmm.
well, this is my first time-
Hehehe
I'd make one for you, but it'd suck
Well, relatively simple- I need to find and replace < and > in strings to make it impossible for people to enter html into my innerHTML
o_O
in javascript?
i hope you're doing this server side also :P
should just do IRC webchat
unless I misunderstand
brb
I was thinking of doing it on the receiving side of the faye in browser- but I could intercept and do it in the node.js server
Ooh-yeah
not much need for regex here
Oh?
bored'
I'm having issues with quitting-
uses a socket.io server, but all that does is send each line in a packet, parsing hapens client side
I mean irc client would be nice, but it would be nice to have a room where only the current people drawing can be in the chat-
Oh yeah-
depends on whos using it
but if--using socket-io to actually connect to irc yourself isn't too crazy advanced- that could be a cool addition
this is now a geek channel
Woo~~
/me tries to be a geek, but is only able to be a nerd
derp, this network
has a geek channel
word is hard
XD
hehe
channel has channel within
bak got my coffee
?
is the?
yeah, *finds*
had to restart
https://sourceforge.net/projects/drawroom/
latest commit isn't 100% stable, but yeah
/me is a terrible terminal noob
had to go in and delete index.lock <,<
/me doesnt even know wat a terminal is
oh yes uh
node.js npm faye I think
It's all very testy and strange atm- eh
the missing images are in 1.5 folder on sourfecorge,
hehe
Aah
which is actually tiny workload
yeah
I never looked at how paintchat works- probably should have
but yeah faye is an npm for--node, and then you have to rewrite the ip's it connect to in index.html
noo- I can create one
probably not of much use though, its all decompiled java, which is like obfuscated code obfuscated again
it kicks you if you spam :P
ooh yeah-
ARGH stupid chats blocking me from doing work
there to interesting!!!
stupid sleep
2am
Stream, y u no load
want to stay up and experiment more
i wish i didnt need sleep
http://faye.jcoglan.com/ here's the documents for faye
oh ok
I am considering socket.io, since- websockets
sumistreem
looks like theres versions of faye with websockets
hm- yeah
persistent connections using WebSocket-
long poll via http post
Oscure SNES rpg ahoy! :$
ERod, the Blockbuster Buster, uploaded his ''Mirror Mirror'' review on my birthday! this is the best coincidence that happened to me today!!! (so far) *SQUEE*

Don't you have school or something?
school?
teacher inservice today, no school!
uh... aparently debian stable does not have a node js package
this is anoying
Huh-
I was worried about node.js or RoR making it hard for people to host this-
urgh
it wants me to compile
True-
!
had to be moved when the laptop finally gave out
Wow
Must be a lightweight server-
to be fair she has some massive connection, like 50mbit simultanious
!
either way i think smoke was involved

05Malavolent: gmod vids
05DoctoDoctorWho: not here
(\
Nice
That I agree with, fanon is good spice
i enjoy fanfics regardless of canon
can get fiddly keeping each fanworld seperate though
Yeah, it's like- canon is cool, fanon is cool, if this adventure breaks canon- well, fanon
and all the good books are done or I dont have the money to buy them
hmmm
I can get a link to my fic if anypony's interested
I think the client basically connects in a way browser would-
Anypony?:(
Wish I could
Anyone has suggestions for good fanfics I could read?

oh gawd ja, but that was not that bad
well
could be worse

well, gonna load it a bit before I watch it fully
actually it was hot...
haha, yeah. I live up in northern wisconson.

VEGAS
uhm
well i've seen a lot of stupid people from america but we have them too
heading out to shops back soon
i know
america is kinda unusual for me but cool
but again, it looks really much like the Translator have never heard the actual Audio-Take...
has*
sounds*
yes they did a *good* job with this one
they shouldn't have translated absolutly everything
i know how hard it is. I've dubbed 3 cartoons myself but this really is just a bit "messy"
Formwandlew would be good for that
I tried to tranlate the Song "Pollyanna" once, with a lot of sayings
*Formwandler
I'm going to take off folks.
No bachelor parties in germany?
well, that's supposed to be an adult joke, the word "Changleings" not

:D
brb guys
:D
*wald is forest
anoter tricky one is "geborgenheit" I have not the slightest idea how to define that

no? :)
/me isnt good with military time
:<
Have I missed much?
*heard it
feeling saved or safe??
Lol!
there is probably a singe english words trhat describes that as well, but that's probably one of the uncommon words
I heard there is no word that describes it
well, "Saftyness" would fit
isn't safyness just a word creation
http://zipmeme.com/uploads/generated/g1352134132272081841.jpg
But is it correct? No clue :D
lets see how much french is still stuck in my brain
:)
It's typical for proto-germanic to be able to stack words
i should trot more
english is about the only langauge I know where you aren't allowed to stack words
/me went to his first concert last night
you aren't
?
English, on the other hand...
Yeah
there are compound words, but thats as far as it goes with the word stacking
in norway it's like, Fiske biter and Fiskebiter mean two slightly different things
and the first one is wrong
ich kÃ¶nnte jetzt auch einfach deutsch weiter schreiben
Hi folks
total
Meine deutsche, sie ist nicht gut, alles nicht gut
^ wat.
oh gott sachsen
I can't read it at all
that's dumb that multiple languages aren't allowed :p
yeah if everyone would speak their own language we would have a huge mess in heer
I can't hold an accent, I'm always switching from Hessian, to Bavarian to Friesisch to Ãst
wow i still understand like 5% of the french dialogs
inflection?
I never thought I had an accent untill yesterday
A'ight peeps, I gotta get some earplugs and then finally go back to the pool!
See you later :)
Yep.
Though I probably shouldn't complain, our language is even harder.
Genitiv, Akkusativ, Dativ, uuh...
hey russia has even more
^
in russia you don't write down the words as you speak them
oh
o.o
wat.
Inb4 someone starts writing in Klingon...
it's like the word beaucoup that is spoken as boku
In russia "Blue" does noit exist , always dÃ­fferentiate between light-blue and dark-blue
Since it's familiar to my language.
just get drunk
HOROSHO!
Once you learn azbuca, you're pretty much set.
I listened to myself once and said http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Dramaticremovalcropped_5788.jpg
I heard Icelandic is one of the hardest languages
exactly
uh ja
not even same group
oui
da
Every Pony ... and with that I mean Rarity
its clearly no one eles then everypony
english is anglo-saxon, germanic and some other thigns though isn't it?
English is quite the mixture actually
Is it?
latin-french-german-norse mixed with saxon?
yes
yeah, lotsa latin
Laters all!
Exit isnt an english word, its actually pure latin
also why it has you you you instead of du de dere
English has germanic and romanic roots
I cant choose a favorite pony! they're all too cute!
huh
And with that word ends list of things I'm proud about.
nun meine lieben, ich muss mich nun Verabschieden, mehr Arbeit zu erledigen, AdiÃ¶
languages are fun, but I don't know enouh about them
"Skynet invades Chekoslovakia" Most Ironic movie ever
Hehe
Ã skjÃ¸nn itj ein sjit
A friend of mine once went to Germany. I told him he should totally visit Ausgard, and just follow the signs to get there. :D
>_>
/me didn't get the joke
Fun fact: Ausgard means "Exit"
Ooh
uhm
Ha!
Ausgang, you mean?
Avgang?
English isn't that great for a international language
but it's a beautiful and poetic language
also aufgang
if one man ruled the world, we'd have a constructed language-
that's the thing, it's easy and pretty and I llove it
but for business and such
it's a bit too loosely defined
<,<
Why doesn't just anyone speak Esperanto?
there is in fact a world language and it is really easy but noone speaks it
well--it's strange
A nice example of constructed language.
Esperanto and Latin are two world languages, and yeah Esperanto is nicely done- but eh international language just sorta happens I guess
I'm not saying it's baad
I was trying to learn it and gave up pretty soon.
i'll just put this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24tnc4GKzUo&feature=related
China has many languages, Mandarin is one of them
Of course we won't change to an international language, english works just fine as it is, even if it is very legalese when we have to
:O
I feel fanscerviced
:O
howley carap!
in a good way?
well twilight mentioned it once during the actual wedding
Turn up the volume : Rotate upwards the magnitude
Can't say the same about Czech one.
totally
this would be a 14 of 10 of awkwardness
i can't wait~ for season 3~
noone can wait
It's the current dominator, but in an imagined world if we were to say we need one language for entire world- you know
yeah
oh
lets see
oh yes not that bad
have a link?
no

whoa
....
95 DOLLARS FOR A CLICKY CLACKY SCREEN PRINTER MAKER?
mechanical?
damn
Keyboards that cost much are usually worth it
all the beating they get-
hi dudes and dudets
they cry and try to work hard, but we keep beating them-
13i've seen pictures of g11s that went through even worse treatment
13like WSAD being completely worn out and letting the backlight show through
except shift and enter were gone too
13no idea why F6 and F7 have spots though
maybe you sliped a few times?
13only thing i can think of is maybe audiosurf, messing with the volume control
136 and 7 are probably where the rest of my fingers would rest
ok
hmm streams not showing up for me
13no one's streaming atm
streams are considered fun
and have rightly been forbidden
...kind of rude
maybe he just dosent want to stream:P or our computers are really bad6_9
I might get one of these https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb

Yeah thats really the only reason why people buy em in my opinion..
This State is now Brownies
not many advanteges...
some people like that they have touchscreens I guess
I'm not sure. :D
I can type faster on an actual keyboard though

That means never say no to me.
You're going to suffer.

Dat realization.
O.o
I just realised Ayejay stinks.
:<
:>
/me 08,01has a weird brain sometimes
Saturn: Don't we all? :D
same
I don't like that with a touchscreen keyboard the screen can feel real warm when I type
08,01also, the music in the first few seasons of Stargate SG1 was FUCKING AWESOME
08,01but then went downhill
Except you.
08,01the score was very filmic
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352109794012.gif
I hate you.
Yeah, I know :P

08,01don't have Universe or Infinity yet, though
dat is for huggin' meh.
yeah
and I'm thinking of changing mine
oh
/me laughs and wriggles around happily
08,01also, i'm missing the TV movies
:3
08,01it's such a pity that stargate is over now
08,01and all spinoffs are basically indefinitely cancelled
08,01just like star trek...
08,01i mean, what's happened to epic scifi lately?
Trruth has been spoken-
08,01we still have the same, if not more, people interested in it
Fringe and warehouse
they ruined scifi
I didn't even realize
08,01yes.
even eureka
which was nice and quirky
08,01the last 10 years have not been kind to scifi
08,01with one exception
cancelled to funnel money into warehouse
08,01BSG.
08,01absolutely epic
bsg?
oh
okay
08,01Battlestar Galactica
I'm not changing my nick. XP
08,01it was one of the best shows of the last 10, 15 years
i have a movie of that show
the only sci fi i like is star wars
08,01i just don't get how things like Journeyman and The Middleman can be cancelled in favour of shit like... *sigh*, Sanctuary...
Saturn: I never watched BSG
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: do it!
08,01BSG is really, really good
Saturn: Do you have it? :)
08,01i don't, actually
08,01i deleted my copy of it to make way for an HD torrent of it i found
08,01then demonoid went under
Does my name sound like a female name?
08,01the actual ship was basically crap, and antique; which is the very reason why it survived, and the other battlestars didn't
nick*
I couldnt decide :/
G'day
08,01or, attempts to
all while using as little tech as possible
08,01simple premise, executed absolutely sensationally
cylons
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: robots
AI run amuck
08,01seriously
/me 08,01does not like robots
Saturn have you seen a show called supernatural
08,01it scarred me
Saturn: oh yeah, i loved that series!
hey everypony how are y'all
Saturn: i know that feel
would you say no to Chi
08,01alexxm: FUUUUUU i LOOOOOVE SUPERNATURAL!
i'm good PeachSreak you?
I'm at school gonna get back on my computer somtime this week

/me Saturn by the way, today's my birthday

damn it.......i tried to /msg it
08,01Dark92Enigma: HAAAAAAAPPY BIRTHDAY!
really
Saturn: You, how could you.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8Y_Oh1Xb10
who's birthday is it O_O?
/me hugs Saturn
This calls for a celebration!
derp
altough I can't actually give you a physical hug, otherwise I would :3
anyone
I am off now, goodbye everyone :)
/me pouts in a corner
!cd
aha
bye MLP_Brovakin
15 00 UTC
O:
yeah 16:00 here
Cuz I can
hm. 4 pm for me
Saturn: I thought you were my friend, and then, you go do THIS!
:3
i should be able to make that
i hope
Ow
there is a difference between a pillow and a trout ;_;
Saturn: You DocWho hating monster!
WHYYYYYY!!!!!
/me presses a button and trolol plays
<.<
yeah
far as i know UTC is the same as gmt 0
/me shrugs
UTC is GMT0 but atomic or something
UTC has leap seconds, GMT does not- otherwise, the same
Interesting, didnt know that :]
yes
Yep
He's the only one I've seen
isn't the demographic early teens though?
Saturn: :D
less sci fi, more like wizardry
which doesnt mean i dont liek the show
08,01objectively, it's crap sci-fi
i guess*
08,01DS9 is probably the high point of Star Trek, when all is said and done
Honestly I think Time Turner wasn't based on anyone
but standard hourglass and his colourscheme amde some fans do it
nothing more
NOTHING
08,01even TNG, which i adore, has its share of bleh episodes
/me screams
TNG was the last one?
Enterprise was the last one
no, that was enterprise
the archer sereis
Oh, Enterprise was the one I followed-
08,01y'know, even though i initially didn't like Enterprise, i've warmed to it
it had too many timetravels and "this was a dream" episode, but it wasn't bad
08,01it was a lot like TNG, but with the focus of DS9
could be worse
I watched some here though
Saturn: really?
not here there isn't
Netflix here has very few series
08,01aye
enterprise was probably my favourite of the shows
even though i grew up with enterprise
*tbg
**tng
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: half my friends play 40k, but i don't myself
gah
40k is something I never got into-

and here's the stupidest reason you'll ever hear: Because of shoulderpads
It's a silly reason- but, yeah, never checked it out.
which reminds me
08,01oh, by the way
08,01HAPPY ANARCHY DAY EVERYONE!
08,01BURN SHIT!
/me 08,01is a proud anarchist

You could say I'm quite knowledgeable in random information.
I don't like--manly things?
Saturn: I am sorta kinda good with some english latin terms
Oi

BL2 and AC3 are both great games. I would keep them if I were you.
borderlands 2 is overrated

doesnt make it good
Yes, we've already heard it several times.
"OMG THEY SAID PONIES"
That's not why I like it.
i can completely see why people hate this fandom
Sometimes people like some shooty fun time, and Borderlands delivers
we're all nerds here .-.
^
The reason I like it is because of the Borderlands style gameplay. HUGE monsters to fight with guns that shoot bullets that probably shoot bullets but you don't know until you find out.
There is a difference.
/me noms on Jmo's fish
Eat my fish, see if I care.
/me sees if he does care
/me eats Jmo's hidden, endless supply of large trout

It is.
It's voice is extremely annoying.
I like terrible jokes, and I've seen more annoying than Claptraps
But it goes on for an entire HOUR. Plus, adding to the problem, the next hour after that is more tutorials.
Ranting about BL2.
Nazies deserve nothing but mocking :D

I told you. It was terrible.
That's it?
Yes.

Also 3d modelling
good lord
You can use anything for Vegas

of those probably less than half take the surveys where there are prizes offered

and surprisingly, they have more power than you think
They both want to ruin the country in different ways. :P
Fox is NEWS?????

Fox News?
FOX ISNT NEWS
Oh, Lie Factory
FOX IS LIES
Minah~ <3 this music
08,01[SWAG]Haku: di dyou see EQLA gangnam style?
Chocolate, it is news.
NO
Saturn no
FOX IS LIES
Chocolate: and Idiots
08,01[SWAG]Haku: the convention broke out into Gangnam Style during a Q&A
aww c'mon, you're telling me this isn't news? http://derpy.me/tiENK
i tought fox was rabies?
Saturn: oppan, and I gotta see the eqla one
Saturn: i saw that :D
Saturn cool cool, you should send me a link to the vid
fox should get rabies
he had laptop
08,01so yeah, i went to a Distinguished LEcture by Noam Chomsky
05fox did one good repotage
08,01he's the most awesome dude ever
05the reporter got fired

05fox news*
minah~ it just got sooo smoooth
wow Saturn
Saturn: http://derpiboo.ru/143519
Minah~ is my add on Minah~
Gangnam style is the best song of 2012
how does it sound? Minah~
Man, all this anti-FOX News vitriol because I expressed a conservative opinion, and someone THOUGHT I got it from FOX News
I can't wait for this election to end.
13Kandarihu: tends to happen, you learn to filter it out
Arent we all ready minah~
/me accepts Bronysith's glasses and dances
05Deacon: sure thing
05what are my options?
Saturn we still have a sucky system here in UK
first past the post
I was ready when season 2 ended
Sorry, but Gangnam Style is INCREDIBLY overrated IMO.
Er, no more filter
Minah~
rather than proper proportional representation
08,01Chrysalis: for starters FPTP is ridiculous
Saturn Alternating between parties would be horrible. Two different mind sets one after another? Nothing would get done. At least now we have a choice to progress or stay where we are
this is the first time I can, but its a terrible choice
dat BBc
13innit though
05Princess: lessen the "Minah~" spam, thank you.

11,01Why can't US news being truly unbiased?
13i know why, 24 hour cycles
11,01And it's not just Fox.
05there is no such thing as complete unbias
08,01Nittany_Discord: come live in scotland
Nittany: Because our country fails. >_>
05but there is mroe bias and less bias
Negative News actually helps people learn more about politics than without negative news
08,01we have more interesting weather here
whem did politics get here?
08,01but it's mroe interesting.
13everyone thinks fox equals oreilly and beck even though they're quite plainly opinion commentators
00,10V studios

Conspirac! O_O
Glen Beck isnt even on Fox news anymore
