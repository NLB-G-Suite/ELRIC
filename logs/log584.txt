No way, I think I did it wrong...

Last action hero game
Left!
*vomits a bit*
00,03Should be good nao
This is more lag than a pvp match in dark souls.
Well, that's the way licensed games tend to be. They weren't made to be good. They were made to tie in with a movie.
no, not good
DoomrbringerZero:
buffer circle
Dov that's alot of lag
hey it's the buffer show :)
Buffer of doom.

Dafuq
seems boring
...more easy then dracula in castlevania 2 ? :O
sooo boring
testing games is for casuals
waaaaaaat
Who has Dark Souls for 360?
Maybe the developers of this game got bored and ripped off the turtle sprite from the game and recolored it.
Seems legit
lawl glitch
VenHur96: sounds legit...
Go play Alien vs Predator in the arcade! It's a great game
/me goes upps
indeed
Can't wait for the PC release of DS Dov, but abit down that it isn't being enchanced for PC.

TrixieMuffin: i would watch both chess AND math olympics if it was it twilight :$
so, anyone wanna bet if there will be an end of the world event at the opening ceremony? :D

Major: nope :) i find it too

http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wtf-photos-videos-power-wheelchair-firepower-that-is1.jpg
Buffer silps in every now and then but not often
08,01The Proms is a calssical music festival in the UK
Creepy music and 6C temp. What a combo.
this is too dissonant for me to enjoy
08,01it aims to bring classical music to the masses
08,01with cheap concerts
he winning a gold medal in creeping the fuck out of the audience
08,01about 100 of them over the whole summer
Bronysith: I want to break my legs now..
/me When will Olympics be streamed?
08,01all the greatest musicians in the world come to perform
/me (or not? IDK.)
the olympic opening doesnt start for another half hour
i want to see the olympics opening ceremony for one reason : To see David tennat deliver the olympic torch :)
Chrysalis: THx.
I take it this guy does horror then?
Oh David Tennant.
http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/wtf-photos-videos-the-computer-store.jpg Sumica
Jmo4267: everyone is gay for tennant
08,01today, they're playing Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 (already played), some weird modern piece (on now), and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 (after this piece)
Obviously. :D
00,10Cool illusion floor
Jmo4267: if there would be someone that should have the honor to deliver the torch in UK it should be the doctor :)
sergio_scriptor: I've been wondering about that.. What if he doesn't light it? Will time and space collapse or wasn't the opening ceremony a fixed point in time and space?
Bronysith: i need those floors
Agrold: then the world will be doomed D:
Does anyone remember the episode where he actually runs the torch in 2012 ^_^(i think it was 2102 atleast)
sergio_scriptor If only he still was The Doctor. :'(
30 min :D
00,10Doctor who?
just the doctor
Exatcly
Novarak: yep,that is what im referencing about :)
what is this?
sergio_scriptor: Yeah.. but is it a fixed point? because if not, it can be rewritten. But then again.. you neer know if David will show up:P Would be awesome if he did
:D
I love the doctor <3
doctor ftw
Matt smith ran it this year didn't he?
woah
So the Olympic stream is in a half hour or so?
Novarak: Eyup
*claps*
I know its absurd but wouldnt it be awesome to see a random equestria flag when the olympic teams march in? :D
Agrold: im guessing it's only a fixed point if the carrier falls,and then some random guy (the doctor) would carry the torch :)
*clop clop clop*
I cried when the 10th doctor regenerated. </3
be prepared for the most british of all openings
Alchemist: YES
Applauding his music or that he finished?
Jmo4267: me too :'(
@Sundaysmile, not sure..
How do I respond to someone :o
Chyrasails: are u from the uk ?
Sundaysmile: prob music , even tho it sounded like sh*t it must be REALLY difficult to do thhat
type their name
like you just did
Sundaysmile: or atleast i assume
So that worked? alright then
yes Novarak
so if the olympic carrier falls to the ground,and some someone picks up the torch THAT would be the real doctor :O people today we might proove the existence of the time lords and the Tardis :O
Bronysith: If only....

Aw, they skipped over the Vikings attacking
Headphones! Forgot about those! :O
i have no underwear
wtf
I have no clothes whatsoever.

who is the director of the ceremony?
Man, if there will ever be another Olympic games in the USA again, the opening ceremonies will probably be themed around the size of government and such.
oh that where Pandemonium comes from...
08,01brunel meets funfair lighting...
08,01Chrysalis: yes it is!
They vote in England?
Chrysalis where was that

I appreciate the effort put into the show... But I'm just not feeling anything.
08,01LumpOfCole: i believe there's a video to that effect on youtube
I honestly had my doubts that London could pull off a good opening ceremony. But this is pretty good.
...So England got the Olympics again this year?

00,10they are brit anouncers
why DO they make these Pompous intros anyway?
Good,that was impressive,NOW SHOW US THE DOCTOR
Heehee
08,01which, in my opinion, is the *worst* national anthem of any country
Best opening ceremony...since...EVER.
Lil_B, and they lost TWICE to Africans!
Happy and Glorious sound like the names of two british ponies
08,01it actually has a verse about smiting Scots
Soviet union had the best national anthem ever
inb4 Mr Bean fucks it all up
dem yellow hats
those damn scots
String_Shredder, no. Hamburgers are not a significant part of our culture.
I think the Soviet Union's National Anthom has the most beautiful sound to it.
Which country is this now?
08,01i mean, it's fine for Flower of Scotland, because it's not our *official* anthem
In b4 Daniel Craig

Now I feel like hearing: Friends on the other side
random bigband?
these are some energetic sick kids...
/me needs electroswing
^
alrigt then
NHS
my moms a nurse, and i can tell you. nurses DO NOT dress like that
patients ! like hell , patients jumping around on stage , they are as fake as it gets
The British: Turning everything into a musical since forever.
i'm pretty sure aick kids aren't that enegertic
This is godawful
was that a very big bed or a very small kid?
NATIONAL HOCKEY SKILLS WOOOOOOO
what?
Sweet Celesita the Queen's old!
If they are hospitalize shouldnt they stay in bed
sick kid jst did a backflip.
Suurre.
Shooeie: its the Morphine
:D
Legit.
Shooeie: Technically they are.
seems legit
you do realise how loose the term "sick" is right
what is this part suppposed to represent exactly?
Rememeber the Beijing games? THAT was an impressive opening ceremony. This has...kids jumping on a bed.
ill never trust a british hospital now
dis is so funny :D
seems legitamate.
a cold is still sick
Damn, they give this kids too much medication...
Novarak, he's feeling better!
looks like they all found the pin killers
Can we go back to china

Are you guys sure this is the olympics?

Dead of too much Adrenaline

awesome
If this is sick children I love to see healthy children
<3
glow*
It sure gets dark early in England
Chrysalis, indeed it is, but I think the Olympics have to be geared towards all ages, including the very old. James Bond is okay, since it's been around for many decades. Dubstep only really caught on a few years ago, and is only enjoyed by some youth.
sssssshhhhh
i want i light up cover biatch!
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
XylemTube: No. With the constant "Welcome to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London" I really doubt it.
Shooeie: +1
There are people on this very IRC who detest dubstep.
these make a hay fever look like a joke
It's the Mare in the moon!
silence, kids are sleep :)
GO TO BED

No, Rick Astly would have singed louder than that.
RUN xD
Ghosties: The Dodgylympics.
LoveandTolerate, Doctor Who. In one of the episodes he shows up in the London Olympics
Because having Tennant bring the flame in would have at least been fun and memorable.
To clear everything up, there was an episode of Doctor Who where the Doctor travels to the future and lights the 2012 Olympic flame
suddenly it breaks out in a Rick Roll
If you trip, WE'LL KILL YOU
