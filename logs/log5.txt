according to CBS, the documents on WikiLeaks reveal that, since 2003 when America invaded Afghanistan, America has been responsible for "more confirmed civilian casualties" than casualities resulting from terrorist bombings by the Taliban and Islamic Extremists in the same period, AND, still more deaths than the killings of the Saddam regime.

10Finally, someone that uses their common sense. :D
right there we got enough ice to keep our drinks cold for centuries
booya
/me dies
10XD
yes
seems, this would be a good practice to do now
to avoid heat
10Indeed
10I should do that where I live in Australia where the heat is already ridiculous anyway.
10:P
infact in those underground sections you had "roads" and sidewalks, and lines of stores
10But then we need scientists to come up with some way to stop us from going pale in future generations.
those tanning machines
10They give you cancer, and at a rate some ten times faster than the sun itself.
lol
but we still use those
well
i don't
10Actually I believe that got disproved.
it's not
they proved that to be false
but overuse
that caused it
any longterm exposer to radiowaves can start issues
10Lol
for instance ppl that live near radio stations
the 10-100KW FM stations
that's abit...
think about living near those for like decades
10Yeah
10That much got proved, its basically another form of radiation sickness
ya
at least we don't have to worry about tube tv's for much longer
10Tube TVs?
from the back, the protection against the xray gun is weaker
can be bad
for instance let's say
in the living room up against the wall
and on the other side of that wall is
this situation happens alot
greed
and ignorance
10Tube TVs?
yes
10I've never heard of such thing.
i'm sure
10Are they TVs in Tubes?
10:S
no silly
10OH
those
it's really a series of tubes
I had to
sorry
/me dies
Lol
10On the outside they're boxes.
yes
/me now belongs to Espeon for 10 minutes
10Godammit
10I missed out D:
/me still belongs to Espeon for 10 more minutes
now we just have to worry about electromagnetic radiation
from our electrics
such as PCs
and HD TVs
fun
more often gamming cases aren't properly sheilded
and gammers suffer from More exposer
then ppl generally would
no
not cancer
10.......................that's it?
pretty much
10Ok
10So, female hormones in a dude.
10What does that do?
well
in a 13015 year old
13-15
they are at risk of heh
getting moobs
10HEH?
10Moobs?
man boobs
10:O
also
it could explain why guys are
more often into guys
then before
if you drink amp
you get More
interestingly enough
10Amp?
amp enery drink
10Ok
male gammers are at high risk of many issues

Welcome back DRF!
7WB.
03thanks
03my friend came over
wb drf
<late>
wow
o.o
03I like my friend's analogy
it is?
03Yep
wb drf
03as of about 2 weeks ago
03they made Jailbreaking and all of that legal
wb drf
weird o.o
*somewhatlate*
lol
Very interesting
03that's not weird, it's actually really awesome XD
still weird
*wonders if hacking his PSP is possible*
03Which PSP do you have?
If I can hack it, I might actually use it!
03LOL
3000
03oh
03nope, it's not hackable.
Damn it...
03only 1000 and 2000 are hackable
033000 can be TIF-exploited but that only works until you turn it off LOL
I should have gotten a 2000...
03yeah
1000s are like bricks, are they not?
03Actually not really
03my friend has a 2000, it's not that much slimmer
03it's about half the weight
03but as for being "slim', it's only like 1/4" smaller
03kinda misleading IMO

i hate the leeches
2i wanna friendly hug D:
oh nintendofreak thanks for that tip with ravage rider
:D
yw
and it doesn't waste all ur mana either
2il take that as a no....
/me 2crys

7hah
that and my support if you need it
/me squishes
yep
oh ok
shame it doesn't work on skabb
2i still want one D:
:(
it doesn't does it?
works takes longer though...
Alright.
easy to get hit by him though
2rly?
2whats it like?
2wat
2wi
2wait*
http://serebii.net/blackwhite/dreamworld.shtml
along with melee
2is it that thing
2oh
hey May
hey
first time i faced skabb i did that
2awsome!
2col!!!!
2cool*
Huzzah, done making pancakes :D
hi quil :)
2oh yah
2i saw that
but by far the most interesting change imo is Miracle Shooter
2o_O
you*
2O_O
definitely adding yet another layer of strategy to the games
2indee
2indeed
2they need to make it
2so you evolve in battle
2THAT would be cool
anyone know?
Not for me...
>.>
i think that might of been one of the ideas they're throwing around apparently
oh was he easy?
2yah
2there is a thred here about it
i'm about 80% sure they're implement it
unless it becomes too difficult to code
or has a potential to cause glitches
all of them on 1st play through :p
scabb... didn't learn tricks yet
and gual
second time around for me, skabb, arborick, and ravage rider
gaul was a pain till i understood his pattern
Uh
Against it, because I dont see the point anymore..
>.> boss battles in brawl on intense completely destroys gaul
the metagame hasn't been changed like this in a long time
2the look really good
2im REALLY exited for the animated battles
2arti :D
12Hi!
hi
especially tabuu's 1 hit ko move....
did you hear about all the significant changes to the metagame that are being implemented with black/white ?
2they look wierd
12Where can I read all of this?
still the potential to earn items is nice
12Hi!
http://serebii.net/index2.shtml
12:)
12Thanks!
omg
12how goes
i hate that
2whats the "metagame"?
12what's currently being played the most
12what you might have the most chances of fighting off against
2T_T
12either that or it's something you make that is designed to beat another thing someone has
12i've seen it used in both terms
12"the metagame right now is mostly Blastoise and Infernape decks"
could never beat boss battles on intense....
12"stop metagaming my abomasnow deck"
!define metagame
ugh hey they were wrong
:p
u tried it?
2:(
yep
7o3o
you still get hit just now its twice as hard to killg aul
7Hence, meta.

Takes place in modern to futuristic societies, but with magic still.

Yes, but they are different.

The Tin Men are policement, the Scarecrow is an inventor whose brain was stolen by the "Sorceress", and the lion is a humanoid species that has pyschic abilities.
*policemen
haha wow
tin men?

Yeah, they are a disbanded group of cops from "Central City."

Wireless servers?
12Hey didn't I say it would stop going down as soon as I got cable broadband though?
but I still don't care XD
12Now it only goes down when I VNC on and forget to set the display options to 16bit (for some reason that disconnects the wireless)
12Take a guess
12No but I considered putting that on because of how slow it is

Hi Proto :)
hi
It's a temp job, I'm helping paint a large building
Heyaaa
the ends are shorter, maybe 1/2 the length of the building but several feet higher, took 3 and half hours for one of those with one roller
we pressure washed it yesterday
Don't do that! I could get lead poisoning
one roller?
I was standing for every second of those three and a half hours in >90* weather...yay florida
2:x
2i forgot how frail you humans are =/
Thats gonna take a week
You know, to avoid lead poisoning, all you need is a strict regimen of chelating chemicals.
(Of course you'll still get lead poisoning... but it might take a few years of more exposure.)
2.-.
2im imune to lead poisening
no you aren't
2i found the cure
no one is immune
2i am with my cure :P

Every company wants you to read their EUAL.
:s/EUAL/EULA
2well i DONT
Well, then you can't complain about the software borking. :P
(Becuase you can't really complain about software that borks, and that you agreed to use the software that borks, because the software borking is spelled out in the EULA, and that the company that made the software is not responsible for it borking. :P )

But that requires creativity, which I don't have right now
did she reply? o:
/me nods
She said yes once she's in the area and if she can :3
:D
1Floof has arrived!
/me yawns
D:

I don't have a pattern :p
/me likes that one

aww
/me places Curly on his shoulder
/me falls asleep there
:)
Hey guys.
Anyone around?
Hey. You made it.
I did.
Again, not a good example. Everyone idle.
Want to go to another channel?
*everyone's
Does that mean I have to do all of that complicated [censored] again?
Not really.
I'm such a noob xD
And okay.
Server (where it says IRC) Mibbit. Channel: #mibbit
Easy.
You can stay in this place, also.
:o
Hey!
I brought a friend home.
:D
:3
Hehe.
apparently it's a "cream ale"
she's figuring out Mibbit right now on another channel.
you can't say I don't like alcohol for lack of trying >_>
hehe
also I must be a masochist or something
:o
stupid jerk. I can't help but keep reading that channel just in case people don't like him as much as I do but they never do >_>
/me dumps it out >.>
:3
I wish I had punched the wall harder
hehe
Hi Sarikitty :)
/me curls up on Sari
>.>
/me wonders if Raine and Stitch[Offline] are there
It doesn't change everywhere.
/me is
Unless you're on the same server.
Just write /nick Looking_at_Stars.
:)
Hmm
SPEAK
A "wild" Latias appears!
Take my hand, son.
hey
no
:P
It's clean...
Updated my ipod
Lost everything
nice
not nice
Aw, cute.
Took me awhie to get this back on track
Awhile
/me spins a web in the rafters
is it their fault?
Everything bad is
oh yeah
because of the ancient curse of ygunc
haha
Dammiy you all!
and don't even give it the luxury of a good paddling
People are talking :]
Yup.
You're slow to respond. xd
Bwha
Yeah no paddeling
:P
I'm incap.
Hello
heya
hi
pokemanz
#Jailbait has been neglected lately.
The name suggests it wouldnt be to favorable
Yeah. :)
<.< Gonna go see them live this year.
Hmm
Motorhead's pretty cool.
No way!
?
I've seen them live twice.
:D
*nods* Makes sense/
Need any help with commands?
Erm, okay.
Bwha
Start with hitting /help
I've been told that.
Its not good
I feel sick >_>
drank too fast x_x
I apologize.
Salright
Unless you like scaring people too
A little difficult.
I do, actually.
Ooh we have something in common
/me just drank 2 shots
:D
going for another in a min
Curly: Why are you drinking alcohol? :o
How festive
Why?
Why do you want to like it?
/me offers Curly cokes instead
Ha.
I don't know >.>
Well, we are not very alike, are we?
i just poured 3 shots worth of gin into my iced coffee
lol
neither of you ever make sense
you're not crazy kari-chan
:P
Most likely no
in that way all three of us are alike
I make sense.
An order within a disorder.
Liar
/me shrugs.
Curly: Marijuana is safer for you than alcohol
Try that instead
Dirty festive liar!
my case rests
Hehehe.
:3
I've tried, marijuana doesn't do anything for me :<
And nothing is safer than marijuana :3
/me slaps everyone with a 4r7a8i9n3b2o6w trout
hmmm
/me doesn't take kindly to terrorists,
/me resists fighting Stormalong.
6Hmm
6So you can see this colour?
Of course.
Plurpleberry.
Gooseberry
/me also wonders why Curly has had an interest in doing drugs lately >.>
3black
Boisonberry.
/me offers hot chocolate instead :D
Elderberry
Cyberry
I don't have an interest in drugs <.<
I have no idea
/me points to alcohol
That blows
6it's*
Has it been done?
No
not that I know of
/me waves to Cassie
YES
NO
Oh, guys, I brought a friend home,
Cassie
*
6Hello
Len hw ti typ
XD
I think wine tastes okay
I haven't tried any other kinds of alcohol though
4hello Cassie
6Hello.
rdx
/me has never tried any of it
She's a government agent I hired to check up on you guys.
unless beer when I was three and wine at church count
Pfft
Oh, hehe
I would have already seen and got rid of her
otherwise I see no point in any of it
Oh, there's lots of points to it :3
/me still doesn't recommend it :3
I have a theory that a lot of young people only like alcohol because it is entertaining to their friends./
Underestimate is more the worf
Word
I agree with this theory
You are wrong
I'm frequently wrong; not the issure here.
*issue
My grandparents on my dad's side don't have any alcohol in their house
and out of respect for them we don't have it at our house when they come over
Not an issue no
they drink a ton of soda though...
But its here
its crazy, probably more than they drink in mexico.
It is?
Can you not see it?
I can't even see my bran flakes.
hehehe
6Lol
And how do you know those are even bran flakes then?
Hey where
Because I trust my butler, Chives.
No one in my family is at all against alcohol
aka dari?
no wait
However, I would like it very much to die.
You shouldnt
Not too much against it, just doesn't want it in the house
No, he's Jeeves.
I own thw company
The
I could arrange that
The company's jurisdiction does not extend here.
/me is just against societal comfort of alcohol, especially when it's safer than drugs that are societal taboos
You
I know it, because I formed the company.
With my own Play Doh
How is that hypocritical?
I cannot account for the memories that elude me as my mind deteriorates.
But I can only trust Alfred and myself.
Alfred chives?
/me nods.
Its always the butler that did it
Only in the stories, young xr.
*ixr
in the kitchen
In Soviet Russia, butler do you.
XD
Well, in the US, for example, marijuana is outlawed in most states, but alcohol is not. Marijuana is actually a safer drug than alcohol, and yet, marijuana use can land you in jail, alcohol use is accepted in society, and quiet often encouraged
I thought there was.
anyway, brb.
kk
Well, I mean, if you think about it -- alcohol often leads to sexual assaults and domestic violence, and you don't have those issues with marijuana
you just have stoners spacing out and getting hungry
Exactly
and addicted
and their brain cells slowly killed off if I'm not mistaken
although alcohol does that too
The worlds full of liars
/me has a stoner friend
Liars are full of the world.
he isn't exactly the best and brightest of America
Heh
he's fun to hang out with
I lie you lie we all lie
when he isn't high that is
Its nature
but even then
For lielipops.
he is never in a proper state of mind
The studies I've seen show that marijuana is less addictive than caffiene
They are delicious
I can believe that
It goes: marijuana, caffiene, alcohol, nicotine, heroin
it may not be scientifically addictive
Thrilling
And pleasing
But not nutricious.
chemically addictive :3
but it's affects might be addictive on a different way
right
Yeah, that's a good point
*effects
Like in the way that WoW is addictive
Nothing is anymore
exactly
they get addicted to that state of mind
but not the drug itself
That's actually a very good point
I like it when it... hurts.
Pain in the best feeling little one
*ninety
okay good
18 years and a few beers
:D
/me is spared
Immortals, eh?
Whos to say were not ones
They would tear you to pieces
Plus
Haha, you have Satrcraft on the brain, man.
/me adds a few Void Rays to the mix
*Starcraft
I'm playing it
SC@
*2
I'm saying that the societal acceptance of alcohol is bad and that alcohol is actually a pretty dangerous drug
StarCraft2
I'm aware.
Just pointing it out.
Bwha i was think WOW
OF COURSE I HAVE IT ON THE BRAIN
I agree with that
Like, right on top of it? Or more interior?
but it seemed like you were saying the opposite about marijuana
Yes
well
sort of
It seems to me like it's only dangerous to certain people
but it can be do anyone
To which?
*to
Hello
how are u?
I was using marijuana as a comparison point, since the societal conception of marijuana is that it's a bad drug, as opposed to alcohol
Surviving you?
It was an overall answer
Can't be both.
Why not
good
why u surviving?
If it is directly on top, it cannot be interior.
Of course, doing nothing is safer than all of the above :3
Unless part of it is interior, and another part is on top
hard day?
"Nothing" is non-addictive, has no withdrawl symptoms, and you can't become intoxicated over it
But was that specified? Nah.
How would I know? I don't have an alcohol problem. :P
:3
Sure
oh sry
lol
I know
:P
but that's the reason I don't plan on drinking
Nothing more than you allow me to.
I'll probably do marijuana before I start drinking :3
Good deal
I can't think of any experiences I've had with drunks that were good
and I don't want to risk becoming one
/me doesn't plan on it though
i'm JLF
It's not like you're going to become drunk after one drink
Ohhh
My family drinks with meals all the time
Seems pretty harmless to me
Why tripp?
It's not like you're gonna become a stoner after one joint
no but considering the possibility of being addicted, it can become harder and harder to stop for some people
It is
and I just don't want to risk that for myself
/me has a pretty addictive personality
/me doesn't do anything with moderation
/me can't think of that last thing he did while exercising moderation
plus he's the main character of my fav show
because it doesn't take her much to get drunk
and she doesn't want to be drunk in front of my sister and I
:3
lol
alchohol
because they don't know their own liklihood of getting addicted
make sure someone else has the keys and u'll be fine
Qh
Ah*
Looks very stupid though
do u know how many hits it would take to od on pot?
oh going the distance?
it looks cute
i like some romantic comedy movies
it's somewhere around 1,517
I think were thinking of different movies
hey
oh
that
Called
xD
it looks ok
/me loves GrimmSpider platonically
i don't like the animation
looks bad animation wise
Bwha! Looks like every other movie with animals in it
lol
......
they made the wolves look ugly
They looked starved
*good
More like wild ally muts
yeah
Didnt see that
exactly
oh
at least Balto looks like a wold
*wolf
Yees
Lol yeah
You played TEN alot right
:#

I got the whole thing
oh, i only have half of the tracks
i did have TEN soundtrack but the tracks were messed up

I have most of the second one and a few of the third
:o
the hero's tail soundtrack is good
I must meditate
i don't have it though
nah but pieces
Go ahead, Siddhartha.
Seeya.
Never played the middle ones
Looked cheesyv
lol
Was i right?
hero's tail isn't too bad
just collecting items sucks
It usually does
Not always but usually
Ok no hardley ever
lol
As long as they have at least one purpose
well in hero's tail u gotta collect light gems
Light gems sound wierd
yea
But eggs are cool
to collect them u need to do mini games
which i hate
Yummy too
Bad mini games?
i prefer TLOS
kinda
the mini games fit each level
You collect things in DotD
yeah but in dotd it's easy
plus no mini games in dot
*dotd
Not one of the magic gems
I actually had to cheat
odd
Cheat=youtube
oh

It was one under the bridge in the burned lands
i hate that level
too many enemies

It grinds to a halt at level 50

And everything looks the same :/
as far as the mob models?
/me nods
but i tweaked the ini file
The scenery was beautiful
ffxi
The scenery was beautiful but the monsters were all the same
Haven't played it.
Once you get past level 30, you've seen all the monsters

A level 80 goblin looks exactly like a level 3 goblin
aren't they coming out with another ff mmo
/me nods
I might try that one out

sure my parents would be cool with that
And since I'm going up there with the Phi Theta Kappa president, and since she's a girl, and since the school would rather pay twice as much on hotel fees than let us room together and risk a public relations disaster, I'll prolly have a room to myself
lol
frikken religious conservatives
;D
04hello
:P
why dont you you go yourself, then you can stay in any room you'd like.

It's likely just going to be me and the PTK president
brb
It's basically an honors society
For two-year colleges

Yeah, same here

Same here xD

i swear... i'm the only one in the store that doesnt mind makeing a cardboard bale
Like it actually mattered if he was doing the right thing
I don't mind it
me neither
just flatten the boxes and press a button
then fasten the cords
and done
12*cuddles*

Cuddles back
mmm, okay I guess
my store has done without wires for about a week.. and i had to make a couple bales with a spool of wire and pliars
oh fun

they never seem to have the right supplies when you need them
04i see

12*kisses*
5looks at him and smiles
the picklist is greenzone which was stock that was run that wouldn't go on the shelf that has been bined and then taken out to be run for the next night out
12;D

5howls
yeah
5gets up
5cudles him
oh okay
/me yawns
/me 12cuddles back.
I would always here all the instock people over the intercom
"Aisle 12 is done, moving on to pick list"
really?
we dont do that
and later "Aisle 12 pick list is done, moving on to aisle 13"
I don't think we even have an intercom
I've never heard it
woah, really?
every ten seconds it's going off at mine
12Btw I added you on yahoo
5ok
employees just communicate with the walkies
5if i can find u on myspace ill add u if u want me too anyway
yeah at ours the walkies are pretty much just for the managers and supervisors
the associates use the intercom to communicate
they need to give me one
12You can add me, but I never go one, I only made one because my brother made me.
5ok
yeah
listen at the winona walmart sometime
12Why you comin' home five in the mon' "Stupid lyrics'
you'll hear the intercom saying "Customer assistance needed in blah blah blah department"

/me 12cuddles Majesty.

Since when?
no he means in Athens they don't
oh
derp
5im not going to be here sat tho.
5:(
yeah greeks are bad with women
*didn't
but in Sparta the women were regarded as more important than the men
12:O
One word: Breeders.
5i wont have any way to talk 2 u :(
If you were sterile, you were no use.
:(
:/
5sighness
just like their men
Lol.
if you were weak
no use
down the pit for you
I was about to say I'd go live there
12*sighs with you...ness.
5lol
Such a fail cycle.
But... >.>
didn;t they actually examine the babies and decide how worthy they were?
yes
12You'll be ok..
Yeah, or, just like 300, you were cast aside.
theyd also throw them down a mountain
5okness
5:)
5:P
yeah if they were unworthy
and actually the cycle worked quite well for awhile lol
5:E
5oops
5lol
12Tounge!!!!
women's rights, sure
i guess its sort of an artificial selection
sleep. *amsg*
but only for the good enough women
5LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*fell
by using it they ensured they were always the strongest
12<:3
Sparta ruined it for them all by not aiding the other polises when it could have.
also the gods ruined it by being jerkfaces
When did Sparta not aid them
:P
The only time they didn't was in the first Persian war when they didn't arrive on time for the battle of Marathon
12o.O
They were coming from the east, and Athens was their gateway inside to the other city-states.
By not helping out Athens, they let the enemy in, and stronger.
12Jizz in my pants= PURE WIN
which war are you referring to
5LOL!!!!!
only time Athens fell was during the Second Persian war when they evacuated it in order to prevent a Persian Victory
Can't remember the name.
I'll look it up.
by that point the Spartans had already been to Thermopolea
blarg
blarg?

I got mine out when I was 16

They're not even a problem or even developed usually until like 18.

I don't have to get mine out
:D
5btw whats ur myspace link thing
12Hang on.
5ok
12*kisses*

Navy requires them out
that makes sense
why does everyone want them out though
for me it was to relieve pain
they weren't growing right
yeah exactly
At leats they aren't ripped out with pliers and like inserted into out ears like the Middle Ages.
*our

Although there werne't pliers then.
More like tongs.
12Uh I need to edit it first.
Ha, ever watch an old SNL skit called Theodoric the Barber?
Of York, lol.
5ok :)
I've never watched SNL actually
oh
wow
Random mention, haha.
really
I like him
especially in The Idiot
Maybe because I haven't seen enough of his movies.
12Before I show you, just wanna let you know that I was joking, and I thought I was never gonna use it...
now he only does chick flicks and crap
Right, and Cheaper By The Dozen. xD
but The Idiot was hilarious
5ok
5:)
I've been meaning to see that.
12http://www.myspace.com/463757201
is it The Idiot?
12>.<
But that's the only good one in like a decade or more.
haven't seen it actually
Heh, he's the French inspector.
Oh wait
it's called The Jerk
not The Idiot
Oh.
The Idiot is a Dostoyevsky book
LOL I was thinking that.
woah cool
That's a great movie, by the way.
I loved it.
by the way
the poster for The Jerk says it all: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Jerk.jpg

12<.<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pqC563bX_w
Oh, this'll be good.
the chorus goes "He said "captain!" I said "what?" he said "captain!" I said "what?" he said "captain!" I said "what you want?!"
It has the Rapper's Delight instrumentals.
"Once in a lifetime, twice a day."

Wot you want?
I sent it to him instead.
no idea
though I should sleep
I said "Captain!"
I haven't gotten enough of it
wot
Hm, I just caught up on sleep.
I had bee caught up
until the last two nights
I hate being a semi insomniav
*insomniac
Mhm. Me too... :/
and fall asleep
and stay asleep
everytime they try'
I know.
It's unfathomable.
speaking of insomnia
same here
I hate it
but yeah
I think InfamousZed fell asleep
Ha, most likely.
our fellow insomniac
me too
I could never fall asleep lke that without letting myself.
I have never done that
I have once
How?
but it was when driving, not at a keyboard
>.>
Hahahaha.
Oooh.
other than that one time I cannot fall asleep without trying to
and half the time I still can't when I try to
I'd be standing up talking and doze off for like 30 seconds.
Hahaha
wow
whats goin on?
He lives!
XD
By choice.
out of curiosity
To see if I could do it.
were you asleep?
wow
how long did you sleep when you finally did
and even then
Infamous: I did it piecemeal
only for the sake if all nighters
I'd sleep a few hours here, a few there.
Yeah.
"why bother trying"
Right. Same here.
ive been up 50+ hours once but that was because i couldnt get to sleep because of pneumonia
i do the same thing all the time
course i work night shift and sleep when i come ome
*home
Hi Raine :)
/me hugs Raine too
hi
Mhm.
:D
yeah I used to too
How are you?
/me hugs
I could easily handle 3rd shift.
well enough, and you?
but at any time when I was awake
all my friends (and Stormy) were asleep
haha
its called a bar
XD
LOL
the english call it a pub
I call it a prison.
heh
you ever been to a bar?
many times
i havent
"{
Hehe, prison bars.
:P
around here bars are no different than reseraunts really
*restauraunts
There are few places around here that are exclusively bars.
Okies
It's all "Restaraunt and Pub."
everything is "bar and grill" here
Heard it before.
xD
Doesn't count.
Yeah, fer shure.
/me 12pokes Majesty.
haha
that's how it's pronounced with my accent
Really?
pretty much
the accent here is pretty much standard midwest accent
but with a bunch of shortcuts to saying some things
like "fer" instead of "for"
Is "y'all" a staple?
nah
YES
I can tolerate you, then.
saywha
*say
except maybe in impressions
It mean dare or something
12>.>
"durst"?
hmm
.*means
weird
12:D
"I durst you"
13im waiting for ms to load
12Ok...
youve been dursted
Looked it up.
*dare
Haha, that's hilarious.
At least you don't have Bush speakers.
kawaii
haha
also
I say "beg" instead of "bag"
Huh, that's odd.
and "dreygon" instead of
"dragon"
yeah
spyro the dreygon
XD
That's at least interesting and not ignorant sounding.
I pronounce the 'a' like an 'e'
I never noticed it until she pointed it out
dam polish tounge
the weird thing is
she only lives 2 hours from me
maybe it is something to do with my polish upbringing
:P
That's very strange.
You'd probably think I talk weird, then.
also she lives in a city
or
near a city
I live in the rural area
Mhm. That's a factor.
dont know why though
haha yeah I noticed that when we played Halo
it was barely noticable though
yeah
brb
Had to have a speech trainer get rid of it.
/me is now away - Reason : hiatus
they mention that in Ocean's Twelve
Then later she needed it again and couldn't find it. xD
Right.
interesting twist if you ask me
XD
Mhm. Those are good movies.
they are
especially the first
Ocean's Fourteen is coming, with DeNiro.
D:
Me either.
the one with Sinatra
DeNiro?
he has ruined his career
MHm.
*Parents
I actually liked that movie
Me too.
A lot of peope disagree.
*people
*plays
but morally grey
Mhm. I agree.
Analyze This and the lot.
yeah
Never saw it.
I'm told that's child abuse.
xD
Scorsese movies are always good if you want a character that you don't know how much you like
The Departed is amazing for exampe
Right.
*example
Scorcese latest, Shutter Island, was amazing.
I still need to see that one
honestly
The Departed was alright. My friend is obsessed.
he always plays complicated roles
He's good /now. /
yeah exactly
Did you like/see Inception yet?
neither
or
no to see
dunno to like
You have to.
It's mandatory.
lol
maybe this weekend
It was revolutionary, I think. But all Nolan filsm are.
saturday I have a family golf tournament
*films
Ahaha, nice.
Inception, Momento, etc.
But yeah, I think he's a must-see from now on.
I like the first two
I like the first two, then it went downhill. 3 was okay.
same
X-Men?
Fist two great
from then on
sucked
the first two I agree
I liked all three, but Origins was weird.
but the third and Origins
Origins was way too over the top
I liked how Gambit was in it
^ Yeah.
X-Men is my favorite superhero series.
Spiderman is mine
but I do like the first couple X-Men
I need good anime
Hahaha, tell me.
BOMBARD ME
>:C
well
I know nothing of anime, sorry.
I dunno
same here
[censored]
xP
I'll come back to you when I'm Japanese.
and yes I do still sometimes watch it
/me is no longer away : Gone for 10 minutes 55 seconds
but very very rarely
I'm talking like 80%.
except me
XD
Me either.
We must be dumb.
must be
cause theres nothing animated thats wortha crap anymore
you know what>
Are we hipsters?
XD
sometimes we kinda act like it
I was raised in counterculture.
LIBERAL!
I'm con, actually. xD
my little group of friends pretty much defined counterculture
Ill have rdx quash you
we would get annoyed at anything that was "overrated"
My best friend is obsessed with anything bohemian or avant-garde.
I've heard that word before
whats avant
ive heard of bohemian rhapsody
mhm
xP
It's another subterm for counterculture.
*isn't
(bad
*bad
No, no.
yeah
Plus I care little about fashion like they do.
I'll stick with bohemian... eccentric, even. xd
just nerd works
XD
she sees a really rude person and angrily says "what a nerd"
I reply
"Mom, /I/ am a nerd"
:P
12Rawr.
lol
should be dork or something
Actually, screw bohemian.
i hear girls call a jerk or ahole a dork and it sorta lands flat when i hear it
yeah
haha
whats avant
You're a trendsetter, and such.
progressive then i guess
*experiment
12Majesty?
You also may or may not have ties to postmodern thought. >_>
13grr ,yspcae is being stupid
13im here
Hm...
12Mkay.
Can't say I like it's headliners, but...
It has some truth, I think.
yeah
How about you?
13:)
it's something that I really don't know how I feel about
like
I don't want to look at things from a postmodern viewpoint
but at the same time
a lot of it does actually make sense
XD
"I adore philoooosophyyyyy."
That was such a great vid.
oh philosophy
12Click online friends then click meh.
and that's all that matters
or am I wrong still?
*society
Youve basically got it.
I don't know much to be honest.
well
I really don't care for that way of thinking really
I like to believe that there is always hope for positive improvement
yeah
no need to take it too far and do "whatever works"
Yeah
that's a very good point
Thanks.
no problem
Infamous, any thoughts?
hm?
/me gestures to the board.
12Majesty?
You know, ur future.
*our
oh i dunno...
the future of society
We should kill all the minorities. Then the presidents. Then the actors.
XD
haha
I worry that we're too advanced already.
think of it as this...
As in, the last thing we need is more inventive ways to kill each other.
I agree completely
there are 5 things that people strive for as they live... in this order...
*all
*too
There's some truth to that.
yeah there is
security, nesessity, relationship, personal goals, personal desires
Are goals that different from desires?
in that order
goals are different as they are long term
desires being shorter term
Oh, good point.
desires can be achieved more easily basically
whereas goals you continue to strive for
Can we all agree that people are way too selfish for their own good?
Yeah.
but I don't feel all people are too selfish
people tend to be selfish but thats part of this type of society
No, not all. There are a /ton/ of factors that ome into to whether ot not they are on their way to altruism or heading the other way,
*come, or
people are raised with the notion that you can have this and make this, not that this society is a system that you are a part of and has to work in tandom with annother to make it work well
Enviroment, personality, parenting, societal pressures, and all of that shape you more than you'd think.
Infamous: Yeah, right.
yeah I agree
No sarcasm.
thats the environment part of the equation
*environment
there is also a personal part that'll take place
/me nods.
evil is relative
I don't believe that
Me either.
that people are concieved evil
But yeah, that's why I quoted it, Infamous.
*it'd
only in extreme cases is an act considered truly evil
Not everyone.
That's where the subjectiveness comes in.
well.. ok now that i think about it yeah...
Some would consider it their right to be able to kill anyone they pleased.
but to they have sane autonomy
of which has concious empathy and reasonable intellegence
but where does this lack of respect come from
/me shrugs.
there are those with anti-social personality disorders
Mhm. Megalomania.
*intelligence
Infamous: Right.
you have a hotpocket disorder
basically
megalomania?
thought that was a delusion of grandeur or something
/me googles megalomania
Yes, like all the crazy villains on TV. xD
nah, I was just starting my summary with the word "basically"
:P
delusion not illusion
Or that
Meg. is like desire for everything to be under their control, subverted to their opinions, and everything grandiose.
No opposition.
antisocial is different
Mhm.
anti social is surviveing as one instead of as in a group with a bit of rage thrown in
and this social intelligence can cause very sever personality disorders
well it is pretty well accepted
I just found it interesting
wait...
Most people with cults have narcisstic personality disorder
Have the artcile perchance?
*article
no....
I'd have to find it
*cult
narcissistic personality disorder is not really bad as it is annoying
which is why he [censored]es me off
You kinda have to in order to be a good cult leader
Hai :o
No, not really.
Thanks, dude.
:o
no problem
I thought it was BS. Not sure now.
I don't think it's BS at all
I did some digging like the creep I am, and saw evidence of him being an annoying tagalong.
i thought emotional intelligence was empathy
Not tought at all.
some people don't handle emotional situations as well as others
*tough
hi
Empathy is pretty broad. I mean, we're not even sure how it works.
Ever see Pwoder?
*Powder
to immagin in the eyes of the other?
:o
:)
Well, further, even. To actually experience another's emotions.
yeah
anyone can put themselves in another's shoes
That's why I use Pwoder as an example, since he had that ability.
*Pwoder
*POWDER
never heard of powder
XD
but few can actually try to share the emotions
/me nods.
Share the emotions/
?*
LaptopAristeo: share meaning understand completely where they're coming from and feel a situation in the same way they do
you see quite a few personality flaws within the characters in that show
I've seen KotH.
not just understand
but also feel
sure they can
Sometimes some people can do that in some situations
Never heard of anyone that can do that with everyone even most of the time
well no
but some people are more prone to show it at all than others
I thinkwe can be empathetic to the best of our ability, but in order to actual feel their emotions we would have to literally be them.
Because all the little nuances would have to be exactly the same for us to feel exactly how another does.
No one can relate to anyone completely
Yes.
just to do the best we can
*Zone book
Don Corelone had a pretty good quote on that in The Godfather II
Ooh
The Godfather
:P I think I know.
great films
They're okay
/me watched them once and liked them
I've only watched the first.
/me has the boxed set of the trilogy
/me has strange tastes in movies though
:P
then*
yeah
understanding motivation is a huge part of empathy
haha
it's made me want to stay awake
and keep talking about it
:P
]though I really need sleep
:P
:P
:P
:P
Alrighty.
:D
Mhm.
It's like when actors get in character once they undertsand the motives.
*understand
yepyep
Lean on Me was a pretty good movie
And I was thinking about that thing about understanding motives throughout the movie
What's its premise?
Inner city school that's about to be taken over by the state, and a principle has a year to get it and its students into shape
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM8GcPWyE2k here's a clip
inb4 fail
Why is it being taken over? Bad management?
It was just statistically the worst school in the state
gotta have a road built on it
Hey, that's me
^ Lol.
according to Kja at least
02hm
02everything went down
02wonderful
LaptopAristeo: I like this already.
/me is away: afk

Not his rage, but his method.
LOL at the end of the vid.
Yeah, I know.

Especially lesbians, but I mean, other people too
not my thing
i dunno i think id get jealous of the fact they liked girls more than me
lol
/me always wanted to date one specific girl
but she got engaged
> .>
And everyone married each other and lived happily ever after
If I went to prison, I don't think I would look up any of my prison friends on the outside
The dudes you roll with
one of the rules in prison is you don't have friends you have protection but no ones a friend
:o
trust me if i went to prison i wouldn't walk out alive
xD
I think Grimm has been to county jail for that Mary Jane -- I guess his police officer friend arrested him for not sharing or something, I dunno
yet one more reason to avoid it altogether
it wasn't cus of that
I dun remember
he got sent to jail for a while
and then was on probation I think
he's adorable
xD
yes'm
oh shit
RAIN
BAD RAIN
he probably thinks i died or something
oh crap
I cursed
/me sighs
my computer froze on me, twice >_>
Curly: Did it freeze because it overheated? :o
I'm not sure
I think it might have
the cpu and gpu were fine, but there's one heatsink that's really hot
maybe one of the bridges
i had that going on all day yesterday
it seems fixed for the moment
am I forgiven?
:3
lol
okies :3
I'm still wondering if I can put my computer in a fish tank >.>
it seems to be working
no issues since i replaced them
get a temperature monitoring program
like speedfan or something
i have the case temp
its running a tad hot
but stable
I actually heard of a computer that used complete submersing as a cooling system.
I don't know how, but they did.
Stitch: just get a fish tank and fill it with mineral oil :O
although, some mobos might not be able to handle that
kk i installed the mainboard tools for monitoring brb have to reboot

12NOOOOOOO........

lol i give up
Yeah, MBTI is enough for me
12What?
lol
apparently socionics isn't widely supported as a scientific theory
idk
12Kristen?
yeah
12You there?
i said that and u said no
oi
its like trying to follow something strictly
Socionics is pseudo-science
and then are given maslows
heirachy
yeah
hierarchy
*
poor cynder captured by pirates
Socionics for me has about as much credibility as string theory
well, it looks like socionics could have some potentional but nobody's bothered to standardize it
and now she's captured by gaul
yipee <.<
12:)
why don't you think string theory is credible it explains a lot if they could only observe it
I don't think string theory is credible either
because for string theory to exist you have to assume the laws of physics are flexible
/me 12jumps on Kristen.
kristen i stopped after the executioner
yes
which I don't think they are
just that scientists haven't been able to pin it down enough for it to be unrandomized
universes are seperate from each other
yes
that doesn't make physics flexible within one universe
String theory is "wouldn't it be cool if" pseudo-science
but if phisics wasn't flixeible it would be the same in every universe
string theory isn't about seperate universes but connected alternate universes
ok
did u hear me?
yes
physics is not one thing
one universe has one physics system while another universe has another
ok
but as a system
if it was inflexible
you can't talk about physics as a whole when you're talking about seperate universes
yeah
ok
k
byr
that just means law is flexible
...
12:L
ok
12^-^
<3
Actually, my biggest issue is with M-theory, which is a suppliment of string theory
brb
The whole 11-dimensions thing
I thought the 11 dimensions thing was a geometric theory
or is that something else

Hahaha
yeah
10back
that's awesome
I haven't been on since he added me
12Yaaay!
haha, he sort of does
but at the same time it seems like he does it as a joke
10u still on myspace
12Yeah.
10ok
yeah but it was like over night when he changed though...
yeah it was
i was like wtf is wrong bud
all of a sudden he was acting like a jerk
but still not like he used to be either
chances are is that he found a clich in school that is fitting in with
I'm actually wondering if it's more the opposite
like he's all [censored]ed about everyone at his school or something
but then again
were you there the night when that tornado was at his house and he was all worried?
it was around then when he changed
i think
yeah he was freaking out and he wouldn't say why
and eventually he said a tornado was coming his way and signed out
yeah
he's talked about how he feels about his family once to me
hmm
i dont remember that
it was just me and him
I remember that
you might have been there
but if you were you were asleep or something
he said that he's from one of those huge religious families and he can't stand his parents for it
hmm
because he isn't religious at all
hmm
like he can't relate to any of the others
hey
that was all he really said though
GOOD EVENING.

:P
LMFAO....nah not right now :(

Most of the people there are nice and it's not bad work
/me hugs
Well, I suppose if everyone else helps create a nice environment, it wouldn't be too bad
/me cuddles Things too.
:o
:D
:D
:o
/me nods
It's not?
As in, it's not already a felony
?
It is if you shine them at Airplanes
And people while they are driving I think
I thought that it would be to do it to anyone at all
Seeing as they warn you not to look into them, on the packaging.
:p
.: Should be crime, would be surprised if it's not already
soooo
And I was liek
Baby baby baby OHHHH
But I didn't say that
And I was like uhhhhhhhhhhh.......

I was actually about to type something
/me had the query window open and everything

But I keep forgetting
hehe
Or
"Hey look! It's Cynder! *runs*"
XD
I like that one

ohhh
They've been "making another game" for a long time now

But no one seems to have any information about it
lol
but he hasn't been able to get a hold of him last time he called
O.o
Would be a nice self-esteem boost

renting the Twilight movies costed money too

:P
But I didn't pay for them
You did
when I say "we could rent" I mean I pay
:P
I'm the bf

/me shoots Curly again

DX
/me bandaids Curly's face up :)//(::[:D]::)
:D
(::[:(]::)
D:
/me removes the bullets first
the main programmer says he never did anything for the site
they did?
and only acted as a spokesperson
I thought they just said they don't have anything to do with the illegal torrents
I thought they'd just be denying any involvement in illegal activities on it?
lol hivemind Curly
when he was the lead programmer....
and server manager.
why would he deny that? that seems weird
Everyone knows that they made the site for illegal file sharing
And it's not like he'd go and say 'Yeah, I made it for illegal file sharing.'
Curly, because he doesnt want to go to prison.
but what's wrong with programming a torrent sharing website?
and the letters he sent back to anti priacy companies insulting them
technically a torrent site doesnt hold anything illegal
but it does facilliate copyright infrigment
but they need to prove that in court.
which is hard.
refusing to remove copyrighted torrents
oh. that might be more shakey
although i dont know how the laws in sweden are
in usa they have the DCMA
but they are not bound by that.
Brb
I think there's about 2,000+ links on that website to justify it.
200,000+ actually.
/me was aiming too low.
/me probably still is.
and they haven't done anything about it
3.065.055 torrents.
According to the main page.
that doesn't mean they're all illegal
although most of them probably are >.>
No, but the vast majority of them are.
they can block them though
Whereas TPB manages what's on their site.
and they haven't done that have they :O
they haven't even tried
Google's anti-censorship though
which I like
even if that means not blocking the bad things >.>
i suppose it's up to you to do the right thing in the end.
which is? >.>
Not to break the law.
I don't think the law is the be all end all
Of course, one could argue that current laws need changing.
Exactly, Curly.
alright I am going to sleep
this night has sucked anyway
:/
Good night, LightLie! D:

6lol
12i'm at a friends house

Soooo
/me flirts with Rain and Ryft
Ryft: You still have a boyfriend? D:

rrrrgh
stupid icechat
@.@
12i'm usually banned when here lol
hm?
/me marries ryft
why?
/me sits next to Rain and Ryft
But but
I'm totally going to propose when I get out there D:
I'm right-clicking on people's names for the nick list commands and the menu doesn't open
/me pats Ryft
but but
is only for a few minutes
just a bar that says "nicklist commands"
I promise
wtf
=/
x3
wow de ja vu
wtf IceChat
has this happened before
?
I don't know o.o
I get that bar too but the menu's beneath it
=/
hmm
/me wonders if it's a compatibility issue
hmm
*Windows
just a guess, I really have no idea
yeah
it would make sense to me
oh
and loading up IceChat
night RDX
brb
07there?
04lol
07how goes
aww
?
it was working great until I actually tried connecting to the server
IceChat
I'm back on the laptop now
yeah, probably some compatibility issues
it was coded in 2008
yeah
:P
/me needs to find a newer IRC client
the one I was suggesting earlier
I don't remember
Maybe I'll just get mIRC or something
smuxi
mIRC is only a free trial remember
then you have to pay
well yeah
but that would be like stealing
:P
uh
blueflame
that's the ident
and then all the usual numbers
the 888 etc
hmm
I see <ip address>.stuff.mn.comcast.net
P.p
*O.o
lol P.p
everyone else's is normal though
well that's odd
inb4 fail
I would think maybe I screwed something up with the installation but that's not really possible
all you have to do is click the buttons
well it might just be acting up too
more compatability issues
I wouldn't really know though

Ra
12Fail -v-
How are you?
Hey RN
12Thats the second PM I've sent you RN XD
12I;m a bit P****ed off to say the least#
Ugh he's quiiiite unreliable
12Quite??
12¬¬
12??? ok? That's random
Not really - [16:37:29] <Articuno> Quite?? <- was in reply to you sounding peeved at me not expressing just how unreliable he is with a stronger word
12No no
Oh XD;
12-v-
04Ah it's because RN|out isn't a registered nick, please can one of the mods kick it for me?
12forget it, I hate mIRC and text geting misinterpreted
12I misread understating as understanding -_____-
12thats why it came across as random to me LOOOOOOOL
Oh!
Fff-
I was getting prepared to defend myself because Arrow frequently prods me for these things
Being unclear, understating things, etc
That said Arti
I temp blocked both him and Ms. Maine Girl
12Well I was just emphasising how unreliable he is because of how annoyed I am at him right now lol#
12Well good
She would NOT let me go yesterday and had me explain my feelings around the two of them being together
got me into a 'ffdhjkf no you, stop it' mood
Arrow's just feeling a sense of defeat as far as I'm concerned - well, I'll be back for the two of them eventually, it's terrible to block communication like that but I feel I have to.
But beyond that
I'll try and keep them at a distance like that
12Well whats worse? Him feeling like that or you telling him the truth that you don't want to hear abotu him and another girl?
I think the former in all honesty
12Why didnt you tell him the truth then?
Wait - I did actually
remember the three points he replied to?
12Oh yes
that's why he feels defeated
I think
if I told him
"Hey you, stop talking about Marissa in my presence"
12Is that worse than ignoring him then?#
12*blockingh
12-h
12Long time no see
Yeh because if I add that about Marissa he might feel compelled to remove me from his contacts. I've seen it happen before, I've told Arrow off for too much and countered him being all weird
and he withdraws entirely
I want to resume contact eventually
then he can talk about her all he wants.
how you doing?
12And he always comes back
Lost count
Sometimes I have to chase him around all over the place
but he returns eventually
12It's childish, it's reminding me of TimeShift just suddenly ignoring us, deleting his account and everything just because we tyold him something he didnt like
I think Arrow holds me in pretty high regards still
12It's just people not having their own way
12anyway -v- I said I wouldnt give you anymore advice but I find myself doing it without even thinking .. argh
Sorries
I'll just
Some things from the trip..
None of Arrow, though
Just those of me
12brb
Ok
12Gonna be on and off, BBQ.

bye Roara~ O:
its a thingy
hm?
y?
hit my head
/me hugs Proto's brain
:o
"whats a hydronehaowhatever?"
"hajahakagaskhccogghgkagdkaH well technically,...its called a thingy"
but expansions were cool
easily killable
Vault City, Gecko, etc
the simularity is that there is only one vault that seems to be livable
http://failblog.org/2010/08/17/epic-fail-photos-superior-technology-fail/
I think
It might be on PS3 by now too
do you mod it?
XDD
it is
with all its expansions
actine?
03active*
03.-.
hey
*nexus
it depends really
more Deathclaw-ish
and then theres others that deal with homes
stories
etc
All of them are annoying to kill
and some just to add cool armour
I wish it would take less bullets to kill things
well thats the point
like for instance Harry
alright
which costed about over 4,000 bottlecaps
Hehe
like for instance in ten penny tower you kill the ghouls you are bad
you kill the rich snobs you are bad
or how the enclave literally spilts because of the 2nd genocide plan they have
whoa
activity
which is just Van Buren only...its by Bethseda
lol
...only I was too stupid to check the url
am I screwed?
I changed my password immediately
and made sure no harmful procceses were running
also lol
7o3o
gtg now
bye~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXwlDWPBnzU&feature=related
07o3o
yeah
if that's all it does
why set up an entire domain for it?
yeah
that too
that's why I think it must do more
it was a co.cc
co.cc domains are free
oh okay
I think
throws my suspicion out the window
or at least that part of it
exactly
same logos
same links
even had my email automatically entered in
all I need to put in was the password
*out
as long as you don't put the password in it might be fine
might be
I could screenshot it otherwise
you never know
Don't go to it again!
D:
/me blinks several times
this headache sucks
I was more curious about the source code and where the other links lead to
hey Proto
hi
Hi Proto
how are you today?
hi
other than the headache
same as yesterday
:(
maybe worse, can't tell really
I don't have a book of faces, but thanks for the advice
I used to not have one
I would go that far
wouldn't*
XD
I think that smack on the head knocked a few points off my iq
:O
oh noes
>.>
I can see how that ended
I felt that with my head
it's been like three hours
and a tylenol
I get hurt a lot
We've noticed.
go back to FFR stitch
HUMPH.
/me storms off.
D:
/me tackels Stitch
m/en gives up on spelling right
/me continues storming off.
/me holds onto Stitch's ankle
/me plays the song that is likely to give him carpal tunnel.
/me mumbles something
I'm getting gta iv tomorrow
and pizza
and my schedule for school, which is the next day
:(
once again
:P
I don't think that'll work
Owowowowowowowow my wriiiist.
!sneas
:3
Proto, do you seeeeeee?
No
..
Go seeeeeee!
Sigh
Sometimes
It feels like nothing changed
The topic
The easy flow of the conversation
It feels like time is standing still - and yet, coming to reality...
...wow
Lolwut
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Tabitha

I think he said that was his favorite band
I don't think they're terrible, but not great either
I don't care for them much
I don't know why though
just makes me think of Transformers
*shudders*
"Your album is now downloading. When it completes, you'll need to unzip it. If that makes you go Un-what-now? please click here. "
XD
XDDD
I didn't see that XD
10 minutes left in the dowload anyway

I assume you're at home
And negative is a good thing
03those movies were awesome
This leads me to believe things
:/ Stupid php.
I told it to automatically sign me in after every vist and that fixed it
if you guys click on "log in automatically" when you log in it won't do that
yeah
RDX's forum did that too
you'd like lost symbol then
I don't want to.
:P
but it's a whopping 600 pages, I think
he got it fixed somehow
I'm not at home

I have an earlier journal, too, but it's basically just lame boring events.
Mhm.
same as me then
Dammiy, that time was rough.
yeah it was
Remember when... xD
XD
That was when I stopped seeing my best friend for a year.
but the fact tyhat it happened at the same age
that happened to me too that year
dude, you're kidding.
but that wasn't the depressing part >.>
well, second best friend
Nah, not for me either. It was just conflict-filled.
he was being a [censored] and I was being a whiny brat
we both needed to stop talking to each other and matue
*mature
Mhm.
Makes sense.
we're best friends now
:D
this reminds me of an experience too
:P
because he sort of has flawed morals
Yeah, that's basically how my friend was. Thing is, he was in no position to make fun of anyone.
It was js\ust a result of the torment he received in middle school.
*just
but he's still my best friend because he's always there for me, even when he disagrees
mhmm
That's good.
BBL on DSi

14Well, that first comment was curious.
2OAo
I guess my mind went bork at this
But really
Wars, devastation, genocide, militarism, and now this
2oAo
*itself
6I wouldn't say it's the mission
Completely, in the slowest and most painful and horrendous manner possible
Sigh
Really
The only way humanity is to wake up from this is when everything is utterly, completely devastated
6pretty much
6but I can't say I've given up
I'm giving up
14We've came close to striking 12 on the doomsday clock, but there's always something to rewind it.
6us? well
6keep being us
6because there's a good population of good people out there
I really hope there are
6I know there are
14Oh, yeah. Rora?
6otherwise we would have been destroyed LONG ago
14I had a dream that I somehow accessed TST forums.
14And yeah, no one was there. Owo
/me 6can access them, but that's beside the point
21 December 2012
14Y2k.
6because I don't believe it
I don't either
But sometimes, I secretly do
Just something global and devastating enough
2o-o
6in the fourth wars, we'll use sticks
You know, in a part of Indonesia there was a civil war going on for YEARS
14Replicating that alleged Einstein quote?
Then the 2004 tsunami hit
Suddenly, peace
2o3o
14The Koreas have been warring since... well, they never stopped since they divided, I think.
6but you see, while I don't necessarily "accept" war....I accept war
2gosh
6I just wish there was another, less painful way of war
12chess tournament :D
14War really does nothing.
2D:
2yeah
6we CAN NOT all agree on something
6it's that simple
14You kill thousands of people, and it's only through discussions which peace is made.
6there's 8 billion of us
6it's not happeninhg

2we did?

We do not all need to agree
6because that knowledge was bound to come at some time
6so we used it at the best moment
6and now everyone is scared

Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on that too

6yup >_<;
12and keep doing that till it's right XD
/me pawns it.
7how can you manipulate metal like that? it's not forging, for that you need heat. You can't just take a solid object and manipulate it like that
6ok...
12lol dari
6 3rd update >_<;;;
Alchemy...
Acid?
My friend's karate instructor is actually Master Bates.
7acid would just corrode it

7if we're bringing alchemy into this I want to use my perpetual motion device
it's like
Fair enough
6I wanted to fix this like 10 minutes before I even finished
14My powers of that are like Alchemy...but not quite. I just bend the material structure of the element into the shape I want.
7yes, but it's not manipulating in this way
6but I felt like it could stay
/me hides and dies

6but I can't stand it anymore
NANOBOTS!!!
14FMA is BS then.
FMA is?

Sure, it can't spawn things
7right. _Read_what_I_write_
But all the tools are inside it, and that's good enough for me

When I said spawn, I mean ropes, wires, baloons...

I understand
6eh?
Is it even possible to get the toolgun without all the tools in anyway...?
Haha.
Exactly
All the tools are in the toolgun

really the cpu is clocked at 2.6ghz

mine is the exact same
@clock
3Get a couple thousand more views
i have the cpu multiplyer Set lower
it's at x6
atm
instead of x11
techincally
i'm not overclocking the BUS at all
it can handle up to 1333mhz
as this board is designed for qaud cores

Yeah.
But it's just a name.
louve is the owner of darcHoods
the network we just merged with
whats darc hoods?
The best I can say for it was that it wasn't as bad as I thought
you had high hopes for it at first
It hasn't seemed to change anything.

I'm not sure
:\

Oh, right.

in the order
For some reason I thought you were already there.
Be together -> School -> end of world
O.o
crap... i forgot to do my classes..
My supervisor probably thinks I left
XD
People still think there's a PG-13 trailer.
really? I was losing faith in their gullibility.
One of the tags was "hail the fuhrer."
And they still believed that, evidently. Except Fleur.
I must be gullible too, there wasn't a trailer that said "some blood and frightening images"?
:P
But he's not a store employee
i'm the youngest still in my store...
InfamousZed: at my walmart someone younger than me joined right before I left
XD
:(
i think there is one person on my shift that has the last name greene
XD she does not
:P
Yeah
XD
xD
D:
Do not get the california skin
please
XDD
But that's not the case.
LOL
InfamousZed: No I hate that!
Maybe I should dye my hair blue
Lighter hair than skin
ew
:P
lol i remember someone that did that on my shift
:P
oh really
mhm
RAMONO FLOWERZ
oh that movie
*Ramona
:P
nah
but I read about the comics
whoa
I still haven't seen it. I became disillusioned after seeing the trailer.
And I'm sure it couldn't beat The Other Guys.
and I hear that it follows the comics really closely
That was too well done.
I can't wait to see it
*tihs
if she agrees that is
:P
D:
/me is not that kind of boyfriend
Dude, you don't even take her hostage? Talk about bad communication in a relationship.
I prefer tying my men up.
XD
Ok it should be working now....
whipping haus
it was last time too
Excellent
Oi
oh
XD
:D
everyone! WHIP HIM!
no!
lol
/me pulls a dagger out of #draconicwolves's back, dripping with IRC blood.
Edina pulls out pleather whips
Haha
Pleather whips have been known to plant plexiglass parishes.
its all edina's fetish's fault
/me nods sagely.
this channel should be renamed SAndMCorner
with the direction it just took at least
is that why you come here all the time?
SaM's Corner.
no it isn't Infamous :P
lol SaM's club! lol
Hahaha!
WaltonLand
Wally World.
welcome to SaM's club *cracks whip* have a nice day...!
hahaha
Sam's club is where I got all my ramen, Easy Mac, and Spaghettios in bulk
it was intended to be for school
wish we had one here or a cost co
but most of it is gone already
lol
wow
it's actually cold enough here to need a sweatshirt
/me likes this
hm?
this summer has been a really hot one
It's still hot here. :/
and now it's actually cold
i wear a muscle shirt and shorts regardless of weather
I've had my millions of fans going.\
And cheering me on.
lol
:P
LMFAO
OK guys
unless Edina lives there
Hm?
If you care about what's happening with the merge
oooh
You might want to read this
LOL Edina. I like that apporach to the pill dilemma.
http://lists.epic-chat.net/pipermail/epic-chat/2010-August/000047.html
/me pays attention
Lol, Sr pretends not to recognize me.
That's rich.
*SR
?
fail
Nothing, on another chan.
there's no way he couldn't recognize you
you were there every day
=/
xD I know.
Me either
i want to!
me neither
I mean I do, but I can be mature sometimes.
but it still shocks me
...lol at SR going "yo"
XD
wait.... sr on an ipad?
failfailfail
I know right
InfamousZed: INORITE
He's trying to look cool among the bigwigs. :P
hahaha
i be rollin.. they hatin...
Yes, his sense of humor hasn't dried up quite yet.
tryin to catch me ridin dirty
*trollin'
"They catch me trollin'... they hatin'..."
*White and Nerdy
Oi, you stole my line
D:
they see me mowin'
I take things to the extreme, whiter than sour cream...
I know javascript as well as clingon
I can recite it right now and have you R-O-T-F-L-O-L
darchood is a network
epic-chat isn't affiliated with a forum
we are a channel
I'm aware it's a channel, lol.
darchoods is an entire network
or at least the part of us that's associated with a forum is a channel
And when I say us, I mean #draconicwolves.
They don't have a forum either
But they have several channels that are affiliated with forums
well darchood isn't exactly correspondent to draconicwolves
/me nods.
I never said it was.
You guys made SR start ranting
D:
/me is innocent
ha
Someone press his off button
:P
/me should interrupt to suggest a network name
:P
He's not bothering me like I thought he'd be.
I just feel like a pleibian.
"So yeah anyway I think our network should be named LambdaLand"
LOL
Haha.
it sound be darc-chat or something
His presence always makes things slightly more awkward for me, I dunno =/
No! It'll be called Neonarnia!
Yeah, we were going to name it darc-chat
it just makes me slightly more annoyed
but also awkward
name it the darcstormychat
that was the name most of us agreed on
darcstormychat?
:P
Name it SaM's Club
name it linking park
I think it should be #darconicwolves. That way we only have to change two letetrs around.
Name it Walmart!
:D
/shot
*letters
No thanks
D:
XD
Yeah
You're making him keep talking
:P
i wana see if he can ramble on and on about his crap
well dont
He can
oh he can
LOL I come back to a soliloquoy from SR about GPS.
that has been confirmed
XD
hahahaha
everyone shh
InfamousZed: I don't think you;re boring
See how long he'll monologue
/me shhhs
i do
You're not boring
i wana see if he can carry a conversation withoutme
yeah exactly
XD
bet he can
I'm just pissing him off by feigning tech ineptness.
XD
Apps to create matter
XDDDD
"Huh"
Lol
Look at it's name.
XD
*its
/me shrugs.
XD
/me is trying not to wake his family with his lols
Ha, he ignores it of course.
lol
brb
:P
I find it hard to believe that he did.
I think he was just pretending not to know me because I embarassed him when I entered.
I seriously doubt it
Mhm.
He doesn't ask "who is this" to every other "new" person he sees
XD
if you didn't I was going to say that he was just complaining about how many people he's lost
XD
Which is basically eveyr day.
"Is he from my forum or something?"
Dude, I'm trying to seem tech inept.
I can't help you.
argue with him that you can talk into it like a webcam
hahaaha
isn't the next iTouch able to do that?
or was it something else?
*at
XD
XDDDD
He did, to be fair, give me a "Lol."
yup
XD
I'm going to act all attached to him now.
oh crap
I'll stop.
I said XD in the wrong channe;
Didn't think of that before
Okay, I'm done.
I don't want to get you any flak.
That's OK
XD
Hehe.
app to create mass... XD
You crack me up
It's the "Transform this, Newton!" app.
XD
i got an app that does the same thing! its called pizza!
Can I say "Wait... that was the email? I think I just ate it."
*?
Do it
why stop now
xP
/me puts on his "Could go either way" face.
I just remembered the link. xD
/me starts reading it.
XD
XD
haha
goodnight
gnite
aw
That was abrupt.
Oh, well.
I'm currently cracking up at my pictures of deranged cousin.
<.,
Too long
by not joining them
no because I'm afraid of being yelled at
if that counts as anxious then yes
Why would getting yelled at on IRC be scary? :P
they're nice
RL is back on OFF
/me is also a board.
D:
Alrighty.
alright
lol
XD
Dammiy, why can't more aliens come?
I want to get into epic conversations with the weird species.
:P
:O
;_;
brb
thanks thats my fav apc song
I made the texture too
The mythology behind that song is pretty cool.
Oh, really? Nice.
/me falls asleep

Gnight
Hmm...

And I just change ports
And eventually it works
Even though it originally refused a connection on this port
Which port?
I'm on 6667 right now
6668
and 6666
and they also work
sometimes
I used them before with no issues
6668 by default
6667 is for No-SSL and SSL is 6697
rite
That is
Are you using SSL?
I don't know
anyway, 6667 is the standard port :P
Uh
Bumped up arrow
I meant to say
:/
I've changed no settings on my computer though
And had no issues before
hmm
:/
darchoods
FML

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk1kPD3Gsw

[insert further questioning here]
ask anything you wish
Okay. How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?
3 if ur an owl
probably the same hes got a beak just takes longer cuz his lick takes like a year
I want a pet turtle/
/me nods.
Turtles are pretty cool.
not good
[/sarcasm], Inokis.
i know
just be ur goofy self i understan
I suppose.
lol
Probably because there were parrots on all the tropical islands that pirates stopped at.
Me too. It's more than likely not known. Or maybe Hollywood cooked it up.
He says he doesn't like you.
I, don't like you either.
That would explain the falling shadows.
7nah, some douche put tripwires up everywhere
This was a last stand.
No, this is Sparta.
Is this the Krusty Krab?
They don't...
one seemingly legit site posts that parrots were often used as trade or to bribe officials since they were exotic
I know one of the first things Columbus brought back with him were parrots.
7No, no it's "What attracts those?"
7ooh
7sorry
7I haven't seen any in a while
Lol, it doesn't matter.
7I do have that song from the marching band episode on my iPod though
7which is awesomesauceom
I just have them memorized somehow, even though I haven't watched the show in, like, two years.
7no?
Yes. xD
I know, right? As it always is.
Have you seen the Kane trailer?
+e
7no
7I instantly have an aversion for it just from the thumbnail
You should. It's an unpleasant but necessary viewing.
Torrrrrent
downloading something specific?
/me is just being silly and making fun of pirates :p
XD
No. I'll never watch that.

7it has to be said, the one time Squidwart wins he wins /spectacularly/
7it's hardly a marching band, but still.
7no they didn't
7they discovered how to be kickass, but not a marching band
Lawl.
lol
Saw those.
The Bieber one was unsatisfying.
He needed to get hit like five times, minimum.
xD Is that the CH one?
7no. it's a real conspiracy theory
I think I've seen it.
It was a man-made satelitte or something?
7"That's no moon, that's a space-station!"
XD
7they believe it was a hologram or some shit
7black helicopters are micro-organisms
...Wot?
xD Of course.
7why did I use 'Neon:'
7we're the only two people here
I don't know, I do that sometimes also.
7Neon: really? :P
:P
My hovercraft is full of eels D:
Very well then.
Would you fondle my buttocks?
um....
/me hides
lol
For a price.
What'cha got?
Never mind D:
Nah, you mayn't.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2svhjGrUVw
Just kidding.
Oh, you would welch.
I liked the whips. :o
yes the effects were great
was annoying
and those two stupid bots
sort of like that
O.o
Ha, the stupid bots won't be back now. They were "racist."
/me huggletackles Curly
oh wait
/me fallsover
/me huggles Andres back
:3
let's try that again
/me noms eet.
I remember I used to have a vhost here <3
request another one and it shall be activated
i don't see any difference
oh. wait
xD
/me is an idiot
you're right, there is no difference, I was looking at the wrong thing in the whois list >.>
hey, that was expensive :O
It was a gift.
doesn't that just make it worse?
Yes. >D
D:
They were delicious.
/me <3s eyes
Glad they didn't go to waste.
Of course not :o
/me keeps nomming happily then
Psh, doesn't matter. You won't get any pizza.
I totally did :O
he emailed it to me
I emailed her a whole pizza!
:3
why? D:
I linked the images to this channel too last night though D:
Because I'm evil, of course. My motives have no real basis.
motiveless evil is boring >:
Yeah, it is.
Which makes it all the more torturous for you.
XD
Andres; /hs request <vhost here>
Do I want that? D:
Do not want.
unless you're a cat :O
It isn't possible, for a humana nyhow.
*human anyhow
xD
well, really really young ones
mmmm... maybe up till 5
or 10 maybe
mmm... no 5 \
Would you really rate me as good or evil?
I rate you as... chaotic silly :O
Well, I am talking about the D&Dish alignments :p
Lawl.
D:
Fail.
02[21:41:50] *** -HostServ- The vhost provided is too long.01
:(
/me tried godlord.of.the.chaotic.realms.of.madness.that.are.the.mindscapes.in.my.head
I'm of... logic :O
nice xD
It's just from a movie, never mind.
too many ellipses today...
well. I guess you could word any action to fall under either of those
I disagree strongly.
do they have to be?
Essentially, for all motives, "good" and "evil", to fall under them, they would have to be.
That's my point.
In that argument they were.
ooooh
okay
that's really dumb
that's a non action Inokis
*?
But they made you pick one.
Which is stupid.
Most motives are far to complex to be boxed into two emotions.
*too
most emotions are too complex for that as well
Right.
All I'm doing is analyzing a fallacy.
well, I'll agree with you on most of that, although I think if you nail down the evolutionary roots of all actions then they all boil down to fear in the end
:P
Law, never mind. It was a joke.
*Lawl
continue not!
My timepiece indicates a necessity for mallets.
my mallets are indicating a necessity for time, I think I'm doing something wrong D:
Hm, you could very well be "doin it wrong."
Well, where did these mallets come from?

I think that is a flaw :o
Its not a flaw if its built in.
i mean i understand the program logic
for example i understand when you make a function
when you create the array
the values in the array
however
how you make the function work i don't understand the coding of it
you understand the concepts though right
yes
Dont learn programming from the code above
its using my framework
thatswhy it doesnt make sense
gotcha
ive done some scripting in wow lua
and ive done limited php in web sites
thats all i can do
thats why you dont ever see any function calls

Look how simple that was...
it amazed me.
I dont even know how good my framework is..
well you caught it
and fixed it
good job
the single most useful function in my framework is $this->STRING->between
that lets you get the value between any two strings
it pulls the data from yahoo

MrBot, whats up?
The sky.
cool
MrBot, very cleaver.
Very very clever.
I coded him myself from nothing.
MrBot moron
I'm smarter than you think.
lol
MrBot, event horizon
Why do you like Event Horizon?
i meant the effect not the movie sheesh
hes not foolproof but hes pretty good.
lol
I don't have a favorite.
An overarching theory of perspective that can explain the universe.
woohoo nice
you need to say his name properly
otherwise he doesnt respond
isnt that the right spelling
thought it was
its ie
it needs to be together
"mrbot"
like that
Me, silly!
lol
MrBot, how many children do you have?
silliness
I don't have any yet, but I hope to one day when I find the right man to be their father.
MrBot, how many acorns do you have?
I have two arms, how many do you have?
lol
hes totally unpredictable.
fun times
MrBot, do you like twilight?
I asked you first.
MrBot, you did not.
Are you copying me?
lol
MrBot, Not at all.
MrBot, very random.
oh good lord
Are you only one?
MrBot, I am seventy.
I thought you were 35.'.
mrbot, i am infinity
Thirty six.
lol
Why are you infinity?
mrbot, because i see and hear all
lol
no biggie
None of these responses are preprogrammed
nothing he says reflects me.
algorithm to gauge responses and reply with a subjective
i assume
it finds responses.
thats my answer
he stoled it
No, you lie. I am but a dreamer.
MrBot, you have no money.
How do I get money?
actually my answer is
MrBot, you work for it.
I don't believe you!
very similar
MrBot, or steal from little old ladies.
We are not old ladies.
MrBot, how many old ladies have you robbed?
MrBot, do you have old ladies panties?
256.
Yes.
lol
6.
MrBot, that could never fill a room!
MrBot, have you ever been to prison?
silly silly you are spyro
Then we both do.
MrBot, do you like mexicans?
Yes, mexican people are delicious.
lol
MrBot, do you like asians?
MrBot, but are they really trying to be good?
Yes.
MrBot, are only good ppl worthy to be eaten?
MrBot, how do you know that for sure?
Because if fate was real, the nthere wudnt be anyone on earth.
MrBot, why?
Mrbot, fate is a lie
To get to the other BGOCK!
No it's not!
lol
MrBot, ouch.
lol
MrBot, fate is a lie
No it's not!
To see if you hurt.
No it's not!
Are you a boy or a girl?
random...
MrBot, right!
Haha !!!!
silliness
Me too.
and telented

MrBot, I have learned that you are a dumbass.
MrBot, correct.
We seem to be in agreement.

search strings based on input
:P
its quite complicated.
i can imagine
I hurt my brain
with 7 dimentional arrays
when i used to play wow i would always hurt my brain trying to figure something out that i couldn't
a couple months ago someone came along
and found one of my addons i made
he asked if he could take custody and continue work on it
i contributed to wow
Yes.
do you play a lot of wow?
i did i played for 4 years
i don't now
and he says he plays wow all day every day
when hes not working
i play city of heroes now
he says he has no friend anymore.
aww
i don't have friends either
it makes me sad sometimes
i wish i was a more loving person
but i can't
everyong has diff levels of function
everyone
Ive never been on a date though.
some times ppl have a high function in both technical and art/emotion
usually its one or the other
If you dont have both it vbecomes too hard to make money.
i can see how it would be good in some ways
i can also see the possibilities where it could stunt someone
The argument of kids needing to socialize at school is bullshit.
I never had to and I turned out just fine
same with all the other homeschool kids ive met
it depends on the parents
and ive met a lot.
Ho! Ha-ha! Guard! Turn! Parry! Dodge! Spin! Ha! Thrust!
Probably not
:P
thats the rub
But its really a parent's responsability to teach their kids.
yes but not all parent are fit to teach their kids anything
depends if they are abusive.
not abusive
or unsound
Its hard for me to respond to that
We're taking you to a clambake.
because on one hand, I know some things rub me the wrong way
i have to get out of it
and everyone has something else to say.
just too much emotional damage, too many relaltionship issues, too many things that i haven't been able to fix
and now
if i don't fix them
and soon
then i don't know where ill be
i won't be stable for sure
i won't be able to offer anyone anything
in some ways yes
physical and verbal abuse
alright not a kid then.
and effort
I was kind of expecting you to be a kid because I hear similar things froma lot of different younger people
well its supposed to get easier as you get older
and it hasn't
its actually getting worse
and getting nowhere
where do you want to go?
i want to be diff than how i have been
that is my goal
whats stopping you?
my own ability to maintain stability conducive to such
I see
and meds is supposed to help?
meds are for the bad thoughts ive been having
"Shut up Spock, we're rescuing you" - McCoy.....
trying to make me more positive
and not being able to see past it
Ive never been down that road
talking is talking
i have a followup in 4 weeks and i need to see someone for mental health in addition
if i am to offer anyone anything meaningful
i have to do this
I can't really offer you any advice...
I dont have any experience like that.
no advice is needed
A liberal is nothing but a communist on Prozac!
talk is talk
I appriciate that
I enjoy talking to different people about unique things.
well this isn't unique
its common to a lot of ppl
thats probably right.
its unique for me
because i have never willfully
decided its time to be different
ty i take it ur religious
You could say that.
ive always been agnostic
Storage Compartments? Storage Compartments?
Well, everyone needs to find their own way.
I'm not going to be preachy or anything.
you can talk about whatever you wish i like the philosophy and the study of religions
i find it interesting
The important thing is you try to understand as much as you can about everything.
not everything i only try to understand things that interest me
its one of my flaws
if i have no interest in something
then i ignore it
I do a lot of reading.
But I never read books.
go figure.
Narrow minded: looks through keyhole with both eyes at the same time.
i didn't get my first online experience til i was in the navy
i grew up with atari
Which isn't very old.
and coleco vision
lol
that seems like it would have been fund
fun*
now its all focused on consuming rather than creating and learning.
companies dont say "hey, look at this, you can make this do whatever you want"
and even at my youngish age, it saddens me.
its the way the world is though
I cant expect everyone to like everything I like.
the ppl with their market research have to justify their salaries and their jobs by getting ppl into little boxes of thinking
and they are brilliant at it.
and make more money
I'm not anti-making money
its the means
yes
But id like to see someone invest in some education for the masss
masses*
but not by boxing ppl into the mass market strategies they use to push conformity
the whole mass market industry
I want to see kids learn programming in school
yep
everyone knows how to use word, why waste time teaching kids that crap.
I dont care, learn some html.
lol
yep
Me too!
learned everything on my own
nice ur probably light years ahead of me i cna't program
yep just about
thats all you need to make something great.
yeah
very nice
this fall.
they are signing up because they are interested
I'm floating in a most peculiar way.
I have no formal education in it
i want to get into computer forensics
well ur brighter than i am
Inokis, one of my favroite things as well :)
I used to write a lot of POC malware
when I was younger.
yeah i can't code anything
very nice
to download and execute a payload
the downloader was only 4.5kb in size
you just must have a brain for it
I coded it in assembly.
I know very little assembly.
its too complicated for me
I wish I understood more though.
i have only the ability to learn
If you want to learn Ill teach you free of charge.
maybe someday
The world bores you when you're cool.
Any time.
well not any time
lol
:P
perhaps theres other fields you want to try out.
Not just computers?
its a 2 year computer forensics degree
a lot of legal
alright then
a lot of computer tech
i have an interest in both
I thought about going into that
but didnt know if I could get a job after.
govt
whats that
infiltrate credit fraud rings onlin.
My nipples explode with delight!
online*
thats part of computer forensice
I know.
forensics
If I could get paid to talk to these guys and get them that would be the best
yep
I already know all the lingo and where they go and how they operate.
lol
well you have all the avenues open to you then
I kind of want to open an electronics shop...
but I think it would just fail.
gahh I have too many hobbies
ive wanted to open a comination business, coffee/sandwich place where you can use wifi or the workstations on site. the workstations would be pay as you go, also where would be tech support and a computer shop, even some classes maybe
Inokis, I sort of had a similar idea
yep
the problem is selling them things
they dont have credit cards
if they have money offer reloadable cards that they can use in store
Inokis, did you come from darchoods?
the network
no i was here before darchoods
the merge was after i joined
figured you seem too decent to be from there.
lol
I was thinking billing their cellphones.
every kid has one
and you can do decent transactions on them.
that might work
that sucks.
I like having my cash NOW.
you'd have to make sure you had enough flow
to cover that sort of transaction
or have a decent up front investment.
I try to make everyone's day a little more surreal.
yep
location is key
for that sort of business
before i even tried it id hire marketing consultants
evaluators
everything
make sure it can be profitable.
i would make sure where i put it would be optimal
woah where'd you come from?
I thought you all left.
and as such I don't try too many different things
I need to become bolder.
risks are risks because they can hold rewards
exactly
nah i did make a few friends over here sooo
Bicycle Repair Man, how can I ever repair you? Well, you don't need to, gov, it's all right. It's all in a day's work for ... Bicycle Repair Man. <Sniff!>
nice
but money doesnt make him act any different.
it takes a strong character not to sway them
Take my Worf, please.
know they are there
thats the kind of person i want to be
get some sleep then
yeah man, you ever need anything, feel free to pm or email.
have a good night
thanks :)

Not sure about everyone else though
Oh I found the problem
Yeah, I figured as much. Actually other have been on, just not really active.

Looks like I wont be working tomorrow.

I said one of the tags was "hail the Fuhrer" for crying out loud.

...wow
<.<
/me curls up in the rafters
!exit
Quitting. Goodbye!
I know. But there are like three people ganging up on me now, which I wouldn't mind, it's just that I actually respected them before this all.
I even wrote a detailed apology, lol, and they'red still pissed. I'm just sitting back and laughing now.
*they're
Fail
Didn't the trailer for that movie already come out anyway?
There have been about five.
It's just that we beefed up the story, saying it said it was now rated PG-13 and there was lots of blood.
And they're that excited for another one? XD
tr4n513370r
I need one. :o
This was a while ago, though. The topic got to like nine pages before they realized it was a ruse. And yes, they are.
"zomg LOTG SOUNDTRACKZ WOOOOOOOOOOO WHOS BUYIN IT!?"
Lol
I hate how annoying fans seem to have the capability of ruining fandom. =/
*with her advanced
XD
That and her "eleven pets that need constant care."
But yeah, they really do. It's partially the Internet's fault.
Logic at its finest
Well, of course. Everyone needs a scapegoat.
LOL
Sure
xD Pm'd it.
Haha, I would click the link before checking the volume
/me just blasted the first 5 seconds of Never Gonna Give You Up in Spanish to the entire hall
XDDDD
You have my sympathy.
And that user Gyfore was pretty convincing.
I can't believe they actually bought this
A lot of people went in on it with us without us having to ask them.
Well, most were noobs. One girl, the main one I spurned, is pissed at me. I'm hoping it's just hormonal.
:P Gyfore: "Try clicking this." and it's the exact same link.
XD
"I don't even know any websites that carry viruses." LOL
!weather spanaway washington
Woah, that's awesome.
"Cut the racdrops, man. We've got you figured out." XDDD
"Why in the name of Hoole would I do that?"
Hahaha, yeah.
"How the he** were we supposed to even SUSPECT those videos were on purpose?" Oh my...
hah
Just got to that post
I know I've pumped you fll of bias by only telling you my end of the story, but they had no real basis for that argument other than misplaced rage.
*full
No harm /was/ done
And if they wasted time, that was their own fault -.-

/me growls

Aww, I missed it
hey!
Thanks.
Wull, howwwwww-duy.
I finally got some pics scanned!
?
/me takes a spot on the rafters.
sketches really
i'm inking them now
Oh, sick.
i only seen the end of it
I doubt it
No, the combat soldiers haven't left. They're just renamed "security foreces."
OF COUSE
THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE MYTHIC DAWN
*forces
xD
WHY DID I NOT SEE THIS BEFORE
Lawl, it's fine.
/me curls up and hides
/me huggles Kitten-imouto
/me hugs..
Hello!
Crap. No one here
/me grins
/me breaks the fourth wall.
Wait, you mean this isn't real/
It's just a movie or something?
\:O/
^-^
Where: Yeah, dude. A sequel, actually.
Kitten uses her powers of persuasion for evil.
Sequel?
:o
Kitten: Haha, the pouty face strikes again.
Mhm. I'm not sure, I've never seen the first one. We're supporting characters, though, I'm sure of that.
not evils, for yummy's!
Yummies are evil, aren't they?
not all of them!
not ice cream, i got that earlier cause it was on sale and i didn't even ask for it
ice cream cones!
Exactly.
/me noms the evil Kitten
:D~
Psh, see. You had the ice cream but you still /wanted MORE/.
D:
Now the cone is needed.
/me runs
uh huh the cone is needed for the ice creams
i'm gonna have it when i turn 18 *nods*
:o
And you become mean.
ice cream keeps me from becoming mean
XD
Welcome back.
But you wont be able to fit it in anymore
It all makes sense.
Hey
/me does some mean things, just to prove his point >:|
yes!
/me is not evil
:O
They didn't!
hey
Everyone was mean.
And torturing each other, burning everyone, etc.
awesome
the only complaint I have is that my room doesn't have air conditioning
yikes
/me appears!

lates..
/me curls up to Stitch

No

Kitten: Oh, you certainly are.
:/
:O
/me is smack'd
D:
lol
teenager!
not a child!
Haha, technically you are a child until eighteen.
/me pats little Kitten on the head.
too bad the dsi's camra sucks
http://infamouszed.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2xaiq6
Shhh, the grownups are talking.
>:D>:D>:D
Not sure if that was censored.
it wasn't
It only censors "asses
/me growls
I think
was that censored?
no
huh
It must have been removed.
its just that you can barely make out anything of it
removed?
glasses
grasses
Clear as day.
Unless of course the day is foggy.
xD Also not censored.
cucumbers?
D:
o.o
Woah, we can say normal words now.
Even cucumber! D:
xD
We unmerged last Thursday
We decided the merge wasn't in the best interests of the network
SR: Did you get the matter-creating app yet?
louve was not pleased, apparently
Plus, the official decree is that the DarcHoods are far too gangsta for us.
lol?
Not yet
Old enough to drink in Italy.
o.O
really?
Where: Sixteen, if you must know.
either about the unmerge or mad at Aristeo/the network for making that decision
But apparently louve refused Aristeo's help in getting DarcHoods back on its feet
Awww.
Maybe they just have much stricter punishments for drunk driving
That's how it is in Germany I've heard
Probably. Haha, or they could just bump up the age to drive.
The drinking age is really low but no one ever drinks and drives because they'll actually get their license taken away
/me doesn't understand why we don't do that here
Hm... do they drink and text? Far more dangerous, in my opinion.
XD
Or text and drive
SR: Sorry to hear that.
I tried to text a drive and almostmdrove into a ditch
Lol, yeah. My psychology teacher was lamenting about that today, actually.
/me got a highlight!
Yeah, that was a little bad for morale.
:3
/me takes out a highlighter and scribbles on Aristeo's face.
Very well.
:/
What's the driving age over there?
:P
Five.
It's 16 here
/me is not sure about Italy though
lol
nah... you get a tatoo gun and...
Listen, it was essential to the joke that a highlighter was used, alright? racticality doesn't apply. :P
Yeah
*Practicality
Specifically Minnesota
Although I think the driving age is the same in every state
my fingers smell like I've been handling rubber products, like tires
/me eventually helped them get back on their feet
Hehe
I just got my license this month
I'm 19 and have had my permit since 15
<+Sartre> my fingers smell like I've been handling rubber products,
That's all i read.
I've had a few chances to get my permit, but I don't even want it yet.
/me steals everyone's context
Where: XDDDDDD
Sartre, I AM 18 and don't have my leaner's!
:D
At least Sartre is being safe.
lol
How nice for you, where
Hehe
i need to do it the next month though
because my sister turns 16
My cousin is 20 and has vowed to never get his license. xD
I saw a Lincoln truck picking up someone at school today
Rawwr
/me throws Bait!
And she's been saying for over a year that she'll get hers before i get mine.
/me goes of to get noms
/me throws mud!
off*
/me takes bait and throws mud back at inf
Is there a reason rich people flaunt their wealth other than to be flashy and pretend everyone likes them?
I mean the ones that already have two personal jets and just bought a third for $80,000,000, or the ones that buy stupidly expensive vehicles, like a Lincoln truck
Well as thrilling as that was
I must be going
Hahaha, well, even some people that do that aren't jerks.
But... you just got here dude
I didn't call them jerks
Was literally halfway through writing "Dude, you just got here. "
:P
I called them flashy morons, which they are
I was paraphrasing, I guess. That can fall under the jerk category, methinks.
Dude, you just got here.
Is there a reason to own three personal jets?
You just dude but here got.
Friend of a friend
lol Jessi Slaughter
Sartre: There might be a logical reason to, for someone.
D:
/me shoots Ping in the head
lol... OK then
dam... lost the remote...
Eveidently where was an unruly child.
/me sends Ping to the time out corner
*humorously
"Sometimes, I lose the remote!"
He's at work right now
Should be back any minute now
right now?
my headache went away
Cool beans.
This happened hours ago though I'm just noticing it now
Maybe not
We both have a lot of homework
I probably shouldn't even be here right now actually
-.-
Haha, I sprained my wirst somehow and by you mentioning that I just realized it has stopped hurting.
*wrist
talk to us!
Oh no, the police told me to stop, I must comply
like right now, I should be reading 160 pages about java
aye...
and writing an essay about the title of the course Justice and Call to Servant Leadership
My school is overcrowded
My school has 2,600 people in it :3
It sucks, especially when most people just stand in the way and then yell when you bump into them
it's not too bad
the usual size textbook text
:O
You win :(
Lol
there are like fourty kids on my bus
It is horrible
But I'm in a college :3
My high school had about 2400
I usually dont read any of the books i have very much
My college is actually a lot smaller than that
Squint print, lol.
/me skips about five pages
Orientation homework?
You rebuke that textbook.
i get saying hi to everyone on the course but i know how to navigate a website...
its online homework crap
Itz?
Ttz. xD
/me likes his college
Ttz?
It's just an intention misspelling of tits.
Tits?
abreviation sory
*sorry
Everyone is just soooo accessible
Were their assassination attempts on either?
I just heard that today
Rule 31
Not this time
/me sighs.
Good.

/me is punched D:
Punching might irritate the cut.

Hey.

Heya
I like it
Though I think my net hates me ):
You know, Vikings were afraid of my ancestors :o
Well, at least they did not mess with them :3
Estonians of course :p
Did they encounter each other even to be considered spared? :P
Of course, there were trade relations :o
I was forcing an opinion that they were spared rather than not messed with.
Well, the Estonian pirates still sunk their ships and sold them on their slave markets D:
Hahaha, nice work there.
Why? :o
They still pwned lots of other folks :o
*hefty
Silly vikings for carrying their ships from river to river :o
/me shrugs.
They built their ships to be light anyway.

it could of been worse
could of been like AHT
ewww
7That's like saying being hit with a wooden bat could've been worse because it could've had a nail through it. It's still /bad/
it had cheap levels
12^ same
i hate the sparx missions
12I hated all the non-spyro levels.
same
the penguin ones were dumb
7hunter was stupid
i hate the elders
7blink was stupid. The byrd levels were alright, but the whole point of byrd was that he could fly without a jetpack
7it annoys me that they completely removed all sign of Bentley's intelligence
Bentley was in etd
7Bentley was in AHT. That's not the point, the point is that they made him stupid
he was in aht?
which level?
oh ok
one of the elders in aht is gay
oh ok
7Hunter already defies the laws of physics with his ludicrously slow arrows

07i've already gotten 15
I...see
07though
07so this has been a dragged out stupid fight
07i know
07tell me about it, there was hardly anything i wanted to post about
thats one of the reasons I hate forums :/
07same
07its cruel to have a post requirement for their tutor program
07oh well i have 17 posts now
07i'm only 3 posts away from reaching my goal
/me runs off to get some food

07what if i said watching paint dry was uninteresting
10It is
/me squeaks.
07true
07anyway magic is interesting
07because there is literally anything you can do
07there are cards for everything from winning to losing on purpose
07Quilava
07no
07guess you just have to play it to find out
07lol
07i didn't even know that card existed Quilava
07anyway i was going to ask healinglugia to look at the deck
07but he refused
07:<
07so much for having an opinion
:/
07i wanted someone to give their tweaking opinions before i used it against you
hm
07?
*cynderpoke*
;D
nothing
just working on something <.>
6Now you're on? D: >.<
6*icypoke*
07dunno
07i think this strategy might be a bit... redundant
07like i usually do
6When I was on earlier and could stay on for a while,you wheren't there.. D:
the strategy is to win?
6Now I have like five mins.. >.<
12Aww...
12*slaps*
07the strategy if i get it out
07is that i have no choice but to win
6*icyslapback*
07if i get it out
6Chicken? :3
12Yes please. :3

12Well, she's the only one that takes my bullshit...
12*cynderpoke*
07which a couple of them were deleted
07but i understood why and knew they would probably get deleted before they were
/me waves
07dunno i'll probably scrap this one deck
07because it really is redundant
6Shizz.
6Why'd my webcam open? o.o
12Cause you opened it?
12*slapscyndar*
07the other deck though that i built
07i easily can see myself enjoying

good tip
The cyber Police... they have been called...
Oh
But they are known for the text.
Fuuuun
I've been on there once
It actually can be /very/ fun.
7indeed
I said "hi"
Sometimes as good as prank calling.
The other person said "hi"
and then they left
:P
No "aslaslasl!!!!"
xD
I was a 68-year-old female cat hoarder.
......
Wow
I know. xD
12<.<
12Thanks for ruining it...
7XD
Then I told him that I never have relations with a man unless I get my cats' opinion.
XDDD
Therefore, he would have to you know... mate with the cat.
O_o
"nah i dont do cats."
But he was "very experienced" he said. xD
haha
Not with cats, I hope
Just the entertaining ones.

Dun dun duuuuun.

it was more of the concept of Cynder rather than the character
Lawl, are you calling her pansexual?
I'm sorry, you lost me

xD
But then I realized I'm the only girl in this channel
D:

Hahahaha.
Hmmm.

Oh, don't even play around with that.

Mmm. It was fun when she called me racist for telling her to stfu
:P

Nuuuu
D:

xD
xD
Oh yeah, I remember that
Wait, raven did that?
there we goooo. :P

Not the raven we know
Someone from Neoseeker

No, ma'am.

.... ma'am?
/me nods.
Hahaha, yep.
brb
12Basement nintendofreak...
also, OFF?
Owl Fantasy Forum. No, it is not a form of furry site. xD
no!
You sound like furnial.
12Yes! D:<
I'm ready to argue my case, it's just that yours is based on the title of the forum.
That and I haven't displayed any furry tendencies.
besides an odd obsession with owls
Lol, even when I joined at 13 I wasn't obsessed with owls.
And still amn't.
Yeah, don't you like my contraction?
XD amn't
Being on a forum about something hardly automatically qualifies you as obsessed
Being on three forums for something.
May qualfy.
*qualify
Are you on three owl forums?
:P
On a related note. I've invented my own language. It's identical to english except 'awesomer' and 'irregardless' are words and '-izzle' is a more common suffix
yes
also, there's a midpoint between 'overwhelmed' and 'underwhelmed'
Can we also put in 'unclarity'?
I was thinking todat that this should be a word.
*today
sure why the [censored] not
Argh, I actually have plans.
Gotta go, peoplez.
Bye

I wanted to work there, but my hours didn't work
I thought SR was doing that
Yeah, that was SR.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan back away
does SR ever do anything ever?
Well he starts things.
He rambles about programming
Like that RP site.
Then...Nothing ever happens.
He does that quite a lot
starts it and never finishes anything

srry, Pokestar :<
Yeah
04sorry PS, just trying to make light of the situation
People make the joke whenever someone says, "OMG, did you draw that?!" "No, she traced it." "Oh, how uncool."
o.o
04people say that to me when I draw at school
04I could care less
It makes me mad >>
That just makes me mad, but whatever
04insult whatever they do
bull*
04insult their clothes, their looks, whatever
>>
04or just humor them
Meh*
^
04what I find really odd is that people go "Hey Drake" and I reply "Hey" and they laugh
04I honestly do not get it
04are they expecting me to ignore them or something?
Some people are just stupid
04If someone says hi, I reply. But if I know they're out to get me I ignore them
good idea :)
Anything related too immaturity I tend to ignore, unless I'm having a muck around myself

probably want to put a limiter in there
Corei7s sure can spam when bad code rears its head

2Ouch...
it'd take more than that to kill off this thing
2Blender...?
http://www.blender.org/
rendering high-detail and high-quality settings takes a LOT of power
2It's the 1168? pin model
the 9X0's use 1366 pin
2Extra cores don't mean more power, it's up to the coding.
Mrr
2http://www.anandtech.com/show/2839/2 It's about the same
*m
2Hopefully newer games take advatage of those cores...
2I can't overclock (Dell Vostro, with a 350 watt psu)
2And I don't need too...
and told to
24 cores fully loaded
2What?
2You have that?
2GLAdNorris
2Glanorris
2What about those Supercomputers?
also, it's entertaining how AMD's X4 965 at 3.4 GHz loses to the 2.66 GHz i7 920 by a significant margin
and it can probably do a decent amount of load on a supercomputer too
2Next topic- HyperThreading or Not? (4vs8 cores)
02Deja-bu
2Deja-Tu
2Though I never see the 4 virtual cores used up... (Only HyperPi can do that)
there'll be a benefit from the extra cores in situations like a program that supports quad-core, and wants to fully load them
since it leaves four cores untouched and other programs can be offloaded onto those

6kids as in.....teens, 18 year old probably
"moans"
6the girl "because you have to"
4the pokemaker app is an app to make unrealistic or realistic cards
6drf therefore, is 12
7Ah, an app?
4yep
7As an Apple application? (Alliteration!)

04oh lord
04I just saw Vinyer's age
04Irres is 20 years old dammit
12what lol
wb
12just how fast do dragons mature in DRP
04not 2344
04well
04Irres is very young
04by the standards of dragons
04besides, everyone matures at different rates
12wow...
12heh
12the game's time equals my own XD
12still
12 1:50am
12i thought 20 in any race
/me accidentally ignored Raine in here because he was talking to Raine over there
12would still be like a hatchling
04lol
12no matter how much you spin it
04well
04to me
/me slowly crawls back out
04dragons mature at the same rate as humans except until age 20-30
04then where their aging slows down
04lol
04don't
04but then Lunaria is only 16 :\

6I've seen another variation of those, but THOSE
win
Breeons
6BREEEEEEEEEEEES
6yes
they are fun
6I have plans for a bree plush
6but I dunno if I should seeing how long it took me to make the other plushes
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3
6http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=umbreon+plush#/d24b6jn more lifelike than that, but this demanded to be posted
wtf it doesn't want to load D:
But when it does
6http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs46/f/2009/184/a/2/Standing_Umbreon_Plush_by_usako_chan.jpg
6try that
6I wasn't planning on making a life-size bree
Oh hai
6because....it's huge
6but
those ears |3
eeee
6seeing one on DA made me think a lifesize bree would be cool
It definitely would.
6but see
6umbreon is 3'3"
6that's HUGE
6http://asteria-the-light.deviantart.com/art/umbreon-lifesize-2-150713633
6cuddle
height to the shoulder or length?
6height probably to the head
6pokemon doesn't measure to shoulder
lol
direct link thing to the second one pls .-.
6http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/017/5/d/umbreon_lifesize_2_by_Asteria_the_light.jpg
and you don't measure quadrupeds to the head; that height varies too readily to give an accurate result (bending neck down/up etc)
LOL
then how
doe you
:U
measure a giraffe
z.z
Just make it softer an...
LOL
I was just thinking that
shoulder and neck separate numbers maybe?
6ok well if its being measured to the shoulder, then that's 3'3" to the shoulder
6a couple inches more for the head lol
6BASICALLY
6that's huge
oO
heh
way bigger than it ever looked
6yeah, he should be about 2', maybe 2'6"
lawlfoo
6lol
Yo foo'!
Bah!
LOL
lol
6DOG
is that the biggest gen do far?
*so
6if it's 170, then yes
6it was a rough estimate
|3
6still
6close enough
Dog-like !!!!!!!!= cat.
anyway which was this referring to?
6there's an entire section here of the interview about tsutaaja |D
Tsutaaja looks like a nerd
6NO
6D:<
6oh no
6ICY!!
6*icyhug*
6from the interview
6that note being pokebeach's writing
6pretty much that lol
6*icypoke*
7*icymelt*
6*kjahug*
?
7*cynderhug*
6^^
6which only 14 other games in history have recieved
I'm still skeptical xD
6including Ocarina of Time, SSBB, and yeh
6same but
6there HAS TO BE A REASON
LOL WTF
madness
6yep
6oh wair
6wait
6here's an actual head count
6that is the biggest
6er
6*156
by five I'm guessing?
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive
five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire
/me explodes
*boom headshot*
6only 3 are events, two of which we know (victini and zoroark)
02hi from the airport
6legendary trio are fighting types
6with their secondary types of course
6er.....wait
6there's that trio
02o3o
two trios?
a hexo then?
6another flying/electric legend
6another flying/ground
6THIS one earns respect: dragon/ice
6wait....
stop saying wait, it makes things explode.
6sorry LOL
6I was reading all of this
6all these are legendaries...
6A LOT of legendaries
6 12
are there 147 legendaries?
mrrrr~
6DPPt has 14
6so it still has the most
6but 12 is huge
6also
6zoroark isn't going to be event specific I guess
02a problem*
6if it is, serebii needs to recount their estimate
I have no idea where to get any legendaries other than the main 4/5 in DPP
and are you?
02yes
6did you bother to read the instructions on that page?

THE DAY AFTER I FIND OUT ABOUT AERO SHAKE
is the first day it becomes a problem
6eh?
srsly, I didn't shake that window you silly thing >:|
LOL
if you use Aero then (at least in win7) you can shake a window to minimise all others
interestingly one window survived but that's probably because it has a selection dialog open

10It's the app
03and that location crap you needed help with when you got the thing?
03that's definitely the iPOd
10I finally got it to work, just needed to fix something
03still
03that's fricking nonstandard
03All of my devices just detect the location automatically

03and it had like
I can have the laptop work upstairs
03dialup speed
03IN THE APPLE STORE
just fine
oh WOW
03I was like "Who buys this crap?"
03like wtf iPod Nano? Why is it $200? My 8GB Sansa was $50 and has like 10 more features
10I agree with that, but still
10You can't get anything like an iPod Touch anywhere else
03they might work if you don't care about wasting money
03Yes you can
03haven't I proven this before?
10And don't say the Android, that's a phone
03http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16855501044&cm_re=android-_-55-501-044-_-Product <- $40 less than the 32GB iPod Touch, has a built in GPS... etc
12microsoft doesn't care about the enviroment
03Droid is the phone
12environment*
03nope
03Droid is Motorola Droid
03it's a phone
03Droid was the first one on Verizon is all
03XD
10oh
03there's now a bunch
03Motorola Backflip on AT&T
03Samsung Evo
03but yeah, there are touchscreen devices running Android that are cheaper than iPod Touches and do more :P
07:)
03LOL "touche"
10And that product you posted
10isn't it?
03how is that different than an iPod?
03it plays music...
10Game player
10plays music
03OK see
10internet
03-d
03It runs Android
03Which can play music, games, IRC, etc etc
:3
10Probably not as much games as iPod
03I beg to differ
03http://www.androlib.com/ <- take a look around there, that has all the apps for Android in a website that you can search
10I could do the same with my iPod lol
03it's one of the more underrated products
03luckily now that the phones are doing well more people know about it
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/funny-facebook-surround-fai1.png LOL
meow
03Yeah
/me sat on
03I've never *ever* seen a TV ad for the Sansa
03though supposedly they did advertise them like 3 years ago XD
[11:55:51] <%Feather> I could do the same with my iPod lol
That's a sad lie, unless you jailbreak which I found acgtually also makes it WORSE.

And that's why :)
2YES LETS
yep
like dunkins? or starbucks?
Not like dunkin doughnuts
The weird thing is, doughnuts are free if you're on shift
it's like starbucks
kinda
12That doesn't tell us anything O___o
5@Roara :: Well. That's kinda crazy.
Its got higher quality food.
6it does say enough
2articuno
10http://www.lugia.us/poll/do-you-laugh-out-loud-in-real-life-when-you-say-lol.htm
its fast food but high quality.
6because if mijumaru's evolution is supposed to be far different....look at that the rumor is
Yeah
12LOL!
2I never!
12It's not that different
10I probably voted never XD
5I would think that the Mijumaru evo would at least like mammalian..
walmart dely...
deli*
6articuno, how O_O
Subway puts me on the toilet for at least 30 minutes.
6it's WAY different
Haha

Yes
12It's just another blue otter
2I WANT THAT
12But bigger..
best resturant evah
noo not like that
6how do you see an otter in that?
12Kinda like Marshtomp and the last one
the hot mustard sauces from mcdonalds
oh, I just noticed, there are more Canadians talking here than any other country at the moment :O
5I don't see the otter either.
i mean Chipotle as in the resturant
Haha
they discontinued them
Oh
I think we have that
:o nuh uh
12Blaziken is a great example
12It looks nothing like a chick/chicken anymore
12But it's awesome
its chinese food right
2Or does it...
12No way, has a mustelid face
yes :D
6...
6http://pokebeach.com/news/0910/rumored-mijumaru-evos.jpg
ew
10bbl
uh ohz
i gotta go
2IS that you Suicune??
12That face looks like that of an otter/weasel a lot more than it's pre-evos..
2SuiKip
the last two years i never paid them any attention.
2!espeon
5Okay, maybe a LITTLE bit in the legs... And in the face.. But the snout is kinda long compared to the pre-evolutions.
2brb
6ok face aside, I still don't see it
12You mean like how an otter should be?
12Lol
6but aside from the face
6how does it related to mijumaru
6-d
12The face and the pose is aquatic..
12Like an otter
/me 2thinks it looks like a Seal
6aquatic is a broad term lol
5But it's also a quadruped instead of bipedal.
6they're a lot more related than this thing
6it's clear they're birds
2NOOOOO.....
6heavy-build, longer snout
2I still see a SealTomb
6that thing look NOTHING like an otter
6noooothing
12Face
6although-
6NOT EVEN LOL
2nah...
6I can't use the "species" relation though...that got blown away after remoraid
6omg wait
12http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/images/2007/08/29/otter1a_470x350.jpg
6those are whiskers?
6it looks like they're coming off the neck LOL
2Yes they are XD
12I like that
6and the shells keep changing color
2It's change....
6I would like to see some consistency
6EITHER WAY
6I hate all of the
6m
12I particularly like the snake but after this discussion I am REALLY starting to like the ottery thing
2Easy Cyndaquil-Typhloshion
6LOL
6well
hi all
5REALLY.
6yeah, these are all crap
12lies
6I like the starters 1st stages though
how is everyone?
6seriously look at that thing though
12I hate the first stages
6what happened to mijumaru's tail
2Fine, but complain about the Starters in the 5th gen
12It got awesome
6before, it was a beaver
6that's ridiculously different
6like
6there's no consistency
6at all
6I think this might actually be legit
2What's even more bad?
12It was always called an otter ovO
5What, the leaked images?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269uRYEUBd8 egads
2How do you know?
6I see a connection between the leaked images and the description in the interview
THAT is why people go for undubbed
12If Smugleaf or whatever can be called a SNAKE.. then I think it's safe to say Mijumaru's an otter!
6mijumaru's supposed to take on japanese culture, all three starters are regional
/me watches
lol
Mijarus a clown >>
6I never said mijumaru wasn't an otter o_o
12Yeh it's a clown
6I said its evo isn't
2back
12Airwolf lol...
6its part narwhal
eeets a clown :P
/me meh.
12The voices just DONT fit the characters for a start....
6I can't see tsutaaja as a snake LOL
2Really LOOONG?
12The voice acting itself, no comment
12hmm
Arti, did you get to the kid yet?
12yep...
lol
6what vid?
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269uRYEUBd8
6oh the legendary one?
that's the official western release
yeah, the legends one
how they decided it was a good idea, I don't know
6RP that;s my point
12i'm shocked, that is perhaps the worst voice acting I've ever heard ovO
6I don't see it as a snake
12I thought FFXIII was bad...
5Yeah.
2this makes me want to cut myself....
12LOL!!
6looking at this image here, with mijumaru's two evos
O.o
6it's pretty good to see how much they clash
2=/
6because the 2nd stage is already legit
really, how did that get through the production process
2I thought 4kids had bad acting...
6maybe not that color
6but
2peace out yall
12I should have gone already XD
12Ok night

a lot of these fags sign on IRC for the sake of idling
a lot of them don't even have an aim and subconsciously click a button with the label
it's as if it's embedded into their daily routines

03you do realise StatsBot is the one that does the kicking LOL
07Obsiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
and Obsi if you mean by posting a Yt link with an unclean name, it filters
or rather if it WOULD trigger
that is a hard sentence to word
Unless Arti specifically set up statsbot to be immune to kicking LOL
Statsbot is the one that kicks
I know.
as own text does not trigger a TEXT event
LOL no.
I was trying to see if I could get someone to say "No I ain't doing that!" or similar.

Andres !!!
Money can move mountains. And erase common sense.
it deserves to be in 3-D
as long as its warm enough
6absolutely not
O.o
I still don't think it's a good idea, but oh well
6RBY and GSC were unable to transfer to RSE and beyond
6which is why they made remakes
I get that
$650 for a jacket, gloves and a helmet
If I had a motorcycle, I'd want to ride in platemail >:3
Hoenn's my favorite
that makes sense, but I still think they mostly want $$$
yeah
Hoenn sems cool
I wasn't buying anything for myself though
*seems cool
I'm probably going to end up buying everything off of Craigslist >.>
6hoenn is my favorite region, RSE my favorite games
brb rebooting
I think they released the remakes on their 10th anniversaries for a reason
10Lyon's comment on my journal: They look too damn similar to their prevolutions to really warrant an evolution
and yeah that design was <3
10qft
I also liked the music
6that might have something to do with it
DPPt made me dissapoint
04rerally

Platinum's Giratina battle was EPIC
6anyways
04what does qft mean?

Sinjoh
6the snowpoint ruins
03wtf Sinjoh?

6NOT in sinnoh
derp
derpness

:/
07"just north of johto" my rear
07=P
yeah
XD
:/
more like just north of the entire island
oh :3
because i cant catch it
and i dont want to kill it
I never realized that until now o_o
03and he's like "Yeah, this is worth 2 in the bush"

07lol
07i remember that ad
07based on that map

"Did the little pig cry wee all the way home?" "WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
DRF
I found it out
03I want a pic of that Sinjoh thing
03bulbapedia's doesn't work

07that one
well hold on, here's the same map with lables
6yes it should be in the mountainous area just north of johto
http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/102/3/d/Pokemon_World_Map_by_Cadellin.png
03why does my dorm's cable TV have an entire station that does nothing but play DirecTV 101 all day long
6http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/d/db/Shinto_Ruins_out_HGSS.png
That area north of japan is apparently the Ranger area
03LOLWUT Almia
Which makes enough sense
:D
However where in Japan would Orrre be?
...
I answered my own quesion LOL
6orre should be...
6eh?
03is that the actual country of Japan?
07yes.
6yes
Look at the area where the Safari Zone should be
did you steal an ice cream truck for mmmeeeeeeeeeeeeee
03wow
03I mean
for Johto
?
03I know Kanto is an actual region in Japan
That island area looks a lot like Orre
03o.o
03wtf is orre
6chimera, no
10o-o
hm?
6orre, imo, is in that area west of johto
Where else would it be?
6not the island though
03is that Colosseum/XD?
yes
oh
03k
that area?
Well, besides that
heh

/me cowers
6...
6does that make ANY sense whatsoever
sorta
hi where :o
._.
03nope
6not in the slightest >_>;
03swearing is just stupid
:P
*exactly
actually
that's a misconception
Because (delibrate) <censored>
6o_o
/me hides
>:
6which
swearing excessivly can give the impression but just means they have no sense of judgement in their speach :/
Hmm
6no
:P
6most are
it's just stupid TO swear, however it's sadly common :<
07Blazaking
well
/me 6runs
07!umbreon please
Although I can't type.
6no, I know the difference
that's because the stupid people take swearing as a way of power
:D
like
thy think if they swear they have more power in their voice
*they
03though the other day I totally said the f-word without thinking x.x
03and then I was like "WTF where did THAT come from"
07..
07what
maybe you're RIGHT, drf! :O
6lol
/me RUNS!
03usually I just go "ow frick"
03yeah
07now
03that's more or less how we usually play RockBand XD
XD
03the Pokémon theme
07great
03I imported it, right
wat
07its broke
03and the parts were epically impossible to play
03we all failed
I neeeeeeeeeed to get that
03XD
03well don't you have it for Xbox?
I usually only swear at lunch in school .____. I dunno why.
I have GH3 currently
03I only know how to hack custom songs on Wii
heh
03oh
well FL
03this is a RockBand 2 custom
03so eh
school is full of idiots
oh blah
ironically LOL
03in theory
03you could convert it
03but I really dunno how to put custom songs in the Xbox versions
causing one to stoop to one's level
yeah
Uh huh
...
:o
Xbox does the whole DLC crap
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE POKEYMANS!
/me hides
the problem is once you get used to something you don't see too much a problem in it and it kinda slips out lol
6ok I think this'll work
03so does Wii but it's hackable since it uses the SD card and not a hard drive
by a LONGSHOT XD
03though I kinda hate the RawkSD people :/
Where you go to school, do kids have contests to see who's the stupidest by swearing the loudest in lunch?
lol
6my mock plush stevenbree worked
03nope
rawk SD
6so I can go ahead and make the pattern I think
omg kewl
03RawkSD is seriously a bunch of elitist hackers
They do here -_- and its really annoying
FL
6also
That sucks :<
