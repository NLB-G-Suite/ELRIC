:D
13hundreds of permutations...
13gate has some 36 symbols, need 6 for an address
smooches :D
13way way more than hundreds possible
/me likes permutations
yeah hundreds sounds like a few orders of magnitude off.
00,10quick run the numbers Shizuka
recalculating...
would the amount of coordinates for the stagate be 36^6?
Sumica: I love you
/me got a strange Liberty Launcher
WHOOOAH
ohaaaaaw
00,10Nice TOY_PON3|TF2
13oh milky way has 39..
:)
13so....
/me has no idea what that is.
1339 nPr 6
00,10I suppose you will use it on me at some point.
yes sam, you said that already
132,349,088,560 possible addresses in milky way
Indeed
it's a PHONEBOOK
00,10I got the lazer rocket launcher last night thanks to one of our nice viewers ^_^
13wrek gave me a strange ax today <3
hello again
Nice
A GIANT STARGATE PHONEBOOK
2,176,782,336 possible worlds @ 36^6
hi Phase4
DAYUM, that's alotta adresses
ohai Phase4
SO MUCH MAIL
00,10i wanted to play with you guys today.
did they say 7 symbol codes?
wow, just when i thought bronystate can't get any better, you guys start streaming SG-1 /)^3^(\
136 symbol address, 39 symbols available
00,107 yes but one symbole stays the same.
13plus one for point of origin
Derpy's gonna be busy
13but that one's irrelevant cause it's unique to each gate
^^indeed
/me licks everypony
there goes my sleep schedule...
Now...Should I buy a hat, weapon, or misc?
HATS
TOY_PON3|TF2: Go nekkid.
13and we have a premise for a series!
Placebo: <3
:3
need more hats TOY_PON3|TF2
from the discusion about stargate i gather the stream is either booring or stargate
6 symbols mark 3 axies in the 3d environment of the milky way, pinpointing the target location. the 7th marks the starting position
Ishbestpony Why I get licked? D:
Nuke all possible desinations. It's the only way to be sure.
MahBoi777: I do need moar hats..
3,518,743,761 then @ 39^6
Snakkkeeeeees because ponies
LOL
/me buys ALL the hats
13not exactly
:3
13symbols never repeat
13and order matters
an 8th symbol gets you into the pegasus galaxy and all 9 lead to the destiny
00,10then they added the 8th, which is like dialing the area code first
well, the books exclaimes that
its shooty time
13yeah 8 is a distance function
so i'm gonna believe the books
139 was for specific gates
shooty wooty
PEW PEW PEW
Pretty sure the number of permutations possible on a given stargate was found to be way, way way too insufficient to properly cover an area the size of a galaxy. Least that's what I heard.
THIS IS MY BOOMSPEAR ... .STICK ... . . thing
hey guys
so in essence, there's no limit to the number of connections
Shizuka: theres a function that does that, i THINK its factorial but i've never been good remembering words
00,10bang bang, she shot me down.
13permutations
i have a feeling the writers didn't quite think that stuff through when they first came up with it
1339 nPr 6 is the 2 billion number i said
/me does drugs
Of course they would kidnap her.
Walmart
Its 2349088560 combos
13brain all melty
remember kids, drugs are bad.
for the 39 symbols without repeating
I might buy Modest Pile of Hat
Hmm..
Presccription
00,10sleep sleep. poppies poppies.

Hmm.
"Poppies" is a euphimism for morphine...
Toy...You being playing Tf2?

Aircrafter: Yes

Cavy EQ had a post about it a few days ago
so new episode then british movie night immediately follows
it directly dollows the stargate movie, maybe you should watch that one first
00,10correct
is this the movie?
i remember seeing the movie
Will it cost a lot of money to improve capacity here?
this does look like the movie
Hmmm...Well I think about it, I will probably come across it. But then I never come across HATS...
this is the pilot of the series
which came right after the movie
00,10we have plenty of room here.
Plus I technically got a weapon already
i watched this and was disapointed with the stargate
i only have two hats :p
I have 5
So many hats.
Sumica have you been in these rooms during an ep of MLP... wayyy too much talking to even read

DAT FACE
Is the host's mind destroyed with the parasite takes over?
Hmmm...
/me wonders if should buy Modest Pile of Hat
It only gestates in the intestines.
HE'S DEAD
the larvaes get carried around usually by jaffa(the snake-heads) in belly pouches until they mature and can take an own host

Oh yay! stargate SG1 :D

Sumica: Sam you say?

WOAH!

00,10Krakass just search EQD for stargate equistria

How does STargate Equestria handle the bug scene?
00,10It dosent.
:D
watrya watchin
00,10jaffa in the trees
AA-12?
yup
Stargate equestria has an AMAZING OP, if you hunt it down..
Ponies that carry a parasprite in their manes are granted long life.
princess celstia want to battle O.O
wants*
the story is basically that sg1 came home from a botched mission but the stargate short-circuited, sending them to the planet of equestria, which had a stargate that was disconnected from the network but reconnected by the shortcurcuit
guns > laser spears
obviously
they work now
g36 is best gun
well, staff weapons are not made to kill people
its like ßigmacietnam
they are made to make them piss their pants
wtf
vietnam*
too late everyone dies... end of story
Don't these people have Mortars or artillery? Has any of these "military" people even heard of a tank?
sooo inaccurTE
Tanks don't fit through the gate.
And O'Neill kind of... semi-freaks for the rest of the story. Semi. Because it's silly to his head.
00,10hard to get a tank 20 stories below ground.
A tankette?
LFG. Need tank.
convinient rocks
/me becomes L4D Tank. RAAAAWWWRRR!!
rofl
No tank for you Pale..
Those thuds when things hit the Iris... they are nasty cause you can just imagine what's going on
no tanks?
Germans have a neat little mini tank that fires TOW2 missles. That'll ruin someones day.
/me shoots at Midnight_Tempest
oh, and it turns out that celestia and teal'c were in the same business
they seem rollin
/me throws a rock at TOY_PON3|TF2
/me gets hit and is down
00,10still love what jack calls the jaffa ponies
noooo bad timing for commercial
Oh, and Daniel and Twilight have what can only be described as a Bromance. Even though Twi is a girl. But, well, there are limits.
awesome
I'm down!
not the women
<--- someday wants to work rules combining MLP into Exalted.
/me charges up to TOY_PON3|TF2 and smashes him
MEDIC!
Awwww I'm hit low!
http://macromeme.com/dog/bill-nye-troll.html
USE THE M204
/me hits TOY_PON3|TF2 with a medpack instead of using it on him.
staffs don't kill people guns kill people
/me dies
Score Team 1 = in the 100s Team 2 = 1
theyd be winning if they were using the ump45 supressed
staffs aren't made to kill püeople
Actually, staffs have killed a lot of people.
/me morns the death of TOY_PON3|TF2 "he did't ask for this"
/me hits TOY_PON3|TF2 with a wrench to repair
Okay, Im back now.
:/
Welcome back
bUT... Iif Danny was a pony, well...
yes, but they still aren't made to kill people
Jakka in large numbers = Stormtrooper syndrome
Erecting a TOY_PON3
ewwwww
oh snap
LOL
Note made to kill people "Burns hole through victem"
they're made to terrorize them
Jaffa*
That ain't good
wtf was that
00,10ear rape
:(
yep

kowalski is a spy!
THUD THUD THUD
THUD THUD THUD CRUNCH
squish
D:
GET THE TARP!
havent heard a woah in a while
Sumica :P
staff weapons have the primary goal to inflict terror in the opposing factions m which are primarily quite primitive. the killing is a neat side ffect htoough
Almost a man down!
ummm that iris is going to need cleaned
00,10so do you think they have to wipe the back side of the iris off?
Whoa!
hwooah!
No, because they're never rematerialized.
You know, this HAS to be followed by the Stardate Equestria Video.. just because.
THats more like it
WA-HA-HA!

:3
Stargate?
Agreed with Ken

At least I thought I saw one.
This is Spinal Tap
Krakass, link?

I've seen every episode of stargate at least three times. It gets to become the type of show you never get sick of. :)

we like that becauase it's AWESOME.
we got someone knocking on the door... set self destruct
I always wanted to know what happens if you go through the stargate backwards.
ouchy
00,10you cant.
00,10it's one way
That's sum strong iris
Oh, so its like going out an incoming wormhole.
a wormhole always goes in the direction you dial. you wanna go back, you have to open a new wormhole
bugs on a windsheild...
That's a morbid thought.
knock knock! Who is it? Burglar!
how does that guy not know about the bug in his head
i love that thought...
00,10the technobable behind the iris is it's so close to the wormhole that you cant be rebuilt by the gate before you hit it.
Are you a spy:D
00,10so it's like throwing a bucket of water at a wall.
Ok. I have t get sleep. 2:07 here

SGU is a blight on the series
00,10it was like lets see how many shows they could coppy.
Never watched SGU
it had way to much drama
Like relationship/useless drama?
00,10It was lost in space with portals
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
like somebody took all the drama out of BS galactica, concetrated it, multipled it and stuffed that into stargate
00,10exactly Dark_Horst
Oh wow. I'm glad I didn't watch it then lol
I'm putting off dishes to watch Stargate.
00,10I did like how they alowed twi to bypass the iris in that fic.
actually damn plausible
i like battlestar galactica, it was a great show

Going to the cafeteria before 12:30 was a smart move, almost noone there

Jim: all your talk about lunch confuses me since its 2 am where i live
Time zones are crazy things

It's 11:24 here and I'm eating my lunch-but-I-haven't-had-breakfast.
Kammerjunk: I do that all the time
Kammerjunk: that's called brunch
brunch den
Yesterday, I didn't even eat before dinner.
nido: Well, I usually have my lunch at around half past 11.
That's a sunday, I usualy wake up for dinner then
Okay, I don't wake up -that- late.
I sleep laate on weekends
>Barely eats anything

I dreamt that I was on a sinking ship tonight
First time I've dreamt in a long time
Well that was fun.

The last dream I remember was from when I was 8, and that's because that was a seriously trippy dream.

Not because WR R LEGUIN LOL.
No 9gaggin'
9gaggin?

A pun on "No lollygaggin'."

Wrek: Saxton HALLLLLLLLLLEEEEEE

05type connect 46.236.85.221 in console
you just need practice
where is wrek located cause my ping is horrible
That's silly!
DeadpoolDash: Wrek is in Sweden.
TOY_PON3|TF2: I bonk'd you :3
gaah, me neither, downloading it atm
00,10I dont think any one has this map
The Land of Metal.
BONK
Placebo: I suck as spy ._.
TOY_PON3|TF2: I didn't remember how to even type a message untill that last game >.>
im in Alaska that is probably way mine is so horrible to wrek
Soooo
why
Feels good having a ping of 1.
has anypony got any idea why my mic function isnt workin
it works in the test =w=
Console commands are the best.
oh yeah i am not cut out to be a blackguard i suppose :P
Starflash: Just doesn't work for TF2?
are ya holding down v?
Yeah, I am.
I have no idea what server you guys are on, so I'm just going to not try.
Enough TF2 for one night..
was SB64 even in there the last few games?
nope
he is playing MW3 if I am correct
Ew.
yup
Soo, I was wondering. Are there any Homestuck readers in this IRC?
lol rebel yell
Isn't the free trail of MW3 over? Think he said he won't be playing it
I am 10 weapons away from a new hat. I must play more TF2 to gain more items.
I've heard of Homestuck a few times.
Looked it up once, didn't really see what the fuss was.
Same here Placebo
Does anypony know when the item count is reset?
Does it ever reset? :o
^
I like homestuck. It makes me theorize sometimes, like YSNHDT did for me.
Sinfest is best webcomic.
I dont really like webcomics
I am still pondering if you can count mspa comics as comics, it is not that the text is in the pics. More like a childs book, with a pic for every page.
Is it wierd that I am attracted to Rainbow Dash?
/me hnnnnnngs
I'm off to bed. Night everyone.
Hey guys
Take care Placebo
Oh hai CupcakeWarrior
I guess the chat is dead then?
So, I've bought Amnesia, but I dare not play it yet

I've heard so many bad things about that game
but I still want to play it for some reason
As have I
Goodnight Chat. It was a fun day. :3
Good night Aircrafter !
Plenty of Gay Parties and TF2.

:|
talk!
Shinedown!
Guess people are either working or sleeping at this hour
also, super late bye nick
Jim: That's bullshit it was alive an hour and a half ago
Sorry..when I'm sleepy I get cranky...
true
Then we had Yatta Yatta and stuff.
What's a Yatta Yatta?
I helped bring the chat to life at that moment
Jim: It's a song
Ah, right
You don't want to know.
I was here then, but I couldn't see the stream so I had no idea what was going on
You wanna know why I'm really irritated though?
Why's that?
The WHOLE time I was playing I did not get a SINGLE item :|
While everypony else got like 4 or 3 of them in one game
I was playing A LOT of tf2 yesterday, and got none items whatsoever
Like wtf does TF2 not like me that it doesn't wanna give me items?
Highlight of my day
I GOT A TOP HAT
I don't wanna waste my money of my weapons...
Highlight of my day: Didn't get shit
:|
Everytime you buy a hat, Gabe gets a snickers
Oh my god!
what weapons do you need?
DeadpoolDash: I don't know what weapons do you have extra?
i have loads of extras
I don't have nothing to trade so I don't think you want to give me a free item
they just take up my backpack
Okay well message me and tell me what items you're willing to give away?
ooh, time for class, but I will peak my head in here from time to time
I need keys .__.
Dashie_Dashie|TF2: Buy keys
confound my internet
can you find keys too? or craft them?
Well my TF2 crashed, I'm done for the night
Dashie_Dashie|TF2: You have to buy them
:3
you can't find keys
or trade for them
I love this remix

Hello everypony =)
ohai StickySyrup
hey
Why why would she pop up in my head so randomly?!
Just finished the 6th chapter for my fanfic... omg its getting good XD
hi StickySyrup

TOY_PON3: lol saw u playing lastnight.. loved it
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/8662/The-Power-of-Stars
StickySyrup: Thanks
sounds interesting
Maybe...maybe I miss her...
Sounds good
But she was evil why would I miss her?!
Phase4: Its taken me a while, and it may not have many views, but im loving writing it
bye bye erverypony
Time for me to get back to work, see you later guys.
C'mon somepony help me out abit, Do I bring her back into my life or do I leave her out?
bye RainbowJack and Scavender
byebye
yeah.. I should probablly have some breakfast now... its nearly 12pm
il see you all in a bit
bye StickySyrup
^^
C'mon anypony please
I have no idea what you r talking about
at the risk of not being able to answer (given I'm at work), who is this she
OneTrickPony: I think I miss my ex gf, I'm thinking should I let her back into my life or should I keep her out.
move on
it will do you better
/me looks down
I still like her...
/me never wants to dislike someone enough to cut them out of his life
who broke up with who?
But I'm a fool to think that, knowing she doesn't want me.
I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, you'd better find out on your own
My ex gf broke up with me around December
last year
No, take that back she cheated on me and I broke up with her.
you should probably move on it will be better that way
She broke up with you? then you have no controll over it do you?
oh right
It's just we were together for 2 years..
That's the most I've ever been with someone
if you get back with she will probably cheat on you again
True..
you will find someone better don't worry
I want to find a pegasister or atleast some girl that can tolerate with me being a brony
She couldn't?
She did. She watched it but wasn't really a fan.
why cant you just be friends?
/me is not good with relationships
friendzoned
Because then knowing how stupid I am I would probably start falling for her again...
Unless I start to remind myself of all the abuse she gave me during our relationship then maybe I could work things out with her.
dont worry Phase4 im not either :p
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/smile.html + http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twqM56f_cVo
Thank you Phase4
TOY_PON3: perhaps tell your friends and have them also remind you if they notice you do start to fall for her again?
I'm..I'm gonna try to be a friend. Maybe it would work, but if not. Then I will have her out of my life completely. I have to promise myself to NOT fall in love with her again.
I can do that too
i've gota reboot then check somethign and go to bed, night #bronystate
TOY_PON3: good luck, wish i could be more help
Good night Phase4
night Phase4 thanks for helping me out
nacht Phase4

Assuming you don't read reddit, what do you see in this screenshot?
haha its cool we are both bronys so does it matter? (well except for times)
http://i.imgur.com/qDC65.jpg
Yeah, a brony is a brony no matter any location
I don't see anything special..
apart from the obvious
kids got a different family name to the dad?
Mutterguy: I dont get it
no i dont either Mutterguy
What's there to get?
Was this on Fox News?
Cleveland's ID#
lol i found 69

nope
TS= Twilight Sparkle
TS=Tara Strong
OHH!
OH MY GOD I SEE IT NOW
and I was about tell you
Was there supposed to be something funny?
what I didn't get the sudden realization unlike you two
OH SHIT I saw it
that is very VERY obscure Mutterguy
The letters stand for the mane 6
I nope just a little nod
btw one serious question..
Whoa Phoenix Wright moment... O_O
go on TOY_PON32
Dammit McFarlane
there is a random R
Do you think Tara Strong hates us bronies now that she found out about R34 ponies?... :(
Rarity ^
R is Rarity
no last name :p
oh whoops
so only 1 initial
Well, she must get that not everypony is interessed in r34
Tara had the best Twitter post ever!
I always forget 1 or two
TS-RD-FS-PP-RA-JOO2
I don't want her to think we're all sickos because we're not
MASF123: TS-RD-FS-PP-R-AJ-002
And plus Twilight Sparkle is my favorite pony :(
Pinkie is my fav
The 34 is okay
of the main 6 flutters
argh
mane 6*
Vinyl is my fav they need her back
Nah... she's fine with it. you have to consider her other work
In the sense that i am okay with people drawing it
I don't want my favorite pony's VA to not like us including me :(
Honestly, Tara seems pretty ok with it.
Okay..
Who was the brony that noticed this first?
She should've never stepped onto those grounds..poor Tara
Imjoshdean on reddit
Tara Strong probably lurks in here, and we don't even know it. =O
Welll Imjoshdean was the first to publish it
http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/pxan2/cleveland_show_adds_small_nod_to_my_little_pony/
I just wanted to know cause it's been bugging me ever since I found out
Seth McFarlane's shows were never funny
Later everypony

and then they put derpy in every ep just like mlp
SuperBrony64|Zzz: As much as yyou say you go to sleep, do you ever actually sleep?
SuperBrony64|Zzz: So why aren't you? ;)
10,02Sometimes O___o
can't then I assume?
10,02I need somepony to read me a story ;____;
anyway Hi SB64
He's sleep internetting
lol
SuperBrony64|Zzz: If I start reading cupcakes, will you go back to bed?
Tara should already know of rule 34, everyone of the characters she has played has a R34 version of it
10,02No...cause it's against the rules... ;____;
could do it via pm :p
Damn it.
Still, I need to tell my non-brony friend about the cameo in The Cleveland show. He hates the bronies so much, that I drive him crazy with amazing things they make.
10,02u can tell me about the one where superbrony64 goes to save the princess derpy :3
Hello my woodland creatures
10,02Paradise92 :3
10,02hai :>
Good day Paradise92
SuperBrony64|Zzz: There once was a pony named Derpy, she was the fairest princess of all the land.
yeah i'm here just 2-3 minutes
10,02:D
then off to school
/me cuddles up in bed
goin to school after 2 weeks
damn you
10,02Damn me? ;____;
SuperBrony64|Zzz: One day, princess Derpy went for a walk in the woods by the royal castle.
No school for me today
haha Paradise92 im in the same situation :p dont worry its not that bad
10,02Noooo...not the woods, that's too scary ;A;
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Where is she going, then?
xles: try orchard
10,02To see Pinkie Pie :3
*rewinds*
SuperBrony64|Zzz: One day, princess Derpy went for a walk, to see her friend Pinkie Pie in town.
Let me have a crack then... Once a upon a time in far away and social primitive land was a Constuitional principality know as theBronyState (there were attempts to rename it Bronia but it always got shot down after the second reading)
you cant ping him it will distract him frm sleep :p
...
10,02*squee*
I could never get into reading these fanfics or reading at all. So hard to concentrate. :S
It was a mighty fine day, sun was shining, the pegasi had done a great job at clearing the skies for the day.
hell xles seems to have it nailed down
MASF123: Who's reading fanfics? I'm reading up on dementia and what to do about a demented parent.
Multitasking!
I thought you were going to make a story right now
/me now has solid proof xles is a lady!
Mutterguy: No, I have absoluytely no clue about what I'm doing, as usual.
ooooh
im gonna download some fanfics to read in physics when i go back to school today :p
On her way, Princess derpy met someone she hadn't met before.
oh England it's only 4:24 here
OneTrickPony: you gonna reffer to me as England?
I think I need to take some medication, it would explain my lack of attention span.
no there are multiple people herefrom England
i know
:P
right now thouhg?
Anyone have any idea for a good a main villain that SuperBrony64|Zzz has to rescue princess derpy from?
I'm blank...
10,02Discord :D
oooh
10,02NO WAIT
10,02How about...
10,02KwakLad :D
Why Discord? Maybe someone else
xles: Molestia of course
i dig that go for it xles
KwakLad: Fine, but only if you do realtime dialog.
erm
crap
10,02:>
10,02Ohai PrincessDerpy :3
KwakLad: ohai, you must be new in town, because I haven't seen you here before!
:D
Hey there PrincessDerpy erm i guess so started on monday or tuesday im a new-foal still :p

KwakLad: I see, so, what brings you to this part of equestria then?

10,02But I misclicked <.<
Reasoned "Molestia"
/me hugs SuperBrony64|Zzz.
/me hugs PrincessDerpy
Wlecome back Mutterguy
Hurrrumph
10,02Don't hate me ;A;
It should be noted that I'm the worlds worst RPer, with or without dice. So we'll see how this all goes in the end. =P
So where should i set up shop? im looking for a place a bit out of the way
10,02But you weren't introduced yet ;__;
im terribble withough dice good with them
/me hugs Mutterguy
Should we get dice? =P
introduced? you get new-foals that friendly with everyone straight away?
/me puts on wizard hat
10,02I was talking about Mutterguy :O
I thought i was?? as what the heck are doing in my castle? oooh I'm a mason just checking up on some brickwork
*you
Ohh
I think we need a GM to make this happen. =P
I'm game
gm?
10,02Mutterguy is the narrator :D
Game Master /moderater or whatever
ohh i guess its a bit more general than DM for dungeon master
KwakLad: Yeah, DM is DnD specific GM.
DM is just specific D&D
dang it
aye i did realise :p
I need more tea. brb
01,04Hurry up with the storry o____o
10,02^_^
oh and as a note im not particularly interested in ducks and birds in reality , kwak has no relation to quack :p
Well I got kicked so I lost my place :(
also one of the cast members has gone on break
10,02We were at the part where KwakLad introduced herself :3
Ok, wait I'm lost now...
"Well, ouch"
(oooh)
"apparently pony folk im a filly now"
back back back
Welcome back back back PrincessDerpy
welcome forwards back back forwards PrincessDerpy
/me pulls blankets up closer to face excited for the rest of the story
Thanks, and if ya'll pardon, I'm going back to me, using quotes for dialogue henceforth.
10,02I lieked PrincessDerpy though ;__;
"So, erm hi"
"Will you be staying here long?"
"Planning on hanging around this area for a season or two if im welcome"
Oh my the KwakLad character seems to be a fourth wall breaker
"Everyone's welcome in my kingdom! ...Unless they touch my muffins. Nobody touches my royal muffins!"
10,02derpy lieks muffins :3
"so iI'll be needing a place to stay, perhaps rent out of the way a little bit"
"Muffins you say? I'm a dab hand at making them, i could help sometimes perhaps"
who doesnt like muffins
"You bake muffins?"
"I do try often"
I don't particularly like'em actually, hah.
"Well, sounds to me like you could use some expert hooves to help you out, for a taste test"
xles: shun
"pity about that is i dont have any with me right now, i've been on a long trek and ate them all"
bartsonic: Feel free to take over if you want. I'm rubbish at this. And I'm a muffin'-hatin' herritic! =P
i shall and ill be the best muffin taster ever
I;m honestly having writeers block for a single word
xles oh shus im terrible too but you can see im trying
"Shoot. I guess that's just as well, I was on my way to my good friend Pinkie Pie to get some anyway"
10,02*squee*
GOING TO PINKIE PIES yay
Someone seriously needs to make a MLP:FiM RPG... As in actual pen&paper RPG.
"Pinkie pie? Odd name i'd think she'd be better with pies than muffins"
xles i know ive had this idea
Just then the fanfare (ddddduuuuuh) sounded! "Presssseeentttting the Element Of Laughter!"
"She's pretty awesome at all things tasty, especially cupcakes"
10,02If you check last Monday's newsletter, a group we are working with is making a MLP RPG :D
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Squee!
That is relevant to my interests
SuperBrony64|Zzz: i still havent got a newsletter
I need to sign up for that shit.
"ohh i need something sweet"
10,02If you're good at art, programming, etc, view the contact info in that newsletter :3
"You're free to join me if you want!"

ooo ponies is on my TV
Stargate Equestria is fun if you like stargate

*'It's about Time"
POUND AND PUMPKIN

:DDD
oh ofna you're watching the new ep lol
a Friend in deed?
I'm gonna' listen to this thing, again, because I'm having way too much fun with it; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mid0vJ22oc
NOOO
COMMERCIALS FUUUUU
in my tv channel there are no ponies... only reality show.... and infotainment...
valoreins: Likewise.
I stopped watching TV when I discovered ponies
yesh
As did i Jim
good idea jim
theres enough bronys and pony media to entertain anypony
I stopped long before that.
Pony if anything has gotten me to watch broadcast media more than ever before...
i need fanfic nao
link if anyone has good ones
http://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Story
i only read the top rated fanfics :p
only read 2 actually
oh ponies is back
I've only read two fanfics myself... Cupcakes and rocket to insanity. =P
Both of which are topics not for discussion.
I however intend to violate that rule and state the following; The most disturbing thing is that they're so poorly executed.
...The storytelling that is.
:O
a pinkie pie song!
: D
Heard that they are poorly written
ofna01: AMAZING pinkiesong.
The smile one?
ye
DERPY?
i swear that was derpy,but it was a filly
....
Oh well irc just derped on pc so bye for now
cya
bye :D
Bye
anyone else see derpy in pinkies Smile song?
when she was jumping rope,a filly with derpy eyes jumped in XD
Isn't that Ditzy Doo?
dunno
i guess,never knew ditzy was real
derpy's lil sis?
that sounds believable
I meant Dinky, isn't that her little sis' name?
Dinky, yes.
Ditzy is Derpy, dinky is Derpys daughter!
Ditzy and dinky doo. (Pre fandom influence)
ok
now i get it
I'm in the minority that still prefer Ditzy over Derpy. =P
This is Dinky I guess http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120123081729/mlp/images/3/39/Written_Script_and_Golden_Harvest_with_filly_Dinky_Doo_S2E14.png
it was weird,cuz she was sorta purplish,but had derpy eyes
Dinky is a unicorn while Ditzy(Derpy) is a pegasus
does anypony know if there are any flim flam brother remixes???
google is your friend
ofna01: i have tried to do that i coulndn't find any

Don't worry Pinkie, you always make me smile.

listening to smile smile smile again :D
Probably my favorite song/episode
nick
Did I show you guys the badge I did back in november for an event for a local theatre here? =P

Jim: Wore it all day. They showed the original 93 JP on 35 in theatre. Soooo much fun.
XLES
I WANT THAT NOW
Jim: Guy tearing tickets (well, scanning barcodes on your membership card rather..) was impressed with my stupidity. So.. Worth it! ^^
hah :)
XLES
ofna01: Haha, I can probably make you one if you want, still have the files somewhere.
O_O
you should email me the files
So, I see you like pens
Gotta' edit them a bit, wasn't entirely screen accurate I noticed when I saw it on the big screen.
Jim: Fountian pen junkie. *rolleyes*
so i heard you like pnies,so i put ponies in your ponies so you can watch ponies while you watch ponies
I also made another badge a few weeks ago...
why must you torture me so?
Fun, obviously.
http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7030/6725570483_9b3abcc797.jpg

XLES

Pinkie would beat the two party system
What about that guy, Vermin Supreme. He claims a free pony for everyone.
*starts throwing money*
ofna01: Where do you live?
Unanimous vote for pinkie pie
florida
ofna01: US, check. I shall investigate how 'spensive it would be to ship to the us.

I want one anyway, i don't remember what it is, but i'm sure i want it.
I want to admit to my friends im a brony but i dont think i can :(
How come?
http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6234/6385028959_e7a3cfaec5.jpg
EspyLacopa: im pretty sure they one make fun of me alot\
Yo Guys

Do you really want to be friends with people who would make fun of you for liking MLP:FiM?

SQUIRREL GAVE FLUTTERSHY FLOWER
And not the good kind of making fun of you, where in the end everyone is laughing together.
parasprites
Show them ponies: the anthology.
yes
Say you found this
EspyLacopa: well i think if i show them im a brony slowly they will understand it more
Ponies: The anthology is a definite win to make people bronies
hope they continue themselves from there
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqo53-pNxsE
anyone remember the alert we had to have awhile ago?
EspyLacopa: best music video ever
because of that operation gluefactory or whatever?
akward silence is awkward
moo
hm?
Chat is now lava, discuss
OUCH OW OW OW OW IT BURNS
Lamps of Lava are mesmerizing.
I know right EspyLacopa, Derpy seems to like lava lamps too
Remember seeing a video of that somewhere
I miss my lava lamp. =(
/me used to have one that was used like a nightlight
the derpy lava lamp is my screensaver
ohai guys
ohai Hazard

i think i do
mine's blocked for some reason
who else here has ever seen or heard of a movie called Undercover Brother?
me
I have seen it.
We've all seen it
who here thinks we should show it as an B movie
/me tackle hugs tovler
hi
Too annoying, man. =(
An B?
ofna01's blackness: confirmed
-___-
a B movie XD
im not blck XD
im not black i jsut remembr it being hilarious
black*
We should watch human centipede
I haven't seen that movie though
HELL NO CCCP
NO CCCP
ok
:(
lol
Do not want at all
We should watch more 50s sci-fi.
/me tuna slaps CCCP with a large fish
lol
So when you said "I'm black" what you meant to say was "I'm back"
ofna01: /me noms on fish
we could watch a scary movie sometimes
no hazard
The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), for A movie, who's with me? <3
im not much of a scary movie person
maybe
2001: A space odyssey?
but ill watch that xles
brb
Jim: Good film.
xles: i watched that movie like 5 days ago
CCCP: Hehehe, me too.
Help! for a-movie
We could wtch A Clockwork Orange
or Wizard of Oz
That's quite cool
i love that movie
Let It Be for B movie
Full Metal Jaket
no
Noooooo! Not wizard of oz, it's like a bad acid trip.
FMJ was horrible
Scares the shit out of me every time, especially the lollipop guild.
ofna01: :o
Wait, does all this talk about the movies mean that the new newsletter is out?
50's sci fie movie? Does Iron Giant count?
/me refreshes mail
IRON GIANT
i love that
We watched the Iron Giant already¨
Pulp Fiction
D:
when?
And it was awesome, Jim.
This weekend ofna01
ofna01: This past weekend.
i was busy all weekend
fml
It was great
Don't you get the newsletter?
We should Watch the Super Mario Brothers movie for B
lolno
oh god ponies anthology.. i LOLd hard at death note sce XD
Think we've watched it
good news!
that was horrible
scene*
CCCP: We watched that months ago
im not going to schoool today!
List of movies we've watched: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmUkrR9vDjRUdFl0Z0pReE9TS3VPRkZXeFI4VW9POGc&hl=en_US#gid=0
Sooo many months ago
I know the perfect combination; The day the earth stood still (1951) for A, and Forbidden Planet for B.
EspyLacopa: :( y am i always so late?
It was the first movie night I was here for. Young Frankenstein and Super Mario Brothers.
u guys watched The Room? lololololol
time to take out the adorable trash
XD
Ahhh, Spider's Web.
Someone should add a note that it got hit by the Horrible Movie Clause.
Spiders Web is a good movie
what about The Princess Bride?
Heh. Meowception.
situation that would suck* stuck in an elevator but having to use the bathroom
>.>
that WOULD suck but you DO just pry the door open and piss/shit out of it down into the elevator shaft
^
ofna01: Not a problem judging by the smell in elevators around the stockholm metro area.
we should watch Evil Dead 2
Deathstalker II was awesome.
:( I never watched Firefly and Space Mutiny is useless without The Bots
You've got time to watch Firefly before Friday Tovler, it's only one season.
time is the future
and the future is time
And it's a very good show
And life is time
Therefore, life is life
XD
/me nananananana
^
did i ever mention this is probably the best chatting/streaming site i have EVER been to? because it is
Hazard - that's because ponies.
The Up/Deathstalker II night was wonderful.
not because ponys
Because bronies and ponies
because bronies :D
/me hugs everypony.
/me hugs xles
Because magic is friendship, Hazard.
and because ponies, bronies
my statement is no less valid
true
I do remember being in the channel and listening during the initial Inception stream.
And thus hearing the Meow.
/me silently waits patiently for the stream to come on but is being careful to NOT take his pants off while doing so
We could always watch Plan 9 from outerspace
why not Killer Klowns From Outer Space?
Watching the stream without pants is best way to watch stream
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-so-dont-make-her-dissapoint.png <-- Hazard
Hazard: because of tomatoes
/me notices he's in public "Oh bugger"
EspyLacopa: thats why I DONT do it
Y U WATCH ALL MOVIES I WANT TO SEE ALREADY???
If it wasn't because people unfamiliar with the film would take offence, I would suggest the danish 90s film "Gayniggers from outer space", because it's hillarious.
Dead Space Downfall for B movie anypony?
Wow, dat title xles o_O
B Movie: Howard the Duck
That movie is only 30 minutes long
:P
its not a movie then Tov
Jim: Hehehe, yeah I know. People who don't know the film go "HUBUBUBUB! THAT'S OFFENCIVE!" =)
this is an actual title for a movie we should watch: Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D
I bet the GayNigger's leader comes out onto a stage and sings "Come on everybody,Everybody clap yo hands!"
While we're at weird titles: "The Man with the Smallest Penis in Existence and the Electron Microscope Technician Who Loved Him"
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274518/
There you have it.
My ongoing pick for B Movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083258/
The Strange Thing About the Johnsons is far more offensive and is also 30 minutes long.
Jim: LOLWUT?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374020/
It's only 26 minutes, but it's so much fun.
that sounds insane Jim
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105643/
it's a 9 minute movie though it seems
haven't seen it myself
XD
wow cccp
brb
Jim: We can have a "offensive sounding short films"-night ;)
This one is actually supposed to be good, I'm gonna suggest it as B-movie
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/
Your troll movie is no Labyrinth
It doesn't even have David Bowie sempai-san-sama
The B movie I keep picking… will never get picked, so why bother even sharing it? ;_;
-dono
KUN!
Which one do you keep suggesting Tovler ?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViftZTfRSt8
The Thing
Do you have the power?
Jim: I suggest you watch gayniggers from outer space sometime if you feel for something very silly. Basically the Gayniggers from outer space travel the galaxy to rid it of womenfolk.
Jim: i saw that movie
Sounds fun xles
CCCP: Was it any good? I haven't seen it myself yet
I need to watch it again, probably been 15 years since I saw it.
Good lord, watching Labyrinth in this channel was awesome.
no
Jim: it was okay until u see the trolls
Low budget animation I suppose
they look like they are from an N64 movie
game*
We could always watch Videodrome.
we could watch the original Texas Chainsaw massacre
I don't really like those kinds of splatter movies
or Silence of the Lambs
Hey, the whole Gayniggers from outer space short film is uploaded to youtube, wonderful! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ncwCETyQlk
Jim: the original is alot less of a splatter movie than most think
is chat frozen?
Nope, it's dead, Jim!
i can see yours
No, people are just preoccupied with other stuff, I'm watching danish cinema at it's best.
ohai guys
ohai Hazard
the video isnt playing for me :(
u guys already watched Evil Dead 2 :(
don't think there's a stream at the moment fluttertay
ohhh
my grandma came in here i thought she would kill me :P but apparently not
makes sense
I'm too busy watching Samurai cutting helicopters in half.
oh god i miss my old PC *sobs*
Kill you for what? Were you grabbing cookies again?
yes and i was on her computer
did i kill the chat in cold blood just now?
No, I'm busy watching Gayniggers from Outer Space.
I already explained myself
I don't like that movie
xles: u like saying that name alot
Why not? Gayniggers from Outer Space is a neat name for a movie
ya its just.....well u know
CCCP: It's a solid short film from denmark, nothing to be ashamed of.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLvIyme2MU4&list=FLTBn7pTsF7FAUDZNE6nkYpw&index=6&feature=plpp_video the video i have been watching for the last 40 minutes of no streaming
...
It is?
I am ashamed now.
Kammerjunk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ncwCETyQlk
Hazard: best weird song
my grandma and i watched the weirdest fucking music video the other day
Oh Goddesses, that horrible Danish accent.
http://imgur.com/xxAkY
it was QUEEN VICTORIA GROWING GIGANTIC AND EATING TWO GROWN PEOPLE!
i was listening to Revolution 9 0.o
"Holy phallus, what are they doing down there?!"
I hate it. It was so embarrassing seeing Lars Løkke sitting next to Obama.
that boy needs therapy
Yes some birds are funny when they talk.
and he also lay false teeth
what does that mean?
Man this short film is super silly.
your a nut
not u xles
super silly xles? thats just what a silly filly would say XD
Hazard: I admit, I'm a silly filly, and so is the creator of this short. ;)
:D
Well, time to go home
See ya folks in a while
Man I should've done this sooner, last time I saw this was on bootleged VHS.
ill be at kongregate for a while...ill be back soon if there arnt any people in chat there cya Jim and all my friends :D
Later Jim.

No, noone.

That is my workstation indeed.

As AJ would say if she was a tea farmer; MOAR TEA!
Wtf
Oh well
Waiting for tea to steep...
its really hard for me to convert people to bronies
So, don't.
They don't have to be you know, it's ok to not like our heroin.
xles: but they refuse to even look at it
:(
Their loss.
Don't force it, don't say "OMG THIS IS SO AWESOME", sooner or later your friends will become curious to "why the fuck you're watching a goodam girls cartoon".
They will become, ponycurious.

you describe me very well :)
I'm busy doing other stuff. =P

Would Fluttershy be consider a hufflepuff or gryffindor?
lol ive been doing that lately
TrixieMuffin: Probably a MUD for that somewhere.
im sure there is one
MUD ?
Its funny how everyone is quiet and shy like Fluttershy.
TrixieMuffin: I believe it stands for multi user dungeon (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

lol i remeber hearing that song in a trailer for scott pilgrim
I liked the movie and then I read the magan and liked it more. I didn't like how they portrayed Ramona.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lznr8pjvAv1qii7qjo1_400.gif
yea me neither but still at times i wish i had a ramona in my life
xles: oh pinky always destroying physics and the fourth wall literally
You will someday bartsonic. Just have hope
If any pony can do it, pinkie could.
lol i meant actual ramona id love to fight 7 evil exes and get sword to come out of my chest lol
I liked when Ramona got the sword of love in the last magna
It was epic.

Tovler: what the hay is Linsanity?
Of course, once this online class is done, I'll be back to only attending weekend streams
Fuck yeah, phone server is up to date! ...It only took two days.

I almost fell asleep in my mock...
I haven't met any other.
damn it that didn't work right
Marshallow: IRL? Nah.
nope
what maybe do girls count as bronies
otakon, are you space?
I AM SCIENCE!
I have a good friend of mine, who absolutely loathes MLP, does that count?
Yes, I believe the term brony is unisex bartsonic
and thus, I am space in relation
Jim: Whatever happened to pegasister?
I haven't met anyother althougt someone drew princces celestia on a folder and pinkie pie on a box. I am still searching for them.
bartsonic: yh, it's genderless at this point, just refers to a older fan of the show
ok then 1 or 2 brony friends
Actyally, the females are called pegsusisters
Some people prefer to use pegasister, but I know girls who refer to themselves as bronies
Smile Smile Smiler Smiler Cider Cider Cider Cider… darn it.
Jim: Blasphemy!!11 ;)
wait what counts as older im 14
...well that was odd.
I once saw someone say,"I luv being a broni"
I just told you about my friend who loathes MLP.
...Now she texted me out of nowhere.
Marshallow: well that practice is kind of falling off the wayside
xles: I won't say convert her, but
what do you mean orakon?
xles: CONVERT HER
Marshallow: the girls don't seem to LIKE being called pegasisters half the times from what I've seen is all
otakon: Nah. Not her thing, I understand that. I will however, continue to annoy her for my amuzement. ;)
lol that happens to me alot say there name and then get a call or text or fb message lol just happened to me
xles: no, do not go the way of the TROLL!
THere is a douchbag who likes the show. he is kind of a jerk.
otakon: Trolling extremely close friends is acceptable, when it's the common thing to do.
i troll my irl friends alot
xles: oh, well in that case go ahead. a TIME HONORED tradition!
Calming music - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWeL181JFIk - While I try to keep from rage quiting ^_^ All is Well :)
I do better. I Princess Trollestia my friends.
no really, I'm agreeing with you me and my old buddies did that kind of stuff allt he time
I just downloaded Fallout 3
otakon: It's like, "Oh really, you don't like my stuff? Sucks to be you, I'm gonna' change my cellphone ringtone to annoy you"
lol
CCCP: the game of the year edition I hope
And I'm man enough to answer my phone when it rings in public too. ;)
CCCP: have fun with the G.E.C.K.
otakon: no i didn't whats the difference?
CCCP: That's a great game
/me waves at everypony
CCCP: the expansions
oh
i had a ring tone that was like pick up your phone your phone is ringing pick it up people are staring at you
I found a PMV of IZ's Over the Rainbow - but didnt want to post it here until I found a version that the artist didnt cut short. At first.
ohai RainBowJack
/me hugs Jim
CCCP: the game of the year edition has ALL of teh expansions released for it, INCLUDING the abitily to play PAST the ending
my rington is space is 20% cooler
CCCP: since if you go straight through the game, it's over mighty quick
I have rainbowcrash' 8bit pinkie pie polka as my ringtone, it's a beauty, and loud as hell on my phone. ^^
otakon: well that sounds great but since i just downalodedd it i guess i cant go back :/
His Ooooo Ooooo's are edited out to keep the pacing, I guess. but here's the vid - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2mEPWAx6js
/me hugs Otakon
I want this, though; http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=1714
CCCP: eeyup, now you have to get it seperately if you want to go past level 20
It'd go great with a suit, right?
Cypresswolf: :) that brings a smile on my face
/me hugs RainBowJack back
The editing ruins it for me personally, but you've got the whole song in a previous comment :)
otakon: :(
Pinkie pie breaks the 4th wall
http://nyanit.com/bronystate.net
sorry, and all the expansions are 10 bucks a piece
are there and MLP mods for fallout 3?
CCCP: you could just bite the bullet and buy a physical copy of it at walmart for 20 bucks on PC
Heard IZ on the radio quite a bit vacationing with family in Maui a couple years ago
i could try that i guess
bartsonic: We need to go deeper: http://nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/nyanit.com/bronystate.net

Pinkie pie epis are so hyper
um wat?
brb
See what I mean about the pmv version? the editing is a bit harsh, too obvious. If the artist redid this video with the song's entirety, it would be great
bartsonic: That is my fetish.
lol
I found this and felt bad for laughing
http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Nyan+11+Prolly+a+repost+but+I+ve+never+seen+it_8c3d7b_2485383.jpg

They do to me.
I can't see it though
Want me to find another copy?

Marshallow: hahaha
http://files.shroomery.org/files/11-26/960072697-nyan11.jpg
there you go Jim
It didn't work either o_O
i never been a pinkie pie fan but the episode made me like her a bit more
Likewise.
>never been a pinkie pie fan
true true
How.
I mean, Twilight is my favourite pony, but how.
RD is my favorite
Fluttershy needs to pick up the pace.
yeah twilights my favorite
Fluttershy used to be my favourite.
Thats weird Jim. Such search "Nyan 11" and you'll see it JIm.
But then Lesson Zero happened.
In my case it's probably earth pony racism. Because when I constructed my top 10 list, all pegasi in top, followed by unicorn. So I'm obviously biased.
I thought donkeys and cows were in the bottom.
I can tell what it is from just the title ^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9F-wM0gqQs
lol
Sphyco Twilight was epic
Being a fan of Napoleon XIV made me like Lesson Zero even more.
Not the French guy.
The guy who made D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\fallout 3 goty\Data
I am so bad at this.
They're coming to take me away haha!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnzHtm1jhL4
Exactly.
And a bunch of other tunes.
I loved Crazy Twilight :D
:)
I owe a lot, to iowa pot *sings*
fits perfect with crazy twilight

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DybCjKqyjLE&
Don't you mean love and tolerate, bartsonic ?
More fitting would be "I wrote you a little text to explain how much I love ponies."
Also, that book's probably the size of half of mine.
oh well i did not see that pic on memebase time to make it my own pic and profit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG90sNcVMqk
^ south park refference
aww, I shaved my head again.
I have returned for a moment
Huzzah!
Guys, I read this and its mindblowing. Remember when Rainbow Dash tried to prank Fluttershy with a fake turtle. Now remember how Fluttershy trolled Rainbow Dash by giving him a pet turtle.
-giving her -
Mother of Luna.
"oops"
Fluttershy is now a troll.
turtle works hard to be her pet never appears in any more episodes
tortoise.
hahaha
what ever
Hopefully we'll see more of Tank
She trolled the king of trolls too, Discord.
Was that a Pig Pen pony? :) Hooray! Peanuts Ponies!
hi everypony btw
ohai CountDoofus
CountDoofus: Hi, haha, awesome.
Jim: With all the continuity in the latest episode, I'd be surprised if we didn't.

yeh, we didn't see Tank after he came into pay, but the Cake twins? Eeeyup
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kri83dexbyw *Squee* ^_^
Pony fandom needs less talented people in it... I can't bloody keep up with all the amazing art being produced.
i love the babies cake
Marshallow: >Great Scoot
I see what he did there.
LOL Cypresswolf
Princess Trollestia replies to Twilght's letter by saying, "too long didn't read."
derpy is every where in every pony epi almost
omg i agree fanfiction does scare the shit out of me
bartsonic: Then stop reading grimdark.
Princess Molestia sends Twilight a letter sehe replies "I want to see your sexy plot "
It's your own fault.
well not ALL of it is bad
there's some funny fics out there
hi everypony
just the more "infamous" ones are recognized is all

Not all fics are bad.

can't stop staring at that... plot
...class is still down...alright...Well, Im gonna play some Fable 3
bartsonic: I have to agree with people, that is a quite good first PMV.
darn it another pony walked into the sun
Recommend me some good fanics to read.
Also, even with music blasting, I can STILL somehow hear Fluttershy saying "yay~".
lol
Bye bye everypony
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/9329/Beating-the-Heat

g'day RainBowJack
i usually dont read fanfics. I read clopfics. jk

nope.avi
how is that one
okay, there's some sexual stuff in there, but it's also the most hilarious fic I've ever read
but, can't make you read it, can I
yay
i never played fallout but i heared about fallout: equestria a whole lot
Marshallow: "How Did I Get Here?" on 64 chapters and the sequel "Le Retour" currently going at 25 chapters. Also, "Through the Eyes of Another Pony". These are all Human in Equestria, I'll see if I can't dig anything else up.
Kipkat07: it's Fallout but with ponies
o
But it depends, really. What genre do you like?
... my little dashie
Kipkat07: there is humour, violence, even a little love but it's really good tbh
do they have the mane 6?
I tried reading Fallout: Equestria.
But that kind of grimdark is not for me, at least not mixed with ponies.
I don't want anything sad. Doctor Whoove: The Voice of the Elder was sad. :'(
Kipkat07: in a sense....it happens about 200 years after the end of the world basically
mld was too sad for me
oooo ok
Kipkat07: might be too dark for you then
m'kay
What about "My Little Pony: Friendship is Tragic"
I heard of that one.
that sounds nice
trollface
damn you Trollestia
holy god, 47 chapters!!!???
Well, there's "The Showmare's Tale" if you like Trixie telling stories. Luna and Vinyl teams up in "Party. Sleep. Repeat."
Kipkat07: 49 including the epilogue and afterword, 600K+ words, 2K pages on standard paper with standard font.
o
I have a bunch of shipping, but not everypony likes romance.
eh
i does
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u2JBwlDfMg&feature=endscreen&NR=1
I've read one semi shipping fanfic
Something I amm not gonna read is Cupcakes.
I really should get around to downloading these fics to my local library.
heya all
Marshallow: do not mention that here please
hiya ekips
i listened to cupcakes but not read it
Sorry.
/)_-)
opps
ohai ekips
And those were all complete. I have around 30 fics or so I'm waiting to update.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm6f8q-r9HM
Ayup everypony!
ohai Globetrotter
g'day Globetrotter
How's everypony doing? Jolly good I hope.
And then around 25 more I haven't gotten around to reading.
heya Globetrotter
82 local fics I haven't read.
Wow, I'll have a busy week.
Oh wait, no. Even more.
anyone got some sad fics? I've read My Little Dashie, but it didn't do anything for me
well then no
Doctor Whooves and the Voice of the Elder.
I'm getting a bowler hat.
Stronger than My Little Dashie? I could print out a picture of the Mane 6 crying and shove it in your face for 3 hours if that'll help.
its pretty said
well none that i can mention
I couldn't find a boater hat
does that require knowledge of the actual Dr. Who show?
no
off I go!
Its just sad, what happens
Anyone here know how to do clothes?
CountDoofus: hmm, you could try Sunset
Oh. No. I have 83 -categories- on my disk I haven't gotten around to read.
I sure will have a busy week.
I'll check it out, thanks ;)
Countdoofus here
just saw of dr whooves now i get it
a picture of
Hey everypony
Fazana Ayup me duck
Reading Doctor Whooves made me dislike the actual series.
ohai Fazana
hi Fazana
I'm back after my crazy racing experience
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBg6qC3ZvvQ <-- Moments in Sailor Moon's life. . .
Do tell us more
It didn't turn out so well
I managed to pick up an injury
Apparently x/0 = infinity
I was reading that Doctor Whooves comic until I saw the bowtie around his neck.
WoOoOo
I'll just go back to my book now.
Time what you think of the series kammerjunk
Marshallow: Which of them? I prefer series 2 through 4 of the new show.
I have to agree with dari on Matt Smith.
I like Matt Smith, his script is just terribad
mlp is so popular now it needs some games or a movie
bartsonic: Games are being made.
I dislike matt smith he is kind of coward always running
What's that MMO called again?
hopefully an mmorpg
Marshallow: No, that's just the Doctor. There's a lot of running involved.
Marshallow: He is only equipped with a scroggy that has alientech, and he avoids killing people
I know that but i really dislike when he doesn't save everyone.
Anyone know how to wear a bowler hat?
Rally to me brits!
Well, there's a reason the 9th Doctor said "Just this once, Rose, everybody lives!"
Globetrotter, but it on flatly, with the front facing your direction
/me doesn't own a bowler hat.
The same way you put on a fedora basically
feelsbadman.jpg
On your headGlobetrotter
Fazana you are amazing
KwakLad2 You are my god
/me is wearing his fedora
/me hugs worshippers
/me doesn't own a fedora either.
I just really dislike how the doctor says the Darlek all died in the time war but they keep appearing but no time lords.
http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/MyLittlePony.jsp looks like i need to go to hot tpoic
Darleks Y U KEEP APPEARING?
Darleks can be made, doctors can't
Kammerjunk, we must buy you a hat.
What's a Darlek?
Fazana: sure Doctors can be made, you just need two Gallifreyans that love each other VERY VERY MUCH
Its just really annoy because the show has a ton of loopholes.
River's birth was a mutation, and donna was because she fused herself with doc's DNA in his severed hand
otakon, that makes time lords, not Doctors.
Globetrotter: I used to have a hat.
But then I brokested it.
Marshallow: it's soft science fiction, it's might to be enjoyable not sense
otakon: they are just about exinct
Then we must buy you a new hat!
/me gives Kammerjunk a hat
It's invisible
... i need a hat
and has no mass
I'm coming to the USA in a few months... first stop: Hot Topic! :)
Loopholes are explained by wibbly wobbly timey wimey
I have a ton of british hats, which do you want?
I dislike Amy. I liked Rose more than her. Amy is always whinning and yelling "DOCTOR!"
What do you wear with a bowler Fazana?
I liked Rose, Rose was cool.
EspyLacopa: yh, but The Doctor is a Timelord and I DOUBT he is a singular occurence in ALL of existence is all I'm saying.
Often a monacle, people tend to look good with a bowler, monacle and a pipe if you smoke.
I would like a Gentlemans Tophat!
me too
Fazana I'm afraid to say you missed the word 'stuff'
Fazana, casual bowler hat wearing though.
otakon: Oh, no. There used to be an entire planet of them. But they died. Then stuff happened, which resulted in other stuff because I don't want to spoil it.
i need a top hat monacle suit pipe weed lol
Asides from the "Are you my mummy?" episode, yeah.
I'd say you should get a mad hatters hat (I forget the proper name, they are like tophats, but are much taller) and have a pipe with it, even if you don't smoke it.
Oh, past Tennant.
That's because dari doesn't like Matt Smith.
Don't forget Rassilon, with his silly outfit.
Kammerjunk: The empty child
That's the one.
Mummy....mummy, are you my mummy? *scared me*
Don't Blink.
Mama? Mama Luigi?
I don't watch a lot of the 9th Doctor, to be honest.
http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ovWvxVcKg4k/TlO1g0DxpWI/AAAAAAAABLA/Jiwkm0OmiD0/by%252520janey-jane%25255B4%25255D.jpg
9th doc is good
dat Rose Marshallow
hello
ohai The_4th_Wall
I know
When I got into Doctor Who, Tennant was already there. So I was a little confused when I saw the 9th Doctor.
Rassilon comes from a Doctor Who thing that aired back in '83.
hiya one who is broken constantly by the small pastel colored equine know as Pinkie!

Yes! Someone took my request relating to Dark Souls and Luna! Wahooooo! http://i44.tinypic.com/r1iu5j.jpg
Wait, did I start a Doctor Who discussion because I said that I didn't like Smith?
/me goes to pony confessions and says he hates the 10 doctor.
That's awesome RawketLawnchair
RawketLawnchair: but that character she's dressed as is a GUY

Hehe
Now I only need Celestia in Gwyn's outfit and I can die a happy man.
Gotta love eccle's goofy smile :D
And otakon , Gwyndolin had powered relating to the moon, so I thought it was fitting.
Marshallow: HAHA
I swear, the incarnations of the Doctor keep getting younger and younger.
Marshallow: you DO realize that him being over 900 years old that he can consider ALL of us children right?
otakon: Doctor heavy: ENTIRE EARTH, IS BABIES!
D:
RawketLawnchair: good point, but still a guy, who tries to kill you for going through a door
hmmm if twilight meets her future self will doctor hooves be the one to bring future twilight back in time

Brb, off to go watch it
So, the difference is the 11th doctor has a fez?
Fazana: do eet NOW!
bye valoreins
>Implying Gywndolin didn't increase her bust when making the illusion of her
Wait. 12 days?
Why is ep19 in 12 days?
hi everypony
RawketLawnchair: why would he? SHE'S 30 feet TALL!
no new ep this week?
otakon: Or is she
No new pony episode this coming saturday?
RawketLawnchair: her bust is ALREADY friggin bigger than your damn body
As we've seen, Gwyn and his family were only slightly larger than the player
RawketLawnchair: well I'd like to think she is anyway, maybe she is normal sized if you ever do meet her
n/me suffers a heart attack
Espylcopa the difference is that the 11th isn't depress
Wait, no pony episode on Saturday?
/me suffers a heart attack
YAY!
I'm going to an ACTA protest on Saturday.
/me brings out the defibilators "Here we go"
RawketLawnchair: did you SEE The Lord of Cinder? He's like and easy 10 feet tall and Gywndolin is another easy ten feet tall. Who's to say the daughter isn't just really BIG it wouldn't be that surprising in that family
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=U3qS0odekuU
unfortunatly ACTA will pass or they will keep makng laws that will destroy the internet
otakon: You have a crush on Gwynevre, don't you?
Ha ha!
RawketLawnchair: yes I did
Anywho, is picknick time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOYnWIz5Lo&feature=g-crec-u&context=G2047e94RCGXQYbcTJ33ZqJi21cqoWBMveVtPT1jNvHCsS32mos7I
/me is going to wear his Celly/Twi plush fleece throw all day on Saturday in protest of no new ep
Wat can I say? I like tall women.
Why no ep this week???
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzr2E1Q2WWA&feature=related
CCCP: for the lulz
no new episode this week world blows up
dat sudden pootis
^
Hiatus this week.
Don't know why.
If a hipster is the last person on earth, insint everything he does mainstream?
HUB better show only ponies all day to make up
CCCP: good question
The_4th_Wall: YES
Dat philosoraptor
^\
bbl bronies gotta take a shower and toss a football with my friend
The_4th_Wall: they won't and it's a the NEW timeslot when it airs
!cd
Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 12 days, 1 hours, 21 minutes, 8 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
yh
new timeslot
/me puts on waiting hat "Oh boy"
as in 1pm
later?
this season should never end
as in 1pm EST
which means if my net goes out again
I'm screwed
IT's justgunna be a rehash of Dragonshy. Mark my words.
Ha ha!
wait... 3pm Mst?
RawketLawnchair: YOU ARE WRONG!!!!!
I wonder if Fluttershy will sing the F.U.N. song?
Well at least i'll make the live ep on here
:)
Next ep needs more derpy
^
The new Flooter episode will either be: Dragonshy rehash, the episode of Sponge Bob on the beach where he's a jerk while being assertive, like the Scrubs episode where Iron Will was dead the whole time, or Iron Will will bel ike Kamina.
In order of likelyhood.
Aggressively nice Fluttershy? no wait, that's Pinkie
The past 2 times i've stayed up for the live pony stream, I fell asleep before the new ep aired
Simpsons did it every thing has already been done before. Nothing is original
3PM local time is a welcome change
RawketLawnchair: I HAVE PROOF that's she's actually that big!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL9705D23B7A55A495&v=PnTPsNAutKY
Sooooooo bored
go play a game
of disappearing bears
can't in college library :V
crap
/me makes plans to watch new ep at home where he doesn't have HUB
Snakkkeeeeees: scream out IM A BRONY!
yay VGA cables
otakon: Gwynevre left Anor Londo a long time ago, and there's no real depiction of how she lookedl ike, and Gwyndolin probably took liberties when making the illusion ofh er.
RawketLawnchair: Priscilla her daughter
We know she is your waifu, so give it a rest already.
no she's not
pony vid on 42" tv, chat on laptop
Ha ha!
I'll pass. I havn't even seen signs of other bronies around so if there's any hidden they're like me and don't want everyone to know
I want EVERYONE to know
Snakkkeeeeees: Hide your powerlevel at all costs.
Snakkkeeeeees: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL9705D23B7A55A495&v=qqo53-pNxsE
lol well my friends know but that's about it
hai everpony
I AM NOT ASHAMED
lol well I'm shy so don't judge... you know... if you don't want to.
RawketLawnchair: it makes sense though, Priscilla is a halfbreed dragon with NO scales that towers over the PC, Seath has GOT to be her father and Gywnevre would have to be the mother, considering the Painted World is in HER cathedral and all. It makes perfect sensce. Which also means she either had relations with Seath, or was raped....yikes.
I've taken my Celly/Twi blanket into public on my way to school before
that's on public transit
Im shy but i told everpony at my school im a brony and it makes every thing so great
HIDE NOTHING
lol well /forever alone
Hide everything.
http://i43.tinypic.com/9uyxl1.jpg Hide everything.
GET A MLP SHIRT
ohai #bronystate
Nothing is safe. Got to follow the rules.
yeah I plan on getting a shirt soon enough and I do plan on wearing it but I doubt anyone here would even get it
RawketLawnchair: i used to be like that
i'm not like that
Bronies should have nothing to fear. we watch the "girliest" show there is and think it's the best thing ever.
I'm going to put of flyers around campus of the mane 6
enver have been
also guys
I'm off to Salisbury for a couple of hours
so I'll see y'alll later
have fun!
see ya
bye otakon
:)
Snakkkeeeeees: You fool.
oh gawd I'm gonna sneeze :o
Snakkkeeeeees: I implore you to reconsider.
nope false alarm :\
lol reconsider what?
The posters.
/me hugz and nomz everypony
oh why?
IshNotMorningPony: damn i only just got here too -_-

Hilarious idea for a thanksgiving dinner: serve it as though you mummified the turkey: Cover the turkey with edible mummy wrappings, and serve the stuffing and cranberry sauce in canopic jars
Lol.
That's a quality idea.
As long as the Turkey isn't 3000 years old
that would be awesome
It even comes with a Mummy's Curse: You are doomed to fall into a delicious turkey-fueled coma.
Are you going to invite indian stallone?
:P
So I take it not everyone here is ame4rican, given that you're not at work
6_9
Indian Stallone is invited everywhere
English
British
Belgian
And so he should be Jim
Brit brohoof!
Maybe the fake mummy wrappings could be the biscuits, specially shaped to mimic the wrapping..
where abouts?
Please. I am Belgian.
wanna share a waffle?
Ha ha, I would, but I am not actually Belgian.
I am an Amerifat.
Brithoof Lucid

RawketLawnchair: You are a Brony!
Any other p[onies from Leeds area?
Lol, I had an all nighter last night; I loved it! Almost fell asleep in a serious Mock Exam, but still. :3
Belgian. . .I was taught by my faithful hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy how dirty a word that is. You should be ashamed of yourself for saying it here.
I am. . .not, KwakLad
I got the Saint's Row reference, btw :p
Lucid I am from 20 milenorth of manchester
CountDoofus: Ha ha, someone got it.
where is that?
my geography is awful
I'm from Wootton Bassett- ring a bell?
A faint bell
I live in a pineapple under the sea
Yeah, the town of repatriations. :P
EspyLacopa: I just looked on wikipedia on what you were talking about. I lmao'd :D
Heh

hi Kipkat07
hi alex
Wrek: \team fortress 2\tf\materials\vgui\logos
this song is surprisingly relaxing, even though I don't understand a word of it
seem's very solmen to go with this game
hola
heya RAWRity
hey RAWRity
What's going on in here then everypony?
what u been up to today
TF2
im gonna play TF2 anypony wanna join?
05join us instead
how
I want to watch a film, but can't decide what to watch.
19:25:33] <@Wrek> type connect 46.236.85.221 in console
eating dinner now, and got a response from my betareader regarding my fanfic, got a lot of improvements to make :p
What console
05this is a nice song imo
whats your fanfic about CountDoofus
Guardians of Ga'Hoole
is that the owl film that came out a couple of years ago
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/internet-memes-whoops.gif
bai gonna join the game
yeah, but it's based on the book series, and my fic is mostly based on those
RAWRity: lol :D
oh i didn't know they were based on a book
first 3 out of 15, to be exact
well scar's won then RAWRity
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-slowcord.jpg
any word on a 3rd season
in production
good
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_episodes
There has been a 3rd season confirmed but anything else about it is just speculation.
ok cool
somehow I really hope the CMC will get their cutie marks, either in the S2 finale or the S3 opener
when is the newsletter sent out anyway
i hope discord comes back
seems unlikely, but who knows
doubt it'll happen in the S2 finale. All signs are pointing towards the Finale focusing on Princess Cadence and Shining Armor
aka two characters we've never seen before
(right?)
eeyup. But Hasbro needed new toys to sell
Tea takes too long to make.
if discord did come back i thought it would be intresting to have the mane 6 need his help to deal with a villian based around order but have him still be the magnifcant bastad we know him as
Where is the console that i can put the code in Wrek?
I just got around to listening to that Dr. Whooves Radio drama. Pretty neat. Some of the Voice acting needs work, but well done for a first outing.
go to the bronystate steam group and find Wrek's username and click join server
oo ok
what did u guys think of my idea
Awesome LC
Derpy gets all my awwwwww
05sounds neat alexxm, but old disco would probably hold one hell ofa grudge
yea i guessed i thought it would be he turns on them as soon as the order based villian is defeated
bye gon play tf2
cya Kipkat07
gonna join that server too
cya CountDoofus
but I'll still be here :)
me toooooo
sorry thought u were going to play the game
WHY ISNT MY GAME LOADING UP???:[

how come u can't play tf2 if your moms home

ok
meeep

just out of intrest what did u do to get grounded
HAHA Metal abba... never heard of that before.
bye
cya Kipkat07
Hey everypony, back after a kip. :)
hey Fazana
what u been up to
ohai Fazana
Sleeping
Kip = nap
i know i meant in general
I had a really really late night before
Nothing much
Litterally just woke up
went back to college after a week off today
Same.
I has a really late night because I was watching Montoya swear at people in NASCAR
what did u guys think of saturdays episode
I dunno
Quite different to the usual approach
They were obviously having Pinkies alien physics in mind.
the bit with the felt i guess
Brb, my microwave senses are tingling
hey everypony :)
ohai ScootaChicken
Hello, ScootaChicken
oh look, TF2
Jim dedded.:c
hey ScootaChicken what u been up to
Right, luncheon is at the ready, so I bid farewell for about 10 minutes.
being ill mostly
whats wrong
hope you get better
temperature, headaches, leg aches, stomach aches, vomiting
the fun stuff
0,5Guys what is today again?
monday
monday
05mumday
oh, President's day
anyway. off to have some food
0,5Ah
0,5Thanks WAWRity
00,10Is this wreks server again?
05ye
Lola Bunny taught me everything I need to know about Presidents Day
besides i live in england
there is vacation in the netherlands, that is what i know, becuase of carnival.
what is it Boltasar
I dont really know myself, only had 4 years of carnival celebration, and I could care less, it is mostly about costumes I guess. Umm, lets see... I really dont know
how did you manage that jump
Back
I do live in the Netherlands, but never in the part wherre carnival was really celebrated
ok thanks for the info
Soldier rampage
u know i have the werdiest schedule for tormorow
Exist?
go into college for 9
4 hour gap between lessons
Confound you and your strange items! I havent had a single one in my 4 years of playing
then last lesson of the day
Server shut down
So it wasn't just me.
Ah, no.
and coming up again
Just connect again.
This song is ace.
queen is best band
^
what are we watching?
TF2
An image of TF2 upon one's computerscreen
I once used to be good at it
But did an arrow end that?
serriously i have a 4 hour gap between lessons tormorow
I kinda got bored
'3'
all the good custom maps got forgotton when the easy pick were made
Balloon battle is epic
demoman is best samurai pirate
One of the best customs
I got an auto healing spy
how did u manage that Hellsliver
I use an combo of kunai and feign of death to walk over and over
u know i personally thought who wants to live forever would have been a better queen song for highlander
kunai lower the hp, but allow to heal 50% of max hp
ok thanks
per backstab
cool
Kunai is really hard to use, but it's brilliant when mastared
the feign of death are to trick my opponents into think they got me
i usaully play as heavy's
then I make them squel like a pig
I tend to like playing is SHNIPARGH
anyone thought who wants to live forever would have suited highlander better as it's theme music
every team need at least one pyro with regular flamethrower... aka the one with airblast
I feel like playing L4D
nice going as demo
If he likes doing this, he should use the highlander or the horsemanns axe.
yeah
I never got the axe
I got it the 2nd day
The first day, I didn't have a skullcutter
through trade or by beating the npc with melee?
then I got one random the next, so I yayed.
05why? i love the zitochi
overtime is best time
I remember when overtime actually were a one life with melee only
Wrek: More max HP when you are rampaging, and you move faster too
Hellsilver: Still is, it's sudden death
I miss sudden death
it were the best with soldier and the shovel
hand grenade taunt makes it priceless
05sincei manage such a high K/D
well that was quick
05i survive logner by using the samurai sword
forget survival when you can make chaos?
(Matt Smith)
so how come they're not using guns in this game
its medival map
05its medieval mode
it deny modern tech
05only blades n arrows
ok
Dat server lagg
If you were Pinkie or the doctor, you could use guns
teeeeeeeeam fortress :D
Wonder if I should help wrek...
He doesn't look like one requires aid.
ok
if anybody else plays team fortress add me on steam :D
cuciii69
<---
I would, but I have 2 bronies addies, makes people start to suspise
afraid to jump out as one?
Yep.
you need to come out
you'll feel better D:
I'm a closet Brony
I kinda plan to keep it that way.
so yea if you play TF or DC universe add me on steam
that seems to be an interesting server
I WANT RAINBOW DASH IN MY BED WITH ME

I just realised something.
My drop rate has been crap
05too bad killing me proves such a challenge
Wrek
Wrek: K.

I'm scared of going against Wrek.
05ok should be joinable
Wrek that's pretty fun actually, not too bad :3
Thanks to Pinkie Pie's "Welcome Wagon" song, we now have the perfect video to play whenever a new Brony shows up here.

hi everypony!
Scootachicken: You don't like fanfiction?
ohai Kipkat07
Even the non shipping cool kind?
@jack That what is the worst in your opoinun
I wonder why there are no smileys of the royal sisters
*shrugs
Morty: nah, I'm ok with fanfiction, I just don't read a lot of it
I'm not big on fanfiction. Especially super sentai yaoi fanfic...GRRR.
i couldnt figure out how to get the console in TF2 so i said buck it and gave up
anyone else notice a pony with a cutie mark thats a spoon
i guess cus the sisters have weird horse faces
but I've read fanfictions that have... scarred me.
I know dat feel.
go to advanced in options and it says enable developers console
indeed scootachicken
Me and my friend literally screamed in fear when we saw this nasty ship-fic between our 2 favorite characters in Gokaiger.
in my fanfic, Pinkie rages against fanfiction writers, and in an epic move she cries "This one's for my innocence!"
screamed?
It was....horrid.
literally?
although I do remember sending a terrifying Tom Delonge x Mark Hoppus slash fic to my friend who's annoyingly into blink-182
that was amusing
in my fanfic, Celestia is swarmed in her sleep by a mass of black tendrils.
seems legit.
13that's... lovely....
And also, the characters were completely off. I know it's fanfiction, but PLEASE, keep the characters to their personality, not some weak sex crazed freak.
Sounds...fun..
lol lil miss rarityt
...Goddammit RAWRity.
ive seen enough hentai to know where thats going
rarity*
LadyCanary: what?
You know what.
Shizuka I have a feeling that there might be some fanfics for the nightmares
Rawrity: In a way I feel that is justice
I did nothing to earn being goddammited
Ohrly.
in my fanfic, 5 of the Mane 6 have passed on, and the last one is soon to join them

RainbowJack: Exactly...
thanks Wrek

/me hugs LordCelestia

I NEED FEEDING.
/me still wants Genndy Tartakovsky for Season 4 since Rob Renzetti will be leaving.
what are we talking about?
/me wishes emangamer was on right now
FEEEEED MEEEEE
Tovler: that would be GREAT!
Genndy? The guy from Dexter?
I'm not even sure otakon o3o
if we just could ask lauran Faust to come here as a interview that would make me so happy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_63184&src_vid=7iaXqItRMOQ&v=sGEz31VThMM Smile and forget that
lets troll the troll
are we going to have a stream anytime soon?
So how about us arranging a meeting with God to discuss this portal to Equestria
Tovler: was not aware of that either, where do you get your information?
~(.o.)~ meet my tentacle monster - I named him Jim
I've got my engi's working on it Azure
hi jim
OTAKON! HAVE YOU BEEN BEATING SCOOTALOO?????
/me feeds [wub]Nidalee
um no
AGAIN?
why?
if a niterview with Lauren were posibul on here that would be so great
LIES
I never did
OI ENGIS
you did what to the chicken
It was all apart of the Season 3 drama that Amy Keating Roger leaked.
TIS A LIE!
HOW'S THE PONI PORTAL
otakon: You know of the upcoming fighting game Skullgirls, right?
Tovler: that s3 is in production?
yea
im still hungry...
LadyCanary: yh, the one that seems to be all eyecandy
It caused a Season-3-is-the-end panic
IDJDKSOSJSODIEMDDFJCJDIEIEJE
how
LadyCanary: what about it?
Well, we could end up like Megas XLR
Tigerwong is working on SkullGirls.
otakon: You never know. But the 8th character in the roster was released and by Celestia, she is UNHOLY.
Tovler: what about s3 specifically?
anyone else wanna troll the troll
LadyCanary: orlly? The titular Skullgirl I'm guessing
And there was a hint saying that another character might be released as a DLC >W<
Now Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight!
i cant follow what is eveypony talking about
bartsonic iiiii dooooo
LadyCanary: characters have been planned as dlc for awhile
im so bored.
me neither colt of personality
eww fighting games
I know Ingwaz|Laptop, but I wasnt too sure. I wanna see Squigly as one :3
i hate not knowing what is being discussed
SkullGirls vs Galaxy Girls, hmm… Lauren should contact them.
the only fighting game I'm good at it SSBB ._.
*is
Faust should poni poni
That's okay ScootaChicken ^-^
SSBB FTW
Mortal Kombat...
yay im in the conversation
SSBB kinda killed the Smash Frainchise for me
Not of itself but because the fans kept BITCHING
All I know is the fear of S3's fate was reported on EQD in November
Fighting is Magic when it comes will be awesome
I too am not so good at fighting games, but I have a strong respect for them, especially the artwork and gameplay. Though my favorite is Arcana Heart.
i just like it cus its not as serious as other games probably is the same reason i love viva pinata
Probably the only fighting game I would play
Inb4 somepony breaks AJ
why violence in Equestria ;(
Jim: agreee i cant w8 till it gets released
Why not?
I've never really played any fighting games
could never get into them
Tovler: i shall simply have to have faith then, i can see little reason for them to end it
Sad as it is you cannot make a country based on peace and nutrality
Unless you are Poland
yup
iv only realy played soul calibur but i gave up on it
omg guys what if when we die we turn into ponies in equestria
possible
far off but not impossible
I'm the one who MADE that theory thank you very much
Poland and peace and neutrality in one sentence?
if thats ur heaven i guess
bartsonic: if it was confirmed, give me a gun
I do think that people get the type of afterlife they really want when they die
lol
why hello everypony
ohai StickySyrup
hello
Hi StickySyrup!
suddenly StickySyrup
They have a town called Brony, of course it's going to be peaceful
OHAI, ScootaChicken!
yea
How are we all?
wait... is asdfasdfasdg dari?
Maybe there will be a pony community in the afterlife.
hae there Pegasister16 ^_^
yes
...wait a minute
hopefully
Poni is on channel 300000000000000009
I guess he is ScootaChicken, he's making the EQD updates frequently
Pegasister16: has emangamer been telling you bad things about me?
ScootaChicken: did u record the stream on saturday?
after Earth
if we find an alternate dimension wont that destroy the universe?
Soo... What are we talking about?
StickySyrup: which stream?
The afterlife
the episode
And ponies in the afterlife
going to euestria when we die
And ponies in general
you said u were recording?
/me starts an unincorporated Brony town in Montana.
no...?
u become a background pony lol
oh
… or not
nm
I'm ok with that
the universe is resilient , it doesnt care about what we think the laws of physics are supposed to be
TrixieMuffin: it should be trixiepinecone
stream... y u no online
I wonder if we will ever find a planet with ponies as dominant species and smart like us and tlak like us
i would kinda live there if there was a town just for Bronies
WE ARE BRONIES RESITESN IS FUTIALE
heck, I'd be happy to be a background donkey if it meant I could be in Equestria
Bumblebees are only able to fly because they don't know they can't
>Your Brain when
i know i can't fly
maybe pinkie will teach us of here physics destroying powers
That planet they found a long time ago its able to sustain life they no see whats on the planet itself
RainbowJack: we are the herd, resistance is futile, assimilation is necessary
/me giggles
I haven't seen dari online a lot lately
HAHA
ASSIMILATE
he must be busy
Well, through wonders of bioengineering we could possibly one day make sentient ponies! /)^3^(\
Perhaps he's busy
Saggyapples in time
Genetic Engineering can only do so much
Assimulation yes all the Haters
probably A levels and whatnot
We are the Bronie , welcome to the herd , resistance is Futashy
omg the bad thing would be the cloppers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M6UYwaYRqw /me imagines Trixies Singing this song
I got a feeling Dari is asdfasdfasdg, since he links every new ED link like Dari does
/me is a clopper :|
oo, that's my favorite tumblr
ED post*
lol
:'( nopony joined me in the team rocket motto
lmao
PREPARE FOR TROUBLE
Meowth, dat's right.

MAKE THE FUN DOUBLE
StinkomanFan: skips right to the end...

"Well, this is the end, beautiful friends. After more than 11 years, this is Toonami's final broadcast. It's been a lot of fun, and we'd like to thank each and every one of you who made this journey with us. Toonami wouldn't have been anything without you. Hopefully we've left you with﻿ some good memories. So, until we meet again, stay gold. Bang...."

Is it wrong to not like Transformers, but like Beast Wars?
13beast wars was done by the same team as reboot
MASF123: not at all
:D
i was confused i thought we were still on reboot lol
Booooooooooooooom
I mean, :)
hey everypony, what is that ???
just smack him already
13they built up so much history and fleshed out the universe, that's why it's so much better than the rest of the transformers series
Dinobot = starscream
i like tf prime and g1
im gona go off chat for now bye everypony :)
Dashie_Dashie: no, that's Waspinator
Dinobot is equal to boss
I wonder if Dinobot actually stopped to wonder at any point what use that spinning tail-arm-thing actually was at any point.
why voice commands for themselve, i never got that
Rattrap and Inferno. That's the only 2 names in Bears Wars I can remember
is this one of the first eps?
Remember when the Powerpuff Girls watched a parody of this?
beastwars needs more grimlock so does prime
Dark_Horst: it's the second ep
13dinobot is more a melee fighter
bartsonic: I agree
13the spinny thing would be a good shield against melee weapons
oh god...
I! Still! FUnction!!!
this is sooo wrong
13except for the part where they fight with mostly energy weapons
well i have to go cya later my fellow bronies!
he has a JETPACK!
The reactions to derpy talking in "The Lat Roundup" in this very chat! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geTCP666Yf4
he is based on an ape
hmmm what if after fall of cybertron they make a game based after this series
13yeah optimus had the idiot ball there for a bit
Is there a higher rank of a brony?
DerpyDash: taht was Pinkie Pie room
13dinobot is best honorable fighter
no not really
Oh
Shizuka: agreed
lol
The pinkie pie room
http://mylittleponycollecting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/MLPs_as_humans.jpg would somepony watch this?
Dinobot is what TV tropes would call a "Noble Demon"

DerpyDash: that video is how i found this comunity and became the newfoal i am
We should watch Ruroni Kenshin
Pale_Horse: eeyup, like Rubicante

no destroying of physics to girly not random at all
it was probably one of the easiest things to transform you just needed to move it's head and that was it
eeyup
Bronycon?

I has a secret for you Otakon
13bartsonic: be respectful
Pale_Horse: basically think of it like shielding
PhrozenFire: fine wat?
yeah I'm bored too
Shizuka PLZ say you have a Samurai Pizza cat epi
I'm not

Then why not build the proper shielding into their alt modes as well?

thats in beast machines alexxm
One shall rise, and one shall fall...
Meanwhile at the CRYME SINDICATE secret lair...
oh i started watching later then you guy's then
Ugh, the CG, it's worst than I remember
and they all died anyway
the CG looks pretty bad
energon chain reaction... RUN!!
Midnight_Fyre: well compared to today'
s stuff ofc
incoming resonance cascade!
ARE YOU FEELING ENERGIZED!?
13this was also basically the pilot
Even then. Remember, this came out after Toy Story
13yep
13not long though, 1996 iirc
Midnight_Fyre: remember, this WASN'T a movie studio
Shows what a difference in budget can do.
lol
welp, there goes the robot crack
13reboot was 1994, first CG show ever
Derp it like a man. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3O7V_yVcA&feature=related
it was made in canada... this was some pretty awesome CG

Admittedly it is a lot better than the graphics in the originally Legacy of Kain... and I loved the Hell out of Legacy of Kain.
night RainbowJack
omg WISHBONE
Legacy of Kain was great...except the ending
WISHBONE?!?!
YES
Yay, Wishbone!
and... i cant watch this... never liked it much
I wonder if this will be the Faustus episode
ummm
WISHBONE!!!! :)
/me 13notes for future, beast wars is louder than reboot und wishbone
rlly?
is this the dog from frasier
no
it's not
Did anyone do a Read it and Weep/Wishbone crossover?
actually Wishbone isn't me thing too much either
I remember the episode when Whishbone did Goethe's "Faust".
why are we watching a dog who was under drugs while they were making these?
Pale_Horse: eeyup
i rember this from when i was a kid
PEDOOOO ALERT!!!

13we did start with ep 1 of all of these
13you just weren't here for it
you just weren't there is all
oh ok
I see a Skype friend calling!
dat skype call
Legacy of Kain's ending was terrible
dat ashtray
13but reboot is pretty self-contained, and both of these were two-part openers so there's some time to catch up
Ends in a cliffhanger
Shizuka: you have a friend!

Someone should really do some sort of Read it and Weep/Wishbone crossover. Wishbone is actually closer to the structure of the episode than Reading Rainbow, which got one (for obvious reasons)
my god
This show so.. much.. nostalgia.
Shizuka: your friend wants to talk to you dear
13not in boo radley's house!
I think Astray wants to talk...

May 3rd is offically pinkie pies birthday.
xD
i vaugly rember this show just not any episodes
Dashie_Dashie: you'd think April 1st would be
It can't be...The new episode came out on Feb 18th
Just because the episode airs on a given day doesn't mean that's when it takes place
okay, so brb gonnna play some ME3 MP
may 3rd best day ever
see ya otakon'
May 3; CONSTRUCT PARTY CANNON
hi
13now that's a knoife
April 1st, the day of the fools would make more sense
i agree with Midnight_Fyre i mean what about episodes that happen on more than one day
Shizuka look at this please
http://ponykart.net/
13please don't link non-images during streams
13it's rude
So, whats going on now? O.o I keep leaving the chat and coming back x_x
Shizuka but it is a GAME :D
Ponykart!
we're watchin Wishbone
we're watching wishbone
:O
How long do you think MLP:FiM will last?
pedo alert...
8 seasons
FOREVER
Wow, i havent seen wishbone in Foreverrrrrrrr!
13he triggered a trap card
a long time hopefully
My Little Dash confirmed it
8 seasons?
I think 5 seasons at least....
A long time if it keeps up quality. If quality starts to drop I hope they end it before it becomes an embarrassment like the Simpsons
^^^
I would laugh my ass off if it winds up beating The Simpsons. :)
The longer the show drags on, the more material is going to be used up
Nah. not forever. Eventually the series will delve into the far future for stories, with a new cast, and be known as "My Little Pony: The Next Generation".
13was it? never did actually read tom sawyer for myself
Shizuka: WE NEED SWATCATS
Well, there always has to be a moral, right?
13mid 90s political correctness and all
Yeah, i guess
If Pinkie Pie ever dies in the last episode, that would make me cry
o_op
*o_o
Nah, that wouldn't happen
MASF123: that would kill me too
is that the same rope swing as in bridge to teribithia?
Nopony would Die are you kidding me? :D
Dat rope swing: Seems legit
It's possible
^^indeed
would that actully be allowed to happen
no^
If it is a movie special
If she dies, it would be a veritable world of grey
hey! wuts up with the stream?!?!

owwwwwwww
13something wrong?
Ahh! We hit a wrinkle in Time!
this is wrong...
welllll
what is this?
Quick to the hourglass!
it works.....
this is sooo wrong...
THIS IS SOOO WRONG...
wut is this?!
But yeah, there are some things they can do to keep material up in the show
what is this?
I thought it was something along those lines. I tead Tom Sawyer sever times as a kid
MLP:FiM The death of the Pink one
wishbone
But if they make them get older that wud be awful o_o
wut wut wut?!?!?!?
Season 3 = the plot of DS9

Would be the most controversial thing ever
13oookay
Erk..... Hello everyone again... I have brought pies.

Then again, considering how often Mark Twain used the N word in his books . . .

http://macromeme.com/dog/heads-up-7up.html
someone knows if the new free to play game on steam is worth the time? (realm of the mad god is the name)
yes it is
and it isn't on steam
RaveBrony Yeah I draw. I started because I have quite a bit of free time and it kills time. Still practicing like mad.
Realm of the Mad God
it is since yesterday
is free to play :)
and i really like it
i wanna draw but im not that good
been playing it for a month now
flutter_spin, take a pic of the ones you have :)
well, i'm gonna give it a try then
Pinkie Pie is perfect. Rainbow Dash is awesome too. Fluttershy & Rarity's hair are... a little off
this music is far to epic for this game
Naw. I don't feel like taking a picture of them.
http://macromeme.com/cat/i-must-go-my-people-need-me.jpg
ekips you will need a lot of skill
though
and nice DashWithRainbows!! Can i see one or more of your drawings? Im practicing too, and try to gather all pony drawing help i can :D :)
skill comes with practice
I really wanted Twilight Sparkle, but Pinkie & RD make me happy
epic pong

I don't get that last one in the pic, but its the only pic I could find of Fluttershy card

the spazz during derpy episode was way too underreacting
Shizuka...i'm not watching the stream i'm only here for the chat currently... -_-

Whether you're watching it or not is irrelevant.
^
Paradise92: so?
some people are indeed watching the stream :p
I wonder how the McDonalds MLP will hold up. How much longer is it, 3 weeks?
Shizuka which song is this and where can my computer be graced with its presence
Ugh, my computer is refusing to listen to me, so I'm going to give it a time out
In other words: Good night, I'm going to bed!

10,02Hai :3
All that was asked is "are there only 13 eps" and the guy said "nope, we're still working on it". So, that pretty much says nothing. >.>
I did play the ME3 demo. Didn't care for the multiplayer. I am eager to see more of the single player
More like, I blame sxypurtndr.

hi Cipher
10,02Midnight_Fyre: You're not supposed to, it was a quick sketch that I did, but wasn't originally going to share

Cipher You will always be the jet pilot who plays the saxophone in a very sexual manner to me :3
Given Granny Smith's history, I imagine AJ's parents are out on expediition searching for seeds like she (Granny Smith) did
It must have something to do with Sparta

Spoiler alerts are irrelevant, posting spoilers will get you banned.
mods seem to be elsewhere right now, you might be ok
mods are always watching
mods are elsewhere post ponies?
mfw episode 21 of season two is named "Dragon quest" also mfw the square enix game.
If she sees herself and actually benefits in someway, AWESOME. If she gets a note and it becomes a misunderstanding from her friends, booo
Mods being elsewhere isn't an excuse to overlook the rules.
Mods are always watching...
but theyre are always mods
owww shit it is on 3rd march indeeed...............

Dashie_Dashie: check the synopsis on eqd

Pale_Horse: ...that might actualy happen and it will be epic
If we're lucky Dr Whooves will crash through the library wall in a delorean.

This game = The battle for the internet
And Tallest Purple says lasers aren't cool...
The battle for the internet would have more ponies.

It would have more ponies, bunchies and memes
For great justice... Take off every Zig.

Cypresswolf: that's technically a non image link, be more careful.
#dude why did you do that

Even after you killed me twice?
0,14oh hai Scoot-Scootaloo

United States too.

Meanwhile: not sure what you meen
Really
... The ship is drafty and damp... I complain, but... nobody listens...
Phase4: that's technically a non image link, and those aren't allowed.
scootaloo episode confirmed :3
Meanwhile: ah, ok
do you intend to have certain background ponies receive episodes like Big Mac and Cheerilee did??( Vinyl Scratch, Octavia, Berry, Et Cetera) ...
Meanwhile: so if i was to screenshot that it would be fine :P
brb
about berry punch drunk scene
08,01apparently, fluttershy is best background pony
Phase4: Hm. You know, Idk about that.
it was truwe
00,03Now I can die happy...
confirmed by animator
At first I wanted mane6 episodes of them hanging out. Then I wanted 1 of the mane6 themed episodes. Now I don't care.
xD
00,03Actually, not until I actually see the episode...
08,01unfoundbug: the what?
realy?
Pow! Haha!
Scoot-Scootaloo: die happy in the knowledge that we'll watch it extra hard for you.
the thing about berry punch being drunk in a scene and it being removed
08,01unfoundbug: oh, i never heard of that
neither had i till someone said on here recently
I just find it awkward when you don't see Rarity or Twilight in an episode. I want them to have some screen time
Scoot-Scootaloo You have your priorities straight...I am proud to call you <Insert name here>
Are the rooms broken or something? they keep saying missing plug in
aaaaw, i wanted to see is asplode
but just found confirmation from one of the animators
Can you give us some descriptions of other scenes that were cut before they were aired (something we don't know about)? ...
apparently it was intended as "dizzy"
"Oh Rarity created this wig" ... *looks for Rarity* :(
Phase4: it isn't.
What does it mean by missing plug in?
It means there is a plug in, and it's missing. Shrugpony.
Also I am sad now...my cat died....
Ohhh no! Poor kitty. :(
hear*
No idea it just says im missing one
Clint Eastwood - Gorillaz reference would have been awesome :)
Where the pitchures of the rooms should be
COOOOOOOL
:O there was a scene cut from the trixie episode with a clint eastwood reference
is the stream working for you?
More to the answer - "and in one part applebloom would actually keep awkwardly asking bon bon about the apples until she fell in a bush, it was cut due to redundancy."
and at the bottom of the pages are the room names I can select
the stream works fine
LOLOL
Okay everypony...
Who wants to help me name my OC?
Chumpy Muttonchops.
Hey Syndicate
i misheard that class...
Hey KwakLad.
The Hull has been breached and the Science is leaking out!!!
Wanna help?
Your OC? ... what is an OC?
Sure
Own Character.
Original Character.
^
Original Character
Im surprised my cat made it to 18,he had barley any fat on him, I could feel every bone on his body
?
Pale_Horse mfw i got that reference
Basically, My pony.
There was a rumor that S2 has 28 episodes. Is this true>Also, was Luna Eclipsed the only time Luna appears?...
18? wow, thats impresive
oh your pony. Ohhhhh
Origional character, do not steal
Dark_Horst: LOL. i love that game.
Donut steel.
So...
This is OC.
Name Ideas?
http://i1213.photobucket.com/albums/cc464/ApkRyan/Ponies/Mypony2.jpg
This is sparta
I also like the line "In space, no one can hear you scream, unless you're braodcasting on the right frequencies."
Ignore my wingboner
http://mlfw.info/f/1793/
Frost Strike
Frosty Whitecoat.
first thing that came to mind
/me 08,01stares directly at Syndicate's wingboner
FUUUUUUUUU
08,01swag.
xD
I'm liking Frosty, in any case. It's Frosty looking.
soo many people on ponychan...lagging like crazy just trying to scroll down the page
You know who can hear you scream in space? The thing that kills you
lol, mods are quiet until ponies are posted
Mods are asleep, post ponies
So Frosty?
it wakes them up
I'm changing my A movie selection to Alien for all future lotto entries until it wins.
08,01huh
Frosty Cream? uh Frosty Fly? uh
08,01for some reason, my kindle session disconnected
Frosty Wingboner?
So frosty? Some other ponies recomended "Sky".
sorry
Royal Frosty
Hey everypony :)
Allo TOY_PON3
Hmm...
Heya TOY_PON3
hey TOY_PON3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
unfoundbug: You never added me on Steam :| Add me
TOY_PON3: Oh you there, how do?
i can't see any requests
Meanwhile...I like it.
why do space missiles have fins???
MEANWHILE IS THE WINNER!!!!!
Because fins look cool.
unfoundbug: Hold on

A winner is me.

Thanks everypony!
Dark_Horst increases the swag level
I'll be back later!
Tata Syndicate.
Syndicate: Frosty Sky is a bit breezy with the wing boner?
its like running faster with a knife, everyone knows you run faster with a knife
later Syndicate
please note: my previous statement is a reference, running with a knife is a terrible idea
xD
/me has been reading the ponychat thread
Thank you KwakLad
unfoundbug: What's your Steam name?
Syndicate: No prob sorry i couldnt help :p bye
I never got the "wing boner" reference. I wish I could look past it, but the chat usually spots it dead on
same as my chat name
what exactly happened on ponychan? i'm a bit confused
Okay
Dark_Horst a confirmed animator from the show appeared
I guess the same could go with the "secret butt fun". Yeah ok, but why?
Running with a knife is especially reccomended if you have the tier 3 Commando perk.
interesting
CMC actually getting their cutie marks, that'd be a pretty big step away from the norm of young kids in cartoons.
Who never achieve anything meaningful ever.
Phase4: What's your Steam name?
TOY_PON3: ariscop
Be weird if Sweetie Belle got a mic cutie mark
Eyeballs, y u suddenly on firre?
if anyone sees Princess_Luna, the one whos obsessed with mane brushing
link her this please
Will do
Brushie brushie.
Are you guys planning to END the series after season 3, or there are chances of a season 4? (and 5, and 6, and 95!) ...
Btw, that's awesome
Cypresswolf it will have to end sometime
unfoundbug: Nice
^MEanwhile
For some reason I felt Luna was more of a passive character. She is strong upfront because of her position, but really just wants to have fun like Fluttershy
then we will stalk lauren faust
Derpy stays! I am happy now.
FIREFOX! Y U NO MULTITHREADED
08,01i want sweetie belle's cutie mark to be this: http://du.cx/277
Even though Faust already left the team?
more luna eps pleeease
Phase4: IKR?
^
i read all the fanfics already
Meanwhile: Come on now. You don't need a reason to stalk Faust.
unfoundbug: all of them. every single one
all that i could find
Kammerjunk: I'm too busy stalking someone else.
You haven't even scratched the surface, man.
some of them were.... uncomfortable
I bought a headset everypony ^^
a .gif cutie mark! that would be amazing
TOY_PON3: :)
:3
/me wishes he was alone more often so he could voicechat
unfoundbug: Try searching through every page on EQD. Then read every. Last. One.
But I think people feel Luna is really bold all the way. I can't quite nail it. Seen her in what, 3 episodes?
It's rare Phase4 that someone aspires to be Forever Alone.
...they don't make games like this anymore
08,01would someone brush my mane?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<urd, <
Sorry.
Meanwhile: not forever, just alone long enough for a game. theres allways someone around
I'm sure if the sad day ever comes that the MLP series ends, everyone will be able to move onto the NEW series - My Little Bears: Mauling is Magic
ah yes, new superwoman show
Yes, Supergirl. It's Faust, so it has to be quality. I'll definitely check it out when it's released.
Greetings everypony.

Can you play multiplayer?
What are we watching?
So I just recently found out what Faust's Derpy sketch sold for.

Aaand..
^_^ Something to watch out for! - Not sure if you've heard of the Lyra Sitting everywhere meme?.....
And I forgot how much.
so thats what milky way and the galaxy girls is all about. its epic and should be made into a show
But wow.
trololol
RAEG
DeadlyDerp3: how do you know this alien doesnt have a speech impediment?
Ah yes. The cyanide and Happines spoof.
Seriously, wow. Hold on.
Why is there static?
"Derpy Hooves: $2,151" is what google told me
Yeah, that sounds about right.

ohai
They're more properly known as the "Undine".
Its like Plasma Pong :P
DeadlyDerp3: Eh he. He he he.
Borg designation is cooler
Sure.
Species 8472 will mess you up.
Wait, this is Star Trek Crappidy Crap!?
I can't argue with that. :P
hey now, its Star Trek. Don't dis it
Man, these graphics of NOTHING are astounding!

The best thing being "she's gonna apear. she's basically a higher tier backround pony now." about Derpy.
hey unfoundbug
never played it myself, looking at getting it
"Would you make me a sandwich?"
aparently the engine is open source
Oh chocolate French silk pie. Easily one of the greatest advancements in cullinary science.
cypresswolf why not make the doc run across the background with derpy at random moments? that would work
no
00,03Ah~
With the amount of ships this pilot has taken down, shouldn't they be the red baron of the STAR FLEET?
My brain was out of wack during that scene. My thoughts: "Oh Pinkie Pie, why? *facepalm* Oh its Pinkie Pie *continues watching*
Ok. it's been fun, but it's 8:00 here now and I haven't eaten anything since breakfast. So i'm gonna go make some pizza.

13i meant only i have been on for some 4 hours or so...
08,01SuperBrony64: IKR!!!!
DAWWWW
13besides i wanted to at least get to the sathanas
08,01Meanwhile: phooey to you
Shizuka: I enjoyed your stream ^^
13poor Midnight_Tempest seems to have missed it though
08,01Shizuka: what do you drink
13i drink whatever is in the house .-.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQs-W7_gFrM
Bleach?
oi... where'd the stream go?
"Yes he was human. But he was also Chicken and Waffles!"
Shizuka thats a dangerous blanket statement
Whiskey is the best.
Is someone else going to stream in a short time?
I cannot stress this enough.
how long till its online?
Dishwater?
i drink bleached dishwater Meanwhile
Hazard: do you eat bowls of nails without any milk?
yes
hey scootalooo u there?
08,01Shizuka: but what's your favourite (alcoholic) drink?
13i do not drink
08,01oh
lol
vodka
08,01do you have any vices?
/me awkward
Shizuka: You should take to drinking whiskey, then.
Whiskey is awesome.
Meanwhile I ate a bowl of milk for breakfast!

08,01whoops

08,01i have no idea what that link is
How many whiskey drinkers we got in the stream?
08,01i've not been to it yet
08,01if it's nsfw, i apologise
/me raises a hoof.
i do on occasion
good burn
How did I just accidentally get into ponychan without noticing?
08,01i like ale
good read actualy, go read it
Amen to that, DaringDude
I only drink smirnoff ice. Unless it's a party, in which case I mix everything I can find into one glass and drink that. Not always a bright move.
08,01and mead
NUMBERS NUMBERS!
nordic mead?
Sorry, nerd.
i hear that increases stamina
Cypresswolf: I second this notion.
Mead is alright, I guess.
HonningBrew Mead? *snort snort*

*music starts"
I wanna be the very best
what, you talking about that grocery store jackdaniesl?
Like no one ever was
that's the crappy shit
I like to go a little bit better in quality and reach for Gentlemen's Jack
00,03To train them is my cause!
good whiskey is, sadly, expensive
Scoot-Scootaloo: you missed a line.
to catch them is my real test
Cypresswolf: I mostly drink Jack Daniel's myself, but that's because I'm 15 and I can't choose what brand.
Digimon is better
to train them is my cause.
00,03darn...
/me dunk TOY_PON3 with a cinderblock.
I had some mead once, at this viking-themed event. I could drink it, sure, but it wasn't awesome.
I will travel across the land
Ow! :(
00,03Gardervoir is best pokemon, btw
searching far and wide
What the hell is a Gardevoir.
Magickarp is best Pokemon
/me 11,01moves back and forth.
Back in my day we had Charizard and we were bucking ecstatic.
teach pokemon to understand
bye
lol
I've been known to drink down 1.75 liters in less than 1 week.
Scoot-Scootaloo I think Lucario would like a word with you.
oh hey Nittany_Discord
the power that's inside
ugh. I tried making myself a pony, but I can't do it.
Meanwhile: You know, that overused R34 Pokémon.
What the hell is a Lucario?!
Green hair.
Pokemon! Gotta catch'em all!
it's you and me
I don't browse Pokemon R34 Kammerjunk.
oh god
the theme tune again
I know my destiny
Stupid Pony Creator *throws Pinkie Pie*
someone please stream it so its out of everyones system
Wtf is Pokemon R34?
Pokemon!
*refreshing page*
Oh your my best friend
Meanwhile: Neither do I, but I just Google'd "Gardevoir" in Google Images. Which has safety off by default.
TOY_PON3: never you worry your pretty little head about that.
:why:
flutter_spin I know right, move the tab adn the damn thing refreshes
Meanwhile: Okay :3
in a world we must defend
And then I remembered it from a thread on /b/.
Pokemon! Gotta catch'em all!
1.75? did it give you an irish singing voice?
WAIT! Why were we singing pokemon, what about Bronymon?
a heart so true
Back in my day Pokemon only went up to Mewtwo.
^
our courage will put us through.
>Mewtwo
I actually know that name.
You teach me and I'll teach you
hi
po
ke
mon
You had better know that name
It's the only thing I ever had to do with Pokémon. From The First Movie.
Gotta catch'em all!Gotta catch'em all!POKEMON!
Or i'm gonna get nostalgic on your ass.
I didn't mind Red & Blue. Then Silver & Gold were fine. After that, I just thought "ok, now they are milking it"
I am back
I remember that glitch to catch Mew :3
i liked gold. nice graphics
Well, Im Scotch Irish by decent, If I didnt have one already, I certainly do now :)
;/
I can't even remember all the original Pokemon anymore. It's been that long.
Meanwhile: The only time I have had ANYTHING to do with Pokémon was when I saw Pokémon: The First Movie as a child. I have never owned the cards or games or seen the show.
I guess it didn't make sense to me that all of a sudden there were more pokemon.
Kammerjunk: did you grow up in the desert, eating cacti for nourishment?
Nope.
I grew up with BOOKS.
me starts singing digimon intro...japanese version
my ancestors are hungarien. can we switch?
Screw digimion
Why do you think I have 700-and-some now?
Books...books...boooooks........hm. No idk what that is.
And guess what. NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
Twilight would know what books are ._.
I don't even like books.
/me sighs...
Coincidentally, Twilight is my favourite pony.
Infact...It's over 2 hours past 5 now that I see the time. Time for a drink!
What's streamin
emangamer: What's wrong?
Nothing.
I still have the original pokemon cards. I remember buying a Japanese back and getting Mew. Best single japaense bought pack ever.
..
Oh
XD
TOY_PON3: oh...nothing
/me starts singing Digimon Intro Japanese Version
Gotta catch'em all!Gotta catch'em all!POKEMON!

TOY_PON3: nothing is wrong...

emangamer: why so sigh then? relief?
Who wants to party?
emangamer: I believe you
The flute from that movie gave me chills
Ukareta chou ni natte ichizu na kaze ni notte Doko mademo kimi ni ai ni yukou Aimai na kotoba tte igai ni benri datte Sakenderu hitto songu kikinagara
emangamer: I want to believe. But I just can't.

Meanwhile: I can't just sigh?
I can't get myself to believe.
/me checks chat and sees TOY_PON3 and tackle hugs him
stream stargate. or full emtal alchemist, or doctor who. or some rad wshow they don't show anymore, preferably without ridiculous japanese robots
why does everyone feel like something is wrong?
emangamer: What's with the '...'?
:P
emangamer: usually when people sigh they sigh with reason. But no, you're entitled to sigh if you want to.
Because you emoted a sigh.
Reboot :P
DAMNIT
I wanted to see Iron Giant again
Kammerjunk: and I can't just sigh?
nope.avi
lol.
i vote for stargate, been far to long since my eys glanced it's glory
Never seen Stargate.

08,01ha
Dat wall of link. Again.
the nuzzling MAKE IT STOP!
08,01regarding deleted scenes, one of thanimators said "at one part in Trixies episode, twilight would whisper "i bet she has sunshine in every bag" as a homage to clint eastwood, but it was cut due to the drug reference (still doesnt mean it isnt a badass song)"
whatever you're wathcing, youre wathcing it wrong, i see no stream
08,01i wish that was left in
08,01it would have been so freakin funny

Nuzzling is for couples.

00,03Hi~
In all honesty, who would you rather get a nuzzle from, otakon or Luna?
hell yeah amnesia.
I'm a white heterosexual male, I don't mind hugs but nuzzling from guys is where I draw the line
Scoot-Scootaloo: thats not sexism. sexism is discrimination, while otakon is simply not secure in his masculinity, hense his not likeing me nuzzeling him
Woona
=3
no
00,03At least I'm not biased when it comes to hugging people of the same gender :3
i am glad about this

Someone !!! Please!!! Stream Amnesia Dark descent!
otakon is getting his brain picked tonight

PhrozenFire: yelling isnt going to get anyone to want to do it
otakon: and yet you dont like me nuzzeling me???
PhrozenFire: ask nicely

True, otakon watched the show in a public library. That takes stones.
