Maybe I do. Not a clue.
I dreamt that I was on a sinking ship tonight
First time I've dreamt in a long time
Well that was fun.
I have had some of the wierdest dreams
The last dream I remember was from when I was 8, and that's because that was a seriously trippy dream.

Ew.

Soo, I was wondering. Are there any Homestuck readers in this IRC?
I've heard of Homestuck a few times.
Does it ever reset? :o
^
I like homestuck. It makes me theorize sometimes, like YSNHDT did for me.
Sinfest is best webcomic.
I dont really like webcomics
I am still pondering if you can count mspa comics as comics, it is not that the text is in the pics. More like a childs book, with a pic for every page.
Is it wierd that I am attracted to Rainbow Dash?

I still like her...
My ex gf broke up with me around December
last year
No, take that back she cheated on me and I broke up with her.
She broke up with you? then you have no controll over it do you?
oh right
It's just we were together for 2 years..
That's the most I've ever been with someone
She couldn't?
why cant you just be friends?
/me is not good with relationships
friendzoned
Because then knowing how stupid I am I would probably start falling for her again...
Unless I start to remind myself of all the abuse she gave me during our relationship then maybe I could work things out with her.

Spiders Web is a good movie
Heh. Meowception.

Deathstalker II was awesome.
time is the future
and the future is time
And it's a very good show
XD
/me nananananana

did i ever mention this is probably the best chatting/streaming site i have EVER been to? because it is
The Up/Deathstalker II night was wonderful.
/me hugs everypony.
I do remember being in the channel and listening during the initial Inception stream.
And thus hearing the Meow.
We could always watch Plan 9 from outerspace
Watching the stream without pants is best way to watch stream
/me notices he's in public "Oh bugger"

Asides from the "Are you my mummy?" episode, yeah.
I'd say you should get a mad hatters hat (I forget the proper name, they are like tophats, but are much taller) and have a pipe with it, even if you don't smoke it.
Oh, past Tennant.
That's the one.

Morty: nah, I'm ok with fanfiction, I just don't read a lot of it
i guess cus the sisters have weird horse faces
but I've read fanfictions that have... scarred me.
I know dat feel.
go to advanced in options and it says enable developers console
Me and my friend literally screamed in fear when we saw this nasty ship-fic between our 2 favorite characters in Gokaiger.
in my fanfic, Pinkie rages against fanfiction writers, and in an epic move she cries "This one's for my innocence!"
screamed?
It was....horrid.
literally?
that was amusing
seems legit.
And also, the characters were completely off. I know it's fanfiction, but PLEASE, keep the characters to their personality, not some weak sex crazed freak.
Sounds...fun..
ive seen enough hentai to know where thats going

May 3rd is offically pinkie pies birthday.
xD
i vaugly rember this show just not any episodes
Just because the episode airs on a given day doesn't mean that's when it takes place
may 3rd best day ever
see ya otakon'
hi
13now that's a knoife
April 1st, the day of the fools would make more sense
http://ponykart.net/
13please don't link non-images during streams
13it's rude
Ponykart!
:O
pedo alert...
8 seasons
13he triggered a trap card
a long time hopefully
My Little Dash confirmed it
8 seasons?
I think 5 seasons at least....
A long time if it keeps up quality. If quality starts to drop I hope they end it before it becomes an embarrassment like the Simpsons
^^^
The longer the show drags on, the more material is going to be used up
Well, there always has to be a moral, right?
13mid 90s political correctness and all
Yeah, i guess
If Pinkie Pie ever dies in the last episode, that would make me cry
o_op
*o_o
Nah, that wouldn't happen
Nopony would Die are you kidding me? :D
It's possible
^^indeed
would that actully be allowed to happen
no^
If it is a movie special
If she dies, it would be a veritable world of grey
hey! wuts up with the stream?!?!

owwwwwwww
13something wrong?
Ahh! We hit a wrinkle in Time!
this is wrong...
welllll
it works.....
this is sooo wrong...
THIS IS SOOO WRONG...
wut is this?!
But yeah, there are some things they can do to keep material up in the show
But if they make them get older that wud be awful o_o
wut wut wut?!?!?!?
Season 3 = the plot of DS9
Would be the most controversial thing ever

In which case he's angling for a banning.

realy?
Pow! Haha!
08,01unfoundbug: oh, i never heard of that
neither had i till someone said on here recently
I just find it awkward when you don't see Rarity or Twilight in an episode. I want them to have some screen time
aaaaw, i wanted to see is asplode
but just found confirmation from one of the animators
Can you give us some descriptions of other scenes that were cut before they were aired (something we don't know about)? ...
apparently it was intended as "dizzy"
"Oh Rarity created this wig" ... *looks for Rarity* :(
It means there is a plug in, and it's missing. Shrugpony.
Also I am sad now...my cat died....
Arceus-pony|Fancy:its missing a plugin, whats nots working?
Ohhh no! Poor kitty. :(
hear*
Clint Eastwood - Gorillaz reference would have been awesome :)
Where the pitchures of the rooms should be
COOOOOOOL
:O there was a scene cut from the trixie episode with a clint eastwood reference
is the stream working for you?
and at the bottom of the pages are the room names I can select

Are you guys planning to END the series after season 3, or there are chances of a season 4? (and 5, and 6, and 95!) ...
^MEanwhile
For some reason I felt Luna was more of a passive character. She is strong upfront because of her position, but really just wants to have fun like Fluttershy
Even though Faust already left the team?
more luna eps pleeease
^
i read all the fanfics already
I know, All good things must eventually :) But Lets hope its not for a while yet - Rosario - I really want it to continue. and it must.
