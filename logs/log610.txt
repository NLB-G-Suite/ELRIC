Spectrum_Rush, awesome! :O it's already looking pretty smooth!
u mad bro?
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, external client, you can hack the site's client to do colour
Hmmmm
A Friend In Deed :3
Phase4: how do you do that
'Hack'
Seems legit
00,02well change some parameters
well, im bored
who owns this site?
talk normal i dont know what that means
Anaruski: me
could i get permission for free pentest?
Dear god
its free!
LOL
You so funneh Phase4
Anaruski: No one owns the site techinally all mods keep it running and going
TheKoreanBrony1354:
Playing the Wii on a Sharp television is horrible
00,02?
Anaruski: Dunno, I always assumed it was SuperBrony64. ponyshrug.jpg
00,02Jmo4267, ?
wow i uploaded 52 youtube videos
...
well, basicly who own the domain is the legal owner
this episode
AGAIN
FOR THE SHITZILLIONTH TIME
00,02Spell-of-Gaming asked for it :P
00,02complain to him
Spell-of-Gaming: we watch this episode every other millicsecond of our life on bronystate
lidl....
Phase4: i plan on it
i cant unhear it!
when do we get to watch Party of one?
never
:'(
cause people are too busy wanting to watch this episode
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Last time was the Tom Awards, I think.
Yay stream is running perfectly now :3
00,02if Spell-of-Gaming wants to change his choice then i'll change
Phase4: oh im not blaming you dear
Still a bit skippy, but not as bad as before
AdamTheDuck: not for me
im blaming Spell-of-Gaming for choosing the episode everyone and their dog chooses
Okay
Wow, Sith. Wow.
I'll change it then
... Why did I jynx it...
Just stop whining.
and i found the owner of the site
00,02after the song
Phase4: well yea, after the song....yea
cause it is my fav song on mlp
Anaruski: Stil telling you theres no actual owner actually
still*
Screw physics
it's Pinkie
i cant say it is the best song cause then i would be just like those assholes who say "this day aria is best song, and if you dont like it then you are stupid" ugh
but the law says that an domain must allways be designated to a person or a corpration
00,02AdamTheDuck, dat 0x7F
"this day aria is a good duet" ITS THE SAME SINGER
All the 
not a duet if it is the same singer
00,02some of the people here get random malformed text, i'm not sure if its intentional or bugs

and all the signs point to the fact that a person in united kingdom "own" this domain
my thing is lagging like crazy
00,02AdamTheDuck, how you doing that?
Hmm, still comes out as one ...
Phase4: Square, cube triangle
Type in something short, doesn't have to be short
then press
Anaruski: He still doesn't own the site and everyone on it, He only keeps the domain up and all
Phase4: ∆
anyone know who "Andrew Bell" is?
Phase4: X circle square to not die
ctrl + backspace
Anaruski: yup
00,02the linux fonts generate squares with the characters value for unknown codepoints
Phase4: was mine a square?
The Super Speedy Cider 6000 please :3
dat 
the cutie mark chronicals
00,02for those of you that dont understand my badly worded sentence: the litteral value of that was 0x7F
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, good choice sir
Nonpareil
I'm having problems with buffer again. what can i do?
Love using that word in my essays :D
Anaruski: again though he may be registered as the domain owner, But he still due to several reasons isn't in charge
The steam's really laggy. And I got a screenshot of Pinkie Pie blending in with the background somehow. I missed an even better sight, though.
lel
Anaruski: I lack insight to how BS is kept up and running and everything. But i know a few base things
is the server managed by him?
LAGGING
Anaruski: Yes as he is the most skilled person with computer knowledge in general
am I the only one who is having problems with the stream, it buffers every 10 seconds...
Anaruski: If you checked the staff page you can see his position here
Boltasar: i know that feel bro
00,02fun fact: inside the us theres soft cider and hard cider
:'(
Boltasar: Yeah mine is buffering again :(
Boltasar: im having the same problem
CIDER PARTY FTW
00,02hard cider is what the rest of the world knows as cider
00,02while soft cider is known as apple juice
HOLY FUCKING LAG! :[
00,02so when i first watched this, my understanding was that they were all getting drunk
everyday i am buffering
Phase4: actually soft cider is still diferent then apple juice
STEPPIN ON THE BEACH
00,02Spectrum_Rush, it is?
DOO DOO DOO DOO
Anaruski: So he does keep the domain up and everything, He has no actual ownership of BS as it's kept up and going by all the mods here
finnaly
well... that explains how they can produce cider this quick...
:[
Phase4: yea apple juice is a clear liquid, soft cider is not
I love this stream... especially when it dosn't work
00,02Anaruski, whats this now?
Phase4: gimme a couple secs and i will have the differances
Phase4: He is asking who owns the site, And i explained not just one person owns the site per say
im looking for the owner to give permissions for a pentest
F this, im playing super mario bros wii
Phase4: i think he is trying to hack the network
00,02Anaruski, feel free, i'm one of the techs
I like how cheerilee got herself some cider before, but in that zoom out sequence, she's in the audience complaining. anypony else catch that?
00,02its mostly stock wordpress, dont think i've added any exploits with my code
Sylandest, she will always want cider
im with rdibp. Fix this stream
skip, skip, skip....
Suddenly skips to song 6_9
dafuq
Phase4: In the United States, apple cider refers to the unprocessed liquid that you get from apples. The apples are washed, cut, and ground into mash before being pressed. The resulting cider usually contains apple pulp and is dark, brown, and cloudy. The beverage is perishable and must be refrigerated. If this liquid is filtered and further processed, the resulting product is apple juice, which has a longer shelf life than cide
00,02i'm not sure what error you guys are getting, gona have to complain to mips
TIL Konata's teacher is Cheerilee
but just in case, who should i contact to get a permission on paper
woops that was supposed to be pm'd
or as an email
hey fellas

Mornin' StinkomanFan
00,02they've survived a great many attacks
hiya Flutters and StinkomanFan
haters gonna hate?
00,02Anaruski, your best bet would be some php exploit, which considering the setup is far more likely than it should be
/me 00,02dislikes php and its stupids
Durr, is anything on Virtual Console even free?
dovahkin is just an exact copy of the dragoon

where exactly are they? not the mainroom, as far as i can telkl
this is the internet, everyone is a baby

WrekatBUCK: your voice is damn sexy
Phase4: will it it be uploaded on youtube after?

Bronysith: You may want stop now
00,02YAR HAR

Rules decide what's okay
Haha ufb
NEKKID TIME
I was admiring Wrek's lovely Prairty
/me dances around
are there still ppl on livestream who dont use addblock @_@
adblock is bad for the business
00,02Vivix, i disagree
I dont mind ads, they keep the internet free
00,02it took quite a bit to make me install adblock
I don't want to pay for youtube in 2020, so I refuse to use it-
Bronystate doesnt get money from the ads
of course, that would be extreme
...i need to pray for celestia's protection now. cthulu might be onto me
00,02if they want to make me watch that many ads then stuff them
no, but businesses that rely on ads do, not bronystate
>Pay for Youtube
I literally just cringed.
I don't mind ads, because of all the things I get free because of it
00,02i dont mind non intrusive ads
just decided to do something about my clogged sink. not sure what i pulled out there, but i'm pretty sure it doestn answer to any gods we know
yees, that's a better way of putting it
00,02little thing to the side, no sound or video, loads fast and looks interesting
Phase4: at least adds stay out of my games
The worst ad I know is World of Tanks
it actually breaks youtube player
hello
If adblock can do selective blocking I would block them
Welp, Im gonna get me some cereal :P
World of tanks doesnt even have a mute button
yeah-
C is for CEREAL
speaking of which, is there a brony tank corporation?
00,02i'm not waiting 1.5 minute ad about gum EVERY TIME I WANT TO WATCH A 30S VIDEO
whenever i get their ad on youtube it shifts the entire player sideways, breaking fullscreen
00,10Ad block has alot of settings and filters
Dat Sumica
Phase4: GOOD POINT, actually
00,02there are too many ad services to selectively filter
Ohai Sumica :P
00,02its all or nothing
bnut I mean like, netflix could benefit from ads, considering how expensive TV is and how things will shift towards on demand
still depends on the browser you use though Sumica
00,02i per site filter for some things
00,02but not many
who here uses chrome
00,10funfact the company that has the ads on the site still pays the site, you just dont see it
I wouldn't mind blocking the ads on mips and livestream, as they're all boobs and bribes, but not on other things
twindmcmaster: Me, why?
just asking
Well, that was embarassing
00,10adblock works in all browsers
00,02internet explorer would be more dificult than the others but one probably exists
oh hi Sumica how are you today man?
00,02and i know little of opera
00,02or safari
opera has one
00,10I am well
00,02they are hipster browsers
All I know about opera is that it is scandinavian-
I use opera because I love their feed system
Sumica: Even Steam in game browser?
00,02RAINB0W_CRASH, hipster
Did netscape die? I used that back in the day
00,10but yeah you can turn off and on adblock on a site by site basus
i think it did
00,10who uses ingame browser, it's slow as hell
Sumica: okay- that's good. I would love to just block World of tanks flash ads-
i dont
00,02AdamTheDuck, the ingame browser in steam is based on webkit, the thing safari and chrome use
Phase4, at least I check my feeds now, I used to use feeds and still not know there were updates
00,02but adblocks exist outside of that
00,10well it dont work like that Vivix
yeah-
ever since i switched to firefox back in the day i never used something else
00,10you could just block them on bronystate for example
Sumica: Well for games like TF2 when shifting to another tab takes bloody ages
but blocking sites with bad ad service would probably be good
recently looked at the current IE for fun and almost got cancer
IE sucks
Sumica: i have a gift for you actually
also firefox is the best browser, but it just broke for me a little while ago...
Dark_Horst: Rofl :D
00,02Sumica, that depends heavily on how it handles frames, the stream embeds dont exist on the bronystate site
00,02RAINB0W_CRASH, firefox is best browser /)
but I must say I support ads, because it helps people pay for maintenance-
the only thing that dampens the firefox experience is the copypaste crash problem
Phase4, (\
chrome is best browser
00,02chrome is getting there but it lacks some of the polish
^
I used Firefox, it started crashing, switched to chrome, it has started crashing lately
00,10no but it handles rejecting ads based on the page no the embeds in the page
and chrome can sometimes refuse to turn on protection for certain sites...
Phase4: what they really need to fix is the Shock Wave
I switched to chrome because I thought it had more polish than firefox in the first place. :P
when i use ctrl c/v on different tabs and one of them is running an embed, there's a good chance firefox will just lock up
Then firefox updated to look a bit more like chrome
Phase4: Just shine Chrome with some more mods on the Web Store
00,02Major, adobe shockwave is dead, this is a good thing
I want to try Firefox again, I just want something fast and pretty
00,10Dare i ask Bronysith?
DABI PLS
Phase4: not for me, it keeps crashing for me :/
JAYMOO PLS
Sumica: it is a year supply of ice cream
00,02now we just need flash to die and we can live our happy lives adobe-free
/me puts on a helmet
I love how we are suddenly all talking about browsers because of an add on livestream...
Flash is good for movies- and..that's about it
00,02Major, if you have shockwave installed, uninstall it
no u jaymoo
o wait
dabi pls
Sumica: why did you put on a helmet?
00,02Vivix, the only thing html5 cant do is streaming, thats being worked on
00,10so I can ask the flavor of the icecream
Cool, because yeah Flash is good for animation industry, not internet
00,02actual video browsers can do, the youtube html5 demo demonstrates that
Sumica: okay
Phase4: what makes flash so bad?
Sumica: BOOT TO THE SHIN
/me throws a boot at Sumica s shin
00,02Dark_Horst, i'ts a big list, you sure you want?
Sumica: dont feed him questions! ._.
Hehe
Phase4: hit me
/me hits Dark_Horst with a bat for no reason
But yeah, FLASH is good for vector based and rig animation, like MLP, but it's too--clumpy for browsers, In my opinon
I wonder if Adobe will go back to the animation reute, and stop trying to push the webdesign direction they have now
00,02Dark_Horst, its slow, very slow, mostly because of its existance as a plugin. its proprietry, only things adobe wants to can use it, its HUGE (srsly, codebase is massive) and the exploit surface is massive, you can read about some of them, this also leads to instability, and poorly designed, leading to several implimentations of functionality existing simultaiously in the plugin
html5 will just be- more streamlined and faster?
Dat wall of explanation
...that is a pretty big negatove
*negative
yeah, but when flash came out, was it intended for web use?
But how else will I play flash games? :P
00,02Dark_Horst, theres a function designed to pack 4 byte integers into 2, it was once exploited and allowed a botnet to start
i think the exploit surfasce is the reason the guys from eve online dont have flash in their ingame webbrowser
00,02Dark_Horst, in an environment where you count in megabytes, that function had no right to exist
Suck it up dabi
Hehe, JRE ?
who plays flash games...
Who doesn't play flash games?
Eugh
00,02you wont notice the difference
Show me a good javascript game. >:
Dungeon master remake
They don't exist
basically counting sand grains on a beach, eh?
IT IS AWESOME
that is java runtime, don't know if it runs in browsers
/me don't know that shit
:P
00,02javascript equilivent game engines are only starting to exist now html5 is out
00,02chat is ded
no ites not
still here
conversation is just dead
00,02java is even worse than flash but i've raged enough for tonight
what's next on the buck schedule anyway?
We see wrek beat the crap out of GilDash :D
hehe
would html5 allow for programs such as paintchat?
00,02dat 0x7F again
00,02Vivix, eyup
<,<
THat's cool-
00,02i've though of replacing it with a html5 variant
freakin giraffe
Hm, that would be nice, not to mention it could be used by others as well
killerpony7733: nope, but Im sure it's job :D
<_<
Atm it is very unstable, and- yeah only lets some people in
00,02Vivix, one or two exist i think but they're paid or otherwise inaccessible
00,02its why shi-chan's chat has lasted so long
Omfg, ive been wondering for 5 damn minutes why im hearing chattering :D then i realized it was the stream :D
Ahh-
00,02RaveBrony, XD
hehe
who wants to discuss about season 3? NO SPOILERS!!!
I'm excited!
I was like WTF im not playing Sims or Sim City or anything :D
00,02rdibp, do you think it will contain pony?
^
Don't answer! Spoiler!
/me slaps Phase4
I SAID NO SPOILERS'
the pre-opening only starts at 18:00. is that gmt?
00,02XD
I love how I spent the last day before school with nothing else than tf2 mvm and chattin on bronystate
also sleeping till 1 a clock
hehe
Where is Gonder when ponies die? :P
Pshh, itll probably Live Action! :$
Healthy studying environment
RaveBrony: EW
RAINB0W_CRASH same thing
00,02they say theres something big planned, and thus only 13 episodes
Major: Hahaha :D
RaveBrony: imagine if it was suddenly 3d animation
/me 00,02is really hoping for a movie
Phase4: yeah I heard that- I'm--yeah hoping for a good movie
Vivix: o.o
00,023d wont work with pony
hehe, it would be TERRIBLE
Phase4: such a short time for a great show :(
2d animation has always been my preferation
Phase4: hered theres going to be 13 eps for one studio and 13 for the other
00,02it *could* work but not worth it
00,02rdibp, i heard that somewhere too, not sure though
rdibp: that was an early rumour, wil anderson said onl 13
I'm quite happy season 3 is very tight lip'd - havent heard anything about it yet
yeah
00,02i think they are taking brony's very seriously
VERY seriously indeed
Phase4: 2D is cheaper and prettier, and ofter better results with less effort, 3d tends to look horribile when cheap
00,02i meen what, theres at least 3 sold out conventions going on RIGHT NOW
yeah
I love the fact that Im a friend with a brony hater and yet she likes me :D
yeah, there will be more seasons he said
Phase4: Indeed
soo, any dutch bronies here who are gonna go to the meetup in september?
00,02Vivix, 3d can be done well though
and Simpsons to had some 13 ep seasons
who here likes phoenix wright series?
I wonder if Brony Fan Fair is sold out...I expect to see thousands of people
Phase4: oh yes, but it costs a lot more in time and money to do it well
00,02look at reboot and beast wars, to quote two very early examples
Major: there should be more people like your friend :D
I mean, pony takes 6 months of animation?
00,02they got away with soo much by being clever
Hmm, haven't seen those
i wonder how long it takes to make an MLP episode
Ive only seen them on here :D
very cheap 3d studios tend to get results like that berry show on hub
00,02Vivix, dont let shizu hear you say that, she'll make you watch them
hehehe
00,02cheap 3d studios are full of sillies
Lol!
hehe yeah,
rdibp: well she doesnt hate brony's she just hates how they shove the show down your throaght :P
00,02they produce strawberry shortcake wich misses some very basic things
showing something down someones throat is the best way to make htem dislike it
Major: thats not all of them though, i hate how some people fall for brony steryotypes :[
Vivix, you will like ponies. No matter what.
Phase4: then comes Care Bears
I wonder if Strawberry Shortcake would look better iif it was trad-rig animation
00,02i've not seen care bears
Canterlot > Care-a-Lot
00,02ViolaGrey, trad-rig?
rdibp: eh, she's a good friend of mine so I respect her opinion, and no she's not my special somepony thats someone else :P
:D
Rig is like- very well done version of newgrounds
so I call it tradrig-
Vivix getting all technical up in here.
00,02the thing about animation though is its less about image quality and more about motion
yeah
and their use of rigs gives them tons of extra time on details and traditional things for fluent things where they need that
its hard to believe that they animate MLP on simple Flash
00,02Vivix, ah, i've only heard it refered to as vector animation
BFF has over 200 preregisterations :) - it's twice as big as Houstons S2 finale meetup - Awesome
Ello there everypony.
Phase4: yeah like the blue pony in the Best Night episode, he goes so freaken derpy :P
'ello Malavolent
00,02and the biggest problem i have with strawberry shortcake is the Lack of movment
yeah, both the trad and rig are vector based, but traditional is hand drawn frame by frame, and rig is like a flash asset with a doll/model thing
yeah
i wonder what those people are talking about
00,02you have maybe one thing on screen moving at any time, it looks so rigid and dead
I am very big proponet of dynamic scenes, like- that's my problem with anime at times, how little movement and reactions there are-
:O Rina-chan & General Zoi - confirmed guests
Some anime are better at that, I assume
00,02anime can sometimes get away with it, theres a contrast betwene background and caracters that hides it somewhat
Yo, Phase4?
00,02ohai Malavolent
Yeah-
How can I get to TF2 bronystate server exactly?
Did anyone hear that they got Rina-Chan and Bree Faith to do voices in the My Little Dashie movie?
I don't know who either are-
rdibp: Lolwut, they did?!?
00,02Malavolent, the addresses are spitfire nyx and applebloom .ariscop.net
00,02password for all 3 is ponies
Sif you don't know Rina-Chan Vivix
Thank ye.
yeah- I have no idea
My Little Dashie...Movie? :) This fandom never ceases to amaze me
Was she the voice behind the gypsy bard song?
The MLD movie is supposed to by finished by 2012 fall, right?
Phase4: Your servers seems empty of players atm
:P
00,02if this fandom gets a movie finished by this year i will eat my shoes
hehe
00,02killerpony7733, probably, feel free to fill them
Didn't know there was a website for it.
Phase4: screw that im eating my elbo :P
I'd rather see the MLD visual novel, it looked pretty neat.
*elbow
OMG PHOENIX WRIGHT IS A FIGHTER in marvel vs capcom 3. that is so cool
Careful Phase4, there are some among us that may hold you to that :P
Do half life still have that eh..protocol that lets you join games via browser?
00,02OBJECTION
Bronysith = slowpoke
00,02steam://connect/nyx.ariscop.net
00,02something like that
00,02probably horribly wrong but whatever
what are we waiting for :)?
ah yes, you could have links to that, but I'm not sure if that might have been--abused?
rdibp: no i already knew that, i just really want the fighting game now
rdibp: THANK YOU! Im no longer the only one that thinks that!
00,02Cypresswolf, if they get it finished that fast it wont be good
00,02takes time to make things
Major: wut?

00,10might look in to it, been wanting to stream some older games
ive gotten my PS1 emu to work quite well
alexxm: Pretty good, thanks. :)
Sumica: i am proud to say i follow this cult classic ^_^
00,02http://www.pcsx.net/ here it is
00,02http://pcsx2.net/ and this site has changed a lot sence i last looked
ERMHAGHERD WHY IS THIS AWEOSME?!
i use ePSXe
00,10incredible crisis would be amusing to stream
00,10and I love the theme
i love the music to dragoon
GO ROSE AND TRANSFORM
dart
such a badass
he is not some emo bitch
i use very old PSP
is there no stream?
should i get a vita?
YES
y?
they are awesome
y?
Heavy rain outside :P
Major: better save shaun
nomnomnomnom rain
chocolate rain
i have one. they are just awesome
I want rain here
Why are they awesome?
why does the ps1 and ps2 have my fav games?
because those system were awesome
yes
i say if you started gaming in the ps2 era or earlier
you played great games
eeyup
and therefore i recognize you as a gamer
except for systems such as the 3do and cd-i
yea
3d0 had good games...
if you started on the ps2 or ps2, nes, snes,
just sayin
ps1 derp
Bronysith: Implying someone younger than that generation doesn't play old school games.
Did I just hear 3DO?
yes
XD
1 or 2 good games but other than that
Spell-of-Gaming: well i very rarely see 10 year olds nowadays playing snes
on 3do
nes is a current fad, a lot of 15 yearolds play it because it is cool
i still play snes games on my browser
cause lets see
snes had
CHRONO TRIGGER
sega cd wasn't too good either
i owmed a SNES
FF3 (FF6)
Bronysith: It's rare to find the SNES nowadays, though. So that's kind of an exception.
I grew up with amiga, comodore and computers
and i can play the SNES in a emulator
FF 3(6) and Chrono yay
chrono trigger
such an awesome game
eeyup
I grew up with amiga too
playing fallout ruined final fantasy for me-
um
how?
We had Amiga 500 and 1200
Spell-of-Gaming:if you want one get a emulator and then download a rom file and play it on here
Vivix: fallout 1?
I never ha fun with other RPGS after playing fallout 1 and 2
had*
sonicandmario85: Er... I know that.
Vivix: well try out the awesomeness that is chrono trigger
I might- what kind of game is that?
jrpg
it is fantastic though
omg
so aweosme
you can combine attacks
and read the pony chrono trigger fic too
are they still on break?
hm- maybe, I'm like that group that loed WRPGS and Point and click adventures
I loved pont & click too
Hey :)
Hai MaxTheBrony
Broken Swooord
hi
Haya
Chrono Trigger is normal for me.
I like JRPGs and WRPGs
you cant vote for obama, you cant vote for mitt romney, WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR!?!?!
I got addicted playing too much Earthbound
The only JRPGs I've tried are really Final Fantasy, and it didn't do it for me
i still need to play that
that and RPGXmaker games
ty sweet merciful sexy molestia for emulators
Bronysith: :S
my views just changed towards you
wat?
using emulators?
:D
bbl gotta do somethings :s
<_<
emulators are fine
yes
i love chrono trigger
eeyup
whats chrono trigger?
rdibp: ...
has anyone play radiant historia on the DS?
the best rpg on the snes
read the pony chrono trigger on fimfiction
To be honest, I liked Super Mario RPG more than Chrono Trigger.
chrono trigger is the single greatest rpg on the snes
combining attacks
WHY HASNT ANYONE ELSE DONE THIS?!
me
I like talking and walking-
i have
Er... Kirby 64?
Sumica: are you downloading that now?
so how is BUCK going anyway
Kirby 64 combined abilities.
super mario RPG, chrono trigger, final fantasy 6 and earthbound are all kinda tied for me
I hope they can bring back that feature
super mario rpg was a great game
ff7 chrono trigger and ff6 are tied for 1st as my fav game of all time
console rpgs...they can in no way compare to titles like gothic or morrowind
i disagree
what?
morrowind is good
didn't this entire conversation spark from Bronysith asking if he should get a PSvita
nay
it is the single greates TES game ever
i love how complex morrowind is. it makes me feel like i get shit acoopmlished
what's with the stream?
INSTEAD OF THE STUPID ARROW POINTING ME WHERE TO GO
I never played morrowind until this year, installed MGE XE and Codepatch, man that game is AMAZING
you actually have to read in your journal where to go
I love getting lost- takes me back to old rpgs
Sometimes I wish Bronystate never awarded a "best pony" award
how come?
they awarded a best pony award?
Some people took it as canon
well
Which really made me facepalm so hard.
twilight sparkle is my fav pony
there are mods for skyrim which give you this feeling too. having a gps tracking system in a medieval fantasy world is just silly
some people take lots of stuff as canon...
it was just a bit of fun
you can turn off compass in INI for skyrim, makes it a very beautiful game
DaringDerpy: seriously. in a game like fallout 3 or new vegas it works
best pony award? never heard of it
Unfortunately, half of those people don't know what a headcanon is.
EFS, etc, yes
but it works a bit too well comapred to the pipboy in F1 and F2 sometimes
"i love the elder scrolls series. skyrim is my favorite. whats morrowind?"
in F1 and 2 you have to buy a heavy motion detector to get "EFS"
I HATE FALSE GAMERS
in new vegas. you can get an orbital ion cannon. so I guess gps is ok
it has to triangulate with something
DaringDerpy: but how do you have gps in skyrim? how do you know where to go? DOVA SENSES?!
no
it is just handholding bullshit that ruins immersion
In Van Buren it was stated that sattelites still orbit earth
people mark on your map?
yes, but the player position
same problem in Morrowind though
having a more or less correct map and a compass should be enough
All I can say is thank God for quick travel
in Skyrim and Oblivion there's a sentence in Ini file that turns off Compass
compass doesn't have to be though
hi
how you doing LoGaN
goood
the only thing I miss in Morrowind is walkspeed and quicktravel, because going back and forth a lot is annoying
not using quick travel is the real fun...there is always something entertaining on the way
it is, unless you have to go back and forth a lot
how are you alexxm
Vivix: there is quick travel in morrowind
Yes, something to distract you from your 30 minute walk
Vivix: the silt striders
:P
only the boats and the silt striders
i'm good LoGaN
:d
its funny cause you said good
my assassin in morrowind had something around 160 speed. walking somewhere never took long
I avoid Vivec like the plague, because walking there is such a pain when I have low athletics skill
i have high acrobatics
the starting walkspeed is horrible though- I mean it feels like I'm holding down ctrl
cause jumjping is faster Vivix
yeah, I jump everywhere
my acrobatics is so high
wat we talkin about?
hi alexxm :)
Morrowind and other games
hi alexxm

okay guys, I'll be right back. I'm thirsty
I just mixed up a drink. nomnomnom
im just drinking water
Yep a brony with kids. turn them into bronys also!
Water is scarce, drink vodka instead
^^^^
dabi vodka pls
vodka everywhere.
/me chases alexxm
vodka is made from...
/me drinks the vodka
GIMME 20 DOLLARS
potatos
Someone give him $20 already
you know, water is one of the principle components of cancer
dari have a paypal, i'll give you $20 next month
NullRadix:lier
also, if you drink too much, your cells explode
lier
You can only get cancer if you're alive
You know what to do
NullRadix:i drank alot before and my cells didnt explode
:P
dabi so wise
brilliant
/me sighs
and one time my stomach was upset so i drank alot of water and my stomach wasnt upset anymore
I can imagine NullRadix is facepalming right now.
in all seriousness, cancer cells are similar to normal cells in that they do contain a lot of water. what i said was true, but misleading
sonicandmario85: http://leavingbio.net/OSMOSIS%20AND%20DIFFUSION_files/image021.gif
Dat water be killing yo celllllllllllllls
dymkon?
and yes, if you drink way, WAY too much water, it will kill you
Yup
Tis true.
You can drown
Too
But drink as much vodka as you want
It's all good
^
You'll puke it up before you die. Probably.
50 cubic meters of water can kill you in less than a second
water isnt
dat alcholhol
water is natrual
Nah the death from vodka numbers is lower
sanic pls
we drink it
Alcholhol is natural
you can drink a LOT of water before it will kill you. as long as you stop when your stomach tells you to you're fine
We drink it
u mus hav gon scool wer i did
LOl Dumorimasoddaa
SHUT UP AND TAKE THE TRUTH
shoes are not natural
Elephants drink it
HAHA
FRUIT IS ALSO NATRUAL
Dat natrual
DOES FRUIT KILL YOU TOO?
ya no its funny I drank more when i was under age then i do know when im legal to drink
I come back after church and chat is discussing what's natural and death by.water
ikr
how was church? talked about death by locusts and blood rain?
Nopony lurks like Gaston
ooo DaringDerpy
besides if your talking about the water thats from the foset the goverments the one putting things in it
i drink distilled water
dat foset
and it absorbs all those ting like cloride the goverment put in
things*
if you boil it thats what happens
DaringDerpy: Don't start a religion argument
DaringDerpy lool it was good and no topics abouns with Hellfire dark fire this fire in my skin
One question DaringDerpy, is it in the bible?
hmhm
yes
and if you think distilled water kills you you sir are a lier i drank ALOT before
the last chapter
Ima grab a bible for shizz n giggles.
Never gone through one before
even plants drink water
/me dances around chat
First time I looked at a Bible
but not distilled though
Oh sonicandmario85, you will learn as you grow up.
I went to go and find page 666
Oh you dabi.
/me glomps PillowPoni
Dabi pls

I'm fine, alexxm. How about yyou?
alcholhol natral
i'm doing good PillowPoni
This is too funneh
wow...
Mind your language sanic
alexxm nice /)
Boiling water dosent remove anything from it
PillowPoni (\
i cant believe how stupid you guys are to think alcholhol is nattrual....
Dumorimasoddaa: Just kills bacteria
LOL
Unless you actually distill it
YOU THINK WE'RE SERIOUS
HAHA
no i dont

Define 'natural'
Forgive my interruption my sarcasm is augmented
sonicandmario85 elephants delibrately brew alchol from fruit to get drunk
If by natural you mean 'existing in nature - not manmade' alcohol is naturally ocurring in nature anyway
Therefore it's natural
bk
In everyway
/me tackles Vivix
DaringDerpy lolok
/me screams
You've missed a funny segment of this chat.
Book of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. that's the correct title
I see remnants of alcholism
so its in fruit? if its in fruit people are probaly taking it and pouring sugar in it...
What'd you end up grabbing to drink Vivix?
water, and juice
What type of juice?
sonicandmario85 you can make alchol with crab apples and water
Alcohol is fermentation of various types
orange
Dabi be trolling? And I'm missing out on it? Blashphemeh!
And some chewing
I see.
Hey, hey jaymoo
dabi pls
wut u wnt
Do you guys drink jaeger over in Australia?
im just drinking some distilled water right now the regular water taste like shit
Hey guurlz ive returned from the world of robot fighting
I don't think so
Distilled water is tasteless
I still want to drink it
does it look like
Jmo4267: http://www.amathusdrinks.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/j/a/jagermeister.jpg this stuff
i care?
Regular water taste dependso n where you live
Wait, do you mean Jagerbomb?
water has taste?
Oh that stuff, dunno.
Jægermeister is sold over here, but I don't drink so- neved had it
Water has taste
Don't think so
Well yeah, it's what's in a jagerbomb
>_>
distilled water as a little bit of good taste to it
why does a giraffe need to stay in a hotel?
has*
I guess we do drink it then, y?
not much stuff going on on the stream is there
sonicandmario85 it shouldn't not if it's 100% pure
dabi cmin to australa?
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO COME BACK!?!? :[

all the cool kids are at the buck convention
X3
I don't support alcoholism, sorry broski.
/me shakes head
<3
this is bought distilled water
I don't mind people drinking, but I don't like being around them when they do
Non ionised?
besides you can drink without getting drunk, so- I don't mind
LunarSS ish
You can buy it here
But I don't think "people" import it
More companies
i guess alcholhol isnt good for you because of sugar since your body turns it to acid and doesnt know where to store it
okay, in canda its known to be the cheapest worst beer you can buy
don't do alcholhol kids
Oh it's shit
No, that's not quote how it works sonicandmario85 when it comes to alcohol, whether or not alcohol is bad for your BODY is disputed, but it is bad for your behaviour if you're so inclined
But there's cheaper here
Gods bless Polish imports
i just drink lemonade juice and water
Lemonade is a juice?
I drink mocktails. WOO
part juice, I guess
yea exept it has sugar
in it
i like dr pepper
so good
its a juice since its made with lemon juice
Morning Bronystate.
GOOD MORNING
not exactly,lemonade is juice, but most of the water has been taken out and sugar has been added
Morning Jim, welcome to your entertainment for today.
By that logic wine is a juice as is cider
I don't know the english word, but we use saft a lot, juice vs saft, juice is when it's just the juice and saft is when it's more
is Buck over?
Nope
Monday
So does that make a screwdriver juice too then sonicandmario85
how've things been Jim
Because it's got orange juice in it
Saft is german?
:P
Fri-sun
LOL
dabi pls
Saft is norwegian and germanic I figure
WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE where me deliberate on the validity of liquids as juice and the like
hah
orange juice is best juice..
Hell no
huzah, the fun has been doubled
Juice pure from furit
Cranberry and Apple juice for life.
apple juice is good too
I like blueberry-
Is aloud to be consentrated then rehydrated but that's all
and grape juice
All I hear from stream "Rabble rabble rabble!"
most juices have added apple juice...
I need to find a blueberry mocktail
hey Jim how are you?
I'm good, thanks.
My family are returning home today :)
That's nice to know Jim!
WHY ARE WE STARING AT A PICTURE ON THE STREAM
'cause they're not streaming

acid is best drink because its EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEME
I got a message from a friend saying
I remember kids used to hang out outside of 7/11 drinking energy drinks as if they were drunk
"Rum and cherry Kool Aid
Drink that drink and drink it well
"
"Awh man this burns!"
Maybe that's best drink
Vivix what?!
yeah, kids are weird
when energy drinks were just becoming cool here, it was--weird
im actually a kid
i know a bar that makes proper cider but im 16 so i cant even get in the bar :l

I've only been in two bars, and neither times did I drink
I'm proud of you Vivix

hehe
>kids show does an episode about cider
TIME TO KILL A VIRAGE

allthought i have drank cider before tasted wierd
Clearly not many of them know it is supposed to be alcoholic then
:P
I still say it was nonalcoholic cider wit hfroth as artistic liberty
everypony should drink iodine from fukushima
best drink of them all
with a bit of luck it can even glow
Boltasar, you're gonna get someone killed broski.
I've spent 6k€ in bars last year and it was a total waste of money. Always the same losers with the same stories. Stopped drinking now.
I don't drink or smoke, so I get a lot of left over money to buy crap I want-
You should drink with us instead

A can of Pedigree Pony Chunks.

Poor Fluttershy http://i.imgur.com/PwsXp.jpg
Our can was huddled up tightly with many other cans in a small, dark, and dank place.
Oh my~......
/me is watching the Expendables right now... and can't understand a word that is coming from there mouths
DIE VIRAGE DIE
Be back later, Dinner
None of the cans were feeling very talkative, so they waited in their prison in silence.
._.
that story is pretty dark
/me sips his tea
Could be darker
After a while, the floor began to shake beneath them, and a great roar could be heard from outside the confines of the large metal container.
Smash his globes then.
that is why I said pretty Dumorimasoddaa
:p
This continued for many an hour, and the time slipped by slowly.
I can imagine how much tension is ripping apart several people in this chart.
Many a good, and innocent can fell during this tumultuous trip.

It says "BRONY UK CONVENTION"
And it the BUCK logo

So, BUCK and EFNW is happening at the same time?
I think at this moment EFNW is still recovering from their hangovers
Yep Malavolent
It doesn't say BUCK, you're lying dabi.
Well, damn.
They're both so far away.

Bollock, it is the UK.
It was upwards of 30 C yesterday
It is in the whole europe.

Not sure what it is now
I thought hot summers in England didn't exist
The hottest day of the year.
it was 30C here
Malavolent, it is indeed, getting sick of it already
Then again, Australia did have some very harsh winter this year.
its too hot today and too cold next month
I dont feel like doing shit because of the weather

:s
Brilliant white light streamed in.
Hey MaxTheBrony, really love the Bane drawing you did. Really great.
Jmo4267 Thank you ! :D
Our can was momentarily blinded, never having seen light before in his short lifetime.
If he could have cried a tear of, the can would have.
So beautiful.

Aaaand... walked into a very strange convo, haven't I?
Dabi what stry u telin

Na, just a story.
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
Then a vile, cantankerous creature appeared in the can's vision.
Is Nittany_Discord here :3?
11,01Hi Jmo4267
It started snatched up cans
Hayo
Hi, good Afternoon everyone
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
Carrying them off, to lord only know's where.

'ello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
11,01He's not here. Sorry.
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Good afternoon TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Soon he reached our can.
hey Nittany_Discord
/me glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
TRIXIE IS BEST PONY
:|
11,01Hi AttacktheAndalite, Jim, and Ryunosuke.
11,01And now I'm dust-free.
Hey Nittany_Discord :p
For a short while he could see trees, flowers, and the serene blue sky.
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a nice maid corset
11,01What's Princess Dari on about?
Wispy white clouds seeming to lazily float around, not a care in the world.
Nittany_Discord some fic about a can
i think
XD
it is its about a can of pony meat chunks XD
:O
Then this garden of Eden was snatched from him.
/me 11,01is in a maid outfit again >.>
Nuuuuu :s
It disappeared out of sight as he was carried into another box.
Nittany_Discord: how are you today?
Larger this time.
Meh. I'm just here for the movie.
There were more of those large creatures here.
im just here for the free food
11,01I'm actually down.
Nittany_Discord: Maid hour?
Why Nittany_Discord :s
Our can was placed on a shelf.
Nittany_Discord: whats up buddy? :(
Bronysith: Um... there is no food online.
Kencolt: thats why they want you to think
Where he waited, for how many hours he lost count.
perfect 'crazy-uncle' response from Bronysith
Many more of those creatures passed by.
haha
A wild Vivix appears.
Until one day, his what seemed to be his saviour appeared.
Bbl later i hear my food calling for me.
Hi Jmo4267 !
Taking him away from the hot confines of that huge cube.
Hi Vivix !
Taking him somewhere safe.
Quiet.
one of my basses has stained the floor and another bass with its bad paintjob- can't get it off
Nasty
And there he stayed in relative happiness for quite a while.
Dat Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03inb4 I missed it
So much tension.
makes you wonder why they sell spray paint that says "Do not touch, do not lacquer with clear paint"
He would stare out of the window, and wonder at the natural beauty beyond
/me glomps into Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03Wait... wha?
Dabi be tellin storie
Scoot-Scootaloo:prince daris telling us a story about a can of pony meat chunks LOL
Then one day, his saviour - HIS FRIEND - turned on him.
No!
mfw my house is clean and I can be lazy.
00,03Uh hu...
oh no!
Scoot-Scootaloo: hello cousin! :3
tl;dr tbh
In other words, Dari has gone off the deep end.
He was battered and attacked by cruel sharp tools.
Run, can!
And his faux-friend began to pour out his inards
00,03I'm sure it's pulitzer prize worthy...
this reminds of that one blur video wit hthat milk box that gets drunk by some guy at the end-
Allowing some foul beast to come and lick them up.
and goes to heaven
Oh god D:
dear celestia this is bad!
He could smile the disgusting breath of the beast, it's face so close to the can's own.
smell*
He could only watch on in horror as it consumed his insides.
NOO! D:
@_@
Life began to slip away from him.
Fading...Fading.
It's a can. It has no eyes. HOW DOES IT WATCH ANYTHING?
To nothing. But black.
This is pretty horrible
chat derped
The end.
<:

11,01Oh my CrazyCherry *Blushes*
It's an EEEEEVVVIIIIIILLL ring! D:
all for the ring...
midget fight
Actually, Smeagol and Deagol are cousins, IIRC
04Damn, he fucked him UP
kill your best friend for a... ring!
hello Gandalf_the_White
And Smeagol outright murders his buddy. All for a ring.
THE RING!!! *runs away.
"We are doing maintenance, will be back soon." Why i got this? D:
But aren't hobbits supposed to be resistant to the rings corruption?
hai Gandalf_the_White
k im back with fresh hot muffins :P
Fl00tersh41: guess not
pretty much dead
http://imgur.com/gQTFZ
Not for a ring, for THE RING.
Ganjalf: Try refreshing again. It should work.
ded
Could we restart soon?
1,11RANCOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The opening scene - in which Smeagol discovers the Ring and starts on the slippery slope towards ultimately becoming Gollum - was actually directed by Fran Walsh. Originally it was set to appear in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, immediately after Frodo first revealed Gollum's real name.
04I don't think every hobbit can resist like that
/me noms the muffins from Thinder-crescent
Kandarihu: Blue refresh.
Fl00tersh41: To my awareness nobody's resistent to the ring except for Tom Bombodil. =P
Did it, came back a few minutes into the movie.
http://i.imgur.com/Tlvex.jpg
Success.
Gold_Demona: Hobbits are supposed to be, hence why frodo has to carry the ring
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "fall of Smeagol" scene had to be digitally touched-up in two ways. First, Thomas Robins (Deagol) accidentally blinked after being strangled. However, Peter Jackson liked that particular shot so much better than others that he decided to have the Weta Digital crew "freeze" the eyes. Second, in the shot where Smeagol falls on the rocks (just before Gollum begins
1,11to narrate), Andy Serkis' legs were considered to be too muscular and athletic, and so they were digitally thinned-down.
my precious!
Fl00tersh41: hobbits are resilient, but not immune
I don't receive the stream:(
Gimli: Rancom?
ewwwwwww
Michael: its just sushi
crude fish :D
Hello everyone :)
like japan
my pppppprrrrecioussssss
04I dunno...Smeagol really fell into it
hai MLP_Brovakiin
04Like immediately
04Bam
04There was no resistance
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis was not the film-makers' first choice to play the real Smeagol at the beginning of the film. However, once they started considering other actors, they realized that Serkis was the natural choice.
Gandalf: Yeah, I always wondered about that myself
Gandalf_the_White no willpower i guess
I don't think Hobbits have any resistance to the ring as a race, Frodo is just particularly strong.
Gandalf_the_White: Wasn't he originaly a human in the books though? Can't remember
Gandalf_the_White: I can't remember the book, but was Frodo chosen to carry it because of Bilbo, or for no reason at all? Before he volunteered that is
But Smeagol isn't a hobbit. He's of a race that were kinda related to hobbits
It was like, here's Frodo and Bilbo, able to resist
Smeagol is a Sook
04So yeah...I think it's just individual hobbits are good with it
Bronysith: You mean Sashimi. Sushi is vinegared rice with a topping-- not always id that topping seafood.
sam don't give a damn :O
Just out of intreast, did this only start 13 mins ago?
And Smeagol just WHAM! Instant corruption!
Brovakiin: Kinda. We had some technical difficulties again.
Not to mention isildur
most beings are insant corruption when faced with the power of the ring
*interest
Brovakiin: You didn't miss anything, really.
Hobbits just naturally arn't easily corrupted. They're very easy going
silly
MrBen: Ok cheers
Sam is best hobbit. :<
Sam is the element of share the load.
yeah sam is a true hero
the journey home.....
1,11That look...
hopeful sam lookk
hi there
04Sam is the very definition of friend
like a boss
TheMaster, corruption isn't uniform. Corruption in someone who is easygoing can take a much different form than becoming an omnicidal maniac.
when is the movie goin to start?
hai Br0nyxia
for some reason i can imagine smeagol with a rocking moustache
BrOnyxia, refresh

How freakin' old are you, Treebeard?

Hi Michael! Diong fine?
04I'm pretty sure Treebeard is much, much older than any wizard
inb4 trololololol song
alexxm: Compared to Treebeard, I suppose. =P
You know shit's old when the TREE refers to GANDALF as YOUNG.

04LOL at that trivia
10/10 perfect style, execution, and nailed the landing!
xD
Dunk.
11,01He's not getting up from that.
1,11scene (pacing and time constraints), but in his opinion, none of them justified omitting such an important narrative element.
aww
Dunking time
11,01I do agree that this should have been in the theatrical release.
I remember him being mad about it, and I remember being puzzled it was gone
Now he's got a dandy new bowling ball!
it was--important
actually Saruman is probably fine. considering Gandalf returned to the undying lands when he died Saruman probably did the same.
Well if you think about it, leaving that part out is extremely foolish.
Notice how the orb was in the water?
Whiterun
He drops it when he dies, so it makes sense.
/me slaps PaladinDrakkenwolf
my theme
have you guys ever watch im a banana by onision on youtube? its funny LOL
it's the same style ondeed
/me starts slap fight with Bronysith
Except....in the theatrical release, that scene never happens, so the orb is just in the water FOR NO REASON
which conlcudes: rohirim are nord
I believe they should have kept Saruman's death scene in, especially since they cut out Saruman's invasion and defeat at the Shire anyway
/me girl slaps PaladinDrakkenwolf
So it's actually a bit of a plothole.
/me remember the fallen!
/me backhands Bronysith
Gimli: Lee is awesome
well in the books grima just throws the seeing stone instead of backstab saruman
A minor one, but one that was easily avoided if they hadn't made the mistake of cutting that scene.

11,01Morning Shizuka
GAME OVER

Love at first sight.
hi Shizuka
\(^^\) (/^^)/
hai Shizuka
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Billy Boyd (Pippin) sang and composed the tune for the song in Denethor's hall, which is a J.R.R. Tolkien lyric.
04Yarrr!
hi Shizuka
aye
Hello Shizuka :)
Howdy Shizuka! I love thee!
I knew that one Gimli
hai Shizuka
Hello Shizuka
I loved that they actually used the lyrics from the book. =)
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Billy Boyd's singing scene largely came about because Philippa Boyens went for a night out at a karaoke bar with the younger male cast members and she was very struck by the quality of his voice. Remembering that Denethor asks Pippin to sing him a song when Faramir heads off to war, she resurrected the lyrics from the novel and Boyd himself came up with the tune
'Allo Shizuka!
04That Frodo is alive
1,11for it.
Hobits are the very essence of old-style English Country Life. Apparently peopl still DO that in smaller villages to this day.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum is missing his left ear lobe. This is due to an air trap in the casting that was made for Peter Jackson's approval of the figure. When looking at the casting, the design team concluded that it should stay that way since it looked like a battle wound that might have occurred during Gollum's past adventures.
Frodo is going to love and tolerate the crap out of Golem.
also ungoliant ate the tree which created all light in middle earth.
lol
FAT HOBBIT
/me 11,01puts Bjornfot in a dress and gives him a makeover
Is there a Youtube video that lists every use of the word precious in all 3 movies, like every time the word pony is used in every episode of FiM?
A villian! :O
Ungoliant was so terrifying that morgoth (satan) had to defend himself when ungoliant tried to eat him.
04Frodo is like one of the bronies that refuse to see how bad some people can be and continues to love, love, love them in spite of being used
A-Am I pretty now, uguu?
^
Kandarihu that would be funny
that sounds like a good drinking game, shot for everytime he says precious, or hobbit.
Very apt comparison there.

That was helluva party

I'm not sure if it's that they're dumb. Their minds are preoccupied elsewhere. They have more important thoughts on their minds than the dignity that they're being given or deprived of by the publishers of the game they play.

Take a shot whenever Pippin does something stupid.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/507/
Meanwhile: :D
/me digs out the mags and sells them to Rohan
Love and tolerate him Gandalf!
Meanwhile: Pippin and Merry both. =P
Meanwhile: That would require constant drinking :3
>implying i'm not totally swaggy in a dress
gandalf is like a wise brony
a treee
Gondor what type of mags?
hm
EVERYTHING O_O
he saw a dead fluttershy?!
do u see fluttershy?!
Noooo
:s
^
Merry rarely does anything stupid. So, Pippin has to take up the slack.
not even watching the movie, just bored and slightly sleep deprived
I saw him!
His mind was besieged by G3.6 Scootaloo, and her many ways of playing.
She ded? :'(
Anyone here know when next Planet Side 2 beta is airing?
TrustWorthy: Nah, he's more of a really good Admin.
An honest fool
true, he knows when to act and when not to.
TrustWorthy: Then his reaction is totally understandable
And when to ban (Balrog) and not to ban (Pippin)
Isn't Treebeard the oldest living thing on Middle Earth?
Galadriel might be older
xD
1,11inb4 Where was Gondor
"Besides, we don't know where Gondor is."
inb4 inb4
ready for whar
He just blocked The Balrog , he didnt ban him
TrustWorthy: I think Tom Bombadil might be older
:)
Where was Gondor when inb4 Where was Gondor?
know what would sound really good? a remix between "Love Is In Bloom" and "Let It Grow (Celebrate the World) from The Lorax movie
Where was Gondor when they owed Gondor
Ha!
dog
I Treebeard did call Gandol Young :P
Where was Gondor when people starting spewing overused jokes?
Gandalf is a master chessmaster.
When was Gondor, where there was no Gondor?
buh... I'm right here...
I mean *
the worst
anyone here got a good steam skin?
Where was Gondor when the meme where was Gondor was made?
MaxTheBrony, I have steam skins of each of the Mane 6
Their taking the hobbits to isengard
Major: that was bad and you should feel bad
Welp, he's doomed.
Where was Gondor when I took an arrow in the knee
lol isengard
Kandarihu they are so very Bright tho
hooowrse
In Gandalf_the_White's closet
Bronysith: LOL nope :3
Kandarihu if i think its the same your talking about
Nittany_Discord: you want some second breakfast?
MaxTheBrony, indeed. And the special font makes the text on most of them hard to read.
a hobbit smoking too much?
MADNESS!
Pippin is now a decoy. Wait. That makes him USEFUL.
A friend never lets a friend quest not-high.
Smoke weed everyday
Merry and Pippin are always useful
Kandarihu Thats a shame :s
That horse is soo preettyy
TrustWorthy: It's like Dwarf drinking too much
He finishesd an entire barrel already?
MegaMoonShine: :snoop: :snoop:
go my horse......
exactly!
impossibru
And then Gandalf rides off on his rocket horse
gandalf is riding celestia in earth pony form
I just got here what did i miss?
not my friend!
Vivix: It has the same color scheme as Surprise. :3
quick aragon! to the wizard mobile!
pikoRing: Ah yeaah-
so Mary troll'd him eh?
Best bromance. :')
I've always liked white horses with black skin, white horses with pink skin tend to look scary-
Not much Azuredragon, just watchin' some lotr
never seen the lorax
not even read it
suddenly: Elves
dem white horses
When I read lotr I was a kid, and I just didn't get why the elves were leaving
Oprah Winfrey photobomb.
so whats up with the elves running away?
I think I'd get it now--I guess?
Awww yeah , the servers are up on Planetside2 !
:D
inb4 sexy cry?
elves always use white horses
o_O
because they'd already been on middle earth for a very long time.
04A stray child is on the loose. Quick! Catch him!
the end of the third age becomes the age of man in the 4th.
It paused for a moment
Gandalf_the_White: what shall we do with him?!
Gandalf_the_White: Call the Marauder Shields!
have to go sit with the dog, it's storming
TheMaster: so they're leaving to make way?
Simply, it's time for themto go.
I wub Liv Tyler!
and the entire time elves were on middle earth they were getting rocked by Morgoth and all sorts of unpleasant things.
Aah-
Where was Gondor when a child was stray
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Horses owned by the production company were placed up for auction to the cast and crew after the film was shot. Viggo Mortensen purchased two horses, the one he rode for most of the film, and one for Liv Tyler's riding double.
yeah sort of. also elves don't really die and go on to a 'good' place, its more like they would fade away
Manly Tears...
11,01Bronysith: Second breakfast?
lol
Major: That would make her a lesbian.
Gimli: Aw thats good of them
so the elves are heading back to valinor. Middle Earth ended up being a pretty crappy time for all the elves.
watch the movie with the dog :p
played a part in a moving, get a horse
Lesbian Carwash.
Nittany_Discord: you know 2nd breakfast
She cries because he reminds her of original ME3 endings
04"Fuck the status quo! I have to be in this film more!"
"Screw this. I'm going back."
pikoRing: I have NO problem with that x3
1,11lol, Gandalf_The_White
That was fast...
Matrix
11,01Bronysith: I'm stupid. Sorry.
Wow, chat is actually slow for once?
"Why are we whispering?" "I don't know."
Nittany_Discord: No you are not :(
its the moment!
pikoRing, during a movie, no less.
1,11CriticKitten: It's dramatic. Don't question it.
in middle earth and lord of the rings being an elf isn't really a race
forgery of maste swords stunt double
alexxm: That's....a good question, actually.
you can choose to not be an elf
ok. if mlp was in the starwars universe who would be the emperior and who would be vadar?
Dat Daedric Armor.
bah now I really can't wait for the Hobbit!
as elronds brother did.
pony pony everypony
and this is what the problem with arwen is. she can marry aragon and stop being an elf and die.
Aah-
04Why can't I hold
wait I'm still confused in the books, doesn't it say that Treebeard is the oldest living thing?
04all these books?
/me dusts Nittany_Discord and hugs him <3
My god. She dropped a book!
ohai everypony
HOD DAMMIT what did i miss?
where was Gondor when I couldn't hold books!
1,11NOT THE BOOK!!!!
epic book drop
well Treebeard is pretty old. theres only one or two things that might be older.
and now...........saxy times
hai IshPonyPony
o.0
It was horrible! Worst story ever!
/me hands are cold
ohai regulars
ERMAHGERD I DRAP MER BERK
Galadriel might be older, and maybe a few of the gods. though treebeard's been on middle earth the whole time.
cratorkid: Only 47 minutes, not much in light of an entire LOTR movie.
regulars?
hai Ish
TheMaster: What about Tom Bombadil?
Deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaad.
have you proposed to your loved one yet?
do not say dead MEan- dammit
DAT SWORD
Tom Bombadil isn't really mortal. he's probably Eru (god)
Either way Treebeard is best tree
NullRadix NO!
Smithing increased
I dun geddit
grandfather of Fluttershy!
We can remake it! We have the technology!
Why is she ded now
pikoRing: yea , just this was the one i wanted to see most , considering i forgot this one , and dont own this one
Reforging the Master Sword!
04Who the hell is Tom Bombadil?
cuz she ded
TheMaster: oh, right
epic sword
Read the book!
pikoRing, WE HAVE FIRE
THE 5 MILLION DOLLAR SWORD!
that sword is special the smiting lvl is over 9000!
/me smacks Gandalf_the_White
You cannot afford mah diamond sword!
Gandalf_the_White: Who?
:|
Yeah but why is she dying right now
Wouldn't it just be easier to forge a similar sword? The reforged broken blade would not be nearly as strong as a brand new one of high quality.
...and the stream froze on my end
Never
And that's it
more epicness <3
Wait, there it goes
unlike in most d&d being an elf is not being a race.
04I'm serious...
Ever
Tom bombadil was never added to the fil as he added nothing really to the plot
Ever
GONDOR
1,11Dumblewhore: She's not dead. She's lost the Light of the Elves, basically meaning she's mortal now.
Gandalf_the_White: It's Tolkien's mary sue, Tom Bombadil is a man they meet in the forest at the start of the book, he can handle the ring wihtout going invisible or being affected
Dumblewhore: she doesnt go with the other elve to wherever and stays on earth. now she becomes mortal
Elrond was being dramatic and metaphorical
00,10I found gondor
Where was Gondor when they passed into the realm of Gondor?
DAT CITY
emergawd gurndurr
00,10it was where we left it all along
its only a model
04Ah, thanks Vivix
dat hill
The stream keeps derping on my end
BEHOLD! GONDOR!
Gandalf_The_White: Tom Bombadil was a dude who appeared in the first book. He was an awesome character, but didn't contribute anything to the plot, so he was left out of the movies
Giving up eternal life is ONE hell of a way to defy daddy
Suddenly, Canterlot
"How can you tell, Gandalf?" "Didn't you see the 'Welcome to Gondor' sign we just passed?"
Canterloot
best city is gondor!
its onyl a model
Tom Bombadil isn't a mary sue silly.
Kiinda!
he's probably just god
/me 11,01hugs Major
1,11PaladinDrakkenwolf: Shh.
PaladinDrakkenwolf: SHH!
He just appears with godpowers and tolkienish antics, then vanishes
Hi Major
Let's not go here, 'tis a silly place
11,01Hi IshPonyPony
Sumica: On the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONA
you know Faust made Canterlot to be like the little girl equivilent of Gondor?
?
Dat castle, CGI or minature?
Yes I did
TheMaster: Tom Bombadil was immune to the ring. =P
miniature
probably miniature
someone actually built that shit in minecraft
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Minas Tirith set was built on the same site as Helm's Deep, after the Helm's Deep scenes had been shot and pieces of Helm's Deep were altered and built on top and around the existing pieces for the Minas Tirith set.
Oh, THERE'S Gondor. NOW we know where it was. SO enough for THAT Meme!
drocsiD_ynattiN Hi
damn thats high up
right. and tolkein said the only being that couldn't be affected by the ring was Eru (God who created life)
cratorkid: This is the first time I've watched this movie, and I came in 30 minutes late. All that happened was Sauroman was killed by his minion, he dropped the orb, pippin obtained it and was almost possessed by Sauron; Smeagol goes crazy, plotting to kill Frodo and Sam, but Sam tries to stop it, and Frodo intervenes again. That's kind of it.
*iH
Dark_Horst: Someone build an ENTIRE Middle-Earth in Minecraft...
TheMaster: He put the ring on and was like "heh, cool ring" and gives it right back.
imagine handgliding from the top
Fluttershy!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Minas Tirith and the surrounding area are actually a combination of several locations. The seventh tier was a back lot set at Three Foot Six Studios. The other streets were a maze-like set built at the same rock quarry where the Hornburg (Helm's Deep) was shot. Pelennor Fields was a large open field in Twizel. Osgiliath was another back lot set. The full cities of
1,11Osgiliath and Minas Tirith were built as models. The surrounding mountain ranges were a digital composite of photographs taken of several mountain ranges in New Zealand.
TheMaster: soo Eru might have been Tom Bombadil?
i'd like to see ezio climb that building
white fluttershy!
and Frodo is love and tolerating the shit out of Smeagol
hehehe
He is a Stewart....John Stewart.
pikoRing: thnx , thats alot in 20 min
04Better yet, just stay the fuck quiet
Dark_Horst: Well, maybe not entire, nut the place's known from the movies
well nobody knows since Tolkein is vague about it
Nittany_Discord: how you been buddy? :(
yeah-
"In fact, it's better if you just STFU."
1,11"Just don't fucking talk. Got it?"
Well, Tom Bombadil was cool, and weird as heck
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: think i heard of that server
:p
quiet I shall be then.
He knows...
00,10is he asleep
/me nomz the IRA
:P
Denethor is a dick
dat horn
cratorkid: Well according to the mods, most of that would have been cut from the theatrical release anyway, so for the most part it's not super important.
Explain this shit!
Oh Shiz!
lol you have fucked up now!
It broke :(
/me throws a boot at Sumica
denethor is sad :(
:(
"Ho boy."
Nope, that's not why we're here
GTFO
Major are you part of the IRA?
:'(
Boromir was a dick anyway. =P
yay?
I guess he isn't feeling very *puts on sunglasses* horny
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Denethor (John Noble) carried a sword strapped to his belt. Although he never draws it, the prop department made a full sword that could be drawn from its sheath, so that Noble would feel as important as the rest of the cast which used their swords.
Gold_Demona: NO.
wrong yay
gandolf: what the fuck man?
Gimli: hehe- that's cute and cool at the same time
poor John Noble
11,01Major: Life's still shitty. Anxiety disorder still preventing me from working. Nothing new.
pikoRing, the stuff that was cut from the theatrical release were still important. That's why we're not watching the theatrical/
gandalf "oh my god...."
lag :C
CCCP: no but I wish, now dont talk about it or we'll get in trouble
Where was Gondor when Pippin just tries so hard.
Major O_o
"Get up, you idiot."
04Dammit, Pippin, stop acting like a hero. That's my job
War was beginning
My stream keeps skipping.
11,01:p
1,11He uses that staff like a pimp cane. XD
And then he talked
its been a while since I was here..How is everypony?
He TALKEd and now he is some one servant
How can you fuck up that bad!?
Gimli: :D
Where was Gondor when where were Gondor's army
Mithrandir! Now I remember his real name
Kandarihu: Right, right. I'm just trying to shed some positive light for those who missed those parts.
Getting some skipping.
denethor is best shield :D
Denethor is worst leader
Someones jimmies are rustled
Nittany_Discord: aye, going through some crap meself, havent eaten in a few days and and Im stuck with me baby sister
In 2A 2505: War was beginning
bbl
title drop
MINE!
MINE
Authority is not given to you to deny the title drop, Steward!
lol he isn't very intimidating.
1,11That title drop
^
^^
raar
11,01Major: At least you have work.
Black cloak vs. white cloak.
lol it's magneto
1,11Dramatic flowing cape
Woah, that's some view
Fluttershy has the best view.
Nittany_Discord: I dont have a job :S
11,01Oh.
Those guards must be bored as hell.
Nittany_Discord: Dont worry its not that I cant find one, im just too young to get one
They are like Buckingham guards
11,01Mom only wants to suggest food services jobs for me, which are probably the last thing I can handle.
You think they play I Spy when no one's around?
Fluttershy's grand-grand-grand-etc. dad
being a guard is so boring on minas tirith
>_>
and canterlot
^
11,01At least you're young. Anxiety disorder doesn't seem to be a valid excuse for nonemployment.
Oh cool, new emoticons!
Even without an intermission.
11,01At least with people I know.
I'm surprised that there isn't like a town guard kind of thing in Equestria
You've violated the law
04Stupid ass humans can't put aside their own greed for their future generations. *smacks the world of man*
xD
Nittany_Discord: well I too have an anxiety problem and I hope that wont effect my future dream job :S
Surely Gandalf is a man.
Gandalf life imitating art then?
MegaMoonShine: What new emoticons? >_><_<
Dun dun duuuuuun
Just he knows how to use magic
thats a bad world of man!!!
:O
Gandalf isn't human.
He's like 800 years old?
Gondor Calls For Aid!
Gandalf is like an angel or something.
send chuck norris riding celestia and luna chaiot
Gandalf's like some kind of god
we are not in decent places....
What, and wizards aren't human?
Tea time is important for any adventure
"so were in 4chan then...?"
"We're, not, IN, decent, places...."
He's not human, no idea what he is
Hey, I for one only want my children to have a bleak future, because as an avid player of the Fallout series I know how fun it can be, Gandalf_The_White!
dari: Gandalf is literally not of the human species.
Gandalf's technically some manner of ascended being.
In this world Wizards are not human.
1,11I'm freaking out, Sam. I'm freaking out.
They're their own race
11,01NullRadix: It was dishwashing. I almost took a diswashing job back in PA, but I wrongfully thought that they would make me wait tables. When I went for the interview, I started having an anxiety attack and blew the interview.
bros befor rings
So why are there only two wizards in the world.
1,11That chapter title drop..
orcs theritory
04Didn't Saruman say "the five wizard staffs?"
04So then there's five wizards?
Why is everything about the world of men and elves.
Dat beartrap head
or were five wizards
dat ruins
4 wizard staffs now.
Where the fuck are these wizards
Gandalf_The_White: Yeah, there are only a handful of them at any given time
Wizards are dying out or something?
And all the dwarves
woah!
That other staff was destroyed.
04Well
dead probably
Ages since I read the appendix or anything
1,11Gandalf_the_white: I don't know much about the Lord of the Rings lore...
11,01Now I can apply for a 6-hour a day job at a grocery store. Easy work. Still so anxious, I'm afraid to fill the application out.
the dwarfes fight up in the north
11,01Fuck my life.
Nittany, just do it
Dumblewhore: Dwarves are in the north, fighting the Witchking
a jobs a job nittany
The other three wizards are Rhadaghast, Pallando and Allatar.
04I would imagine one wizard went to the FiM universe to give counsel and protection over Equestria, one went to Hogwarts to help teach the newer generations...dunno about the last wizard
Nittany_Discord: It will be alright, I say go for it, its better to try and to fail than not to try at all :(
11,01I'd rather have cancer than an anxiety disorder.
elves are in the north east fighting in mirkwood
Congratulations, you've now multiclassed into fighter. Deal with it.
1,11Gandalf is tripping.
anyhow I'm off for now, ya
ya'll take care
Gandalf: He's stuck in Xanth.
I wonder if your anxiety disorder can count as a disability.
/me smokes pipe-weed
Cya TrustWorthy :)
bye trust
PitViper: nothing wrong with a level or 4 of fighter... lets you get weapon specialization
oh Arthena you are here?
I have anxiety as a temporary disabillity
Yes
or was it 3...
04In other words, it's the calm before the storm, brah
but I live in a different country, other systems
The calm before the storm. The banana before the split.
it's not quiet >_>
04Just a fool's hope
Always darkest before dawn
there's always hope!
tried finding your name earlier... couldn't find it
CriticKitten: The banana before the split? That's a new one.
well, here I am
Enemy: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
MrBen: I just made that one up. :D
Our enemies bodies are ready.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The entire running time for theatrical release for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is approximately 8 hours and 37 minutes, from start to finish. It is considerably longer for the Extended versions.
CriticKitten: Nice! Gotta remember that one.
It's the end of Gondor as we know, and I feel fine.
so elephants are the orcs mounts
know it*
I have the extended version of this on DVD
oh shi
the oliphants are the mounts of the men from harad
The white wizard who fires white magic out of his long hard white staff.
howdy bronies
not orcs
It would, but Gandalf never fucking uses magic.
Behold, the Witchking
^
MegaMoonShine!
Hi Thunder-Crescent! I love you!
howdy Thunder-Crescent :)
Witchking has my fav weapon ever: the bucking huge flail
Gimli: Yeah, the extension version full run time is like...what, 13 hours?
Nazgûl!
Gandalf doesn't use magic because he's not meant to directly interfere int he affairs of men
nice to meet you too
dat stab
TrustWorthy: Yep, that's actually pretty badass
The Witch King of Ackbar
:D
04Remember that guy? Yeah, he's gonna level up and shit
hai Thunder-Crescent
it is the best damn weapon in this movie
If you can't kill the riders.
howdy
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Scenes were re-shot with the Witch King because his helmet was too similar to Sauron's in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Peter Jackson was concerned that audiences would confuse the two.
the big flail of doom
Dem glowy walls
Why not just send them into a huge army of 10,000 people
11,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: That's all rhetortic to me. I've worked one job, so I wouldn't know by experience.
To kill everyone
Hey, I don't mind that the LOTR movies are so long! It's usually quality or quantity, and thankfully this movie has the best of the both.
Dumblewhore: <,<
"Only place left full of enemies. Let's storm the castle!!"
Dumblewhore: because logic
Gandalf could break out his awesome god powers but that would mean it wasn't men beating Sauron
just send spik he could kick a nazgrels ass all he nneds is a bith day present
Quit gawping at the gargoyle and move you dingbat.
them some steep stairs!
seems legit
The army! It comes! :O
i think whoever built those stairs took some bad measurements
pikoRing: this is because this movie have a lot of oscars :D
Besides, Dumblewhore, it wouldn't work. He's the Witch King of Ackbar. He recognizes when it's a trap.
RUN AWAY
frostmourne calls..
It's the emerald palace where Wizard of Oz lives!
the Maia on middle earth basically have to respect an arms control treaty that they won't directly go all out. Gandalf only shows a hint of his powers when facing other Maia
Thiis Creeped me out soo muuuch
1,11Still not as bad as those huge staircases in China...
ie. the balrog
04Speaking of China
its a trap with cake in it!
:O
04I really, really want Sleeping Dogs now

Kinda looks like he's got an ion cannon
EBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB
We're doomed

Holy Witchking, Batman!

http://ponybot.net/pix/904.png
I want one.
This sound was one of the soundmens wife when she was sick, right?
dat army
Sounds like a 13 year olds voice cracking
04The great shitstorm of our time
Frodo's chest = my ears
He just sang Friday :D
XD
in other words: incoming shitstorm
:$ lo
hup two hup two
nah that sounded too good to be Friday
So, if the orcs can smell manflesh from far away as indicated in Two Towers, why can't they smell the halflings right now?
damn they so close
04"Oh, don't mind us. Just gonna raze up some villages"
back :)
how the fuck do ORCS manage to march in order?
hehe
Where was Gondor when we needed a nuke?
because if they caught sam and frodo then that'd be the end of the story
^
So basically plothole?
dirty feet is importnat man
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Did the Heavens have mexican for dinner, because I sense a shitstorm!
04Sounds like a plothole
But they arent men, and tehres too many smells around, or something?
Probably because all they can smell at the moment is each other.
haha lol
hobbits do not smell like men?
pikoRing: oh dear:D
and yeah, maybe orcs dont' know what hobbits smell like
Climb the 7000 steps to High Hrothgar!
Which was the case in Two Towers as well.
watchout, we got a badass over here
They were in a big group there too, remember?
sam always is watching you
Besides, it was the Uruk-hai that identified the smell of men out in the open in a field with the wind blowing.
Maybe by "the flesh" they meant blood/bloody flesh. Maybe orcs are like sharks in this case?
[20:05] <CriticKitten> So, if the orcs can smell manflesh from far away as indicated in Two Towers, why can't they smell the halflings right now? | They can't smell anything over half a million other orcs
nothin <_<
Have you ever smelt half a million orcs?
so wait, who the hell made those stairs?
If Orcs have the ability to smell manflesh from miles away, can they smell why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
Can't smell good
hehe
Smells like ass.
Just came back from dinner, is Faramir dead yet?
Mixed with mud.
Smells like feet wrapped in leathery burnt bacon.
that pass was created by gondor
it was a city meant to watch over mordor and eventually was taken over by sauron and his forces.
wonder how long that took 'em
And yet they smelled the humans from a very long distance off while in a large group of several hundred in Two Towers.
Smells like tourists delight
smells like france
hobbits smell different then humans. there, thats the reason
^
Yeah, not buying the "couldn't smell them" excuse given the context of the last movie. :P
Stalker reference no one understands :P
and orcs dont' know what hobbits smell like because they'd never met them
Hobbits smell like pipe-weed:P
11,01Kandarihu: Blood cereal for Sauron?
Why do they have torches lit.
and shrooms
hobbits aren't men
Bloody-O's?
Meanwhile: BECAUSE THEY'RE SO INVISIBLE
;p
CriticKitten: Fine, they were out in the open air before
ninja orcs!
Lots more air circulation, fresh air
Dem sneaky orcs
also the hobbits were probably downwind
Stealth boats!
or upwing, whichever hides your scent
There they were in some witchking's death lair
+the elvish capes
this is a pretty good scene
NINJA!
Oh noes!
the orcs are smart
:)
Which probably smells like death.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: On the Extended DVD extras, Peter Jackson explains that the head of Gothmog, the Leader of the Orcs during the Siege of Gondor, was partly derived from the head of Joseph Merrick, also known as the Elephant Man.
And is in a cave
And have no fresh air
Good job, idiots, you just alerted the humans that you were coming
Who knows what those longears put in them?
all the troops
They alerted the horde!
Where was Gondor when Gothmog?
CriticKitten: The horde has alerted the hor--wait, hold up.
I miss a good Lotr game :)
Row row row your boat quickly down the river! quickly, quickly quickly, Slaughter all the humans.

So much stealth omigawd D:
Now jump!
well shit
those are some bad guards
oops
Oh fudge.

Burn baby burn!
dafuq?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the lighting of the beacons sequence, one beacon was helicopter up to the top of a mountain and then lit. The rest were all computer generated.
Now jump into a bale of hay!
They are like , OH shieeeet.
And they don't bother checking to see who lit the beacon

You know, this doesn't seem like a very efficient way to send for aid
dem lights just got 20% cooler
<3 this scene
What if one of the beacons gets wet?
Must suck living on the mountain
One of the most impressive shots in movie
Waiting to light it
1,11CriticKitten: What would you do otherwise?
Nittany_Discord, the trivia
*s
Emergency hair drier
Must have been really hard to set this up at first
CriticKitten: It actually is very efficient, it was also used several times in real life
We build it all uuuuuup, to burn it down! We can't wait to burn it to the ground!
How is everybody? :3
CriticKitten: they have oil with the beacons
If neither gondor nor Rohan gave a fuq about the old alliance, why did they still have the old beacons maned and stocked with tinder?
CriticKitten: its a way more better way than going that distance yourselves :)
Wet wood still burn when set right
I am great gilded
hai Gilded
Nittany_Discord: forget that, what about staying up there for days waiting for something like that?
11,01Kandarihu: That's how they did it in the movie.
Gimli: Uh, how about ride a horse there, like Gandalf did to get there in the first place? :P
Hello Gilded, I'm great :)
light travels faster than a horse
Gilded: Hmm would that be you gildash? or are you someone totally different:D
That would take several days. The beacons are much quicker.
pee pressue
Trope Namer!
Heya Gilded im good :)
light beacons aren't fiction
YAY!
peer*
/me answers the call for aid by Gondor
Nittany_Discord, well, I don't think this is a regular occurance.
Dat dramatic pause
Gilded: HI :3
rooohan fuck yeah
da rohirrim!
Where are the tribe when you need them
Nope, someone totally different :P I always get confused for different people in chats
EPICNESS!!!
ROHAN! Fuck yeah!
1,11CriticKitten: The horse ride takes three days. So that would be 6 days to get people there. The lighting probably takes about a few hours at most, so that's half the time.
Sucks to be from Rohan
The beacons are only faster if you have people staffed to watch for them 24/7.
Gilded smells!
and you guys had better be good considering what we're watching :o
and War
bro down right now TrustWorthy
Dumblewhore: why?
One huge war
CriticKitten: wich they do, and had back in the day
Then another
No one ever understands my stalker references D':
orly?
/me brohoofs Gilded violently!
Straight after
Gimli: And yet it takes them weeks in movie time to get the people there anyways, so that time barely makes any difference
/me noms on Trust's ear
Well, it's the same war, just multiple battles in the war.
By the way is this movie Bought or are we all here being acomplices to piracy :3 ( Jk ^^)
CriticKitten: imagine if it took even one more week, disaster
Theoden's got Merry's sword
Dat Esquire!
i own this movie so its okay for me to watch it
Vivix: According to who? When were these used? :P
Gimli: shadowfax

That was Pippin, was it?
the final battle for middle-earth!
I can never tell the two apart. >_<
Pippin is in gondor
Rohirrims assemble!
merry stayed with aragon
Ahhhh.
CriticKitten: The Chinese used similar beacons to send messages from the borders of their country. The Romans may also have used similar methods at Hadrian's Wall.
Technically no, Theoden, the doom of your kind will be decided in front of Mordor
xD Rohan is the brony nation :3
/me for me
Okay, so I was right from the start.
they need to quit *puts on sun glasses* horsing around
White horses in front. Totally not biased.
yeahhhhhhhh
CriticKitten: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon

Short article, not very good article, but has some info on it
that orc must've had a zergling in his family
HA an orc had a arrow in the knee
I'm in ur Gondor, killin ur doodz
Beacons are a fast way to send warning VERY far, relatively fast compared to pidgeon and messengers, of course you can't send A message, just a warning
Vivix: I like how it says "potentially conspicuous", is it ever supposed to not be secretive?
Whoops, sorry. D:
nazgul!
Osgiliath reminds me of Stalingrad somehow...
Hehe pikoRing I hope not
Vivix: Smoke signals are for messages
I love dem Hooded knights

NullRadix: yeah
They use such good music in lotr
Vivix: I mean "intentionally conspicuous".
Oh, yeah

CrimsonPhoenix: I loved Tiny Toons!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Steps of Cirith Ungol were crafted out of polystyrene, and proved a difficult set for Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, and Andy Serkis to film on. The steps were so steep and fragile that they sometimes broke, and because the steps were sprayed down with water, Sean Astin and Elijah Wood sometimes got their Hobbit feet stuck to the steps and had to be pulled off.

CriticKitten yes
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to the cast commentary, although Lawrence Makoare was the person in the Witch-King's costume, his voice was later performed by Andy Serkis (also playing Gollum).
You know, Frodo is like your average Pokemon protagonist, doesn't say a word, just keeps going.
Giggity Witch king

BrOnyxia: We are doing maintenance, will be back soon.

also he's like 87 years old
<_<>_>
hai Slenderman
Sundaysmile: :D
yeah isnt Aragon like half Elf or something....
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Aragorn speaks to Eowyn before departing on the Paths of the Dead. In the book, this is actually the first time these two characters speaks to each other, and is a much longer scene. The aspects of the scene found their way into earlier exchanges between the characters in both this and the second film, however, to make their relationship more realistic.
Greetings Michael
Once you go Elven, you never go back
maybe she can buy some of those rubber spock ears from the gift shop
Laddy :>
heya Slenderman :)
have you learned nothing from Gondor?
Hello Slenderman :)
Gimli: Good thing too, it really makes the films work better
Hi Slenderman, I love you!

PaladinDrakkenwolf: oh, rght

Slenderman: Those are the best kinds of typos.

"Nope, we can't beat them, but we're going to fight them anyways. Problem, you sissy bitch?"

Who's the tank?
I remember when healing was necromancy
Orlando is best legolas :3

What's the mage?
Tank's AFK

Well, eh. *shrug*

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The final day of filming on the trilogy actually happened over a month after this movie was theatrically released, and three weeks after the 2004 Academy Awards. Peter Jackson arranged to film one final shot of skulls on the floor in the tunnel of the Paths of the Dead, which was included in the Extended Edition of ROTK. He thought it was funny to be doing filming
1,11on a movie that had already won the Best Picture Oscar.

XD
:p
epic army of the dead
...how can you kill something that's already dead?
What, you wanna stay zombies forever?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to a magazine article, Peter Jackson hated the Army of the Dead; he thought it was too unbelievable. He kept it in the script because he did not wish to disappoint diehard fans of the book trilogy.
What say you?
I thought it was a good part of the story, what is Jackson smoking?
MrBen: You can't but you can eternally damn them to be bound to the world and never get pass on
its the first time Aragon gets to act like the King he has to become
Epic laugh is epic
I agree with Jackson on that one
FIGHT FOR ME! FOR US! FOR EQUESTRIA!
but I was pleased to see it in the movie-
In Middle Earth, ghosties giggle at you.
What you say?

Skullalanche

ABBALANCHE
Oh, this bit inthe game was a bitch
^
all the skulls
O: jesus
that's a lot of skulls
whats important is that Aragon is now embracing his role as a king. The army of the dead didn't answer Isildur when he called and so became damned. Aragon is setting right what was wrong.
OH GOD! Somebody used the duplication glitch on Skyrim to make millions of skulls!
:O
Gimli: Hrm, I kinda agree actually. I know it takes place in a fantasy land, but all the same....

So they're catapulting pieces of their own city at the enemy. Wow.

where's the dovahkiin when u need it?
Dark_Horst: They do when you fling them out of a catapult.
those aren't Dragons though
Wilhelm 2
His flashlight ran out of batteries
no wonder they didnt get nominated for acting
Ring Wraiths use Screech -25 to accuracy for all allied units.
this theme
Dark_Horst: With the amount of momentum behind those stones, there is no way they'd land and stop dead like that.
Gimli: I am ponyborn, will that count?
oh don't lag on me now you bastard.
HEAD SHOT THEM!!!
Tower explodes into orcs. Made me lol.
Splat
it's raining men!
CriticKitten: Extremely heavy stones tend to not bounce when fired like that, only if they are going at a really massive speed, which they weren't
PANIC!
Soldiers on rampart should have parachutes for just such an occasion.
kill the trolls
^
CriticKitten: well, some of them rolled and slid. but bouncing would be a little too much

Aww, I want to play it at home Gimli
:P
the hobbit is high!
RETREAT!
Dark_Horst / Vivix: It's got nothing to do with the weight or shape. The sheer momentum of rocks like that would be absurd, too much for the rock to just stop dead.
uhhh!
Gandalfs battle cry XD
The Hater Orcs vs the Fellowship of the Brony
Battle Mage powah!

c'mon you cowardly lil bastard

Pippin uses Hobbit Stab! It is super effective!
Why doesnt he use magic? Like Flames or other?
Use magic, dammit!
CriticKitten: they didnt just stop dead. except one

CriticKitten: It's not getting enoguh momentum to lift itself again because it is going slowly, at a low momentum, and downards
no need for magic
Cast magic silly old prume
gandalf's like dayum boy ya'll got skils
sams first kill
1,11Gandalf the Badass.
Gandalf can't freely use all of his angelic powers.
Throw 500kg stones the same way, they do not bounce
he's suppose to keep his interference to a minimum
MegaMoonShine: Gandalfs magic don't work that way
he's trying to train his hand to hand skill

we passed the two hour mark. no break?
Dumblewhore: the power of plot
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
i hope this anit end
Dark_Horst / Vivix: Except that stones of that size flung at that speed would, in fact, have an incredible amount of momentum in the horizontal direction. More than mere wind resistance could stop. :P

Aragorn uses Troll Army
1,11Gimli is such a troll. XD
Oh, wait
guess
:O WHOA
shoo be doo!
I see dead people.
CriticKitten: It was a trebuchet was it not? look at stone throwing, any more movement than was shown would look really really really weird
Und dann the pirates pissed themselves.
ded army
PREPARE FOR BOREDOM
IT'S A TRAP!
Aragorn like a boss
Someone shoulda rolled Death Knight

:'( sad part
D:
Vivix : i played Warcraft 2 alot i loved that game
lol Sundaysmile
compared to her mom Shelob is actually pretty small and not scary
Dark_Horst / Vivix: Most of the stones stopped dead, with minimal sliding. That's not how it would react to a real life situation. I've studied enough physics to know that for a fact. :p
Orks cum in there!? D:
Maid_RainBow: Yeahh, it was my favourite warcraft- War3 was cool too, but War2 was just great
TheMaster: Who is Shelob's mom?
It's like I said. Trust a shriveled up creature that you've only met for a while rather than your best friend. Wow.:(
Shelob's mom is ungoliant. a cthulhu spider that ate light itself
pikoRing: shit
CriticKitten: then you should know that when heavy stones dig down from THAT trajectory, they would barely slide or roll at all
ewww
Vivix : yeah loved warcraft 2 more
the INTERNET
Gold_Demona Ungoliant is Shelob's mom.
this is gollums porn room
Ungoliant ate the tree of light which created the sun and the moon. She made Satan himself scared of being eaten.
Molestias cave of EVIL
CriticKitten: it's a fantasy movie not real life, does that explain why they dont bounce?
Vivix: That presumes the ground is soft enough for them to dig down firmly. :p
He is gonna get so much frostbite venom
INB4 Spider.
Is she in the Silmerillian or something? Cuz I don't remember an Ungoliant...
1,11Aragog is Shelob's mom. :P
Viewers with arachnophobia are allowed to close their eyes now
Due to the enviroment Frodo gains -25 hope -20 bravery -10 strength
CriticKitten: since it DID, it probably was
Wild Smeagle ran away!
:s dammit school...
remdog: I thought she was just one of those spiders from Mirkwood
alexxm: :D
Yes. Ungoliant was in the Sim
Dovah: No, "it's fantasy" does not excuse bad physics. :P
I thought Aragog was male?
I have arachnophobia, this should be fun
inb4 skyrim monster
Und now you realise Frodo, that you are a stupid asshole.
Obviously Tolkein was copying JRR Tolkein, what a hack
04And now you realize ~you were wroooooooooong~
er
1,11Dumblewhore: ThatsTheJoke.gif
a but too late.
CriticKitten: movie, NOT real life......
CriticKitten: just go outside and throw rocks, study movement and not math and you will see it looks correct
Rowling I meant
Meanwhile: Much too late to save himself too
wouldnt shelob be aragogs mom then
I dun geddit
Shelob gave birth to the mirkwood Spiders. Flootersh41
OUCH
Meanwhile: Not an asshole, just stupid.
1,11...Huh...I just realized this is the second movie series we've watched that includes a giant f**king spider
CriticKitten: physics be damned in a movie
dat gotta hurt
Dat luck
Dovah: Repeat: No, "it's fantasy" does not excuse bad physics. :P
I hate spiders-
owowowowowow
what don't you get dumblewhore?
Gimli: What was the first?
Are we still arguing about the balistic physics of a catapult?
04Poor Sam :(
Vivix: Shouldn't everyone?
BREAD!
Nomnomnom bread
Sam: SABOTAGE!
Fat Hobbit meets gravity. Who will win!
CriticKitten: except it wasn't bad phsyics
beeerrreeaaad.
BREAD MAKES HIM MAD
find bread -> squish it
I love bread
CriticKitten: its plausible.
I dont get people who get insects as pets :S
Sam gains Rage +25 Agility +20 Strength
11,01The spider part.
Like a centiped
MaxTheBrony: I hear ya on that-
:s
twilight_sprinkle: But very unlikely, is my point.
Don't bother doing anything to save your only food supply, Sam.
its scary
ERMAGERD SPERDER!
This is my greatest fear, in a nutshell
just seeing that he has bare feet makes me cringe
Hobbit failed his stealth check
Hello arachnophobia!
CriticKitten: its not That unlikely
elven macguffin activate!
think of all the shit he steps on
CriticKitten: It's not even very unlikely, just--go look at heavy objects falling and being trebuche'd
bad idea
Frodo uses Light of Elhendeil +15 Hope +100 Light
twilight_sprinkle: Trebuchets do not fling items in ONLY the vertical direction, otherwise they would only hit themselves. :p
pile of webs, lay in it
D:
uh oh
Well.... That doesn't really help much.
FUCK YOU SPIDER; I HAVE A LIGHTBULB
11,01I think the fanfic Spiderses was out by this time.
GUGH!
"Right behind you."
CriticKitten: err, no shit?
CriticKitten: Trebuchets fling in a downward direction
Well that helped
IT'S LIMBO ALL OVER AGAIN!
1,11OH FUCK!

11,01Last year.
:O
the light...it's not supereffective
THAT'S their brightest star?
god damn frostbite spiders
AJIsAwesome: I've started playing it recently
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While much of the score to these films was a departure from Howard Shore's usual style, Peter Jackson told him that, to score the Shelob's Lair scene, he should "Go off and pretend you're making another movie for David Cronenberg. This should sound like The Fly!"
It's a bit shit
Vivix: Dude, I built one in high school physics. Projectiles flung from a trebuchet do not stop dead when they land.
Not very bright
This is nightmare fuel for me!
bets on when he drops it...
If they are heavy enough they usually do
she only wants a hug :(
5 secounds?
10?
lol
/me is starting to get wierded out
just hanging around
/me 11,01hugs cratorkid
lol Frodo is running through Stonefang Mines,ya get a muffin if ya know wut thats from lol since the boss is a spider
like a fly
This is my least favourite part-
And Smeagol is fuckin' cynical.
Frodo gets caught in web -100 Agility
sweet song smeagol
Vivix: Not usually, no. The projectile would need to be extremely heavy and the forward momentum would need to be very poor.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo is stuck in Shelob's web, as Gollum taunts him, Elijah Wood was actually suspended on a harness with bungee cords fastened around his wrists and ankles. On the commentary, he jokes that he was "not hanging up by sheer strength of the web".
will he get to gollum first
ragefrodo!
/me feels better because of Nittany_Discord
"Welcome to my parlor" said the spider to the hobbiy
ruuuuuuuuuN!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Peter Jackson is arachnophobic and based the Shelob design on the types of spiders he feared the most.
or will the spider get him'turn up next week for more tales of spiders
Frodo uses Hobbit Rage +25 Strength
CriticKitten: which it would be in the direction it was shown in the movie, would it not? Downward fall rather than distance, soft earth, and massive chunks of wall?
Burn it with fire!
oh no, he forgot sting
Nooooo the sword!!
Abandon the sword. Good thinking dumbass.
frodo engages roid rage mode
How exactly does Gollum expect to recover the ring if Shelob eats Frodo?
shelob isn't going to eat the ring
cut her open?
GODDAMMIT FRODO, JUST KILL HIM!
Shelob is sentient and would want the ring, no?
klilililkllklllilikllillABHSHSHDAH
I got school tomorrow :( Time for me to hit the hay.. Good night bronies :)
I love how crazy Frodo looks-
Night MaxTheBrony :)
You really don't want to know Fl00tersh41
fuck man you gotta feel bad for gollum
Gnyyte MaxTheBrony
Goodnignt MaxTheBrony
Gnight MaxTheBrony
Vivix: Given that these are city-built trebuchets designed to fling stones like that for many hundreds of yards, they would not stop dead. Yes, they gain in the vertical direction because of the height advantage, but that still would not stop them dead. Look at how they landed, they clearly do not dig into the earth.
Night
well the ring gets to choose who it wants to corrupt. because its sort of alive.
bye MaxTheBrony
Later, Max!
poor little bastard is mentally torn
Kill him! Let your hate out, and your journey to the dark side of the force shall be complete!
gn8 Max
CriticKitten: dont forget that they were launched off a higher point than the orcss, so it had a lot of vertical acceleration
MaxTheBrony: Night! :)
Fl00tersh41: Spiders usually tuck their prey in web and save it for later
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis's last day of filming was only a few weeks before the theatrical release. On the carpet of the floor of Peter Jackson's house, they filmed the facial reaction of Smeagol/Gollum when he realizes Frodo intends to destroy the ring. The resulting video was e-mailed to Weta Digital so the animators could replicate the shot with the CGI character.
ragegollum
now gollum engaes roid rage mode
CriticKitten: just look at the footage, I don't see any indication that they should have rolled, it would have looked intensly bizarre movie physics if they did
By Max, I hope you sleep well you lovely little thing.
twilight_sprinkle: Velocity, you mean
THIS IS SPARTA!!!!
Visual quality trump reality
RRRRRRRRRRa
My... PRECIOUSS
CriticKitten: yeah.
ded
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: But she's sentient. The rings corruption would make her want it same as everyone else
"Well, that's the end of him--" "NO
well Gollum is a bit whacked in the head.
I get so many Wander vibes from Frodo for some reasons.
a bit'
Vivix: I did watch the footage. They land, don't dig in, but stop dead. That's not how they work, and I know because I made one myself.
suddenly paradise
Why is Frodo so shit
So maybe he would have been wrong and Shelob would have coveted the ring as well
Fl00tersh41: It still takes some time to get corrupted by ring
Is he an deaded?
well thats a weird way to teleport...
AND YOU FAILED!
Every time he is in trouble he drops all his useful stuff.
His sword
portals?
CriticKitten: It looks natural, and it seems correct from what I have seen from that size of stone falling
Yar. Whoops.
The light
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Shelob is already an evil monster
LOL. Bad MrBen.
his balls
Dumblewhore: Because Samwise is the real hero of this story
CriticKitten: point is that it had much vertical speed so it dug in.
And Frodo's just the muppet with the evil necklace
Dumblewhore: The light wasn't very useful at all.
i thought the spiders name was kankra?
Frodo use Galadriel Memories +20 Determination
Cockblocked
why did frodo get the task of destroying the ring? hes a frickin butterfingers
Sam is best hobbit
The light stopped it from eating him at least
Remember also that when movies do these throw shit scenes they use physics engine to speed things up, rather than animate it
i still can't believe how much i hate the way they made rohan
Dumblewhore: I don't think he's going to encounter another monster so docile around a little sparkle.
CriticKitten: also because the orcs were under the walls, the launched it at a high angle, so again, mostly vertical speed
You'd think that everybody would know that [DATA EXPUNGED]
And no one notices that she's in that camp.
11,02Moo o.o
I would stay and watch pretty horses, but BRB
Fenr: why?
sandwhich
hai SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: hiya
dat SuperBrony64
Fl00tersh41: So? She's evil by herself, not because the Ring's influence
Hello SuperBrony64 :)
twilight_sprinkle: They would dig into the ground a bit, certainly. But if you watch the footage again, they actually didn't dig in at all. That's most likely due to them being CGI, but all the same, it's still not how they'd really land.
he's a hobnob
Hello SuperBrony!
Moo SB.
well...mostly in t2t
/me glomps SuperBrony64
Hi SuperBrony64
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Won't take much influence from the ring to make her it's slave

/me /)(\ SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: Hello!:)
supperborny pls
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Just look at how quickly it got gollum originally
?
twilight_sprinkle: You're thinking of a catapult. Catapults launch at specific angles. Trebuchets....aren't really built to do that.
twilight_sprinkle: They're more of a flinger.
fireballs!
Grond. Grond.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.

I can't play any MVM, all the servers lag like shit
Nittany_Discord: :D
Why doesn't gandalf use magic to kill?
oh look,it's the pyro
Damn, this battle's gone on a long time, it's already night.
I'm back, baby
I'm waiting for my friend to host his own private one
wait,wrong universe once again
Fl00tersh41: I don't think it works that day. I think it depends on how strong one's mind or will is, not if someone's good or evil
just well groomed grass...
CriticKitten: well its plausible that it would dig in instead of rolling or sliding. if it clealry didnt dig in, then idk
Nittany_Discord now who you suppose put the poo on the stick?
*way
well he's mad
>no hope
>at the same time as hope
MLP_Brovakiin: magic doesnt work like that in lotr
I see what you did there
11,01Barbetos: They're trying to break down the door with it.
Wut
Oh
Vivix: Welcome back!:)
Denethor is broken
Thank you!
Wb Vivix
in Battle for Middle Earth 2 I love this fight, but Helms deep is more awesome.
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Why do you assume the giant spider monster has a strong resiliance to mental domination?
Yup. Daddy's gone bye-bye.
Nittany_Discord I do not like the style of their knocking.
Thank you, too, Michael !
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: She''s basically a scavenger who hides in the dark
Necromancy?
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Just like Gollum used to be
wow
Grond is Melkor's mace in the Simarillion
OH SHIT CREEPYFAIC!
No matter what comes through that gate
twilight_sprinkle: I don't deny they can dig in, certainly I'm just saying that the CGI wasn't really animated quite right, since there's no indication of them digging in....which means they should have rolled or bounced to lose the last of their horizontal momentum. I'm guessing they said "screw it" to that because then they'd have to make realistic-looking dig marks in the ground
you will stand your ground
Or not
trolololo
OH SHIT
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
MLP_Brovakiin: most of gandalfs magic is themed around blinding light and seems to be sun based (he's the wielder of the flame of arnor, arnor meaning sun)

And then my stream hung. XD

/me refreshes
The Trollestia army has breached the fortress
CriticKitten: True, and consider that this was not animated by hand, itwas crowd ai and physics engine, as far as I understood, additional animation might have been ignored
DEAUGH!
ladies and gentlemen...this is a qaccurate description of the internet
Dark_Horst: o ok
Fl00tersh41: She's not an usual Spider, she was born from some kind of superatural spider-mother, though it isn't mentioned in movie
Is the stream on? Mine is blank.

O.o I can't get the stream back at all now.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The WETA special effects crew felt very challenged when creating Shelob by how effective the giant spider had been in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

What is it with Frodo and getting poisoned by things?
Fenr: Is spiderman is like a spider, why doesn't he shoot web from his ass?
SUPER SAM!
She has some kinky tastes
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo is stabbed by Shelob's stinger, Elijah Wood was actually stabbed with a prop one. On the Extended DVD Commentary, he and Sean Astin comment that it was not only very, very painful, but had actually done damage to the point that Wood had to stay in the hospital for a couple of days. Astin (on the Commentary track) jokes that they used appendicitis as the
1,11excuse, but wonder if that event is what (ironically) caused Wood's actual episode of appendicitis later on (2003).
Sam uses the Loyal Friend buff +50 to all stats
You spin me right round baby
because he's a superspider
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The first shot of Sam's arm coming into frame holding Sting towards Shelob is actually Peter Jackson's arm
"Leave him alone you BITCH!"
04CAVALRY BITCH
go supersam!
Hehehehe, Oh Jackson
elven macguffin,still not that effective
Congratulations Sam, you're the new Ellen Ripley.
No...It's a white screen with the words, "Your system doesn't support this video file. Click here to get the plugin. :/"
So disgustinnng
You shouldn't stab your actors. That's not cool.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the scene when Frodo gets pierced by Shelob, Elijah Wood had 2 Alka Seltzers hidden under his tongue which he chewed up to create white foam which he then leaked out of the corner of his mouth.
CRIT
Fuck you I'm a gardener, I've killed bigger bugs than you in cabbage patches.

Will there be an intermission soon?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Elijah Wood was wrapped in a latex-like material that represented Shelob's webbing. On the DVD, he jokes that it is like being encased in the world's largest condom.
He ded? :'(
damn he's paler than the moon in june
He's dead Ji-Sam
He must complete Frodo's quest!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Elijah Wood is noted for his ability to stare fixedly in front of him for ages without blinking, which came in very useful for the scenes where the comatose Frodo was wrapped up in Shelob's web-like cocoon.
welp he is ded better take the ring
lol Barbetos

Ohhh my
Orcs incoming

Gimli: I'd say he did a good job.

I'll let you cradle MY one-eyed willie. If you know what I mean.
They diiid take him prisoner, at least
I can't imagine Mordors native hobbit population is very big after all

That refresh didn't do crap.
He's only mostly dead!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: To get the idea of perspective in the scene where Denethor drags and throws out Pippin from the burial chamber, Billy Boyd's double was dragged and rolled out. When the double hit him in the back, he popped up.
Listen to him, you fool:[
It's their job to look out for anyone trying to sneak in

Someone has to do a full battle like this with no CGI
:P
WOOOAAAH!
for Equestria!
20,000 extras
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Battle of Pelennor Fields was filmed on a large field heavily populated with rabbits. The place had to be carefully inspected for rabbit holes, which were all filled in due to the danger they would pose if a horse were to step into one, which could cause a major pile-up, with injuries to both horses and riders.
so many vikings
Dumblewhore you remind me of that old game called lemings or something like it
only a part of rohan army was at helm's deep
So that's how the pings work
not the horses!
Just Edoras, Fl00tersh41
actually,most of it wasnt there
Nooo!
poor william
Gimli: Not to mention the rabbits.
nooo dont fire at Will!
Gimli: Rabbits, the conquerers of armies.
Fucking orcs!
Ouch
Being on the receiving end of that would hurt.
Howard Shore, you magnificent bastard
Scary charge -100 bravery for all orc troops
the orcs have a oh shit face
andn now he realises that you cant stopp a wall of horses with a few opuny arrows
The rabbits are taking cover underground right now
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene of the Rohirrim charging the Pelennor had to be filmed 52 times before the crew were satisfied with the take. During this process, about 60 of the 280 horses participating had to drop out for various reasons.
rohan is god like
my little warhorse
remdog: Then why didn't theoden summon that army to defend edoras?
full speed horse charge. Painful
Or helms deep?
And this is why cavalry charges tend to shred the shit out of foot soldiers
epicness
Brownclown: More like deadly
oh no !!!
Poor horses. :
Can you imagine how easy it would be for any of those horsemen who are NOT in the front lines of the charge?
crazy
i missed the charge :(
that white orc, I had teacher in school who looked like him
WATAH!
11,01Mica
fl00tersh41 he did, but they couldnt get there in time.
/me with loony Larry...
Aren't horses incapable or unwilling of charging anyone? Rather jumping over or going around?
Is he being candied?
oh mai
And back to Denethor's breakdown...
Oh mai
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "oil" that Denethor pours over himself and Faramir was a combination of water and glycerin, to achieve an appropriate glistening effect. Because this soaked the wigs and costumes, this scene had to be filmed in a single take.
He really loves to lube up before... well you know.
Hence why box formation was used against cavalry?
1,11That Oh My
cover ourselves in flamable liquid before playing with fire, good idea there sherlock
Nope, that's oil sorry
because edoras isn't as easy to defend as helm's deep...and he tought a huge part of the army to be lost
gandalf to the rescue
Dat gasoline
stop with that, only do the takei soundbits for bad movies
He utterly mad
while it wasnt
he lives
Kencolt: really? Cool-
http://fav.me/d5bs7qd
Bonk from Gandalf again
I've had stampeding horse running towards me, terrifying- even if I knew she wouldn't hit me
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene when Denethor attempts to burn Faramir on the pyre, the pyre could not truly be on fire because Gandalf's horse would not go near it. To solve this, the crew reflected a real fire onto a pane of glass in front of the camera so that it looks as though the pyre is burning.
11,01Sumi
Gandalf 4 Denethor 0
omg is undertaker
Pippin to the rescue!
fatality
Vivis: Correct. The idea of cavalry charging into solid groups of soldiers is all fiction. Real cavalry charges would either end in the enemy breaking and running at the sight of it, or the cavalry breaking rank and going around the rear and flanks of the enemy.
kill it with fire
zooooom
YAY

Vivix: No problem. :)
/me on the ground an orc was hit by a flaming body...

was that supposed to be funny
Is that a comet?
AJIsAwesome: That's just Faramirs lot in life
Nope!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director of photography Andrew Lesnie caught most of his shots during the intense battle on the Pelennor Fields by putting on polo armor and wading into the thick of the action.
TheMaster: we controll sounds, by saying Mica and..Sumi I think
HO SHET

Why don't you flank them you loony?!

i think i can see why it's not a bright plan
So at the battle of Gondor there was one guy doing this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Polo_players.jpg/220px-Polo_players.jpg
This time it really is "DEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
Theoden uses Reform the Line +10 to all stats for 1 minute
Poor horses ;__;
If you split and went in from the side you'd garotte their advantage
the proble m olifantene is, they will not listen when set on fire or are too damaged
Did I hear a Horse Wilhelm?
dats one linesmasher
The fire nation is attacking!
and how are they suppose to fight these things?
problem with*
use the A-Wings!

Meanwhile: They should have formed a pincer here, to encase them. They are few in number and they could have shredded them from the sides
They need the Hawk men from Flash Gordon.

1,11random movie trivia: The Witch-King's mace was constantly redesigned. Peter Jackson said the original mace was OK but he wanted it bigger. Weta workshop enlarged it, butPeter Jackson wanted it bigger, so they made it bigger. In the end, it was so large and heavy, it had lost practical use for the fight scenes, in which it was replaced by a digital version.
Damn right you piss your pants.
Hey look its Mace Windu
wow
Eowyn vs Witch King! FIGHT!
That mace is....uh
It needed to be about 20% bigger

Poke.
BOOM HEADSHOT
/me nomz CCCP
I thought in the book the real reason they could kill him was some elven sword or something
he imploded
1,11RMT: In the book, Eowyn rides into battle with the Rohirrim, taking Merry with her, but without revealing her identity to them or the audience. Instead, she is disguised as a character who calls himself "Dernhelm," and only reveals herself in the battle when she takes off her helmet to show the Witch-King that she is a woman. In the film, Merry and the audience are always aware that
1,11it is Eowyn. The filmmakers made this change because they felt that, in a visual medium, it would be difficult to conceal her identity, and because not recognizing her would make Merry look like "the stupidest Hobbit on Earth."
how sad
Not because they weren't men?
She opened up a black hole on the battle field
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle
My face! My beautiful face!
He's melting!
11,01Only men with vaginas and ovaries can kill him.
His head imploded
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Lawrence Makoare plays both the Witch King and the orc Gothmog. At one point the two characters exchange dialogue, and later Eowyn fights both (she injures Gothmog, who is then killed trying to attack her, and she kills the Witch King).

Merry is off smoking some more weed for sure
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the Special Extended Edition, the scene in which Pippin is looking for Merry after the battle on Pelennor Fields was digitally altered so that it appears to be night instead of day. According to Peter Jackson on the commentary track, this was done to make it appear that Pippin has been looking for hours instead of minutes, underlining the friendship between
1,11the two Hobbits. In the original edit, because it appears that Pippin has only been looking for a few minutes his reaction to finding Merry seems like he's overreacting.
it's the death aftershock that hit her more

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The movie made a 1408% profit for New Line Studios on their initial outlay.
yeah, and it effects the wearer, and whoever has oppertunity to take it or touch it-
I AM HUNGRY
04Sam didn't pay much attention to the ring because he was going after Frodo so all of his thoughts were on something else
Fenr: All the more reason for him to carry it for a bit. >_>
ones does not simply walk naked into mordor
ORC UP!
04But as soon as he found him and pulled out the ring, that's when he got his attention
actually,sharing would be the smart thing
Aren't you a little short to be an orc?
Those helmets
if not for the fact that it'd make both of them axe crazy
Goblin
Big Bruva is watching you!
Can we watch the Robot Chicken sketch about the Surreal Life doing this after the movie?

lol was just thinking that Kandarihu
CriticKitten: Sam had difficulty letting go of the ring after carrying it for only a few minutes
the silver hawks
Looks like the Skeksis. Mmmmmmmmmmm.
^
MmmmmMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm
1,11*slaps Meanwhile* No.
Just what I was thinking
And now I have my roast in the oven... Oh, I'm making a roast. I like making a roast because I can eat for three days for a fairly smallish amount.
CriticKitten: That's why Frodo's the ring bearer
one does not simply walk into mordor!....well boromir u where wrong... 2 hobbits disguised as orcs simply walked into mordor!
1,11*slaps MegaMoonShine* No!
Sundaysmile, I was thinking about it since Friday.
Fl00tersh41: Er no, he stuttered a little, just like everyone else who so much as looked at it.
he suffered a defeat...but you know,that was the vanguard of the vanguard
dat is a lot of orcs
mmMMM--*gets slapped by Gimli*
Ow!
1,11inb4 another great Gimli line.
CriticKitten: Excatly, he was falling under it's influence, just like everyone else
SUICIDAL CHARGE
lol
THE BEST PLAN
Fl00tersh41: So is Frodo! >_>
Bai everypony :'(

Let's go make a lot of noise at Sauron
exactly, Gimli
bye :D
Later, CCCP
1,11Certainty of Death. Small Chance of Success. What are we waiting for?
Aye, Gimli
later cccp
Fl00tersh41: Samwise has the better shot of resisting at present because he hasn't been carrying it for that long.
And make funny faces at him
/me hugs Michael MegaMoonShine AJIsAwesome Vivix Pikachu Barbetos MrBen and Ryunosuke
Pimp him out as king

And taunt him a second time
This film kind of reminds me of the last episode of Angel

"You take the 1000 on the left"
"I'll take the 1000 on the right"
o.o
ohai sauron
In the novel, Sam was tempted to keep the ring-- to become the worlds greatest gardner. IN fact, a Gardner of the World, making all green and fair. He got better.
"OH, I CALL THE DRAGON!"
Parlay?
Ballsy
Dumblewhore: And I'll take the one in the middle.
You know, Gimli's line makes no sense to me.
CriticKitten: Sam was heavily affected by it in a matter of minutes, frodo only after months, and they still have a long way to go
oh noes
dat face
plan backfired
OH SHI-
dat moment
<:O noo
CriticKitten: Sam wouldn't last long enough to make it to the vulcano
:O
Nuuuuuuuuuu
also howdy im baack
bonjour
Allo RAWRity.
Thunder-Crescent: Welcome back!:)
Faramir, yay!
what happened there? i havent seen the previous movies so dik
Oh my!
*idk
Wb Thunder-Crescent
04Fuck yeah, more Faramir scenes
So, long couple of days. Just moved all of my possessions to a new town.
i just punched the main hencman of the main evil in the face
Fl00tersh41: Uh, you can't argue both sides. He's been carrying it for months, ergo he's actually the worse person to carry it right now.
now,kiss me
yay for Faramir
1,11The merging of Rohand and Gondor.
Gimli: :D
romantic beards always work
back to the silverhawks
CriticKitten: Point is, frodo isn't fully under it's control
LOL
11,01RAWRity: College?
oh shit
CriticKitten: Sam would be in a matter of hours
Fl00tersh41: He's a hell of a lot closer than Sam.
04Yeah...Faramir is my favorite human warrior in the series
Gimli: I'm ok with this.jpg
Nittany_Discord: new house
1,11Beijing Chicken...how did they come up with that name?
11,01K.
Fl00tersh41: You can't prove that or even know for sure. >_>
Act casual.
good evening everyone
11,01Moving is always a pain.
k
seems legit
Gandalf_the_White: What, no love for Dumblewhore? >:
RAWRity: How was the move?
"Where's a whip, there's a way!"
I'D STAB HIM IF HE WIPPED ME
hai Alchemist
AJIsAwesome: agonizing, but thankfully ratehr quick
CriticKitten: the book has some say on that, can't remember, but bilbo has something to do with how--resilient Frodo is oor soomeething..
CriticKitten: Neither can you proove that Sam could resist it, it's pure conjecture
1,11Camoflage successful
04You're not a warrior, Dumblewhore. You're the crazy half brother of Dumbledore
RAWRity: OK.
Hiding in plain sight.. What hobbits do best.
the orc is a spy!
Fl00tersh41: The proof is right there in the movie, dope. :p
11,01And the Aragorn and friends accidentally kill Frodo and Sam. The end.
And i am the half crazy half brother of Gandalf the White
now I'm hanging out in my new room, deciding where to put my pony stuff.
11,01Dumbleass is better.
CriticKitten: Yes, it's showing how much faster than Frodo, sam is falling under it's influence
Vivix: See, that would make more sense. But it's not made clear in the film.
04Is it just me or is Aragorn's hair much longer now
he has nice nose rings
:P im eating hot fresly made chocolate muffins
Nittany_Discord: what about Dumbletoilet?
I think Rivendel had some on it? I wasn't here that day
ouch...
Gandalf_the_Brony: Lauriel, because he's worth it.
11,01twilight_sprinkle: Nah.
1,11Fl00ters41: Sam had trouble giving Frodo the Ring after having it for less than a day. He wouldn't have been able carry the load.
11,01But Baltoilet is awesome.
aw
MOOO!
Element of share the load.
Bull? lol
Funny how we never see an enemy commander commence an inspection of his own troops unless the good guys are blending in with them.
Fight, Fight!
Gimli: That's what I'm saying
Gimli: Sam should have done some fucking pullups before this trip then.
all your guts are belong to me
XD
11,01Take a load, Sam.
Drop your load, Sam
Orc guts. Anyone? Anyone?
lol thats how orks work someone starts a fight = entertainment
wheres my lotion when i need it
you know, it's interesting to see what they left out for the theatrical cut.
lol those orcs are in line for the SDCC Derpy figure :D
Hey guys
Barbetos: I'll take some!
Hey XylemTube :)
XylemTube: Hi!:)
ah,the merry land of mordor
Orc Opera = WWE
what does frodo want there anyway?
I always loved this scene, because the low horizon shot made me think of sigur ros
full of...smoke...and fire.....and dust....
Hello XylemTube
Gimli: He stuttered slightly, ergo he could never carry it for the day or so it'd take to get to the volcano? Forgive me if that doesn't make a wit of sense
04Lol Sundaysmile
twilight_sprinkle: they're going there to destro the ring.
hai XylemTube
RAWRity: o ok
11,01Get up. It took us two movies. We can keep going.
He wan'ts to lose his ring Twilight_Sprinkle
it's weeks to get tomt doom
Sundaysmile: mkay
Stop being a sissy, Frodo.
Goodbye clothes
not a euphamism btw
the movie make it look like it take less time
1,11Drop the load.
Not the pots! :'(
CriticKitten: Because it's not just for a few minutes he has to carry it, bit for many hours
why did he throw his armor out? i thought only frodo was tird
what number film are we on?
3
last
third
Okay
Thanks
Nittany_Discord: I'd be like "We've spent 11 fuckings hours of screen time to get here. Pick your tiny ass up and come on.
i hope they had insurence on that armour
HES DEAD
A light :O
he's stoned
I mistook that light for a dead pixel
he died, the armor was too heavy
In the book it was easier to see how much the ring was killing him-
lighthouse sauron
luna is HERE ON WORD BRONIES TO VICTORY *charges out front door with antique sword aimed at naighbours*
The great searchlight of Barad-Dur....
greenscreen
Fl00tersh41: He carried it for almost a full day, and only stuttered slightly in returning it to Frodo. The volcano is less than a day away. By all accounts it's very clear he'd be able to carry it at least part of that distance. >_>
MFW water is scarce
Yeah. The ring is a BURDEN. And I doubt any of us could carry it more than a few minutes.
Vivix: I'd say the movies do a damn good job of it too, what with the visual os Frodo looking completely and utterly fucked up.
mmmmm 3 drops of water
A few drops left
what an efficient way to drink
Manages to pour them down his face
that was more
CriticKitten: That's just movie cutting
is that a buffalo scro
scrod
This is news to Frodo
he was just trying to think positive
theyl die as bro's :'( how touching
CriticKitten: The plain in front of that vulcano is over 100 kilometers wide
but sam just wants Butter
RAWRity: Oh yaeh, totally, but with how the ring was just burning into his vision everytime he closed his eyes, he looks decrepit and sick, though. A scene showing his vision would probably take out the pacing
Sundaysmile: and taters
now ranks,piss on the gate,that will get us sauron full attention
hi
porkbutts and taters
I also think he can not give up the ring withou going mad, or something
Frodo: Get these damn mosquitos away from me!
oh shit
!
GET DAUN!
wat a fall
How does it not see him?
4short amount of time and though he was fine resisting it it was because he was more focused on rescuing Frodo. When Frodo was saved and he pulled the ring out he stuttered then, when there was no direct evil around him.
Fl00tersh41: So it took Mordor several days to empty itself? Yeah, I didn't think so. >_>
Quick, play dead!
11,01Frodo can't take that swag.
Well he's screwed
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
that'd b sweet if the eye had a gold necklace
11,01Frodo is like "He's so dreamy." *Collapses*
Sauron dropped his contact.
lol Nittany_Discord
Can we stop with the Frodo/Sam ring debate now and just enjoy the movie??
inB4 GREATEST SPEECH EVER.
lol Meanwhile
inb4 the mouth
Kthanx
11,01Hi Bronysith <3
theyre talking to a wall
Forrrth
I always thought it was awesome how the ring was almost sentient- creepy stuff
Gandalf_the_White: Yes, he stuttered due to the proximity to the mountain. That does not answer why he could not possibly have carried it for part of the trip up the volcano.
Nittany_Discord: how are you today? :)
oh shit its gonna talk back!
11,01Better.
they should grease that gate
approach wall, bring no siege equipment
it makes sense
dat mouth
nice teeth
they don't want to get in
Sexy.
eww
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the Extended Edition, the Mouth of Sauron is played by Australian actor Bruce Spence. Spence's real mouth was digitally enlarged to underscore his role in Sauron's service, as well as further give the character an inhuman aspect.
they want them to get out
Dat grin
dat mouth..
Well hi there, scary teeth
He seems nice
i bet he gives a good bj
Need a tic tac?
That--HELMET
CriticKitten: well, if the stutter was because of how close they are to the mountain...wouldn't going closer to the mountain make him more likely to fall to the rings, correct?
dat mouth of sauron
years of coffie caused that shit he calls teeth
Mouth of Sauron uses Frodo's Mithril Vest -50 hope to all allied troops.
its a sweater! i made it m yself
Miithriiil
He's a greybeard
Someone equip it
thats a nice sweater
RAWRity: Of course. Same goes from Frodo.
hes got a big mouth
11,01'dat robot voice.
Hello BronyState!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The runes on the helmet worn by the Mouth of Sauron, when transliterated, say "Lammen Gorthaur". Lammen means voice, and Gorthaur, which is mentioned in the Silmarillion, means Dread Abomination, another title by which Sauron was known. The complete phrase, "Voice of the Dread Abomination", identifies the speaker as the Mouth of Sauron.
hoi Riders
He deed.
11,01Hi Riders
domo arigoto mr roboto
Hello Riders :)
lawl
ded
Aragorn uses Decapatation it is super effective.
Oh my
ded
Man, now that I am older I really want to read silmarilion
AW SNAP
RAWRity: Again, doesn't provide a satisfactory answer for why he couldn't carry it for at least some of that distance since he clearly had it for some time prior.
there is your negotiations
CriticKitten: but Frodo doesn't have the issue of trying to resist it. His issue is carrying the immense mental weight of it.
He reminds me of emperor doviculus
hai Riders
DECAPATATION!!!
boring conversation anyway... Gandalf, we're gonna hvae company!
I told you parley is french for everyone else in unarmed and flat-footed.
Diplomacy at it's finest
Riders: Hi!:)
1,11That was a nice F**K YOU.
just unpacked new headphone swith mic AWESOME
Twilight: Win
are you still there +sauron with the portal 2 sentry voice+
Sword diplomacy
And he died like emperor doviculus :D
1,11twilight_Sprinkle: lawl
04What RAWRity said is right
04Frodo's problem lies in him carrying it, not resisting it
How much of the film did I miss/How much is left?
Lightly trudging away from battle.
Sauron used evil look.
So.
so is frodo gonna die or what
No intermission today or did I miss it?
I hope the Hobbit is as epic as this
sirsodaorsomething: Watch and find out
^^
CriticKitten: it's something that could be argued, but I'm willing to believe that they didn't want to risk Sam turning on Frodo. Better Frodo tries to trudge on with it than risk Sam abandoning/killing him to keep the ring.
RAWRity: Er, except that they're both the same in this case.
11,01No intermission yet.
Frodo better die, or I'll kill him myself. :I
ok
A lot, Riders/they're pretty near the end
is the gobbit after this?
Riders: we're 3 1/2 hours im
dat speech
SPEECH!
*in
hobbit*
1,11Gandalf_the_White: Eh, I wouldn't say that. Frodo is clearly starting to be curropted by the ring, but he's still able to resist.
super speech engaged
SONG!
Nittany: The movie's almost over anyway.
Nittany_Discord, yet? We're more than halfway through.
+3000 courage
inb4 more epicness
An intermission at this point would be pointless.
Greatest. Speech. EVER.
SPARTANS TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!!
how much longer is the movie?
THIS IS EQUESTRIA!!1
1,11Why else did he try to give it to the Nazgul and try to walk it into the Witch King's fortress?
04Yeah, the role of Sam's character is that he's the most loyal friend
Maybe it's between the end and the credits
you should hear the german version
/me Sauron used Mean Look you can not escape
Inspirational Speech +100 to morale
it actually surpasses this
I'm playing the Smile song in the background now
Aragorn uses Greater Inspirational Speech +9001 Hope to all allied troops.
TONIGHT, WE DINE IN THE CAFETERIA HALL!!!!
It's cool. I'm here for the community more than the movie, which is still awesome
AROOO AROOO AROO!!!
/me stands
04Because, Gimli, I said that Frodo's will is only broken when confronted with a very strong force of evil
04Otherwise he's fine
The ring has a will of its own, it tries to return
Tonight we dine in Mordor!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene where Aragorn's army assembles in front of the Black Gate of Mordor was shot in a desert that was used by the army as a training field. Because it was still littered with mines and bombs that hadn't gone off, the army had to sweep the field with metal detectors to make the danger for the actors and extras acceptable at least.
Aragorn's horse wasn't actually supposed to rear up when they were shooting the scene, it just did it at random and they decided to keep it in.
"acceptable"
Gimli: wow
13TIL the army trains with live bombs
<3 this music
which lotr is this?
well,a few extras blowing up on a mine could have added to the scene
Gandalf_the_White: I guess Smeagol counts as a "strong evil force" then because he very clearly allows Smeagol to manipulate him out of his own greed for the ring
<_<
COMANDER SHEPPHERD ME3 ENDING SPOOF WITH FRODO!!
they should of brought more water 2 water skins isnt gonna cut it!
Almost DERE!
Spitfire: Return of the King. The last one.
lol anyone seen the Robot Chicken Mt. Mordor scene,w/ Frodo and ****? lol creepy but funny
"Deshi Deshi! Basara Basara!"
Shizuka: Well, with the number of people that die in army training, I'm not that surprised
This movie is 5 hours, does that include credits?
circles!
epic last stand
Kandarihu: I think so.
Fove jpir!?
Five hours!?
this can only end well
Woah
friendship...is magic.
dat gimli
1,11Aye. I can do that.
Dumblewhore: how many people die in army training, exactly? O_o
Gimli and Legolas initiate the Friendship buff +2000 defence
cross species bromance
Friendship <3
Gimli why you so awesome?
pikorar: Not sure, a fair number.
And how long are the credits this time? Still half an hour?
Friendship truly is magic.
11,01Who trains an army with live explosives?
friendship is magic :)
do they still include the fanclub?
I feel like their is less rivalry between gimli and legolas in the book...
Dumblewhore: um, which army we talking about?
Friendship in Middle Earth is Magic
gandalf casts defensive harmony,protection from evil 100y and...some other shit
Kandarihu: A bit longer this time, I think. There were a lot more people in this one.
DIS SPEECH
:(
final stand + epic speach + friendship = epicest moment evar
Nittany_Discord: Someone who wants their army to know how to handle live explosives
Sam = Come on Master Frodo. You make that Will save, you can do it
Sams serinade
Nittany_Discord: Japanese? :P
Nittany_Discord: Mr. T.
great story bro
:'(
:(
Nittany_Discord: Same reason shooting ranges use live ammo
FUKKIN STRAWBERRIES
cool story bro
Strawberries and CREEEMEEHH!!
Goddanggit, I missed most of this.
LOL JK I don't really cry during movies.
Dumblewhore: because I know damn well the US military doesn't do that shit. live mines and the like are for testing the equipment, not soldiers.
Suddenly I have a craving for strawberies.
For Strawberies!
godamn making me all emotional
he died thinking of strawberries and cream... good death
than the element of harmony fly in and kill the enemy army and save the day and pinkie pie sings another sing
At this scene everybody in the cinema was touched ... god it was so awesome
song
FOR WATER!!!! :[
11,01Well shooting ranges generally don't shoot at live targets.
MFW people still die in training for the US army
Nittany_Discord, someone who wants soldiers to TOTALLY be used to that when exposed to live combat.
oh this next line
frodo had too much drug
friendship!!!
:'(
he can carry him
Sam uses the Ultimate Loyal Friend buff +250 hope +250 determination +250 strength
Nittany_Discord: "generall'?O_o
:'(
"DESHI, DESHI! BASARA, BASARA!"
Element of share the load.
*generally
GO SAM!
BY THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!!!
Love lifts him up where he belongs
Just imagine him as a sack of muffins!
"I can't carry the ring....but I CAN CARRY YOU!!"
ISPIRATIONAL
Dumblewhore: very rarely, usually related to dehydration or exhaustion, or the rare mechanical failure/accident.
1,11When he said Carry the Load, I dont think he initially thought he'd literally carry Frodo...
And this is why Sam is the real hero of this story, and Frodo's just the bitch carrying the evil necklace
As Celestia is my witness...ill carry you
staring contest
DISHI, DISHI, PASTA BRA, PASTA BRA
11,01I don't know of any army training exercises that involve shooting at each other with live ammo.
FORWARD! FOR LIFE! FOR WATER! AND FOR STRAWBERRIES! :[
CriticKitten: As implied in the book
Sam is best hobbit
Never noticed but you can actually hear Into The West playing in orchestrals at that point
Sam is-amazing
And at that moment, Sam thinks, deep in the back of his mind, "And I think I understand why Men wear shoes now."
For Frodo
FOR EQUESTRIA!!!!
epic charge inb4
Nittany_Discord well you have never been to my house
Cue the best charge.
For Megaupload. ;_;7
Well, I guess Samwise is FINALLY carrying the ring, indirectly.
1,11Riders: No offense..but it was kinda obvious...
For Frodo......
Aragorn uses 'For Frodo' Charge +1000 to all stats.
11,01Ryunosuke: You want a pasta bra?

Nittany_Discord: well there is a part where they shoot at you with a machine gun and you crawl under barbwire will doing so :P
I miss megaupload T_T
So they forget about Frodo for the ENTIRE movie until this moment....
OH MY GOD HE JUST RAN IN
LEEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEEEENKINS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHH!
HAAAAAM!!!
DEATH! :[
lol halflings
you're too slow
aww :( I slept through alot aof the final part
11,01Major: Do they still do that?
DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAHHH PORCODIOOOOOOOO
Stick to the plan!
CriticKitten: sort of. Sam's the one who goes through the biggest development, while Frodo's is mostly about his struggle with the ring and ultimately getting the urge to adventure and travel beyond middle earth.
dumb frodo in the lava
XylemTube: I thought MegaUpload came back.
*dump
@Gimli = Haven't watched the movie enough. It's my least favorite of the series
STAY ON TARGET
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: To get enough extras for the Battle at the Black Gate, a few hundred members of the New Zealand army were brought in. They apparently were so enthusiastic during the battle scenes that they kept breaking the wooden swords and spears they were given.
Gold_Demona: did it?
OH HELL NO
LLLEERRRROOOOYYYYY JJEEENNNNNNKKKKIIINNNNSSSSSS. frodo looks from the top of the mnt "god danmit leeroy"

GTFO Gollum!
04Oh man, did I miss the best scene?

Gimli: is it a twist if it's been foreshadowed for the last 3 hours?
rock you
Smeagol Lied >_>
Rock to the head.
I LIED!
If Smeagol can choke you, you're weak.
wouyld be funny if he missed
Gandalf_the_Brony: which one? :P
Keep throwing rocks
wound is on the other cheek in this scene
Gandalf_the_White: yes
Bashed!
Break his neck!
Falcon KICK!!
04FUCK
why not stab him with a sword?
04I missed the best scene
pikorar: Smeagol's a lot stronger than he looks. =/
1,11Gandalf_The_White: ...no, you were here for the White Shores scene..
Give Smeagol the ring and then throw them both into the damn volcano!
uhoh'
What scene Gandalf_the_White?
NOMNOMNOM
smeagol uses bash and then bite
Pikachu: actually Gollum's surprisingly strong for his size. Plus Frodo's got the weight of the world around his neck.
oh shit
For Frodo
Vampire Smeagol
The Ring Wraiths have entered the battle.
Major: I think they threw the swords away with the armour.
oohhhh noooww he can walk
Wait, no.

04"But I can carry you! COME ON!!"
Oh NOW you suddenly have energy to climb

The task is almost complete, will Gandalf have to go back to being dead!? :'(
Army of Gilda's!
where did the birds come from?
1,11Eagles > Dragons aparently.
04Nature fights back BITCH
Fl00tersh41: if he were to steal the ring and keep it, he would.

As someone who has not read the books or watched the films more than 3 times, Do they ever actually depict the defeat of Saruman?
Oh, you remember HiShE for this movie?

Nittany_Discord: that was one of the things the contestors were saying too, I remember watching so much about the whole protest hehe. I dont even live in USA
Ill never let go jack
13he was going to yell his other favorite brand, ORAL B!, but it didn't focus well
But, y'know, movie physics.
:'(
yay!
DIE RING!
Why does Sauron put all his power in a ring anyway?
13as an inanimate object, i have nothing to add
OH, MY FEELS
Sam uses 'Don't You Let Go' giving Frodo +1000 friendship.
Sam used friendship, IT WAS SUPER EFFECTIVE
VICTORYY!!
13THEY DID WHAT?
Second best quote: "Don't you let go."

Surely if with the ring he is unbeatable
And it holds all his power

Dumblewhore: you didn't pay attentiion to the first film then, when they explained that?
pikorar: :D
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original storyboards for the destruction of Barad-dur had a volcanic fissure appearing between Mt. Doom and the tower, with lava erupting into the tower and melting it from the inside. When the post-production schedule became too hectic, the sequence was simplified into the version that now appears.
COUNTER-TERRORISTS WIN
Goodbye Sauron

13oh this is bad uh... my administration accomplished all its goals... uh my planet needs me!
Boom muthafucka!
Dumblewhore: He fell asleep in Villain Class
RAWRity: Did I not?
inb4 epic explosion
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Scenes were shot that involved Aragorn tackling Sauron one-on-one while outside the Black Gate. In the scene, Sauron would have appeared taller than the Sauron we see at the start of The Fellowship of the Ring. Once footage was reviewed, however, it was decided that to include this scene would pervert Tolkien's ideas, and also distracted too much from the climax
1,11of Frodo and Sam's storyline. Footage from the fight remains: Aragorn's charge outside the Black Gate was to take him into the fight. Temp work on this scene can be seen on the third disc of the Return of the King Extended Edition DVD.
Cypresswolf: no its just enterplay soldout and it'll be awhile before more are made
13IT WAS ALL SARUMAN'S FAULT!
13mother..
Its so beautiful when its dying :'(
AND THI IS WHY I'M A GOOD DEMOMAN

Oh frodo, you'r hot

Smeagol?
How is the heat convection not boiling them?
13nope frodo, still got an hour to go
Rohan: yes, but the prices for the boxes keep fluctuating
Free at last!
how come he can walk fine now even after loosing all that blood but now when hes thirsty
final quest is over!
Hawt sex
the magic of movies
Convection doesn't exist in movies
Fuck Sauron, I'm just glad Smeagol's dead. He was a little shit.
sirsodaorsomething: losing*
most of it are credits
Cause he no longer has the ring weighing him down
Fl00tersh41: middle earth volcanos work differently
Movie Physics 101: The lava can hurt you only when you physically touch it. The heat won't bother you at all.
CONVECTION CONSMECTION

Shizuka lol theres an hour left?!
grammar nazi
Sam = Now we can start the hour of finales
Shizu: An hour and about five different endings to go
Cypresswolf: last pack i bought had a green fluttershy...
RAWRity: You gunna explain it to me then?
13take a shot every time the movie ends
sirsodaorsomething: WINNING
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Special care was taken to make sure that the destruction of Sauron's tower of Barad-Dur did not resemble the destruction of the World Trade Center. For this reason, it disintegrates from the ground up, and the sound was made from breaking glass, so that it would not sound or look as if it were exploding.
The chat couldnt handel the epic
look at sam,and how he's like YEAH,AND I CAN SEE THE LAVA OF OUR DEATH
you done good kid you did...good.... *andeerson dies*
I only opened the first 20 pack I got - I have 5 more boxes, but wont open those for quite some time
allahsauris swag
I was also going to question how they can go inside a vulcano we have seem spewing lava out of its top for all three movies
Thunder-Crescent: that is spoilers, not everyone has played 3 yet
That's not the Shire, Frodo! Don't head towards the light!
>exploding tower
The biggest weakness of this film: It has the longest ending of all time
Sam wanted to marry Thistlewhistle
>must automatically be a 9/11 reference
Mainly due to the amount pet hair and dust
Cypresswolf: tbh im somewhat dissappointed with the card print quality
who says imrefering to that andesn
13do remember this was a mere two years after it
Dumblewhore: Now you're thinking like a true MURIKAN
13the end
Riders: What's wrong with a long ending?
nao yaoi
I remember having to pee really bad, thinking the ending was close. Nope.
and then they made out
twilight_sprinkle: how so?
oh wait
They were careful to prevent it from BEING a 9/11 reference.
04Friendship, baby
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The first film in the trilogy had 540 computer-generated effects. "The Two Towers" had 799 and "Return of the King" has 1488.

A party on the lava? O.o
CrazyHippie1234: Hi!:)
eagles.we show up late,but hell are we usefull
High as EAGLES
Eagles
Save us Gilda!
Dumblewhore: short version is: Sauron made the Ring to corrupt the world and make him powerful. army of men and elves made Narsil, an enchanted sword, and managed to cut the ring from his hand. leader of the men was corrupted by the ring and didn't destroy it, and thus the ring travelled from there till Frodo got it.
nom nom time for eagles
13yoink
Hello CrazyHi[[ie1234
frodo died 2 weeks later due to a infection from missing finger
Shizuka: Fair point, it was less time after, but the point was that it was a tower exploding in the film, and however they did that, it's still a tower exploding, I don't think that how it exploded would have made people any less offended
and then they were eaten by eagles
13well, we see the "proper" version
damnit gilda
AJIsAwesome = As Shizuka put it, Take a shot everytime the film looks like its about to cut to credits. It's not that anything is poorly done, it just feels kind of excessive
13who knows what other possibilities there were
sirsodaorsomething: Nah, it was sauturized shut by the fire.
And so the age old question of "Why didn't we just fly there in the first place?" was ignored totally and utterly.
13it was aaaall a dream
Those are eagles, not gryphons lol

Shizuka: the original version as actually a DC-8 flying out of Mount Doom and crashing into Sauron's eye.
Sad thing is that terrorists got the idea for 9/11 from a TV show
Gandalf_the_White what if your inception is inside the matrix ?
Meanwhile: Shhh, you're not allowed to point out plotholes or people will get yelly at you. :P
Shizuka: There was actually an online petition protesting the title of the second movie-- The Two Towers-- believe it or not.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The movie marks the second time in history that the third movie in a trilogy was nominated for Best Picture, by the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, after The Godfather: Part III and the only time that a third movie has won the Best Picture Oscar. The movie also tied with Ben-Hur and Titanic to win the most Oscars (11) in a single year. It is also the only one of
no,i'm a ghost
1,11the three to win a Screenplay Oscar.
ohai Gandalf

GANDALF YOUR HAIR IS AWESOME
04An inception wrapped inside a matrix
dat gandalf
"So i'm dead, huh?
04But this...oh man
God, people are daft.
You know, they could do more to make the collapse of the Tower of Sauron more unlike the WTC attacks. They could have it fall sideways. They could have the whole tower turn to sand and just MELT.
13yay we're all dead!
13yay
Cypresswolf: well firstly the green dull fluttershy cards. also the foil material on one of the cards is off by a 1 millimeter or so. and the print is just poor on them in general. and its quite expensive for 5 cards
04How awesome that Frodo sees that Gandalf is alive and well
Hahahahahahahahaha
hello frodo here is your reward for saving the world *takes off robe*
Dumblewhore: I think terrorists got the idea for 9/11 from the fact that Planes can crash into things.

It broke another record by winning all the Oscars for which it was nominated (11 out of 11). The previous record was nine out of nine by The Last Emperor and nine out of nine by Gigi.

Cypresswolf: ah no, amazon has great toy and collectible selection- I'll go there first
song tiem
now, autism
AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE!
Kareoke
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Like Billy Boyd earlier in the film, Viggo Mortensen also composed the tune and sung the part to the song Aragorn sings at his coronation. The translation of the Elvish words runs "Out of the Great Sea to Middle Earth I am come. In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world." This is, according to the book, the same verse Elendil sung when
1,11he first arrived in Middle Earth from Númenor.
04Faramir
And then everyone was like "why the fuck is he singing?"
And an awkward silence as the King breaks into song.
What? No sing along lyrics at the bottom?
on the back where it shows the pony type, are all 3 highlighted or just 2? Cypresswolf
Allahsaurus: you speak Elvish?

I dont think you are supposed to spin while kissing
"hey aragorn, you need a shave:

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Since John Rhys-Davies suffered constant rashes from wearing the Gimli make-up, the make-up department gave him the opportunity to throw his Gimli mask into the fire on his last day of pick-up photography. He didn't hesitate a moment to grab and burn it.
Gold_Demona: His ancestors were Elfs, i think

So is this the complete ending?

He's traumatized by nearly a years worth of resisting the rings corruption, paranioa at his friends trying to steal it at every turn and in the end knowing he succombed to its power

Gimli: Nice call using the words "ponies".
Nittany_Discord: Nope. Just lost a finger
AJIsAwesome = Oh no. we've still got a ways to go

Cypresswolf: thank you
Masochism is fun. So is Schadenfraude or however you spell it.

Nittany_Discord: Would've had to retrive it first. Wasn't much time to do so with the whole volcano collapsing around them. =P

That was old Sam. New Sam gets the fuck what he wants

Suddenly Changelings.
04Didn't Viggo end up kissing Billy Boyd during this scene
xd YES
04And that's why Sean is laughing?
wakes up
well sam has a woman
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd were standing off-camera during Sam's wedding scene, pretending to be wedding guests in order to help Sean Astin's performance. After Sarah McLeod threw her bridal bouquet to Boyd, Mortensen gave Boyd a passionate kiss. The filming of the scene (and the kiss) appear on the extended version extras.

A book within a book?
13it's been four years to the day since this movie started sam
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo is writing the book, the top of the page notes that Sam was elected Mayor of Hobbiton.
tittleception
Mr. Frodo, are you virgin?
MegaMoonShine: No, a book within a movie about a book.

A little more. Ffffffff.
Shit, watch out for falling title!
Shizuka: just in time for our fifth denoument
Alexxm: Longest. Prolouge. Ever.
13bilbo misses his UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAAH
man The Shire would an awesome live action Ponyville :D
Bilbo's age caught up with him. =P
mummy baggins
11,01twilight_sprinkle: Now you can explode on command and have maid tendencies.
YE OLDE BILBO
Lolnope.
Damn, Bilbo has aged.
...
twilight_sprinkle oh I am sure that enchantment sounds like fun and games, but now your cursed to a life time of maidhood and explosions.
Well... About the ring... Erm.
bilbo got old
He is terribly wrinkled.
how long ago did this movie start?
I'm afraid I've lost it >_>
Lost it. >_>
well i burned it in a fire
pffft bwaHAHAHA
13frodo just rolled his eyes
well, didn't the ring make him stay youthful?
I thought he said titty
XD
13did you see it?
Pity.
is that guy smelling frodo?
>valuable family heirloom
Now that's just depressing
Lost it BS
>lost it
NO!
11,01alexxm: That ring isn't keeping him young.
and now that he hasn't had it he ages normally?
Shizuka yeees
he's like 116 years old
lost it >_>
Nittany_Discord: sounds like..fun?..
LiarFrodo <_<
Shizuka: General reaction to the ramblings of old fogeys.
13it's like ughhhh
11,01twilight_sprinkle: It is!
We were talking about how Frodo was good at resisting the ring
Bilbo is best Yoda
13my, what a magnificent blue screen
UH!
Bilbo resisted it for so many yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrssssss
lol
Nittany_Discord: if im a maid too, do i clean myself up after i explode?
11,01My, what a magnificent Shizuka.
And Frodo just months
13protip, my high school choir sang "into the west", playing in the background here
shit hes still young
Nittany_Discord i know i thought he would have some power absorbed to hold it back a few extra years though
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The last shot of principal photography was when the newly-crowned Aragorn bows to the four Hobbits. Although Viggo Mortensen did not need to be on set for that day, he nevertheless insisted on attending. He didn't have a crown (it wasn't necessary - he wasn't being filmed) so he fashioned one out of paper. With each successive take, the crown was becoming more
1,11ornate and sillier as crew members kept decorating it, so the four actors playing the Hobbits often had difficulty suppressing their giggles.
DAT GALADRIEL
Bilbo didn't need tor esist it
Free boat ride for 3! Now who should I take...
For the 3 necklaces of power!
13the dominion of men? better not let the federation know
it wasn't trying to return actively
04Into The West is the best damn song
NOOOOOO Not the Dominion!!!
Pffffttttt Bilbo should've taken it to Mordor!
ADVENTURE TIME
I think I'm quite ready for another adventure - spoken like a true adventurer, Biblo :)

ADVENTURE TIME in Middle Earth lol
It's Adventure Time!

Oh Bilbo, you'r so funny

Going to life forever
Quick Bilbo, touch my cloak! *ADVENTURE*
Cue Leonard Nemoy with Bilbo Baggins!
04Come on, grab your friends. We'll go to very distant lands
Never has award bait music been so sweet on the ears
Should we start singing pet shop boys "go west" now?
and then the elves got killed by neo
With Bilbo the Hobbit, and Gandalf the Maiar...
Gandalf! :'(
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Ian McKellen's first day of shooting on the trilogy was Gandalf's first scene, arriving in Hobbiton. His second day of shooting was Gandalf's final scene of the film, at the Gray Havens.
Yes. They're "sailing off to another land". They ded.
04SMEAGOL THE CREATURES AND FRODO THE HUMAN, THE FUN WILL NEVER END. IT'S ADVENTURE TIME

@Gandalf_the_White = win!
11,01It'll be funny when their boat gets turned around and they end up back at Middle Earth.
That golden sky in the distance :)
13time for frodo to go back to pride rock
Frodo dead!
that boat lacks the requisite number of railings
and then the elves got killed by neo
Bye Fro'-
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Grey Havens scene had to be shot three times, much to the dismay of the actors, who had to be crying for most of the scene. On the first try, it was discovered in viewing the dailies that Sean Astin was wearing the wrong shirt under his cloak. After shooting the scene a second time, the negatives were inadvertently exposed to light during processing, causing
1,11a white haze over the entire day's footage. It was finally captured successfully on the third try.
I MUST GO! MY PLANET NEEDSME!
nooo godamnit :'(:(
dat book
Yes you can.
:'(
I can't quit you Mr. Frodo
So, i hear they're making a third "Bill

So star wars is future lotr?

That's kindof wierd...

For those that haven't seen the movie, this is still not the final scene
sirsodaorsomething: gay is not an insult :[
that smile is creepy
^
And not an intermission in sight.
according to tolkien lore, sam eventually sailed after Frodo many years later by himself
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The end-credit portraits of each of the lead actors appearing alongside their name was the suggestion of Ian McKellen. The sketches were created by production designer Alan Lee from production stills, although what is seen on the movie is actually a slight morph between the sketch and the original photograph.
And then about three miles from shore Frodo realised he hadn't remembered to take anything with him onto the boat, forcing them all to come back again.
Michael: or is it?
Michael: it wasnt supposed to be :S
no its not not
:'(
BAWWW
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Each of the cast members was given a gift on their last day of shooting, usually a prop that was significant to their roles. Miranda Otto received one of Eowyn's dresses and her sword, Liv Tyler received Arwen's "dying dress", Orlando Bloom got one of Legolas' bows. Andy Serkis and Elijah Wood were given prop rings used in the movie by director Peter Jackson. They

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The last spoken line of the movie - "Well, I'm back." - is also the last line of the book.

The ending of Return of the King is a trilogy in and of itself

13Michael: Into the West
Shizuka: You embrassed them at that last party.
Into The West - Annie Lennox
13and all will turn~
This movie is one of three movies I ever cried to in my entire life, this being the only one I cried in the theatres for
13to silver glass~
dabi pls
1,11SILVERSCREEN'S MOVIE REVIEW: This movie...This movie is absolutely perfect. There is a reason that The Lord of the Rings is like the holy grail of the world of geeks and nerds, and this trilogy shows us exactly why that is. This is THE fantasy story that MUST be seen if you are to claim you're into fantasy stories. A PERFECT 10/10 for the entire series AND a PERFECT 10/10 for the series
Is thefan club in these credits?
1,11as a whole. http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m88qgxvVBs1rqykim.gif
Grey ships pass into the west.
04Into The West~
13dari didn't see sauron's death then
13best splosion ever
Dari: The tower didn't count?
they are turning the hobbit into several movies?
There were no fireballs.
>:
I was no sated.
I heard they were gonna make it 3 movies now...
not*
*groan*
13dari also missed the volcano sploding
dabi pls
I missed the 3rd one YAY!
04And yet
I'll correct then
Gnight everypony HF! :)
I have NO idea how theyre gonna fill up 3 movies with a small book like the hobbit
Dabi pls
For what is probably the first time... I agree with Dari.
04I don't think we've ever shown Citizen Kane
13there we go
And here's where my jaw quivers in that way it does when things end.
Didn't see it, no computer/10
Michael: NIght!:)
aww
13six people just to make rock effects
idk if its because i didnt see the previous movies, but i felt like there wasnt enough plot advancement throughout the movie, stuff was just dying all the time
Nittany_Discord, wanna do Portal 2 Co-Op after the credits?
Anyone here have their names in the extended credits?
1,11> The hobbit
13here comes the million effects artists
Hai Everypony :), what was just playing?
1,11> small book
1,11hah
Gandalf_the_White: I'd love to see the entire chat bitching saying "THIS is one of the greatest movies ever? pfffft."
13hobbit is still dense
Man I can't wait for Hobbit.
SirGanjalfTheEmerald: first one, anyway.
13i thought the hellrides in the amber series were bad, but the hobbit is like... all that...
Shizuka: Not unlike it's fanbase. Zing~
1,11twilight_Sprinkle: considering you missed TWO movies before this one..yeah, you needed to watch them.
MFW since fan club is so big they should have just got all of them to work for free
13YOW
11,01Kandarihu: Dunno. More in the mood for MvM
i prefer the hobbit over the lord of the rings, so i'm definitely looking forward to it
13that zing
AJIsAwesome: I take it were at the notoriously long credits now?
Gimli: but i understood almost everything without them though
04Well, I think I'm gonna wrap things up here. I'm feeling a bit tired and have class starting tomorrow. It was fun everyone, and I hope we get to do this again next summer maybe. See you, everyone.
Seeya Ghosties.
the hobbit is smaller than lotr right, still they are gonna make a third part, after the first 2 were finished...
nite Ghosties
13miniatures unit?
13does that mean there's a DM screen unit?
Ghosties: Bye!:'(
bye Ghosties
Nittany_Discord, well, I gotta get through Co-op today before I give out my 75% off discount coupon?
Bye Ghosties
bye Ghosties
Shizuka: Nah they were in charge of the Hobbits.
time to thank everyone in credits again?
Good luck @ school, Ghosties
And Ghosties leaves us to go into the West....
night Ghosties
What's after this
Goobye Red Leverage
04Adios
Farewell Ghosties:'(
11,01Kandarihu: Why?
Hi everypony
I thought the miniatures were the miniature buildings
hello Dashee
What where you watching?
Minas Tirith, Helms Deep, etc
1,11Personally...I liked this series better than the Dark Knight trilogy. And hell, I liked it better than the Marvel series.
I was kidding dari.
Nittany_Discord, I want that Professor Portal achievement.
Oh
/me facepaws.
Boy do I have my timeline wrong -_(\ LOTR museum came to Houston in 2005 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Motion_Picture_Trilogy:_The_Exhibition
11,01K.
Gimli: Well in my rankin: RotK >>> TDKR
*ranking
Dashee: Hi!:) LoTR end credits
I don't really rank films in my mind.
I was never into superheroes, so I've actually never seen batman
Well
Thanks
I don't have a film I like 'best'.
Gimli: I maintain that this is the best trilogy in film. I can think of a lot of good movies, but they don't match up to this.
Though some I can say I like more than others
Right then. Need that cup of tea.
thanks AJIsAwesome
1,11CriticKitten: agreed.
was that lord of the rings?
yes
Eeyup.
1,11kidzrul434: yep
I made a lego version of a set
The Houston Museum didnt allow cameras to be taken into the exhibit, so all I know of what the exhibit contain is strictly from memory
I really need to read these books and then really watch these movies agian.
J.R.R. Tolkien is best lyrics writer
Yep, Return of the King most certainly has ecsaped the 3rd Movie Curse
hey I know a site that has all the locations of every movie made
I want to read silmarillion now that I'm older
But the set up was very well put together, maze like so it took you awhile to go through all the things :)
i kinda would like to see a farseer film, but i'd have no idea how that would work since it's two trilogies long, three trilogies if you count the liveship traders
Fanclub time
You know that 30% or so of movies made are lost to time for ever?
Vivix: be ready for a hard read, but it is worth it IMO
So all those endings were used in the theatrical release?
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
OH NO
11,01Fan club!
Vivix: Silmarillion is good, but it's a lot more dense than the LotR novels.
Andersons
Even the credits never end
lots of andersons
So, does anyone have their name here, in the fanclub?
DAT FAN CLUB
Rainbow-Crash: I was actually not able to read it as a child- but it seems cooler now that I'm older-
yeah- as a child itw as way too heavy for me
And so, for the final time, we encounter the Great Wall of Names that is the Fan Club.
And mind, I wasn't actually impressed with the books. But I still say this was a fantastic film series. That speaks volumes for the quality put in.
11,01I wonder how much money it took to get your name on the credits.
Hooray for neverending credits! :D
Brace yourselves, fanclub incoming
Nittany_Discord: I think it was really cheap- like 10 bucks or 50 bucks
They are not even done with the B's!
My favorite sights were of the bigatures, the hobbiton mill, both towers of Mordor & Isengard, Sean Bean's body dummy in the canoe, and the weapons
my god the must have the guinness world record of the biggest fan club
jus membership in the Tolkien Fancub, Nittany_Discord.
1,11The price to get your name into the credits was $39.99
Cypresswolf: Bigatures beat any cgi any day of the weak
If you notice, most of the cast are in there.
Well, Im out too guys, got 4 and a half hours of sleep left if I leave now.
26 hours later...
C!
The Fan Club is now typed in Fancy.
Vivix: Yes! :)
Darth_Vader: NIght! Rest up!:)
http://youtu.be/xPfMb50dsOk PONY MUSIC VIDEO
Is yours there, Gimli?
I heard that Jackson used to have bigatures from his past movie in his garage, sounds so cool
sirsodaorsomething: No video links, dude.
The model for Isengard tower was 14 ft tall
!
Barad-dur was taller.
Oh, and there was a model for a life sized cave troll, mace in hand and chain around its neck
Crazy-
/me goes take a leak
So were all those ending used in the theatrical release of this movie?
And perhaps its the sheer perfection of these films that make me worry about The Hobbit. I don't know if they can really live up to these movies.
I hate movie trailers! They spoil the movie right before it's even released!
*endings*
13AJIsAwesome: sadly yes
We're in the 'F' s now.
AJIsAwesome: Yes. This is pretty much the only part of the Extended Edition that wasn't extended.
I liked the endings
Shizuka: Wow. I thought they were alternate endings.
Winding down as hell, rather than cut to black
Made for some hilarious reactions in the cinema.
My thingy crashed
They're in the G's now.
~2 Hours Later~
I made a sandwich and finished it and still came back to credits
sigh
\:3/
I just hate movie trailers always spoiling the movie before it comes out
according to the wiki page on the museum the last stop was Fundación Caixa Galicia, A Coruña and Santiago De Compostela, A Coruña, Spain: June 23, 2007 - September 16, 2007
barely on the H's
im eating my third ice now and credits arent done yet...omg time for my 4th ice
~8 Hours Later~
cuz its so damn hot here
inb4 list got longer
RivaLz: Ice? Are you talking about ice cubes?
Three weeks later~
Perhaps after the Hobbit is complete and out on dvd, they'll send out a traveling Hobbit museum :)
ah, so we're on letter K

AJIsAwesome no not cubes, icecream :D Orange flavour xD

Just came back from making a sandwhich. I'm actually impressed we're already at the O's.
Huh.
Are we still on the fanclub?
Yes
yeah
yep
Mhmm
11,01Still scrolling names.
I don't nkow why they included that into their credits, but- funny names
We made it to the Ps
Henry N Parsely III

Lawl

Should stay away from the ganja...lf.
Beeing honest...the Fanbase Credits are much more worth watching then todays blockbusters on cinema.... dunno i dont like the new films these days, except for Dark Knight Rises and some others
STILL CREDITS???
I don't like most movies, because they're movies-
>Echo H Skyhorse
each time we see a name in the credits, we drink
Best name ever
SmerechiniakHayes? that's a mouthful of a name.
So many smiths xD
I mean, they're so expensive they have to cater to many people
CrazyHippie: Don't worry, only about ten minutes left.
even dark knight didn't seem interesting at all to me
Joseph M. Supple
Mmmm Joseph
Trauttmansdorff
Wooooooah, i missed the moviee
RaveBrony :(
Don't worry
xD
You didn't miss the best bit
Dark Knight was good performance wise, it just wasn't as cohesive and DEEEEEEEEP like LoTR was IMO
Me to :(

Bronysith: Have fun, and try hard

so if you don't hear from me, that

11,01I know Sumica might be AFK, but that doesn't mean you can break a rule because the screen is black.
:D
hows it goin bronies
Bronysith: well that is what happens when you ape on someone elses net and they decide to go on vacation
Thunder-Crescent: Hi!:)

Thunder-Crescent: Welcome Back!
Randomnerd: i dont plan on drinking
Don't make friends based on drinking.
You can also NOT drink
In our school ther was this guy who couldn't drink cause he ruined his liver on his 21st birthday
Nittany_Discord: but the point of the rule is to not offend the streamer, if the streamer is afk, whos offended?
im eating muffins
Bronysith: Good on you. I'm a hard-drinker, myself, I won't deny it's a bad habit.
11,01Alright. You can post links.
Nittany_Discord: and stream is practically over
yay
Are we seriously arguing with the moderators?
not that i was gonna post links anyway :D
Anyone want to start up a new game of tf2 coop?

...I missed the movie, didn't I?
Eeyup
That--inception meme
where was Gondor when LOTR was showing
Gondor: Yep.:'(
Where was gonder when the movie-
Where was Gondor when the movie was playing?
When was it?
Blind guardian has made a lot of LOTR inspired metal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoyToHOWSV8
It just ended.
Gondor: Around 1:00.
On the other hand, I could start a MLP fancomic about it.
Cae seraa,,seraaa--what ever will bee
eh..
Anyone else got awsome LotR inspired music?
Not really- my friend used to listen to minstrel bands, some of those were pretty lotry
(My long-running assertion is that Equestria has an Airship Navy -that's why you never see any military presence besides the royal guard.
I heard a great song inspired by "Song of Ice and Fire".
"Song of the Seven", lemme find it on YT.

Randomnerd: Rhapsody in Flames have been doing that ever since they where just plain old Rhapsody
Ever heard "holy thunderforce"?
Fl00tersh41 And blind guardian, etc.
True day
*dat
This one amuses me, because it's the song Sam sings as a lullaby in "Storm of Swords".
Blind guardian where making that kind of stuff long before Rhapsody
But Rhapsody is much more epic
twilight_sprinkle: he hasn't been on in a few days
http://youtu.be/6oqXVx3sBOk This was the music video I was thinkin' of when Dari was talking about that Can story

Milk cartons escaping!

Better leave it to the imp
no stream?
ohai otakon
MvM anyone?
hiya Gold_Demona
Dovah: Sumica went AFK and it's still running
oh I see
AJIsAwesome: Milk carton trying to find lost guy- in my link, yeah- /awkward
Yay~
I missed RotK though, but I saw ParaNorman today. Good movie.
(Who knew Bran the Builder made the Wall out of Speakers?)
Maybe he went downstairs thinking it was ages until movie was done
whats paranorman about
Vivix: Ok.
Randomnerd: That would have been awesome
He probably figures that it'll still be another 15 minutes before the credits are over.
Randomnerd: The electric bill for that would have been bloody murder though
Sometimes when I turn on my bass amp, the fuses go out
a wall of speakers would be murder
is it good AJisAwesome
00,02Vivix, if your pulling enough power to blow fuses, then the volume might be a smidge high
Vivix: A 700 foot tall wall of speakers would be metal though
That'd be WAY too much sound for me. o_o
Phase4: the volume is on 1/12, but it pulls ..400W RMS? I dunno,
alexxm: How should I know. I'm not going to watch that movie.
Gold_Demona: Pah, weakling
I don't know if it pulls more if I turn up the volume?
I prefer NOT to feel my brains rattling around in my head. >.>
00,02its pulling 400?
ok AJisAwesome
Hehehe
Ok guys
00,02Vivix, what kind of monstrous amp do you have!?!?
You have to watch the best video ever made.
I'm not sure-- its a 500 watt amp, but the RMS is ..3-400? into aa--700W 4ohm cabinet
It's a bass amplifier for bass guitar
