:'(
cause people are too busy wanting to watch this episode
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Okay
I'll change it then
... Why did I jynx it...
Just stop whining.
and i found the owner of the site
00,02after the song
still*
Screw physics
it's Pinkie
but the law says that an domain must allways be designated to a person or a corpration
00,02AdamTheDuck, dat 0x7F
"this day aria is a good duet" ITS THE SAME SINGER
All the 
not a duet if it is the same singer
00,02some of the people here get random malformed text, i'm not sure if its intentional or bugs

and all the signs point to the fact that a person in united kingdom "own" this domain
my thing is lagging like crazy
00,02AdamTheDuck, how you doing that?
Hmm, still comes out as one ...
then press
ctrl + backspace
dat 
00,02for those of you that dont understand my badly worded sentence: the litteral value of that was 0x7F
Nonpareil
lel
is the server managed by him?
LAGGING
:'(
00,02so when i first watched this, my understanding was that they were all getting drunk
STEPPIN ON THE BEACH
00,02Spectrum_Rush, it is?
DOO DOO DOO DOO
finnaly
00,02Anaruski, whats this now?
00,02Anaruski, feel free, i'm one of the techs
00,02its mostly stock wordpress, dont think i've added any exploits with my code
skip, skip, skip....
Suddenly skips to song 6_9
or as an email
hey fellas
00,02Anaruski, we;re not exactly going to bring legal action against you :P
whos streaming
00,02Anaruski, if you do find an exploit, tell us first, other than that have fun
PINKIE PIE YOU BITCH
ok
00,02k
last time i got an permission i kinda got sued....
we are setting up right now
00,02i'll stop now
00,02WrekatBUCK, can we let song finish?
00,02is good song
for a pentest
00,02he wants to try hack the site
more like poke holes into it
00,02WrekatBUCK, streams free
ok
ill be back in a sec
hallo everyone :)
/me 00,02*segfault*
but the site is on a shared server?
00,02Anaruski, yup
00,02you cant anyway
00,02its behind cloudflare
00,02with cleverness you might find the direct hostname but wont change much
well
.
as long as its made by humans, it can be cracked by humans
is there a stream?
i think not...
good afternoon.
00,02Anaruski, if you actually got into our webhost i would be incredibly suprised
00,02they've survived a great many attacks
haters gonna hate?
/me 00,02dislikes php and its stupids
Durr, is anything on Virtual Console even free?
dovahkin is just an exact copy of the dragoon
and i got the tools for that
dovahikiins are just extremely lame as well
now you can refresh the stream
Lolwut
Hey guys. What's going on?

Hi everyone!
Guess who's at the front
Who's doing the music?
Gotta say music is making it a little hard to hear saturn
Very hard
Alas I shall talk to.you all later. Bye <3
TURN THE MUSIC OFF please. it is hard to hear Saturn
I have a bad time hearing in microphone. I think it's because of the echo lol. But that's just me
I'll tell him when he goes past
can we turn music off please?
00,02WrekatBUCK, bit of music, i cant hear saturn
;-;
no change
^
mute music or turn it off. cant hear him speaking or anything
:<
Well I'll be back later. Bye guys

00,02Music y u still there :<

Dem hellos.
Hello people

EGGY!

00,02'this one time at band camp'

I like his accent
Correct.

Weird, the pictures move every 5 seconds, but there's no sound

What's dashiesauce?
00,02channel on this network
Hm, never been there
*The rules
Anybody from EFR IRC?
*trollface*
I prefer this channel, because even if there's few rules, most people are nice
hi. what'S that?
00,02Quick, someone make rarity mod for guns of icarus
Dark_Horst,prarity
/me hugs everypony for no raisen

bye bye bronysate i have to go

But some good friends of mine are still in there tho :)
Bye
We are no one
00,02lat.... damnit
aww
00,02Bronysith, could always ask
where exactly are they? not the mainroom, as far as i can telkl
personal opinion should never get involved in modding, but mods are people too
Umm i have no questions but hi to you all!
00,02XD
:P
:o
I think their names are written further uup-
Damn, can't read the writing
I like how, even in handwriting, he's I's are uncapitalized
his*
00,02Dark_Horst, not sure who's recording
this is pretty hard to follow
00,02YAR HAR
That was embarassing
...
Porn is acceptable because of today's society
Rules decide what's okay
NEKKID TIME
/me dances around
adblock is bad for the business
00,02Vivix, i disagree
00,02it took quite a bit to make me install adblock
of course, that would be extreme
...i need to pray for celestia's protection now. cthulu might be onto me
I literally just cringed.
The worst ad I know is World of Tanks
hello
If adblock can do selective blocking I would block them
World of tanks doesnt even have a mute button
yeah-
00,10Ad block has alot of settings and filters
00,02there are too many ad services to selectively filter
00,02its all or nothing
00,02i per site filter for some things
00,02but not many
just asking
Well, that was embarassing
00,10adblock works in all browsers
00,02internet explorer would be more dificult than the others but one probably exists
00,02and i know little of opera
00,02or safari
opera has one
00,10I am well
All I know about opera is that it is scandinavian-
Did netscape die? I used that back in the day
00,10but yeah you can turn off and on adblock on a site by site basus
i think it did
i dont
00,02but adblocks exist outside of that
yeah-
but blocking sites with bad ad service would probably be good
IE sucks
00,02chrome is getting there but it lacks some of the polish
^
DABI PLS
/me puts on a helmet
o wait
dabi pls
00,02Vivix, the only thing html5 cant do is streaming, thats being worked on
Hehe
Dat wall of explanation
*negative
00,02Dark_Horst, in an environment where you count in megabytes, that function had no right to exist
Suck it up dabi
Hehe, JRE ?
00,02prince-dari, they'll be made in javascript
Eugh
Dungeon master remake
They don't exist
basically counting sand grains on a beach, eh?
IT IS AWESOME
that is java runtime, don't know if it runs in browsers
/me don't know that shit
:P
00,02chat is ded
no ites not
still here
hehe
would html5 allow for programs such as paintchat?
00,02dat 0x7F again
00,02Vivix, eyup
<,<
THat's cool-
00,02i've though of replacing it with a html5 variant
Hm, that would be nice, not to mention it could be used by others as well
<_<
Atm it is very unstable, and- yeah only lets some people in
00,02Vivix, one or two exist i think but they're paid or otherwise inaccessible
Ahh-
00,02RaveBrony, XD
hehe
I'm excited!
^
I SAID NO SPOILERS'
the pre-opening only starts at 18:00. is that gmt?
00,02XD
hehe
Where is Gonder when ponies die? :P
Pshh, itll probably Live Action! :$
Healthy studying environment
/me 00,02is really hoping for a movie
00,023d wont work with pony
hehe, it would be TERRIBLE
2d animation has always been my preferation
00,02it *could* work but not worth it
00,02rdibp, i heard that somewhere too, not sure though
yeah
00,02i think they are taking brony's very seriously
well were only getting 13 eps this season, but Daniel Ingram said something on his deviantart about "many seasons"
yeah
00,02Vivix, 3d can be done well though
and Simpsons to had some 13 ep seasons
I mean, pony takes 6 months of animation?
00,02they got away with soo much by being clever
Hmm, haven't seen those
Ive only seen them on here :D
hehehe
00,02cheap 3d studios are full of sillies
Lol!
hehe yeah,
showing something down someones throat is the best way to make htem dislike it
00,02i've not seen care bears
00,02ViolaGrey, trad-rig?
:D
Rig is like- very well done version of newgrounds
00,02the thing about animation though is its less about image quality and more about motion
yeah
and their use of rigs gives them tons of extra time on details and traditional things for fluent things where they need that
Ello there everypony.
yeah
00,02anime can sometimes get away with it, theres a contrast betwene background and caracters that hides it somewhat
Yeah-
00,02password for all 3 is ponies
Thank ye.
yeah- I have no idea
My Little Dashie...Movie? :) This fandom never ceases to amaze me

Aw yeah, the 90's
90s rules
aw yeahh
00,10sadly I was never able to beat it. My PSX died and by the time I got around to playing it again my ps2 died
00,10HARRRRRRRRPOOOOOONN!
00,10I do not.
that sucks
emulator it?
00,10meh emu's tend to not work well with ps games
00,02pscx i think it is, works quite well
00,02they have most of a ps2 emulator now
00,02Sumica, the ps2 variant is called pscx2 or something, havent looked at it in ages
00,10might look in to it, been wanting to stream some older games
ive gotten my PS1 emu to work quite well
00,02http://www.pcsx.net/ here it is
00,02http://pcsx2.net/ and this site has changed a lot sence i last looked
ERMHAGHERD WHY IS THIS AWEOSME?!
i use ePSXe
00,10incredible crisis would be amusing to stream
GO ROSE AND TRANSFORM
dart
he is not some emo bitch
i use very old PSP
is there no stream?
should i get a vita?
YES
y?
they are awesome
y?
nomnomnomnom rain
chocolate rain
i have one. they are just awesome
Major:it rained yesterday XD
I want rain here
Why are they awesome?
why does the ps1 and ps2 have my fav games?
because those system were awesome
yes
you played great games
and therefore i recognize you as a gamer
except for systems such as the 3do and cd-i
yea
3d0 had good games...
just sayin
ps1 derp
Did I just hear 3DO?
yes
XD
1 or 2 good games but other than that
on 3do
nes is a current fad, a lot of 15 yearolds play it because it is cool
i still play snes games on my browser
cause lets see
snes had
CHRONO TRIGGER
sega cd wasn't too good either
i owmed a SNES
FF3 (FF6)
I grew up with amiga, comodore and computers
and i can play the SNES in a emulator
chrono trigger
I grew up with amiga too
um
how?
We had Amiga 500 and 1200
Spell-of-Gaming:if you want one get a emulator and then download a rom file and play it on here
had*
jrpg
it is fantastic though
omg
you can combine attacks
and read the pony chrono trigger fic too
are they still on break?
hm- maybe, I'm like that group that loed WRPGS and Point and click adventures
I loved pont & click too
Hey :)
hi
Haya
Chrono Trigger is normal for me.
I like JRPGs and WRPGs
I got addicted playing too much Earthbound
i still need to play that
that and RPGXmaker games
my views just changed towards you
wat?
using emulators?
:D
<_<
emulators are fine
yes
whats chrono trigger?
has anyone play radiant historia on the DS?
the best rpg on the snes
read the pony chrono trigger on fimfiction
chrono trigger is the single greatest rpg on the snes
combining attacks
WHY HASNT ANYONE ELSE DONE THIS?!
me
I like talking and walking-
i have
Er... Kirby 64?
Kirby 64 combined abilities.
I hope they can bring back that feature
console rpgs...they can in no way compare to titles like gothic or morrowind
i disagree
morrowind is good
nay
what's with the stream?
INSTEAD OF THE STUPID ARROW POINTING ME WHERE TO GO
how come?
they awarded a best pony award?
Some people took it as canon
well
there are mods for skyrim which give you this feeling too. having a gps tracking system in a medieval fantasy world is just silly
it was just a bit of fun
best pony award? never heard of it
EFS, etc, yes
but it works a bit too well comapred to the pipboy in F1 and F2 sometimes
I HATE FALSE GAMERS
it has to triangulate with something
no
it is just handholding bullshit that ruins immersion
In Van Buren it was stated that sattelites still orbit earth
yes, but the player position
same problem in Morrowind though
having a more or less correct map and a compass should be enough
compass doesn't have to be though
hi
goood
it is, unless you have to go back and forth a lot
:P
only the boats and the silt striders
:d
I avoid Vivec like the plague, because walking there is such a pain when I have low athletics skill
i have high acrobatics
the starting walkspeed is horrible though- I mean it feels like I'm holding down ctrl
wat we talkin about?
Morrowind and other games

Define 'natural'
Forgive my interruption my sarcasm is augmented
If by natural you mean 'existing in nature - not manmade' alcohol is naturally ocurring in nature anyway
Therefore it's natural
bk
In everyway
/me screams
I see remnants of alcholism
Alcohol is fermentation of various types
And some chewing
I see.

I don't mind people drinking, but I don't like being around them when they do
Non ionised?
besides you can drink without getting drunk, so- I don't mind
You can buy it here
But I don't think "people" import it
More companies

don't do alcholhol kids
Oh it's shit
But there's cheaper here
Gods bless Polish imports
Lemonade is a juice?

I got a message from a friend saying
I remember kids used to hang out outside of 7/11 drinking energy drinks as if they were drunk
Drink that drink and drink it well
"
"Awh man this burns!"
Maybe that's best drink
yeah, kids are weird
when energy drinks were just becoming cool here, it was--weird
I've only been in two bars, and neither times did I drink
;D
hehe
>kids show does an episode about cider
TIME TO KILL A VIRAGE

Did it, came back a few minutes into the movie.

04I dunno...Smeagol really fell into it
04Like immediately
04Bam
04There was no resistance
But Smeagol isn't a hobbit. He's of a race that were kinda related to hobbits
It was like, here's Frodo and Bilbo, able to resist
Smeagol is a Sook
04So yeah...I think it's just individual hobbits are good with it
Just out of intreast, did this only start 13 mins ago?
Brovakiin: Kinda. We had some technical difficulties again.
Not to mention isildur

Hobbits just naturally arn't easily corrupted. They're very easy going

how the fuck do ORCS manage to march in order?
hehe

04Sounds like a plothole
But they arent men, and tehres too many smells around, or something?
Probably because all they can smell at the moment is each other.
not necessarily. all the orcs are marching together, they probably smell bad
haha lol
hobbits do not smell like men?
Which was the case in Two Towers as well.
Maybe by "the flesh" they meant blood/bloody flesh. Maybe orcs are like sharks in this case?
nothin <_<
Can't smell good
hehe
Mixed with mud.
And yet they smelled the humans from a very long distance off while in a large group of several hundred in Two Towers.
Smells like tourists delight
smells like france
hobbits smell different then humans. there, thats the reason
^
Yeah, not buying the "couldn't smell them" excuse given the context of the last movie. :P
Hobbits smell like pipe-weed:P
Why do they have torches lit.

The rabbits are taking cover underground right now
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene of the Rohirrim charging the Pelennor had to be filmed 52 times before the crew were satisfied with the take. During this process, about 60 of the 280 horses participating had to drop out for various reasons.
my little warhorse
full speed horse charge. Painful
And this is why cavalry charges tend to shred the shit out of foot soldiers
oh no !!!
Poor horses. :
crazy
i missed the charge :(
WATAH!
11,01Mica
Aren't horses incapable or unwilling of charging anyone? Rather jumping over or going around?
Is he being candied?
oh mai
Oh mai
He really loves to lube up before... well you know.
1,11That Oh My
because edoras isn't as easy to defend as helm's deep...and he tought a huge part of the army to be lost

I've had stampeding horse running towards me, terrifying- even if I knew she wouldn't hit me
11,01Sumi
omg is undertaker
Pippin to the rescue!
fatality
Vivis: Correct. The idea of cavalry charging into solid groups of soldiers is all fiction. Real cavalry charges would either end in the enemy breaking and running at the sight of it, or the cavalry breaking rank and going around the rear and flanks of the enemy.

I made a lego version of a set
I really need to read these books and then really watch these movies agian.
J.R.R. Tolkien is best lyrics writer
hey I know a site that has all the locations of every movie made
I want to read silmarillion now that I'm older
i kinda would like to see a farseer film, but i'd have no idea how that would work since it's two trilogies long, three trilogies if you count the liveship traders
Fanclub time
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
OH NO

Andersons
Even the credits never end

And mind, I wasn't actually impressed with the books. But I still say this was a fantastic film series. That speaks volumes for the quality put in.
Hooray for neverending credits! :D
Brace yourselves, fanclub incoming
They are not even done with the B's!
26 hours later...
The model for Isengard tower was 14 ft tall
!
Barad-dur was taller.
Crazy-
/me goes take a leak
And perhaps its the sheer perfection of these films that make me worry about The Hobbit. I don't know if they can really live up to these movies.
I hate movie trailers! They spoil the movie right before it's even released!
*endings*

I liked the endings
Made for some hilarious reactions in the cinema.

I missed RotK though, but I saw ParaNorman today. Good movie.
(Who knew Bran the Builder made the Wall out of Speakers?)
Maybe he went downstairs thinking it was ages until movie was done
whats paranorman about
He probably figures that it'll still be another 15 minutes before the credits are over.
Sometimes when I turn on my bass amp, the fuses go out
a wall of speakers would be murder
That'd be WAY too much sound for me. o_o
I don't know if it pulls more if I turn up the volume?
