Did anyone else get a Kingdom Hearts vibe from the nightmare doors scene, or is it just me?
Well, wait, before I rip this thing down....here's what I think would make it WORK.
Scoot-Scootaloo: so much MLG lol
Well, rather, here's what I would do with it.
Scoot-Scootaloo: just one of those meh days
Dashie_Dashie: No, it'd be more like "Every day I'm buf **************"
CriticKitten go on
Sombre turns out to be the guy who corrupted Luna into NMM, for one.
Everything is MLG with you Scoot-Scootaloo
That way it ties the existing material in.
hrmmmm...wrong one, but right intent. Sorta
TROctavia - actually, i find that scene rather inspiring for a one-off encounter in a D&D sesion
Everyday I'm bu(insert buffering circle here)
CriticKitten because of the spell that made the empire disappear for 1000 years?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZHwGnGrm_k
the book is dark, a darker gray that is and from what I can see is twilights cutie mark on it
o.o
Enjoy some music everyone as we wait for a stream to pop up agian .-. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9vDcxviKQA
Thats another thing
I see we had a few new people
Anyways people, Gigabit and Allegr0 will be working with me on some days for the Celestia Radio/Bronystate collab show every week for the new episodes
CriticKitten: wanna bet fanfics would be better than Lauren's writers?
Come on, buffer!
If the empire went away for 1000 years, would Celestia know ALOT about it?
yep
soo slow
geez, buffering
D:
i see the usuals are still here allthough now we have some new people
/me QQs and hugs ponyfolk
i'm new!
Her and Luna were suppose to have been ruling long before then
Hello there Kurra
princess luna was also exiled for 1000 years...
Everything important happened 1000 years ago. No exceptions.
im new :D'
/me hugs Kura :3
/me hugs Kurra :)
so what is Celestia raido? is it a chatting website?
BUFFER
8radio
I MEAN RADIO
But she was there for Sombra exile
can i get a hug :(
flutterchu its a radio site
Then I'd have Sombre manipulate Equestria through various individuals they've seen before, like Gilda or Trixie, and show up at the finale in a culmination of various small plot threads to tie together as this big showdown between Twilight and Sombre.
EVERYTHING IS 1000
Celestia Radio is a radio
and we dont know how long the crystal kingdom was around either
Quick_Thinker: what does that mean?
/me fluffs thelonepony :>
CriticKitten WRITE IT
I always feel bad for younger fans who think they're going to get game companies to accept their ideas...
do we get moar carl sagan after this?
In case y'all are confused, Bronystate is NOT leaving! Those two are :P
its just like pandora it plays a ton of songs
/me attaches to Kura :>
most are brony related
well perhaps she exiled herself to escape sombras spell?
Buffer Rock is in the HOOOOUSE TONIIIIIGHT, everypony just has a bad time. Circle's gonna make us LOOOOSE our MIIINDS, we just want to see mods.... STREAM THAT
Lol, who really thought Bronystate was leaving
I liked 'em enough to follow them after hearing them once
did anyone else just fell off the xyzzy game again?
we just wanna see mods...(buffercircle)....stream that
hmm
oh yeah and i wish to mention MY GAMESTOP $#%#ed UP AND DELIVERED MY BLACK OPS 2 IN THE MAIL :D
I'm crossing my paws in the hopes that Trixie's upcoming return will play into that.
Quick_Thinker: the real problem is you preordered Black Ops 2
I could also see Twlight almost becoming corrupted because of said dark magic.
CriticKitten I was teriffied when Celestia used it on that one crystal in the start
that actually makes sense, seeing what I have from sombras magic
WinterSpeed, nice touch
i love it when those fools screw up
GigabotHarmonie: Allegr0 sorry to cancel the show :(
CriticKitten: I'll join you.
Domo you still streaming?
also, how bout dat dark magic twilight? that was total win
DerpyMuffins: Nope
i've already played zambies and BUCK its awesome
When Twilight did dark magic and uncovered that staircase, I got flashbacks of Metroid Prime 2.
Cards against humanity died agin.
ZAMBEHS
so what is going on with the lack of streem... i'm new
I'd like to see Trixie come back, wielding Sombre's dark magic in an effort to regain her lost dignity. She takes over, but gets defeated, and this helps reveal the possibility that NMM was created by Luna's own misuse of dark magic, which results in Luna beginning to train Twilight.
13Patience ponies.
^
That's what I'd hope for, anyways.
^^^
^^
fluttershyfan99: because no one is streaming yet :P
well we're ppl so we dont have patience
got it
got a random idea WHO WANTS TO PLAY A GAME OF PRETEND YOUR ZXY :D
CriticKitten why do you make me agree with you?!
i'll go make a game room
will there be streaming soon?
CriticKitten: nah i dont think shes evil enough for that
Because I have good points and I think them through. :P
anyways guys, I am off to bed~ Night y'all!
bye people.
Night Scoot-Scootaloo. :)
I love you all <3
Shizuka, anymore stream shenannigans tonight?
Goodnight Scoot-Scootaloo
night Scoot-Scootaloo :)
twilight_sprinkle he just said alot of stuff leading into it
The scene with Spike crying over leaving twilight.. Is that something that was previously alluded to in a past episode, or was that perhaps a bit of fan-generated extrapolation prior to the premiere?
this is for those like gak so much http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/311199_496978033666490_53153234_n.jpg
^
^^
^^^
we got enough GAK as it is
[SWAG]Haku: into trixie being evil? i dont feel like shes that evil in any case
twilight_sprinkle: I dunno. She's been publically humiliated in front of an entire town by this one filly. And then a dark force shows up and offers her revenge....
shes just a show off not really evil
And offers to teach her "real magic"
i don't have enough gak
Magic that she can use to show up that filly that outclassed her
Anyone want to join me in Board Game Online http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
oh good god i just saw the GAK post on EQD
I think it'd work very well, actually.
http://i.imgur.com/CR3wi.jpg
:>
CriticKitten: meh, not very original in any case. plus trixie doesnt seem like the majorly evil type, she seems more like just an arrogant pony is all,not pure evil
It's a pretty classic revenge story. The sort that turns someone who is just generally unlikable into a TRUE antagonistic villain.
DERP
Lightning: uh oh
twilight_sprinkle something tells me you havent seen the poster yet
She needs to lose the show facade
okay just created a game in pretend your Xyzzy come on in and play PASSWORD IS Brony http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
to become truly evil
6_9
twilight_sprinkle: I dunno. She clearly didn't learn from her prior engagement and basically swore revenge, albeit in a comic relief way.
[SWAG]Haku: the __ vs __? i saw that today nfortunately. but still, i dont think it would be right to make her so evil, i dont feel its in character
She was in 1 episode
I think it'd be a nice change of pace actually
All we saw was that she liked to brag
No villian is villianous while simultaneously caring about how others think of her
her/him, either/or
oh yeah and my limit of players is up to 20
Instead of having villains who are villains because its FOR TEH EVULZ, it'd be nice to see a villain who you could reasonably sympathize with.
just created a game in Board Game Online Open to Everyone http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
CriticKitten Like NMN?
NMM
CLAP DEM CHEEKS
......
CriticKitten: im not even sure shed be brave enough for something like that, plus her hate seems pretty concentrated. unless they go with the whole "blinded by hate" but then again, a character like hers seems more like a character whos just insecure rather than more evil
:D
Idk if I really sympathize with NMM as much as I would if it were Luna in Luna form
And Trixie's case is one where you could potentially sympathize. Sure she was a braggart and arrogant, but she also got shown up in public and basically reduced to a national laughingstock overnight. Her life and career could have been ruined.
yeah I kinda felt bad when he left
Nightmare Moon just wanted some attention, Discord was just following his nature, Chrysalis was doing her duty as queen
Does anyone have a pair of bag shoes?
Cause i lost mine
Mind, I don't like Trixie, but if they played that angle, I would respect it.
CriticKitten Actually, she was only humiliated in one town, and we have seen nothing to say otherwise
CriticKitten: i like trixie actually, shes my third favorite pony. plus we already had a blinded by revenge pony, that would be NMM, doing it with trixie would be repeating itself
twilight_sprinkle: Hard to say, we never really got to see that much of her.
Haku: Aye, but that's my point.
twilight_sprikle NMM wasnt blinded by rage, she just wanted some attention
We don't know how the events of that night played out elsewhere.
I like any villian that has the protagonist by the berries at least once to the point where deus ex machina is the only obvious way out for the audience
CriticKitten: that and her whole house cart thing got stepped on
And now... Gak on loop. http://www.gak-is-back.com/
so she has nothing now
Maybe when that story spread, she became a national laughingstock and her career was basically over. I could see them play that up.
*90% of her watching*
She was atraveling magician in a trailer...
Im pretty bsure she didnt have much of a reputation
[SWAG]Haku: id say its more rage. wanting attention doesnt drive you to take over the world. it was rage caused from lack of not so much attention, but love towards her creations
Since they didn't actually tell us what happened to her afterwards, we have no way of knowing.
CriticKitten: still, in any case that scenario is very similar to NMM one
hey Shibaru
Haku: Again, we don't know. I'm pointing out that for such a strangely beloved character, very little is actually known of her. Mostly it's inferred. :P
I want a villain who's a villain because they have to be, because they have no other choice
Or based on fanon which has been stamped out before.
6_9
i feel like
hai every pony
So really, they could do a lot with her. I could see the "becomes a villain" angle.
anyone read dark esquestria before?
Hi sir_ :)
i suspect that if trixie comes back, the most that mightve happen is shell go overkill, and end up repenting
bronies have loved things b4 knowing much about them before
It'd be fun to watch in any case, if they do it right.
CriticKitten Dude, Im on your side here
*might
9 people in my game of pretend you Xyzzy COME ON IN password is Brony
I'm hoping it goes beyond that.
i think we have enough villains, i dont trixie to become one. id rather she stay the way she is, and maybe have an insecure side revealed
Join if your bored and want to play a fun game http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
You guys remember this morning?
3k people here
DerpyMuffins: Yep.
Now just 200
eeyup
Because let's be honest, if Sombre is going to be a big playing force in the world....he needs to, like, do stuff.
twilight_sprinkle Yeah, again, the poster... pretty sure she's about to cross the line between Villain and Antangoist
peace and quiet =w=
Derpy_Hooves: 3000? your shittin me?
nope
Corrupting former antagonists would be a fun way to go about that.
Just goes to show you, people are willing to unite to watch ponies
superretroworld: Tab fail. :)
Derpy is telling the truth
140
[SWAG]Haku: still seemed like more antagonist to me, although i tried not to look at it too close
wha?
10 more and I get a cookie
Quick_Thinker : whats Xyzzy
Not to mention it would teach a valuable lesson that applies to the real world.
Derpy_Hooves: Someone tabfailed.
*80% of her watching*
AJIsAwesome: whoops :D
Nothing Derpy_Hooves just another tab fail
I really wanted a redemption episode for Trixie...
It's up to 140
lol picture Sombra as Ansem while listening to this :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Gf2Xbwbts

10 More People Welcome to join http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
Like a sorta "Ponies change over time, and can even the worst of ponies can ebcome friends" thing
Namely, you should try to be kind even to those who stir up trouble, rather than trying to embarrass them. If you're not careful, you may create your own "villain". It's something that comics do quite a lot actually.
With villains being born out of good intentions gone bad.
Or just downright bad situations in general.
CriticKitten Im no longer agreeing with, but merely nodding my head
._. Why is nothing playing????
CriticKitten: sooo Trixie is Twilight's Venom? :D Twilie's Spider Mare! :D
beardfucking
:S
:[
Hey, it'd be fun.
CriticKitten like a Sad Villain; a villain who has no other choice but to be a villain
I like it better than "Trixie comes back, does exact same dickish things and is beaten again, then leaves" anyways, which is likely what will happen. >_>
A rehash of the original episode would just be lame. I'd rather her return be DIFFERENT.
^^^
/me nods head
CriticKitten: awww i was hope she would change her ways :S
her return is probely having her pissed off
i mean she pretty much got banished from Ponyville
hoping*
From that picture on eqd, i think its more of a struggle to beat her
than the current ep
and dont even forget the previews we got from the ending of S3
ohai NocturnalBlade :3
I dont want a the ponies to struggle with Trixie, I want Trixie to struggle with the ponies
SombrA
.-.
I wanted her to come back and get redemption
Are you feeling mad, are you feeling glad, do you wish you could have something to gloat to your fellow friends, well look no futher and come play Board Game Online http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG
Because a) it makes Sombre less useless; b) it means potentially more Luna screentime; c) it'd be a BIG step up from the stories of before
[SWAG]Haku: i want trixie to beg twilight to forgive her
Hell no
SOMBRA
Anyone see the journal at the end?
No begging from Trixie
come join Zamer
DerpyMuffins: I did.
I hope she returns maybe manipulated into doing BUT redeems herself and become friends or at least a friend/rival character IF she were to be approached by one of the princesses maybe? idk but i do wanna see at LEAST turn good in the end :$
IT IS SOMBRA
Just her coming back, maybe still a bit arrogant, and sacing the day somehow
Haku superretroworld how about you two settle this in a game
:P
Shizuka, Sumica, Domo: I'
Whoops
13wat
I screwed that up
Haku doesnt feel like playing a card game
anonymus asked: how much wood can a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood. my answer (if there's no spaces that means im talking really fast): wellfirstofallwhatthef**kisawoodchuckandwhydopeoplehavetotellmethesekindofquistionsitjus'tsirritatesmetoseethatpeoplehavechangebecause, sotheansweris1,000,0000,00000,000000,00000000becausethewoodchuckisreallyChuckNorrisandhewouldnotevengetCLOSEtothathewouldgoalotfartherblahblahblah

Dat spam
13flutterchu: Do not spam. You know better.
I would be fine with a redemption ending. I just want her return to not just be random dickiness because REVEEEEENGE.
what?*
there is lots of death
flutterchu the actual answer is 7 pounds
goddamn
You are not new flutterchu
and muffins
Expectations
CriticKitten: I see what you mean.
come on in guys we got 12 people in this game need only 8 more password is Brony http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
If it ends up being poorly written, I'll only hate her character more than before, and nothing of value will have been served by her return. >_>
A wood chuck would 7 punds if a wood chuck could chuck wood
Shizuka: but that's a sentance...just with no spaces.......which means im talking real fast
http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSJH&k=HAG Everyone come join we need a few more players
nyeh
What's next? Mafia wars?
?
stream pleases
Or, in other words: if a former antagonist has to return, it's best if the return actually serves a purpose.
^
^^
serves a purpose about friendship
lol now i kinda wanna Trixie as Twi's Garry Oak :D
The whole "some people can change for the better" actually ha shappened to me
One of my best friend was a complete dick in middle school
and now I love him like a brother
play some youtube poop
Why not do that with Trixie?

Yep.

I would like to see more of Celestia as well as Luna. Maybe some backstory of the two, perhaps?
I'm going to log off for the night, but I just want to thank all of you for being the best muthafuckin' pixels you can be

No, thank YOU, Allegr0.

Night Allegr0 and sleep well :)
Shizuka Allegr0 GigabotHarmonie Sumica and to any other staff: Today's been such a hectic day for everyone. The troubles trying to keep everything in working order during the premiere, the goof ups with Dari and EMN, the emotional round with Allegr0 and Giga moving their show to other places. It's such a heavy day and I'd like to thank you all of the time and effort you guys all do to give us this good free entertainment.

Dashie_Dashie: Message me if i can help.
The chat did act weird when the side rooms were first opened (It was telling me to install Flash) But when I got it working I was good
Punkie_Pue: it will...just as chuck norris jokes, your mother jokes, arrow to the knee jokes....some idiot will always find it funny
thats reassuring.
Has anyone written a fanfic based on MLP : FiM??? I Hve :D
I hope it doesn't stick around. Gak isn't all that funny by itself.

anyway
Wouldn't KHAN be an A movie?
Then maybe
dabummmsitt
I won two times to far. Silence of the lambs and Leon. The crowd was pleased.
Haku has only ever won once, in the winter
twas revenge of the nerds, the b film
I won Luna Eclipse once
i like discord
what is the full name of the movie, Stallion_of_War?

Mask of Light or Legends of Metru Nui
1 or 2
hmmm
hard choice
CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG

Cant find 4 anywhere though
Oh my Bionicles?
I bought on demand for my 16th bithday
i have the first 3 bionicle movies
Oh man, so many memories!
Eeyup
I got all 6 Ignikas, one of the best groups
and a ton of bionicle sets
/me lost all his bionicles ;~;
What you guys talking about with the dark magic thing?
I think I still have the first movie on tape though XD
or at least bionicle parts and sections
I have thw 2nd on VHS, and the 3rd on DVD
The new "hero factory" ones suck, i like the old ones.
Hero Factory's been around only 2 or 3 years and they already getting their onw tv series
11,01Nothing is being streamed.
not cool bro, not cool
agreed
[SWAG]Haku: what's a hero factory?
A down grade of Binicle
*bionicle
Binocle was about warriors in a different universe, about the 6 great protectors working together to overcome evil. Hero Factory is exactly like it sounds
[SWAG]Haku: what's a bionicle?
superretroworld hey retro you alive?
Zamer: yeah
flutterchu one of LEGOS greatest things
[SWAG]Haku: lol so the Bionicle's Toa were the Elements of Harmony :D
Basically, yeah
0,5heehee
I liked the original Bionicle.
Dat Decipher
Alone, they werent all that great, but together, they kicked major ass
just letting you know your turn is about to be back up
They started getting too complicated and silly though.
Not really
same here i still have all 6 of the original :3
With some of their powers being a bit absurd.
the more complicated, the better
oh god..

Dashie_Dashie, you're late
A responce https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEWoQTEjLak
Speaking of Hero Factory here's a simple video with some guy using the toys to tell a story. I know it's not much but this fellow does the best he can: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phYyQxXvwFs&list=PL94394ADBC01F651B&index=7&feature=plpp_video
Though it's a series so I don't know which part to show
So, um...who loved the Dark Magic concept?
superretroworld your turn is ready
Pure awsomeness if you were here earlier http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYW2GmHB5xs&feature=g-wl
Seriously, how badass was this shit? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZbCsJttSyE
you guys know what I want to see on stream?
how did we like season 3 episode 1 I left right after the stream
1+2
I found it okay.
Not great, but not bad.
^
It had great moments
I felt the same way. I was little disapointed we didnt see derpy
Hello:)
it's really the villain that is the main downside
I did like how everypony got a good amount of airtime
i particlarly liked that eyjey had more screen time, and a certain pink one had less.. i also liked that spike played a big role
what ayejay said :3
even though I thought he was okay
Punkie_Pue: Well, Derpy's not really mansatory in an episode.
It was okay, I think Sombra was the letdown for mos folks
brb
I heard Derpy was there
Also, I love the fact that Rarity got some pretty good screen time.
Celestia shot a lot of lasers this episode. Perhaps she was compensating for something?
All the ponies did.
Cadence's dramatic faint...
11,01Night everyone.
I loved the gravity spell:)
I thought it was sort of poor in the context of prior episodes. But still not BAD and it could be redeemed if it is used well later in this season.
Night, Nittany_Discord
Night, Nittany_Discord. :)
nite Nittany_Discord
J_E_Smith71: shopped
redraptor369: i oved tht part

Goodnight Nittany_Discord

Ello Ponies
Derpy_Hooves: Haven't looked into it yet just heard it
It's ok twilight, you've just doomed us all
*faint*
I do love the pun at the end with AJ and Rarity, though. :D
Awesome gif
night Nittany_Discord
What was the pun again?
0,14so Toonami's been leveling up
How so?
pun?
0,14they've brought back Tenchi Muyo
:P
NIce!
0,14and Inuyashi
CrystalPhoenix: Cadenza-pult
*Nice
Also, Pinkie-Palooza is now canon
say did Shining's horn get fixed at the end? cant remember
Anyone here ever seen Cyborg 009?
Nice :3
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yep, the curse was broken.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yes
Go Cadance dart!!
They brought back Inuyasha?
CriticKitten: eeyup
Didn't that show get played to death already? XD
You mean OG Twilight?
Welpl, heading off to bed. Night, and don't kill each other.
Night, AttackWithHugs|Zzz. :)
nite AttackWithHugs|Zzz and we will try not to lol
I love it, but still, I think they've shown the season like twenty times
I'll try not to. :D
I'm just wondering, has there been any MLP villain that's lasted more than two episodes?
Night AttackWithHugs|Zzz :)
latas AttackWithHugs|Zzz
more than 2?
Not as of yet, Lijielong.
I dont think so.
/me hugs AJIsAwesome|Busy, NocturnalBlade, thelonepony, HoodyNinja, and ruffles Jmo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87AxVZekZcE
Lijielong: Trixie
/me hugs AttackWithHugs|Zzz back "Take care" :)
/me noms on AttackWithHugs|Zzz :3
/me nuzzles AttackWithHugs|Zzz
Night Fluffeh :3
/me is hugged
Night Jaymoo
Can't really call Trixie a villain
Sombra could come back
That villian sucked
Not when compared to NMM, Discord, or Chrysalis
I hope he does.
Other than that, great premier
HoodyNinja!!!!!
His horn broke off before he exploded, and he can work magic with the detached horn
thelonepony!
I've been here :I
/me hugs HoodyNinja :3
and another demonstration of Celestia's astounding ineptitude
superretroworld
Or his horn was all that was left
/me soooo fulllll
Also, the whole "dark magic" concept is still a mystery.
We also know that Celestia's capable of it (as well as Twilight), which brings up some interesting questions on what Celestia knows about magic.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: They kinda set themselves up for a consistent theme with the new season, maybe it will gt explained
what caught my interest was the book Luna pulled out at the end
^
She knows how to shoot lasers
CrystalPhoenix: Same.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVMuMZ2bILU
that seems about it
I wonder what that book is/contains.
AJIsAwesome|Busy, what got me curious was the logo
What was it?
I wonder if the episodes will related to previous ones. Seeing as we have as short season
more so than before
13a proper arc would be nice
hold on
1313-ep anime does it all the time
13maybe they caught on
also, spike technically saved the world. i think thats pretty awesome
Shizuka: Well said
Maybe this season will be one big arc season.
13we won't know til next week anyway
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed. Spike got a lot of love.
Wait
I love spike
Spike \:3/
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this.
Spike is awesome
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Hc3II0Akw
I love how Shining armor just hurled his bride at spike
Spike will kill you for fun
that automatically redeems him
2 episode down, 11 to go
Shizuka: Are you fine with us discussing this or do you want us to wait till tomorrow?
13go forit
Ok.
Lijielong: wouldve been interesting if he missed and threw her into a wall
AJIsAwesome|Busy: No one's said a thing so far :I
13we're discussing when the spoiler blanket should fall
Got it.
Nah, she would have glided away
i hate instagram stalkers -.-
One thing I never knew was that Cadance was originally going to be a unicorn.
I thought Luna would secretly travel to help Twilight Sparkle, since she wasn't entirely convinced of her ability
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SLMA4Yy8g4
Anyone wonder HOW Sombra raised to power?
I just realized i forgot the rule about spoilers
DerpyMuffins: Me.
Sorry
AJIsAwesome|Busy, http://i.imgur.com/7HQPN.jpg
i think itd be best if spoilers werent allowed til its shown ehre again, imo
twilight_sprinkle: agreed lol about time they made Spike epic :D
please describe the content of the logo
13last season it was usually sunday morning, i forget if we bumped it down to after euro movie night when we re-air
13which btw we'll be working on that tomorrow <<
I thought so too. What's up with the cold shoulder Luna gave Twi?
CrystalPhoenix: Stars and swirls? What abou-
WAIT
exactly
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
13yeah reddit's been that far for hours :3
Shizuka: And you still haven't seen it so i feel dirty giving it away in front of you
indubitably AJIsAwesome|Busy
13eh, i never care about spoilers
AJIsAwesome|Busy: that more oreos are required?
twilight_sprinkle: :D
I don't see beards on that book :I
not too much to spoil
13unless you sat down and typed out the entire episode, i know there's more than people tell me
OBJECTION http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX7N7YtPfL0
just a bunch of mary sue shinanigans
Inb4 Twilight becoming Alicorn is canon
13everyone knows rosebud is his sled, how many people know what the rest of the movie was
That would be terrible
Shizuka: you spoiled the movie for me
twilight should stay unicorn, but become ruler
I hate instagram stalkerssssss D:
13quite likely as a response to the previous two seasons doing nothing with luna
._.
Bruce Willis was dead Aerith Dies Soylent Green is people It was actually Earth She's actually a dude
has anyone Operation Stranglehold or its sequel A Better Tommorow? pretty good stories plus some Metal Gear Solid 3 references :D hope to see Crab Battle soon
im so random
xD
13wait which is that last
purple magic is probably going to become the next queen horse
13it was earth is planet of the apes, which is she's a dude?
purple horse is MLG
The Crying Game
13oh yes
twilight_sprinkle: Yellow tree*

http://i781.photobucket.com/albums/yy96/Auraion_VZ/screenshawt-1.png
I can
you have turn your entire body around or the hoodi block your view
/me gets stuck
13so question for those of you that have seen my crysis streams
42!
>.>
<.<
13if it gets choppy does it stutter or does it just show a lower framerate?
it was choppy?
^
not seeing a stream currently Shizu
I don't pay attention to the crysis streams :I
13well at least at the finale
13some of the water effects had it chugging down around 15fps
...ok thats just stupid! :D
hm, i dont remember im afraid
since we can still post spoilers http://youtu.be/ewpMsy2x75I
Hello everypony!
Ahh, I wasn't there for that stream then
Ohai Rex_Mundi
i refreshed and still no stream drat
13i ask because i'm not sure how often gta4 holds above 30fps, especially if dxtory is latched on
Hi Rex_Mundi :)
13so dunno if it would be choppy or if you would see the same framerate i do
CrystalPhoenix: Wait, the ep is out, how is it spoilers?
Oh wait
Nvm
oi hoodi, u r so dum :I
oy Rex_Mundi, how goes life
goes life good!
shuddap spriggles im smartur ten u
What was our favorite song in the episode?
Can we talk about the season 3 commercials?
okay u convinsd me ;~;
oi' stop startin' you two :I
GAK
Punkie_Pue, the reprise of the test song
none of the songs were particularly good
gak gak gak
the twi one was cute as hell though
oy stop moderating tehlownponeh
Buytoast: Crystal fair is excellent
nyeh
Do you think Twilight was prepared?
when i saw the twi song originally, i thought it was about her failing an actual test, which i thought wouldve been a great lesson
Twilight was not prepared!
for a test, yes, for a saving the world ordeal, no
Those songs were... eh
oi' stop startin hoodienhja
HoodyNinja: to blow up her house? hell yea :D
She wasn't prepared for this~
oh boy
Neh
Once I start I can't stop
:I
wel start stopin hoodi :I
>:I
:K
okay spriggles
i will
...
/me speech 26
failure happens sometimes would make a great lesson for the show
I can't believe this isn't old yet
What isn't old?
what isnt old yet?
Quick_Thinker: It hasn't?
Yet*
how long has it been since "gak" was relevent in the chat?
but the lesson in this double episode was self-sacrifice
Quick_Thinker: yeah thats what i thought. i thought itd be about her just blatanlty failing a test with no excuses, and learning to accept it. imo thats a very important lesson
about 13 hours
The lesson wasn't very well played
then it must be safe
Who else hated the villian?
also best Crystal Pony http://fav.me/d5kpaff
So can we talk about the season 3 commercials or is that spoilers?
I hated this guy more than Chrysalis
HoodyNinja I got into this earlier about how he wasnt a good villaian
Rex_Mundi: spoilers for future eps no
[SWAG]Haku: He's not
Rex_Mundi: Don't mention a certain Pinkie moment
HoodyNinja I know, I said he wasn't
CrystalPhoenix: I have that saved as my favorites. I do have to say, her crystal design was fantastic.
lol cant believe Shining getting his magic cut off by those crystals ALREADY someone made a joke fic of it being somekind of Horn Transmitted Disease from Sombra...WTF?!
Nor certain equine companions of Celestia I take it as well
so any pictures of Crystal MAne 6?
Quick_Thinker: Yep, use the MLP Wiki
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Ya don't seem too busy o_O
But if Sombra just got more lines, screen time, and actual participating with the mane 6, he would have been cool
HoodyNinja: Just came back to see what chat's doing.
I need to this again. I don't remember half the episode.
see
Eh, he coulda used some more lines, but I don't like his design or his voice
Get back to work AJIsAwesome|Busy >:I
ok lets see if this fails again
Haku Sombra would have more screen time its just the shield was kinding of blocking all of it
:<
im back, i just hope everyone's done talking about...it.......
[SWAG]Haku: Maybe Sombra will come back?
One of my biggest tics about the episode was it all being some sort of test
/me slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
Yes, Rex_Mindu, me and someone else talked about this
;~;
What if Sombra secretly controlled the rest of Season3 so that he could show up in the season finale
[SWAG]Haku: Yes, "Okay Twilight, if you pass, good for you, if you fail, everyone you know will die"
say AJIsAwesome|Busy remove your busy for a sec pls
/me smacks twilight_sprinkle with the chancla >:I
HoodyNinja, let me guess you want him to have this kind of design http://i.imgur.com/N10sI.png and have him speak in a mexican accent?
HoodyNinja I said almost the exact same thing
Twould be better
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large thelonepony
lol i LOVE the Assassin's Creed/Season 3 banner :D
:<
AJIsAwesome: hm ok thanks :D
:D
Ew, what smells?
*huggies AJIsAwesome*
It stinks in here
HoodyNinja: u
/me hugs Rex_Mundi. :)
well im glad im not getting slapped
I didnt want a goofy villain, we got discord for that, but nor did I want a pony who just didnt get what they deserved, like NMM
No, no, we need more lemon pledge
I wanted an actual villain, someone whos evil just to be evil
So, you wanted more chrysalis?
^ thats a cliche villian
[SWAG]Haku: Few good villains are evil just to be evil
Chrysalis wasnt evil, she was doing her duty as queen
crysallis i didnt find evil she needs to feed her people or else they die
13from what i hear the new villain wasn't really much of a character at all?
nope
13just shows up to provide plot tension?
13promptly defeated?
kind of really no choice on chrysis part
Shizuka You got that right
he was The Lich King mixed with Smokey the Bear
Megabyte was evil cause he was program to be
13that's why chrysalis was better
Taking over a country instead of living like you've always lived? Seems kinda evil
pretty much
and DANG is he a great Villain
Here's the Order of Villains
Shizuka: More like sauron in that he is trying to come back but just cant due to circumstances
Discord
Nightmare Moon
Chrysalis
13yes chrysalis kind of comes out of nowhere at the end of part 1 canterlot wedding, but that she was there is plausible
Every other antagonist form the show
Captain Sombrero
And at the bottom is Sombra
lol We need Elements of Harmony NOW! *MMPR theme* http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-92oEeb_lgis/T7AYiRxG30I/AAAAAAAApnk/P1vRGzlcSxk/s1600/185270+-+artist+needsmoarg4+g1+g1_to_g4+Green_Ranger+masquerade+Power_Rangers.png
Buytoast: :D
Sombra HAD potential, he was an actual evil guy!
13if they're setting this guy up to be a recurring problem, and the episode titles through december really don't suggest it much, they haven't started on the right foot
plus Discord and Chrysi had more of a Backstory this one we have no clue why he is evil they just say "HEART AS BLACK AS NIGHT"
Buytoast: :D
wow 4000 people was insase
insane*
But the way he was presented just wasnt very good
Chrysalis had no Backstory whatsoever
and Sombra had one
Quick_Thinker Actuall they had little to no background
Chrysalis was a pretty good villian, I just think she was overrated
13luna was part of the core mythos of the world in episode 1, discord was an escaped villain, chrysalis was a spy that spent a whole episode building herself up
Discord was a spirit of chaos turned to stone by Celestia and Luna
THATS HIS ACTUAL STORY RIGHT THERE
13i'm talking just in portrayal in the show anyway
Tirak was Tirak, and had Dragons 'n stuff
Chrysalis was a Twist
BTW, was Sombra defeated by Celestia and Luna?
Sombra was a unicorn filled with hatred
13for all three of them they existed in the world and were more slowly brought in
Hoody no Spike defeated him
You guys are taking things way too seriously
Anyone up for a game of Board Game http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSLU
He was defeated by them 1000 years ago
SPIKE
Lighten up
but then he came back
another game pls
This is PONIES
13this guy seems to have come from nowhere just to provide tension for this opener, even if he returns later in the season
Admiral Sombrero "Smokey LeRogue" Smokeyton was locked away by the two queen horses
though that's one thing that does get on my nerve
why 1000 years?
We NEED t take it seriously
Dont you think you are overthinking this a little bit?
it's always 1000 years
Quick_Thinker: No, in the beggining, when Celestia is explaining the Crystal Empire to Twilight, there is an image of the princesses defeating him
Whose up for a Extremely fun game all are welcome to join Board Game Online http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=bSLU
oh you mean the past
Discord was more than 1000 years
i tohught you mean who defeated him at the end
Come join it guys, everyone dies of Aids and such
13it's always 1000 years, nice round number that ensures the general population won't remember
Discord never had a time period
The empire dissapeard 1000 years ago, before Luna went dark, and Celestia still knows almost nothing about the empire
13face it, how many of you know what went on in 1000 AD
King Arther, the crusades
Shizuka: Do you?
etc etc
Hi guys!
people weren't washing their hands and were executed for questioning the church
BAM
I'm betting that there were things happening in 1000 AD.
That was more 12th century
Shizuka: Uhh.... Hawaii was first setteled... Roman empire was falling...
hello CrazyHippie
Things and stuff.
1000 AD a bit much
there was that war that happened in 1066

Hi sonicdude558.Are we just making cospiracies?
13but you get the idea
Why you obsesed with gak
idk whats going on
But from what we know, Equestrua wasnt much different 1000 years ago
GAK
All i see is GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK
13except for people that study history, the general public nowadays doesn't know what happened 1000 years ago
I am going to say this
FUCK
GAK
HoodyNinja: I think Chyraslis had the element of suprise on her side too, we knew about Sombra and expected a bunch from him. Chrys on the other hand we weren't expecting at all so when she was revealed we were so exicted over her (Just look at the reaction vids, everyone was like HOLY CRAP NEW VILLIAN), plus the Changeling fight was epic
Why would you want to do that, sonicdude558?
Spike didn't defeat Sombra, he delivered the crystal heart :I
Shizuka Celestia said no one knew about it, but Celestia WAS THERE
the only reason chrysalis was plausible is because they gave her the OP abilitty to transform into anyone
00,02is there anything on stream?
13that too
13not atm
nope
i hate it when shows d othat..
which in turn Hoody allowed him to be defeated
My guess is that there were/are tribes of ponies besides the 3 that made Equestria.
When the Empre WENR AWAY
HoodyNinja: Yes, but he was one of the main contributers of saving the empire.
13thought of doing gta4 but it's raining pretty good here
who pinged me
Shizuka you should play Board Game Online :D
SuperBrony64 moo
13i've played before
11,02JRP2234: Moo o.o
u do GTA 4 can i join :D
i guess you could say that Captain Sombrone's plan...
i have it on steam
BTW what was up with Cadence being called "The Crystal Princess" at the end? Am I the only one who caught that?
WENT UP IN SMOKE

/me throws 50 chewable twi plushies into the chat
to make a royal coronation toy event or something
flutterchu this is for you
HoodyNinja, Cadence IS the crystal princess if that wasn't obvious enough
anything that sounds impressive can sell sell sell
cutie mark, hair
sonicdude558: why>
and they could make a queen cadance toy line and shit
8?
The whole episode was just poorly written, I think we can all agree on that
It would have been a better twist if Shining had been been possesed by Sombra at the beginning and Sombra was using Shining as a vessel
with king armor
*/
*?
really it's all about how much they can milk out of the concept
[SWAG]Haku: I liked how it was written, just not the villian
That would felt like the royal canterlot episode

My mom isn't in best of health... My only hope is that she won't leave us too soon...

yes, rewatch season 3. i'll do that after this :P

serbia doesn't know about al bundy?
:l
:/
>:/
:)
:f
i dont know about el bundi either
yeah, eastern europe is stuck in the stone age...
serbia in particular blames the west for everything
people raised there are grown to become nationalistic
I thought they blame croatia for everything
13Native-Warrior: Do not spam.
Alchemist: croatia, albania, and the west
and none of "that" which must not be spoken
:|
well, nato attacked them, bombed their infrastructure, slaughtered civilians, armed terrorists
Dat screen.
So when do we get some more pony stuff?
Native-Warrior: Go to youtube for that.
well, serbia commited genocide against croatia
Native-Warrior: There are other things you know.
Native-Warrior, eww ponies >.>
and also against albanians i think
Ponies, gaaaaaaaaay
AdamTheDuck: IKR, who watches stuff like that?
everyone committed genocide in this war
AdamTheDuck: Imagine if there were like grown men watching it too!
Isnt it supposed to be playing 24/7?
Yeah I think in the conflict the serbians were the aggressors, but Im not really sure.
DaringDerpy: well it is a war... that's what they're all about
Streams, yes.
Native-Warrior, 24/7 ponies? Oh my
Ponies. no.
They stream when they feel like it.
^
Weird
^^
Alchemist: well asking them sure wont help, theyll never admit to it
Native-Warrior, Why aren't there ponies on the stream?
We dont stream My Little Pony all day every day, because not all bronies want to see My Little Pony 24/7. We show FiM-related material plenty of times throughout the week. Bronystates main goal is to provide entertainment for all bronies.
Ask for ponies, get G 3.6
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9emjalsOsE
DeathStar: not really...it was a proxy between russia and nato...fueling the ethnic tensions was not necessary...but they did it
What AdamTheDuck said.
Ooohhh I see.
Fair enough.
gimme summa dat ParagonX9
Also I suggest you read http://www.bronystate.net/faq/ and http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
speaking of G3. i'll never get that image out of my head
How the fuck does a Russian sound like a rastaman?
dont ask x.x
Not so much FAQ, but rules are a must.
ooh, impossible game OST :)
this is an honest question
killa ll athe niggers
DaringDerpy: I'm to tired to talk about this stuff ^^; but the bottom line is all wars suck and are best avoided
and while we're on that topic http://soundcloud.com/sadhudubstep/gangnam-style-sadhu-remix
its funny, if you doubt that a serbian is telling the truth, he immediately assumes youre a croat or albanian
lol
kk
I just needed to watch something to perk me up
dem blood tire marks
I have problems hearing what he's saying.
Just me?
the serbian government just forces nationalism, serbs that are smart enough to overcome it are pretty nice people, they say its hard to live there if you dont agree with the nationalism

yeah when didja pass out sumi
Anyone else just getting VLC player and no sound? :<
http://i.imgur.com/4lPzf.jpg erm...
I'm getting mostly static jiss
00,10awww I missed just another day in Liberty city
13well in any case, done now
13sumi we should figure out multiplayer some time :#
00,10indeed
What on earth is going on here?
00,10and no i have not recoverd.
00,10recover requires rest, I have had none
Sumica : you feeling ill?
00,10not ill no, just you know streamed from start of BMN till end of New pony ep
13sumi works hard
00,10only 16 hour stream=p
Sumica: you mean from friday to saturday?
ONLY?
00,10then went to my paying job till just now
ONLY 16 hours?
Jesus Sumica...
13correction
13sumi works crazy hard
^
^^
Jeez dude, do you not know the term "Sleep"?
Sumica : do rest please
Sumica, ^ for your own good.
or "Rest"? "Relaxation"? "Doing absolutely nothing for the hell of it"?
00,10Unfortunatly I am past the rest phase, need to carry on till I would normaly sleep now cause my body thinks it's time to be up
Pfft, screw your internal clock
just rest.
Sumica : just take it easy please
00,10all i would end up doing is laying down till I would normaly sleep
better than on-and-off sleep with freakin' cold symptoms. Stupid flu shot...
your eternal clock can wait
its not good. Waking up at 6 in the evening throws you off balance big time
00,10I cant force my self to sleep early
you can with nyquil
or a very large mallet
00,10only think that will knock me out requires a prescription
cone
00,10and you dont want to see me on Percodan
00,10I get loopy and fuck on that
I think I read that wrong..
Sumica : want some coffie?
Sumica, then please, just take it easy.
00,10nah i prefer my caffeene cold
00,10oh I will
ask your perscription doctor if Lymphozapazine is right for you
00,10I have all day off tomorrow
Nice.
OH, I understand what you meant! I thought you meant you go and actually . . . yeah. Nevermind.
00,10what horny?
Hey Sumica! Lets go bowling!
most of you are thinking sumi is insane, but you would be wrong
00,10dont need meds for that
The f-word can be very misleading to a teenage mind.
Sumica and horny nah never
you know what they say
night
A pill in the mouth makes your mind travel south.
night
Buytoast: roofies?
Didn't ArchieV do a remix of BBBFF?
many people did a remix of BBBFF
XAX : dont know but i hope he does
and every other song in MLP with lyrics
Dj WUBS will be coffiee equivilent
I swore he did. Apparently he took down all his pone music, though.
I'm almost certain he did one. Pretty sure it was one of the first BBBFF remixes after the episode...
well, you know what they say
"x"
"x everywhere"
Borning stream is boring
SSHHHT!!

robbing stores
Playing a game, listening to music.
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
;~;
Just modding Oblivion

Stream is more like chat
And if i wanted chat
i would look in a mirror
Zack, please try harder.
and find nothing
You're being too obvious.
:'(
Go and attempt to try 4chan or some forum instead of wasting your time trying here.
You aren't even getting your bite.
4chan isnt internet
I don't give a shit.
4chan is a chasm of rape
You're proving to be a moron.

Im getting a "cone" symbol.
Still around Afflict?

shizu did you forget to stop stream
Hm, this is interesting. :A
*:S
So I heard there's going to be a S3 Derpy episode... Can anyone confirm this?
That's the symbol for VCL
pony_4908: Doubt it.
Hm.
13no it's stopped
00,10all the dings
00,10well lets bump who ever this is off
Since we had the Derpy debacle in season 2, I doubt Derpy will ever get an episode.
all i hear is a hiss of air
^
yeah sorry I'll watch it in a sec, I'm too lazy to move right now :p
hissssssssss
:>
:D
It's just a video game song with a still image.
buffering nau
sound doesn't work on this computer though haha
Well, that would be a problem. XD
00,10that was realy odd
what is the release schedule for s3 episodes, once every week/2 weeks
crossed eyed pete won't get an episode
00,10seeing as shzu fon use VLC
00,10dont use*
I thought it was every Saturday for 13 weeks, starting today.
... It'd better be once a week, at least.
13ohhhhh
13vlc?
Yes
13that would be dari still going then
Weird... A song from Super Donkey Kong has a video relating to Aki Toyosaki (A seiyuu I'm a fan of) in the "related" videos displayed to the side...
GTA PONYVILLE
Hmm.....that's weird. :S
Dari still going? .-.
13he crashed off after the b movie
13apparently he still isn't around
So he doesn't know?
I think the related videos are affected by the videos you watch often
Wouldn't be surprised if he was out playing with his imaginary friends :>
....
Morning everybrony.
DWR would know.
Mornin' Malavolent
Hi, Malavolent. :)
Oh, 4200 people went to sleep already?
Yep. :D
Weaklings.
We don't need them.
It has to be, since I don't know of a connection between Donkey Kong video games and Aki Toyosaki...
Well they both exist, so there's a connection
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Morning? What is this morning? It is night. Time where luna rules!
is Gak still alive?
-_-
Or is it a dead meme already
Gak

i wasn't even around for it's beginning and i could tell it was DOA
Gak is back?
gakgakgak

Afflict, do you watch anime? XD
Creeper D:

(Not sure if I've asked you before... Or had anime come up in conversation while you were around... >->)
no I don't haha

but to be fair, I haven't really given it a chance yet
Well, that's insulting.

Ok.

ojeez Sins of the solar empire. Always wanted to check this out
When will you be streaming the recent S3 premiere since dari didn't?
Ohai Sumica
No questions for you Ayejay.
:<
:>
;~;
Sumica: I love that ptfo means so many things
Pass the fuck out?
more or less
I know it by "play the fucking objective".
Adam you know nothing.
:>
please the fat overlord
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
punch the fat orangutan
so who's playin Spore
Buytoast, Sumi is playing Sins of a Solar Empire
guess they ripped off that last level of Spore
back
SoAE came out before Spore.
So point made invalid.
Welcome back!
actually that was his 1st planat he found :(
SoSE*
thanks
just because something was made first doesn't mean it can't rip off the thing made after it
Oh yeah cause they totally wanted to steal content from another game.
I've been thinking about starting a spyro blog
Oh?
Dunno if I should
I'd probably just post spyro fanart and about other stuff going on in the spyro community
Ah.
I might just do it and see how it goes
It would help though if the spyro community was more active
Yeah... Sometimes it's hard to validate starting something like that if there isn't an incredible amount of activity within the community it relates to.
/me rolls around ded chat
I think it would be kinda fun though, if I had some followers
:D
/me would rather not roll around, because he's in he'd and he just made it
he's in bed*
: |
XAX you're drunk go home
^
Yeah.
SpeccyRush: XD that was le funny
I am home.
Goodnight Shizuschlafen
NIght, Shizuschlafen. :)
Anywho, I'm going to head off now, if I don't go watch any anime now, I'm risking starting a streak of two nights in a row without watching any anime!

Hi, Mr_Anybody. :)
Damn, missed Season 3 D:
Hello Mr_Anybody

^
seriously it's taking over my mind
hello everypony
Hi, Shaker. :)

05http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mda9s63ubO1rkk03fo1_500.png

00,02AJIsAwesome, to be fair it was a lot of ad
True.
But 4 times in a row?
00,02wonder if it was intentional
dat patrick
They've already made remixes of it.
:) Ignorance is bliss as far as gak goes - glad I didn't take my computer to the meetup afterall - weren't that many outlets in that room anyways
THey've even made a Winter Gak Up. :S
i wonder if gak was the fastest meme to be created?
Maybe it is.
seriously it was just yesterday
.-.
00,02not even 24 hours
^
It was only a couple of hours before the meme was made.
i was there and man was it spamcentral
but opinions are forbidden
yeah, gak is back
i have headphones and ears so i'm forced to listen
That Westchase Marriot is the same place Oni Con held their convention in '09 - very cramped for a con that size, which is why they eventually moved to Galveston
WHY WAS I FORCED TO HAVE EARS?!
htere's even a gak fluffeh now
thought is was familiar til I saw it again for myself
thumbs are overrated
^

when the camer is too close, you can see, their eyes are derp
*camera
there is no derp where there's poneh
THis is the only thing that's keeping me from crying. ON THE VERGE OF TEARS! And I need to go to bed. But if I'm not distracted constantly.
Is she supposed to be Wind Whistler?
what in the flying fuck is this
lol Hisin
MLP G3 or sumfin'
Dem Ladybugs are silly
he said pickle
yay Pinkie Jazz
squink
Squink
GAK
and all the parents in the audience look bored to tears
GAK
Well I should probably leave instead of crying to you people more. You probably think i'm lying about being sad anyway.
GAK?
Gak is back!
GAK everywhere
Caramel DAT PUN!!
what if a squink is a pinkie sense combo?
you can frrrt it!
GAK!?
no
i dont want to
Looking at the parents forcing themselves to smile and pretend to enjoy this is amusing.
Damn i lost the game
:D
I HAVE DONE IT
Dammit you made me lost the game you ass
i lost the game
i just won the game
:'( Poor costumes
Im thinking about whiskey in a glass - I dont care if its 6 am
I'm not playing "The Game"
:P Good actors
Kandarihu, you are and you just lost it ^^
If you know what the game is at some point you're always playing it... for lif
hi everyo- oh this again xD
positively pink!
that is the rules
what the fuck am I watching
G3 ponies
DAT PLOT!!!
pony_2153 pony hell
Sumica : indeed
hay Lil_B
It's time for a PAAAAAARTEY
hey Invi :)
SPACE doesnot excites
its 2 hours
i may be a nolife, but on the app im level 49 now ^^"
this is actually better than the G4 Life action Stage Performance they did somewhere once
one does simply not perform MLP live
I almosty forgot. Tell flyboy that I'm sorry if you see him on. I would appreciate someone doing so. But who would want to do something for me. Little old me who everyone ignores. Who everyone uses their tiny little brain to torment till they are on the verge of suicide. YES BTW A FEW DAYS AGO I PUT SCIZZORS IN A POWER SOCKET AND IF IT WASN'T FOR MY FRIEND I WOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW!
Sorry sorry.
Lil_B: talking about that is like talking about that one club
pony_2153: It's called the "World's Biggest Tea Party", a live-action stage musical kigurumi extravaganza based on G3 for the most part.
Snow which one club?
Does anyone ever feel bad for the people in the costumes at children's parties.
no
nope, they are cool
they kissed
they get paid for it
Lil_B: the one that starts with a F
aaaahh that Nuzzle
why does she always whistle? does she have a obsessive-compilsion disorder?
unicormia?
Raising a child from her infancy changes a person. Those of us who have never been parents might not be able to understand.
No she is just the pony equivalent of a redneck
Invi this Pegasus always Whisles in G3, because she's a Pagasus, and Birds and Stuff...
sounds legit.
Ithink her name is WindWHISTLER?
Lil_B, so... it's a genetic obsessive-compilsive disorder :D
cookies
dat poor bird...
come rainbow, let's make some cupcakes :O
No coffie for pinkie
Well that pegasus wasn't whistling.
I think Pinkie has way too much sugar as it is
I might get hate for this but fuck it.... Any pony stuff that isn't MLP has a 90% chance of sucking.
dat song was pretty catchy
it's all mlp
I just need to go okay? Before I do something that will damage my reputation any more. ust remember tell Flyboy i'm sorry.
its just isnt FiM
maybe not fim, but definetely mlp
Hisin : a chance of GAKing
by mlp i mean the show
DaCakeofObst, Pony vs Pony isn't MLP
flyboy, some random guy is sorry
i hope GAK can make it.
Pinkie asking rarity for streamers
GAK is BAK
Hisin: well, now - but prior to G4 ponies were popular enough to still get renewed series
well, the Trailer for the Nerd Movie looks Promising
hey guys
it has been around for years
aand what the hell is that?
Lil_B, wreck it ralph?
Hasn't the gak commercial been running since at least september?
Invi nope Angry Video Game Movie
I remember wanting gak when I was a kid.
gak is Broken
but but but i dont know how -whistles-
hey Eli !
Lil_B, nice
:\
dat pun spike
the Ladybugs are Spike's bitches ^^
hey Lil_B. haven't seen you at the premiere. where you there?
Maybe DaCakeofObst is watching the HUB all day and night long and had a nice long break from seeing Gak ads until now.
Well yes but because little girls enjoyed them little girls have no sense of good entertainment or bad but i don't blame them for that
spike gets all the bitches
dat blood on my keyboard
nooo
uhmmm
i know this song? o.o
Spike reminds me of dragon tails
not this song :<
IMA LITTLE TEAPOT
>..
I'm just saying that before FiM mlp was stuff only little girls and their mothers could enjoy
MY EARS!
ow my head
Eli hes, but stayd in 2 other rooms mostly with regulars, the Main Rooms are to crowded :/
CO/ teapod
and Sumica this pains me greatly... i really^2 hope bronies will never get to join in that
How long left?
little girls enjoyed, their mothers had to :D:D
tell me when its over please
after this im taking pain meds
Cloudchaser, noh
Yep. No I'm defenatly leaning this time... Just forget I was ever on here tonight okay? Just forget everything I said.
Lil_B: well we were on the special room for the regulars
-clings to cloudchaser-
Eli which one?
this reminds me, even thou its not related to g3, i still have a g1 video tape somewhere
#bronystateregulars
Well I think that maybe parents were desensitized to their kids' stuff by parent-friendly stuff like Sesame Street.
EVERYONE
Invite ALL the ponies
Swag.
SHES GOT THE SWAG!
everyone is there... except spike :D
Eli aww, that one xD I wanted to get in there too, but I forgot the correct name >.< I was in the spike chatroom
pony fun
But then again, I hear that Sesame Street was retooled based on a study about children's learning, and it's all about repetition now.
This is even worse than Firendship is Magic live
i just heard pony porn
i feel bad
its more enjoyable then that other one
when the episode comes on im in twilight sparkle room
that boy was Caramel
HEHE
Jeremias: Consider the source material.
i wish the real show had that many songs
hes loves him?
sunny daze
i still want Caramel on my app!
Jeremias, this is better than the Live show of FiM. This has production values to it. the FiM live show is cheapsauce
is a filly in fim
Dat Post Office
bye everypony. keep Pink :D
i think there are more songs in this show than in complete S1
:O lucky guy!
bye Invi !
its a conspiracy i tell you
Caramel i want to be your friend
im busy building vynils and fluttershy's house atm
pokemon taught me words like paralysis
and paralyze
hehe
caramel?
suddenly Caramel
Caramel in stream
DA WHY ARE YOU ON STREAM
Hisin, so an absense of Sesame Street would open the door to them growing up to become entrepreneurs?
00,10you can add me on the pony app too
he lost the grass seeds agian
can you type it in chat?
HES GONE!
00,10Chace_sumica
ValtheJean
pony app?
lvl 49 here :P
Caramel flash
What did i just walk into
whoa
positively pink fun!
how good is the Pony app? is it that game we saw?
im Lafka on the app
how they do that?
The best... show... ever... @_@
back legs are fake
O RLY?
11,01Hi.
This makes me realize how terrifying Fim would be if it was real.
front legs are real
That what I really looked like B4?
hi Nittany_Discord
Zack: NO WAY
is that berney?
barney*
RAINBOWS DARLING
i need a new laptop then i can get bunch of things i cant on this
I wonder if it's coming out on PC. I don't have a smartphone and I don't want one.
Total hype
WHAT?
pretty sure that is barney's cousin or some shit
since it shuts off sometimes..
just get a simulator for android
spike is about...15 years?
I could see it being a facebook game
i have an ipod touch..
pony times 7
They have emulators for PC's to fake a phone?
it looks like a facebook game from a screenshot i saw is it
Cuz from what I've seen it plays like a lot of facebook games
pinky in thr air!
I'd be okay with it if they made it a facebook game.
Gold_Demona, I'm avoid Facebook for about the same reason I'm avoiding smartphones.
Facebook games are bad
royal sound
now its not
Zack: THIS version of Spike is about.... 3450 years old, give or take +- 100. But he's taken a LOT of long naps.
Kencolt at least to run several Apps and Games of phones
I'm addicted to facebook games... o_o
i cant play fb game anymore i guess since this laptop :\
And the kid tries to drink the card.
Gold_Demona thats... bad :/
Caramel do you still have that tea cup?
Sumica: you sure its that name? i cant seem to find you.
thats what they are made for but they are bad
china? in what region of equestria is this?
When my mom discovered the internet she got addicted to a facebook game called Petville and wasted nearly $200 on it.
Caramel what level are you?
I think the main reason i hate face book games is the energy system
im lvl 49
they said china
the worst part is that stupid energy system
what is that app you all talk about?
pluto is a planet
it is not canon anymore
we were taught it was a planet when we were kids so
it will be a planet forever
it's no planet
i know but
look, at least 5 min since I saw the last Pony...
I hate "Free-to-Play" games that have stuff you can buy in-game because in the end its saps more money from you then a game that you pay for straight up.
which is why i hate mose facebook games
Pluto?
same here
they taught us it was a planet
i need him for a quest
im Lafka
:D
and then it was changed
yes
That app sounds exactly like a typical facebook game. You get stuff for adding lots of friends (or nlock with actual money)
will be a planet in my mind
unlock*
Hisin, I like Free to Play games. I don't have lots of money to spend anyway, so I learn to generally make do without.
i need 90 gems for rarity D:
The fun has been doubled!
Good lord what is this
My problem with that is with the "Free-to-Play" games you can barely do anything unless you pay
scootaloo why?
Free to play the way DotA 2 and LoL do it is the best
they usually severely restrict you in till you buy their membership or whatever
there are some f2p which are not p2win, like LoL
razzledazzle
Hisin, I have only played a few F2P games that are really like that. Those are the worst of the f2p.
the last time i checked, DotA2 was p2p
its free brah
no its not
GAKMAN: The World's Biggest Tea Party, a G3 based live action musical made specifically for kids. And to it's credit, the kids apparently LOVE it. Us, on the other hand...
Then again, the absolutely worst case of it was something that I spared myself the indignity of trying to play it.
you could pay for a bate key but you dont need to
;)
WTf is this!!!!1111
Ok, guys... Here's a thought of mine: Is Spike for Twilight Sparkle as Sam was for Frodo?
When does it end
is it over?
I dont like disco
it's 27,99 on steam
o__o
Would it earn me a lynching to say that I don't hate this?
Ah man Badass Spike
o_O
rainbowdash is a mix here between rainbow dash and rarity
in here*
hello I from Russia
disco dash
I thought spike was just severely friendzoned
:)
Some game that plays like Legend of Zelda, but it if you play it without paying into it, you're a ghost that is LITERALLY unable to physically interact with ANYTHING
Disco Dash???
wtf
:D
why
;_;
IS THIS ABOUT ME?!?!?!
hello I from Russia
dsico dash
Yay! I'm a cool kid! :D
needs more swanky Slap Bass
hello I from Russia
Becasue its i n Beta and you can get free Beta keys
:O
Damn this is just crazy
same here
o__o
spike is DA BOUSE OF DEM BITCHES
There's a reason "bronies" didn't exist before G4....
hello I from Russia
:D:[
:S
you can pay for Beta if you want but you dont have to
hello I from Russia
Hisin: they always exsisted
Hello pone_305

GAK is BAK
darlings

GAK IS BAK!?!?!?!

Hisin: dont do that ever again
G 3.5 is the Chibbi Dub with the Giant Heads and/or the Newborn Cuties
GAK IS BAK!!!!!!!
i dont see the balloon
GAK GAK GAK

I'm growing worried about how captivating I find this
Hisin: your use of a meme is bad and you shoudl feel bad
GAK is the smooze!?
Why you gotta hate :P
:o
hip hip horray
YOU CAN FRRRT IT
GAK is the Smooze Darlings!

Well.

The moment when that whole thing was an intro.

Man what would the show be like without Ingram
Like this.
Depends on who it is
That would suck
If it's the same person that did the music here, then yeah it'd be the same
did she just blush?
I severely suspect that Faust was NOT inspired by this. Not at all.
So many adverbs

Firefly is almost as good a flyer as Lunchpad
XD
Hello
Suddenly, pegassus
And talking
firefly
meow
where you going?
Same people, now that I think about it.
Hrm
Mount that pony
<---- I think.. this is kidnapping?
firefly telling people to ride her
and thusly Real Pony was forgotten forever and Megan was never seen again
in case you dont know, firefly was actually spposed to be in FIM. but they didnt get the license, so they changed her color scheme and name
guess into whom
Vordox well... she was willing I guess
Song INC
Ah! So Sandy Duncan played Firefly :D
and they just leave that pony behind
a friend of my roda a horse once without a saddle
What happened to the apolcalypze?
rode*
WE only have a month to live guys
LOLING
in fact, the only pony in FIM which they have the license for is applejack
he was talking high pitched all day
Its nearly 21 December
the others were supposed to be pre g4 characters too
"laughing quite out loud" lqol
/me wanted to be Megan as a kid...
Dark_Horst: They had a lot of the names still, but... well, there was stuff.
i can live without google if it really happens
So where you taking me?
Sandy Duncan is best pony
TO MY WORLD
this was megan everypony, she was here to help us

pony_3981, I'm guessing that the merger/acquisition talks that Hasbro is having with Disney is so that Hasbro can acquire rights to all elements of the G1 cartoons.

SCORPAN FOR HERO
Vordox, It's a TV special, so about an hour
this show has alot of nordic themes to it
Gold_Demona: So which is better? G1 movie, the 2 parters of G4, which is the better? :P
i has lyra and im happy with her :D

What agme are they talking about anyway!?
As far as gens before G4, I'm biased to G1 because that's what I grew up watching.

11,01Stream is offline right now.

oh..
how does somoene stream?
Does anyone know what channel MLP would be in the UK? I have used youtube before I found this :(
Got a Xyzzy game open password pony
Good afternoon everyone :)
Obzezzed, I think I read something about MLP not being on telly in the UK, I could be wrong though.
Ponies aren't shown on tv outside NA
Hi MLP_Brovakiin
ooooh my... are you kidding me?
i cant believe the internet...
Zamer: Of course they are. Haven't you seen all the dubs?
not always
Pop Tarts, BronyCon, ComiCon, Think Geek
but mainly the Pop Tarts
yea it slipped my mind when i typed that
plus i got disctracted by the smell of bacon
XD
everywhere gets ramen right?
ramen is awesome
http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp Room for 6 Pass is pony
aniderp, Do you mean REAL ramen, or the cheapo-deluxe kind?
uhh
any xD
Ramen?
I wanna try real ramen someday. :3
Ramen noodles
Ramen Darling!
What is that?
the store stuff is a cup is the cheap?
really salty..
it's cup noodles
but its not bad
oh, Pot Noodles
but really salty
That's the cheap stuff
they have a bad reputation here XD
except them chinese places
i stopped eating them when i found out the chemical they use to preserve the noodles have a direct link to cancer
i wanna go back it was good food
Isn't Ramen Japanese tho?
well
chinese/japanese i think
Does anyone know if the second episode of LPS is on youtube or anywhere?
the thing about noodles is that you need to get the exact right ones otherwise they taste so bad
Zamer, Umm... If you listen to media at aqll, EVERYTHING has a link to cancer.
Literally. Everything
Everything causes cancer
LPS?
so i could have brain cancer?
from my laptop?
lol Gold_Demona
Zamer can you give me the name of the Ingridiance?
Gold_Demona, for of cancer causes cancer. ;)
I remember at one point they said Coffee causes cancer
and headphones/earbuds
fear
I got assburgers instead of cancer
Friggin coffee
does suizide cause cancer?
can someone explain this Gak meme please!
its not even a meme its some retarded shit we all say for no paticular reason
I forgot what's the wax is called let me see if i can find it
Lil_B, depends on the method, but general rule of thumb is that the cancer doesn't get worse if you are successful
Obzezzed: during the broadcast of Crystal Empire, there were a lot of commercials for this gooey stuff called gak
Because of this, I don't believe anything that says "this stuff causes cancer".
I wonder if gak causes cancer
RainbowAsh guess I found my new Hobby hopefully it's something I can get good in, to inspire people
air is deadly, it only works so slow it needs at least 80 years to work
the sun causes cancer so be very afraid
drawing causes cancer? pft wont beleive that
Gold_Demona, because a favorite beverage of yours was once claimed to cause cancer you don't believe anything causes cancer anymore?
You know, 100% of people who breathe air eventually die. >.>
sun causes skin cancer > Celestia causes cancer
no, Ultraviolet light from the sun causes cancer
breathing actually is bad, oxygen breaks down the cells over time :P
i think you're on to something gold
That's why I love Luna you can't get cancer from her
same!
11,01Yay.
RainbowAsh, No, not just that. It's that they do this sort of thing with EVERY consumable product
11,01Unless you get moon cancer.
there is no such thing as moon cancer
o.O
:P
well the chat i mod is being good so..
also, even without sunlight, you're usually exposed to low levels of space radiation
lets check the other one..
They suddenly say "This causes cancer" and then some months later they turn around and say "this stuff's GOOD FOR YOU" and then they turn right back around and say "THIS STUFF WILL MAKE YOU FAT STOP CONSUMING IT!!!"
I question who brought this topic up.
Gold_Demona, well, it's a promising line of research for uncreative (and morally bankrupt) researchers: Just feed lots of some product to rats and see if they get sick more often than a control group.
Hisin: we do not age, we are slowly being decomposed
all good
All we are doing is using physical bodies to interact with since we lost access to our spiritaul link to the universe
Gold_Demona: the reason they say that almost any food causes cancer is to avoid lawsuits (see the lawsuits won by the people who got cancer from smoking and they sue the tobacco companies for not making this risk clear).
well snow at least we know its possible to stop that decomposition
RainbowAsh, Yeah, but they flipflop their results around so much, it's impossible to believe any of it.
you really start to decompose after your 25th lifeyear
we just need to figure out how
is it possible that i can get taller?
damn Snow I don't want to be decomposed in 3 years
Alchemist, People can win lawsuits for anything, so that doesn't really surprise me
11,01Snow: Morbid.
it's because the legal system is a joke
im 5'0, a female and 20
11,01So I've been dying slowly for 4 years. Wish I would hurry up.
Morbid? ._.
HI!]\\
SNow: That's depressing. I'm 28. :<
i bet im shortest one in the room
By the way MLP is deadly did you know 100% of bronies eventually die?
HAHA I WILL LIVE ON FOREVER 22
true satistics
Did you know water is bad for you
but its true, your cells regenerate much slower after your 25th lifeyear
Gold_Demona, the results flipflop because interesting statistical blips, i.e. something like coffee causing cancer, that more scientists caffinate their rats in order to see if the result remains stable with larger experimental groups. It's a part of the scientific process and the end results should be rather trustworthy.
I'm also 28, almost 29 :P
Gold_Demona: I know, I just say that of course food in general dont cause cancer, companies try to protect themselves by slamming this on every product.
11,01Wish I was 20 again.
my god..
next year i will be 21!
and plus you also got to factor in when both sets of research studies were created
>.>
you know what we need?
Ponies
zelda?
More ponies
11,01Miss college. Miss learning.
someone who omes back from the dead and says there is a heaven and hell
Oh god don't start that topic.
you mean Kakarot
RainbowAsh, Ooooook, what exactly are you trying to explain? O_o
or Yusuke Yurameshi
or Ichigo Kurosaki
time machine
Snow: there was a case like that recently.
Ichigo?
11,01Snow: People with near-life experiences claim seeing heaven and hell.
i prefer Renji
DOn't you mean near-death, Nittany?
11,01Yeah.
Gold_Demona: isnt it the same thing? :9
People who claim seeing heaven or hell were already religious to start with so there is a bias
one time when i was in elemntry school
actually Alchemist there have been several cases that have been reported
Gold_Demona, that early results are sometimes misleading, but if a claim has been thoroughly tested, it is a good idea to trust it, because in the end science works.
Alchemist, No, because near-life means you're already dead. =/
Nittany_Discord: those cenarios are mostly hallucinations
people said down there was mudslides and that xD
actually not true Hisin some weren't religious to begin with
I had a near-life experience when my computer broke down and I couldn't get online
lol mudslides in hell
but most of them where zamer
RainbowAsh, Yeah, but what I'm saying is they always let the results out too early before they have the final conclusive word on it.
most stories are from already religious peopkle
So the media's word on it is always changing.
Alchemist, yeah. I dsedomething about that too
i dont like being in a church..
11,01Scientist claim they are hallucinations caused by brain cells dying.
But the fact that some weren't proves that religion isn't a factor for it
in my head is like stay calm stay calm
I like where this conversation is going :D
i need living evidence before i believe in heaven/hell/reincarnation
when the majority is religoius it IS a factor
Just give me more pony vidieos
yet then how would you explain the non-religious experiences then
hallucinatins
Zamer, the non-religous people are still aware of religion and have some semblance of popular ideas of the afterlife.
human senses aren't perfect and people don't always tell the truth them ost likely situation is that some people just say these stories for attention
i say, when your dead your dead, done
not that different like being on drugs. Doesnt mean the things one see while on drugs are truew
you're
Bring out you're dead
lol
yore
yor?
you know what is really sad?
fb drama :|
but thats my opinion, it doesnt really matter :>
That's a good arguement RainbowAsh since religion has been around for almost the entire human history in some form or fashion, which was mostly used to control humanity by using fear
YAR
Anyway i would believe your senses like sight and hearing aren't perfect when you're near-death...
sup guys
/me puts on an eyepatch and hat.
Zamer: True. On the other hand, oncontrolled humanity is usually anything but humane.
/me puts up a wooden leg
on*
Zamer, you judge the people in the past too harshly
-puts up metal arm-
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kFhPVAhV_o
YAR dead!
I dont think the earlier tribes were that different.
AVAST ME HARTIES
We are quite controlled now and we kill each other just the same.
My stance on religion is that it was useful for maintaining laws and order in the past but that it is now unneccessary in the modern era
/me pokes the chat with a plastic scimitar.
plastic eh?
hold on
Yup plastic
Hisin, I see the internet and I do not see order.
I could also use a foam one, if you'd rather
/me pulls sword off the wall
11,01Hey Bronysith
Nittany_Discord: hi aniki
/me pokes with a foam scimitar instead.
here, tajke this steel one.
Actually Kandarihu It's not that I judge them too harshly, its that humanity at it's core has always been evil, religion was created to help control the masses which has been proven multitudes of time in human history, to keep those in said religion from knowing the truth
/me licks Gold_Demona
Order in the real word and order in a place where you do not need to face as much consequences for your actions are completely different monsters
ohai Bronysith
/me gives Gold_Demona a steel sword
all of this religion talk makes me want to bust Sumica s nuts
:D
Why?
11,01Don't Bronysith.
inb4 Shizuschlafen pings after that link
Nittany_Discord: right, ill go for his shins
Why?
you ever hafve abusted shin? doesnt feel good
Yeah, but why?
Why even do it?
Why even think it?
Zamer: it didnt make us less "evil" (btw what exactly is evil). People at their core are NOT evil. We are tribals. Always were. If we did things that benefits only us and not the tribe, the tribe would've outcast us/ got rid of us, just like now with prisons.
whats everyone's fav anime?
How about them ponies, huh? :D
HEYKIDSWANNASEEADEADBODY?!
morning, everypony :)
oh you mean that shit premiere Gold_Demona ?
Hiyo Sylandest
Heya, Sylandest.
okay, sorry, I'll stop
my favorine anime right now is "K"
Sylandest <3
yup just K
K?
i enjoyed NGE alot
i dont know why
Bronysith, Why you always gotta be so nasty about everything? :<
howdy Gold_Demona, Starflash. Jmo, <3
check it out http://www.animefreak.tv/watch/k-online
My favorite anime starts with a K too
My favorite aqnime is Lupin the Third
lol
mine too
anime*
mine is kuroshitsuji
and wolfs rain is number 2 for me
My favorite anime of all time is mirai nikki that was beast
I like Wolf's Rain, but the ending confused the crap out of me.
or future diary whatever you like to call it
Zamer, we really are basically evil. And there's no way that humans can ever be like that. But we are not a collective, we are individuals. We grow up and are influenced by the environment around us. And also the consequences of what we do.
Gold_Demona: you want it explained?
Bronysith, I liked it for all the pseudoscience and general forebedoing
Bronysith, foreboding
Snow: Sure.
What is evil? Is it harming fellow human beings competing and caring only for yourself? because that is how nature is
hey guys
its called survival of the fittest
How are you alexxm?
Hiyo alexxm
Hisin: I think you might have misunderstood Darwin
i'm good RainbowAsh you?
i know what darwin meant
sup Gold_Demond
sup Gold_Demona
alexxm, I am fine. ^^
Gold_Demona: Kiba failed to get into paradise, so he died because the world was making a ice age. after that the world was reborn and new people lived on it.
Hisin: its not. Pisons are full of people like that.
*prisons
Gold_Demona: it all started over.
We don't compete with every other human being but we compete against other groups
Snow: That sucks. :<
groups outside of our groups
like other countries
Snow, Gold_Demona: More to the point, Wolf Rain is showing one out of maybe many periods that are separated by ice ages.
Gold_Demona: its like that profecy told, when wolfs return to the earth the end is near.
But all the dudes we grew to love died for nothing. T^T
thats why the ending is sad.
D:
Hisin: That's sociodarwinism, which has little to do with what Darwin actually was all about
I like sad endings, but not meaningless ones. :C
*checks facebook* *sees disturbing picture* FUUUUUU
Gold_Demona, wrong. In the next iteration there were these flowers everywhere, so there was progress.
hm
Well maybe i made a bad connection you guys know about john locke and thomas hobbes john believed humans naturally work together thomas believes we naturally compete
i side with thomas obviously
Hisin: Darwin was all about how species change and adapt through environmental pressure, i.e. evolution. Evolution can be explained why some species prefer to live in groups and other solitary, but he doesn't say either is better or mandatory.
XD
I like turtles :>
Gold_Demona, think of the anime as only a short moment in a much larger story that plays out over many generations.
nah not really it was originally this
Gold_Demona: if you like sad endings you should watch Kuroshitsuji
RainbowAsh, My issue is that the ending of the characters we got to watch wasn't a satisfying one. =/
http://soundcloud.com/simgretina/dear-luna-acapella
<3
Gold_Demona: http://www.watchanimeon.com/anime/kuroshitsuji/ this one
BRB
Gold_Demona, I think that might have been the point. It's a really well done tragedy.
Ah fair enough. Good stuff.
Huh, go figure.
Sorry to hear that.
ywhy?
yegnlish is better
T'was just curious, tis all.
XD
Yeah yeah Snow >_>
dem y's
She is doing it on purpose.
just saw the season 3 opener
lol
>_> <_<
Snow it's not Japanese dub if it was created in Japan
Snow: Um... There are no Japanese dubs for Japanese shows-- that's the native tongue.
I still haven't seen the premiere yet, so no spoilers!
there are probably japanese dubs of japanese shows for the hearing impaired
Zamer, It technically IS a dub since that's part of their animation process.
well Gold_Demona you better hurry because the 24hour lift will be over in 33minutes and 63minutes respectfully
Kencolt: uhmmm, you know a better name for japanese spoken shows then?
Zamer, huh?lift? lift of what?
АХАХААХАХХ
the no talking about S3 first two episodes
Snow: Yes-- back in the day when it all started, we called it Raw.
it's a 24 hr for bronystate
ah
As in Raw Japanese.
Oh I'll watch it today, don't worry. Wanna wait until husband gets home though so we can watch it together
and no Dubbing is when you are using a different language outside the original
you're thinking of Raw
Zamer, Nonono. I mean the technique they use.
I've been involved in this forever. Or at least to you kids it might as well be forever.
Zamer: They make the animation first and record the voices ontop of it. That's called dubbing
Zamer, I think you're confusing the word "dub" with "translation/localization"
if i may be honest, i sometimes find english dubs better then raw >_> <_<
Gold_Demona: Not in Japan. In Japan that's called Voice Acting.
You're not getting what I mean. ><
I don't mean the acting
I mean the process of putting the sound to the video. In other places they record the voices first and then animate to it.
>.>
<.<
In Japan they dub it.
Snow: I agree with that. Some dubs have been amazing-- and get certain jokes off far better than the original-- at least in cultural terms. And the Slayer dubs are known for epic gags.
Gold thats not dubbing
That's literally what the process is called.
ermagerd
so many pony tumbler jokes are about GAK now
:D
I give it until Next Week's Episode
to see if Gak lasts another week
i tell you
Gold_Demona: Not in Japan it's not. It's called Voice Acting. Japan is famous for "Who the heck cares about lip-synch?" It's only a concern on other cultures, really.
GAK is the smooze in disguise
Zamer, if the gak commercials return we might be in for a gooey season
i lost count on how many times the gak commercials were on the air yesterday
Oh nevermind...
RainbowAsh: that pun...
EVERYONE, GAK IS THE SMOOZE! :O
And any more Gak jokes and I'll start floaming at the mouth.
Calling S3 Finale Smooze Returns with twice as many Gak commercials
Zamer: The finale will be the intro followed by fiftyeight minutes of gak
Nobody's getting what I mean, so I'm just gonna drop it. >=/
Thankyou discord
When will it be up again?
O U Dema.
sudden silence
Eeyup
is anyone else not getting stream?
There is no stream
i still have that creepy snips on my streambox

Also Snow, Gak is only Smooze if it's purple. :P
/me wants purple gak now
it exsists
there is purple gak

Preciousssssss
ironically known as Purple Panic
lol

HEAVY WEAPONS GAK
Everyone panic! It's the smooze!
Sign here if you were a fan of Gak before MLP:FiM
/me signs
I remember wanting gak when I was a kid
these kids today don't know the wonders of our childhood
but they do get to live through the tortures of Furby
at about 6x the cost
hello
furby...
i was gonna buy one for the fun of it
but its expensive
the new furby
Furby the toy Everyone wanted then after 10minutes you realized it was the worst mistake of your life
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Gtr9s7fGA&feature=g-vrec omg my sides

The epic Gak/Floam wars. A nineteen volume epic saga that is almost as ponitless and the never-ending Wheel of Time series, and with only two characters.
fine
blame Hub for playing it after every other commercial the otherday
GAKA GAKA
Zamer: Ikr
Gak for president 2017
But, you guys are Spewwing it Randomly :I
what's bad it got worse after the MLP/LPS premiers
No >:I
ok
they are named
i lost count after 2 hours
you mean 2016 Tailsy
Zamer: true
Zamer: What normallyhappens is local cable providers oberlay at least a few of those commercials with local ads-- as is normally intended. What we saw was raw HUB cast, so no breaks.
and i had a Huge Headache from that comotion /)_-
guys, what's gak?
no Kencolt we had breaks and i mean during the commercials on the station not in the chat
WHAT. IS. GAK?
gak is back, artist, gak is back
artist it's one of the best things from the 90's
gak is great stuff
^^
But the meme is bad >:I
you are bad
and yoy should feel bad
no u
i wish i could find a free Ruby glitch in the app so i could buy Celestia
:3 jk
Basically, it's snot to play with. That's pretty much how it was marketed in it's original incarnation. Also, it can fart. That was a major selling point back in the day. Seriously.
What if Zelda was a gril http://www.geekosystem.com/dad-rewrites-zelda-for-daughter/
Zelda is a girl
this advert tells you what GAK is http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=kgST63f6x88
Zamer, it was a half joke post
yo
i know
i read it over a week ago
http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
but still that article is a bit interesing
sup
understood the father's feelings though, but to mess with a well known character like that. When she finds out later
Waking up to 0C, its cold >.>

i bet
good point

im trying to find a way to get my spyro game idea ppublish but i doupt it and it gets from the 80 to 100
i found random shiny boldore in vitory road o.O
caught it and was shaking
inb4explosion
it was like 65F yesterday, really rare in the middle of fall
saved bunch of times after
i bet
Funny Fact was Zubats and Ratata was always in B1
What idea did you have?
Ever thought of just making a fan game, spyrofan001?
Just the Main Character was too dumb to enter the sewers
its a boy
i may sr a few times
kill it for a horrible IV'd ♀
strange the alt code worked that time
its about spyro and his mate you chose out of cynder or ember and you get to play as there kids and them and ignitus tells spyro hes his father and i will use some of my OC's as chracters
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my6yGp-oGf8&feature=related such an epic cover
but activision probely wont take my idea
Snow: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuQl47h8CCg&feature=BFa&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ Cover?
im gonna laugh if its quirky nature cause i called it quirky
Hi everypony
hola
^^
Hi Rainboom
Remix
?
Even if they don't, you can always make the game yourself
anypony ever figure out that theres a setting on youtube that you can speed up and slow down videos
omg..
guess what
They wont because Skylanders is their main focus
shiny
no
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI-rTGduHm4&feature=channel&list=UL made this pmv with Season 3 episode 2 last night

I think I spelled it wrong
:D
speaking of Blako..
hi all
/me YouTube comment*

But yeah, you wouldn't have to make the game yourself

Morning hub
*guys

!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
artist, can you watch HUB?

Hi StinkomanFan :)

CrimsonPhoenix: i watch them on youtube :P
naughty nature
i like
good stats
Ohey, we got a new guy?
Hai StinkomanFan :)
I can't see the link
i was here since yesterday
artist they played the Gak Commercial which is a product from Nickolodeon about every other commercial while showing 2 commercials for Gak back 2 back each time
StinkomanFan, pretty sure we have plenty of new guys
for the entire day
girl*
Zamer, 4 commercials
back to back
Zamer: gak
:)
so what did you guys think of the season opener
not this again
gak gak gak
>:I
Gak, Gak glow in the dark, gak priner, gak
they only did all 4 commercials once
every other time it's been two commercials at once
alexxm, I thought it was fine and Somrero has caught my interest
time for genescent
"HASBROS BEST THING EVER"
ya
i was randomly lessioning to music one day and it popped into my head
heres the link to my ff.net
http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7862276/1/The-Truth
sorry my internet went out for a min
leave a review of whatever you think
i also started a roleplay forum on FF.net called The legend of Sj and friends roleplay
CrimsonPhoenix: THAT's another point in the season's premiere favor. We've got more newbies in Bronystate
11,01Gak was around when I was a kid.
11,01Fun stuff. It's also an effective dirt magnet.
Nittany_Discord: REALLY?
Sombro was mainly used for his backstory tyranny and then used to reenact the fear for the Crystal Ponies to make sure they didn't revive the Crystal Heart
its about spyro and cynders frist son (my OC Sj(Spyro.jr))
11,01Yes.
k im good now
why it wasn't a meme BACK THEN and not RIGHT NOW!???? :|
less internet involvement
Dark92Enigma: Because Ponies.
gakgakedy gak gak gak
11,01The internet barely existed back then.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgQ60DoNRJs
back then it was still used for porn
now it's used for ponies
Nittany_Discord: true.....but when was it made?
back in the 60s
11,0190's.
oh Gak or the Internet?
Zamer: yes....there was SOME backstory for King Sombra, but little screentime
besides, how did Shining Armor got infected?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Daniel Ingram and Meghan McCarthy Interviewed
we've NEVER SEEN HOW
/me EXPLAIN MOVIE!
/me EXPLAIN!!!!!!!!!
11,01I think the episode should have had more time to explain that.
he didn't really get infected, Sombra used some glowly stuff that nullified Shining Armor's magic
11,01S2's opener suffered from being a bit short.
11,01Despite being two episodes.
but he and eeveryone else was healed at the end
what are we talking about...
Dark92Enigma, http://youtu.be/j4j02VTiFQE?t=9m16s
GAK, GET IT NOW!
remember when season 2 came out?
I wonder why so many new people have been finding this forum in the past few days
and Dark92Enigma it's to much adult content to have been aired
are u talking about my forum?
season 2 came out on my 19th birthday
/me explodes
No, spyroforum
september 17th..
was awesome :D
ive been waiting for an hour for this to load, what am i forgeting, am i forgeting anything?!
lots of new people joining
My friends Bday is on Brony Appreciation Day im jealous :c
Wow
Rainboom, :c
I just approved a request to join the fan art group
i found it when i was looking for spyro stuf
My birthday is in December X_X
/me is drinking a lot of flat soda and it spilled on me 2 times so far
my birthday is tomorrow :3
sr for genesect time
Nittany_Discord: yes, but Discord had enough screentime. and he had an epic voice.......then again, looking back, the S2 finale set the bar sky-high, so it's hard to top off
thelonepony: :O!
:3
CrimsonPhoenix: thanks :)
SOMEPONY ORDER THE BASS AND PARTY CANNON FOR TOMORROW!
/me calls DerpyMail
11,01S2 finale did set the bar high.
there are still a lot of Spyro fans on the internet. I was surprised how many spyro fans I found on mlpforums
11,01And S3 hasn't reached it yet.
Ohai Nittany_Discord
look up chibi spyro its cute
11,01Hi Ponies47.
There should have been less songs and more explinations.
Zamer: adult content? you mean the movie, or the s3 premiere?......
can we all agreed that the best part of the 2-parter was Twilight running on stairs
ive been a spyro fan sence i was born
/me "Hello?" "I would like to take an order for the Party Cannon and the Bass Cannon please?" "Alright that will be 400 bits" "Ok bye!"
Are you serious?
really?
Zamer: OH WAIT
and Dark92Enigma S3 Premier with Shining Armor vs Sombra
Gekoncze thats funny, btw why are you on the mlp forum?
s3 wasnt as great as i thought it would be tbh
let's just say not for the young at heart
The S3 premeir had a cut scene of Spike and Rarity in bed.
Twilight can now control gravity, she's way overpowered now.
Zamer: YEAH, i don't wanna know how Shining Armor got infected (sorry for realizing it too late) :D
lol
http://i.imgur.com/nWLF8.jpg
I like the show
be good stats genesect
Is anyone buffering?
SR gene fTW
sadly we couldn't do that for the Therian formed Kamitro
I didn't like King Sombra he was BORING and his design was a little cheesy I mean he didnt even give a reason why he took over its just the character only to make the plot
No stream atm
/me Hello, welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, can i take your order?
getting worse sorta
Did you watch the new episodes yesterday?
and I like improving my communication skills
Yes I would like a Good Burger with nothing on it
Rainboom: granted he looked like a Sailor Moon Villain reject
My goodness... SLAVES...
ive always loved spyro
not yet, I watch only few episodes a month, now I am in the middle of session 2

I guess all he wanted was slaves and/or the Crystal Heart? :/
Ah
/me NC: (in response to Edward) no, but you can take this [middle finger] AND SHOVE IT UP HARD
What if Sombra only wanted the Crystal Heart because he lacked one
I won't spoil anything then :P
/me Good Burger review reference*
ok
Rainboom, he's a dictator
im trying to draw spyro but i keep messing up XD
and have power
bad bad bad
I remember myself trying to draw spyro, but it was always ugly
CrimsonPhoenix we only heard one side of the story and we all know how tabloids are
I'm always drawing little dragons on stuff
But I'm still not any good at it
Discord and Chrysalis are my two favorite reasons (I have a reason for Discord but for Chrysalis shes just plain awesome xD)
CrimsonPhoenix: i wanted him to say he wants to rule the empire and then EQUESTRIA so i can say OF COURSE!
villians*
hi
come on gensect be good >.>
Hi Octavia6666 :)
also Celestia and Twilight using "Dark" Magic
same here
I call shenanigans
Meow
:P
aniderp: inb4 bad stats
Zamer, magic powered by hatred
I'm terrible at depth; everything just starts to look weird when I try to draw anything but a side view
i keep finding bad stats
Zamer: Yeah and in the end of the episode Luna was carrying this dark thing it was probably a book for her kind of magic for Twilight
im terrible at tailblade and wings
Wings are really hard. >.>
Rainboom, in my opinion that book pretty much hinted Starswirls the bearded
I'm still interested in a rumor that was confirmed by the creators. Cause if they seriously mean't it theres gonna be a huge damn shit storm when the ball drops
http://derpibooru.org/148742
Who likes my game idea?
and ya
Then again, King Sombra turned out to be the SAURON of the series: we barely know anything about him, we want more development for him, so we make our own plot for him
LOTR reference FTW*
I'm still going by my inplausible theory that Twilight becomes Starswirled the Bearded and gets locked in the past
I like the idea, would be nice to see Spyro and Cynder again
anyone have a facebook or twitter?
But keep in mind there were a lot of fans that hated the LOS series
which is a shame :/
Dark92Enigma, and Sauron was kinda cool
what rumor killerpony7763
Me being one of them. Sorry :(
Zamer Not sure if i can bring it out
message it to me then
Thats why i made it so u can chose from cynder or ember
I mean I didn't _hate_ it... but I didn't really like it either
ah, finally
i probably heard it but forgot
I think it is good idea, but I would need to have more info to say it on 100%
its died down to a reasonable amount
im trying to get help with it
The only things I wanna know right now is Star Swirl the Bearded's history and why he's so imporant and what did Celestia mean when she told Twilight that she will be 'moving on to her next level of her studies"
anyone have a twitter?
only FB
Nope
im gonna scream if these are bad stats
idea* what if twilight is starswirls ancestor
I have both
I kind of have an irrational dislike for twitter
DUN DUN DUUUUUNN
/me rages
I have facebook though....
naturesfury, ancestor?
i kinda like twitter but i rarly get on it
Rainboom: maybe......future plot for season finale? :O
hello everyone =]
DEMAAAA
I WUB WOOOOO
i have a facebook called Spyro Fir Flazard
ohai Jmo :3
like twilight is star's great great great great great great grand daughter
:3
I wub woo too Mojay! ^^
brb, I need some rest after compiling one my app on windows - so exhausting - not as easy as on linux :p
thats what i say spyros full name is
I'm still calling she gets trapped in the past and becomes the Starswirled the Bearded of Legend
Or maybe Celestia
's grandfathers
grandfather*

hey thar DaringDerpy !
im scared to eat this..
wish me luck
Things are epic over here :) , how are things for you alexxm ?
Dark92Enigma, are you talking about an ultimate showdown?
I wish you luck
:)
which movie, [SWAG]Haku ?
Hi DaringDerpy :)
:)
Ryunosuke: hold on....i'll talk to you on PM
ewwww
what?
throw out
Hai DaringDerpy :)
Dark92Enigma no-one knows. what we;ve been told of series 3 realy des sound like they've made the hollywood sequel mistake of aking what waspopular and making it more so wihout reason.
I picked Revenge of the Nerds some months ago, it won, everyone loved it. Everyone who saw it agrees it was the best B film shown yet
oh, this one
Can there be such a thing as a good -movie?
B-movie
Domooo~
Jmo: -poke- ouo
well, my new house has no Telephone or Internet access until 1st of Dec
How're thou?
every b-movie should be good. but bad people always choose poor movies
im voting for either clerks 2 or jay and silent bob strike back
Jmo: Good and you?
Lunac Again, Revenge of the Nerds
I am good.
thats good ouo~
Im off playing some Ac3 be back later ^^
now my PC has to stay at my old room, I guess home is not always where 127.0.0.1 is
Indeed.
I mean the B-movie classification not the B-movie choices.
Bronysith my b movie choice is the castle of caglistro
im ok now.. i had an oreo
Good morning, everypony! :)
Hi RaveBrony :)
Lunac Oh... wel of course. Whats good is all about preference. B film are simply films with low budget, so by the that logic, great films of old can be B film; like some of the old Dracula films, Creature of the lack lagoon, The Giant Claw
Hi RaveBrony ~
etc etc
/me waves to thelonepony and Domo :)

Gak?
thelonepony: I will :3
the Gak meme is too stupid in too many ways... I was there yesterday, put I guess the Chatroom I was In was smart enough to ignore it
People hate on Gak because its the one thing that doesnt have to do with ponies
i think gaK is funny, though i only learned about this meme yesterday, god i hope it doesnt become as popular as the famous saying, "trololololololol"

Gakmakster it only started yesterday

http://askmlcblobs.tumblr.com/post/35489199250/original-characteeer-donut-steal-1
So GAK got to be a meme.......but FRYING THE COKE isn't????
I havre to admit I probably enjoyed watching chrysalis beating Celestian to the floor a little too much.
and then the chubbies made Sombra better
Lunac ikr
Also tempted to dub highlander over it.
Chrysalis :)
omg
лпоп
-salutes to chrysalis-
ENGLISH MOTHAFUCKA

DO YOU SPEAK IT?
Dark92Enigma to be honest, back when this Review cam,e out, I thought to myself , that this somehow doesn't sound right to me
Idiot...
i thought someone was chrysalis here so.. i kept with this name
Chrysalis, is best queen
The only queen in MLP
Lunac, shhhhhhhhhhhhhh
What?
Lil_B: what review, again?
she doesn't know that
i think she does
it is kind of obvious
Lil_B: sorry, i'm usually forgetful about some things, but not in others
:$
:) meetup's over so next week, I'll be here in chat - there are other episode meetups around Houston, but I dont know where yet or when for that matter
Dark92Enigma I'm thinking about which one it was >.< it was toigether with Lupa >.<
I also like the fact they are keeping Luna;s appearnce to a minimum it limits the chances they will ruin the character.
Lil_B: SIMON SEZ

will someone make a meme out of this, omlp, instead of omg (oh my god), you say omlp (oh my little pony). or just give feedback on it
dabi bot is worst bot.
pince-dari why the double post?
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352641853430.png
the reason Chrysalis is the only Queen in Equestria is because of the writing and advertising :) "Princess" is for good and nice Characters, and "Queen" mostly gets used for evil characters
The "We don't talk about S3E1+2 yet" still in effect?
Lunac: Two different posts were made
or osc for oh sweet celestia
Lil_B the reason you mixed both reviews is because Dennis Rodman is in both movies
Lil_B Are you suggesting Celestia is NICE?
...so much to learn
...so much leeeeeeearn
Lunac well, they wanna advertise her as nice to the Kids
Celestia is a troll, lazy, and constantly keeps her sister down.
and thank you Lunac! :)
Celestia is nice.... to an extent. theres always the dark part of youtube... (princess mol-estia)
/me hugs Lunac
she is as crazy and corrupt as she should be after a full reich, (1,00 years).
hey guys,
Oo when wqas the last time she kept Luna down? xD
want to be enlightened?
Aww thanks Dark92Engima *hugs back8
Lunac you don't know what "reich" means right?
lol, reich.
Lil_b modern defintion 1,00 year reich, nazi germany
yeah I wen there
which was the Third Reich
Lunac nope, Raich is simply the german word for "Empirere" ... litrteraly 1:1 Translation
yesterday morning, i woke up to my alarm clock, which i forgot to turn off for the weekend, and i couldn't sleep, i was too excited
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352653603239.jpg
Reich*
I have chat dsylexia okay so typos are often
dat spelling of "emirere"
I simply am a bad Typer xD
i cant spell very good

Zompony: I noticed
Lel
My point still stands
thats a given
hey dair?

dair?
Yep?
Zompony: don't feel bad, i hate grammar too

Invi: Hahaha, i wouldnt doubt it :D
About time we saw enslaved ponies though, that happened all the time in G1. Ever hear about how the Gewle eyed ponies in G1 got those eyes?
Rex_Mundi, wat?
Gewle eyeed ponies?
hey guys
hay FlutterMEDIC
hello
hi
Hi FlutterMEDIC :3
hi
/me hugs FlutterMEDIC :3
anything going on?
In G1, there are a few ponioes with red gems for eyes, and in a comic book you learn that they have those eyes because they were slaves working underground and their eyes died, so they replaced them with magic gems that allow them to see again when they got free.
nope
Nothing much
The episode felt like a 1980s G1
what episode?
Rex_Mundi, wow hmm
yesterday a lot happened
I liked the Greek Design of the Crystal Empire
me too
Is it me, or..
lost here, need information
...just in case you've been wondering if there'S an image about spike raping king sombra, there is. if anyone needs me, i'll be bashing my head into a wall ofer there
did that empire seem extremely small?
Dark_Horst: welp, that killed the mood
TROctavia: My guess is that every settlement other than the capital was destroyed.
ther was a mood?
That would make sense
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352655275980.jpg
ok..
im gonna try to watch old mlp//
CrimsonPhoenix: nice
I guess you could say the economy, "went under.
aniderp1: isnt as bad as you think
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
Maybe the empire was bigger back then
i took pain meds earlier
and did anyone noticed that the white parts in the pupils of these Ponies weren't rounded like normal, they had corners that made them looked like they were shaped like Rupees or other kinds of Gemstones
i get sick when i watch the old
Also, the castle looked like it was rather useless other than a few rooms
trolloa roola
wait
umm
why am I Crimson
Lil_B: well, they are CRYSTAL ponies
there we go
Lil_B, yeah they had hexagonal thingies
nice
Come on that was funny
FlutterMEDIC yes, and I think thats a nice touch :)
before that..
pony gangnam style
TROctavia glad someone else noticed :)
Lil_B, I noticed it from the DVD cover that was up for pre-order a while ago
btw guys, sometime today i'm leaving for Calgary, Canada to attend a funeral, so wish me well
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dl3R3XEdL._AA1500_.jpg
what
CrystalPhoenix haven't seen it :/ I tried to stay away from all the spoilers xD
is my only reaction
We wish you well FlutterMEDIC
CrystalPhoenix: dat RD hair
and seriously one would need to be blind for not noticing it
FlutterMEDIC, Rainbow Ventura
I like her main
ERMAGERD DAT MAIN.
i think Twilight's suits her though
Why.. are there only four with the hex eyes?
and the City Layout was kinda like Twilight Sparkles Cute-Mark :3
TROctavia, good question
she is hexed, hexed
... ssometimes I wonder if I follow the background too much.,..
maybe a fault in design
And you all said cadence wasnt a real alicorn, hah.
trying to find it..
the old one
maybe they just forgot halfway through making it
crystal princess?
notice the stadion http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_9V4-6UAOzU/UCacR1O_qlI/AAAAAAAA0DM/Ug9y9matKSc/s1600/312_l08_ext_crystal_empire_downshot_with_stadium.jpg
anyone think the crystal ponies still looked cute even when they were depressed?
still resembles a giant snowflake to me
Diamond_Tiara_2012, it's where the jousting happens?
Diamond_Tiara_2012: huh, didnt notice that
Ello Brownie state
See look, red eyes http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT40d7npB8UxVsVOaWx0gr1DoxTyMGz6SMOBZQx975sgj7zppy5oPNIIH8Glg
CrystalPhoenix: no, the jousting took place outside
Who picked finding nemo? I must love them
that 80s pony
its a game..
Hello
It's layed out as if they all worked in the center hub, but there's nothing there for ponies to work with!
hi
hi CCCP
HoodyNinja, it says it on the page :D
ello CCCP
CCCP! :3
let me find an episode..
I didn't know seaon 3 came out yesterday O_o
RaveBrony: Sorry, forgot to read :P THANK YOU
now that I look at it... the houses in that City look rather ... Cave Man like... in comparison to the Main Castle-Tower-AlienSpaceship
Hai! :3
Hey CCCP! :$
HoodyNinja: Np, glad you like it :)
Hi thar CCCP !
Hi FlutterMEDIC HoodyNinja MLP_Brovakiin and RaveBrony and Lil_B
Ow
Howve you been, CCCP??
I got pinged
Hi CCCP :)
good evening
:O
'Lo
RaveBrony good just watched the new episode
/me hugs HoodyNinja :3
hi thelonepony
grouphug
Awesome! :3
Bronystate makes me lethargic
another game..
CCCP: Thoughts?
HoodyNinja i liked it :3
excuse me for a second, looking up lethargic..
Villian?
You know what I dislike? People saying that Celestia is Twilights mother figure... she has a mother already, Celestia taking over that role is kinda creepy.
5/5 from me
TROctavia: Lazy
Did the crystal ponies have crystal unicorns and pegasi too? I dont remember seeing any.
no
Only Crystal earth ponies
Maybe the crystal ponies are a race of their own
only see the new episode for that..
pure earth excluding mane 6 shining armor spike and Candance
eh. im too lethargic to look up lethargic
I liked the songs :3
Songs were meh
So theyre a different race of pony entirely.
Hated the history song
HORSES
I liked the reprise of Failure Success at the end
horse jokes
^
Crystal Empire = Only earth ponies, yet their armor for jousting has holes for wings.
TROctavia same
i found something
diferent
liked the reprise version too
what was luna holding?
A book with stars and swirls on it
a starswhirled the bearded book
DoctoDoctorWho: Nah, they are just normal Earth ponies that become crystalized because of the heart
princess promenade
I liked the reprise verson more actually
xles: they were prolly relics from the old pegasi warrior culture
Starswirl episode I guess
@Zamer: ah thanks
DoctoDoctorWho: Possibly. =)
Hai everypony
oh god..
Oi DerpyMuffins
Hi DerpyMuffins :)
hello
good evening
How goes it?
/me hugs DerpyMuffins
Hai DerpyMuffins :)
them small fairy ponies
Back to the usual crowd I see
Maybe >_><_<
Hello DerpyMuffins
Are we allowed to discuss the new race that were shown next to Celestia in one of the season 3 commercial, or is that too much of a spoiler topic?
Any S3 spoilder not shown yet is bannable
How many people were on here yesterday?
3.4k
But is it a spoiler?
hi
they obviously came from the human realm
^^
That's a good question
humans in Equestria!
No
Rule of thumb; All future events are spoilers.
Just, no
HoodyNinja: /)
so what about discussing what pinkie did to her face
since we don't know ANYTHING about them and it was shown pretty much worldwide
all my no for HiE
If its on a commercial, i dont' think it should be a spoiler
Megan and Applejack could get rescued by Seaponies.
bacon and applejack
Shoo be doo
they said there will be no seaponies in S3 though
Zamer: who are these they
It was great
HoodyNinja: they considered the enite Ep1 a spoiler though 8 minutes was released of it
Rex_Mundi: Im pretty sure crystal pony is another pony race, as earth ponies "defining characteristic" is that they have a deeper connection to the earth. thats what allowed them to be such good farmers in the olden times. CP's seem like a jack of all trades culture center instead of converted earth ponies.
Well it's been 24 hours we can talk about the first two eps now I think
tons of fun
Holy text
batman
that wall of .txt
We should double check with the mods
/me shines the batsignal
check the checklist
Phase not here, :(
>.>
dat feel when there are only 11 episodes left of this season
DoctoDoctorWho: Nay, I like the idea that there are only 3 races of ponies (Alicorns dont count), having Crystal ponies be a 4th race would ruin that... whats next, Seaponies? Flutterponies? Breezies?!
Also it's worth noting that the highlights in the eyes of the crystal ponies isn't round, it's a polygon.
Ugh, have to go to the MUSEUM today :S
:(
HoodyNinja: what's so bad about museums
HoodyNinja what kind of museum?
lack of ponies, cowvarkian
cowvarkian: I have to go with my family
Anyways, we didnt get to know much about the crystal ponies did we?
Hey guys!
only 11 but all that worth
CCCP: The sucky kind
enjoy your family while you have them.
Oi SafariMonkey
the sea ponies song and fma xD
hi
they won't be around forever
yay, dark foreshadowing
Prince_Blueblood: My family is crazy
Alchemist: Something tells me that we will learn more about the Crystal Ponies in future episodes. I also hope we havt seen the last of Sombra.
Rex_Mundi: It wouldnt ruin it, I infact like the crystal ponies and dont think they'll go farther if they know whats good for them.
like what kind of crazy?
HoodyNinja :I i like museums
Rex_Mundi: I do
My grandmother is literally crazy
Im love trains
she's a fundy but I still love her in a weird way lol
Prince_Blueblood: The kind where we'll probably get kicked out for
Prince_Blueblood: mine is getting there
ah
bahhh
humbug
Prince_Blueblood: Im making a fic about blueblood, huh.
that's nice
brb
CCCP: Its a cheap museum, similar to a museum built into a house
Oh, those are boring
HoodyNinja oh :/
I just think that Sombra has more potential and should be developed a bit more before he is gone forever, I also want Nightmaremoon to return somehow.
All they have is a few basic science experiments
/me train hits Diamond_Tiara_2012
Alchemist O_O
What?
inb4 Sombrero will become the fan favorite at the end of season 3
Alchemist: :D
Alchemist: I laughed
Alchemist: :D
inb4 CrystalPhoenix gets shot
sea ponies song xD
sombrero vs gak
inb4 Sombre does not return and another
oh god
cowvarkian: Sombrero wins
This reminds me, I have a sombrero
Who says you can't make a gak sombrero?
thelonepony: none can defeat the mighty gak
D:
You do know the first ep is still under spoiler rules?
:I
I'm not a fan of sombrero
CrystalPhoenix: HNGH I need to see that
Chrysalis, 24 hours has passed
too dark
none can stop the smooze
08,01sombrero was not a proper villian
08,01Tom had more personality
^
^^*
lol
:D
sombrero is best S3 villain so far
Gak is the Smooze. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw
that isn't saying much
cowvarkian: TRIXIE
Prince_Blueblood: thats the point
Rainbow Dash is best villain in S3 so far
lol
6Hello ^^
She was just evil and a douche for jousting with Fluttershy
08,01sombra comes from the spanish for 'shadow'
I thought it was spanish
08,01same root, obviously, as sombre, a shadowy mood
11,01La sombra
08,01and sombrero, a hat that casts a shadow
lol
I suppose sombrero therefore has something to do with shade
/me dances around a sombrero
there we go
/me 08,01is stephen fry
Sombra De Amigo
I have no idea who that is
mexican hat dance
08,01fat, gay, and knowlegable
Cute cenera
:D
Are we talking about Stephen Fry and language? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY
Anypony think the CP's still look cute even when they're depressed?
whats up?
^
DoctoDoctorWho yes :3
I'm not sure you can make canon ponies not cute.
Chrysalis: I could buy it
depress CP too cute
hi Lil_B !
i think i found the one you were talking about
hi
I didn't watch the first ep yet, is there any mention of that ugly princess skyla thing?
Is It breaking rules if you talk about the episode? :S
Lil_B: Oy, why you so little?
no
24 hour rule
amd hi DoctoDoctorWho MLP_Brovakiin and cowvarkian
08,01not anymore!
China why you fail http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/560590_454040897967208_640508748_n.jpg
I loved the ep, hated the villian
Hiya Lil_B :3
he doesnt violate it by 3 hours
hi
Zamer: that seems fake
I was happy when Spike sang :)
I'll take it that there's no ugly skyla
Prince_Blueblood: Maybe Cadance will have a daughter this season?
HoodyNinja because, I'm not the greatest :3
I was happy when spike did something
Prince_Blueblood: nope
ah good. at least not yet.
lol
CCCP: Spike singing made me laugh out loud :D
no spoilers >_<
MLP_Brovakiin hehe
Spike sang OMG!
The line of "share of licks" + spike ballerina dancing made me lol.
i have
I haven't seen it either I just don't care
but hes ... forget it
spoilers haven't really made episodes any less enjoyable for me yet
I think its safe to use the EoH again now
Prince_Blueblood: no but literally, saying spoilers here gets you banned
Gravity fall spell
Lil_B: HAX
Lil_B yeah seems like it must of hurt
no questions asked
6Not much,just playing on the PS3 and stuff :P
Anyways, I belive the title of 'Prince' and 'Princess' is simple Equestria tittle for any lord or lady (possible only ones related to Celestia and Luna), thats why Prince Blue Blood and Cadance have those titles.
6You?
SPOILERS: Future S3 eps will have ponies
Lil_B: I was more annoyed how she refuses to use teleportation when it would actually be really convenient.
I need help naming my town in minecraft what shall i call it (its all snow)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWG0KLSJi8g&feature=plcp
Crystals........
HoodyNinja: What if they dont have ponies?
HoodyNinja what if they didn't?
rarrrrrrgghhh
lessioning to muisc
Alchemist: I think teleportation works like yuou have to see or know your destination
Alchemist yeah :/ at fiurst I thought "well... why dodn't you just teleport yourself up there?!"
pinkie and minty darling
My little dragon
oh god xD
*music
You can't just whisk yourself off to someplace you dodn't know
pinkie and minty holding hooves <3
The Spike and Discord show
I was surprised that Shining Armor didn't run into the Snow Monster from Hoth, what with him being dressed up as Han Solo and all.
S3 needs Minty
remember
^
that live show
HoodyNinja: when she was trapped after retrieving the crystal heart she teleported herself outside of the black crystal cell
I wouldn't mind
pinkie x minty
Hi ponies
Wait a second, is the episode encore going to be moved today sometime?
Hi SB64 :)
hi
Alchemist: She had seen/ could see outside the ring of crystals
Celestia was behind Sombra, heard it here first
Diamond_Tiara_2012: If Miny is in g4, it would make the Old-School pony fans very happy, like what happened with Blossomforth.
6:O What you listening to?
HoodyNinja: couldnt she then teleport a few flights of stairs higher?
Celestia knows Dark Magic cannonically now; this pleases us.
What's on?
not much
just discussion
:3
As far as I've seen, s3 was okay. The only complaint I have is we did'nt get alot of characterization on sombra. That however, does not make him bad. As far as sombra goes, I say 6.5/10
Alchemist: I'm pretty sure its dagerous to, or took more energy than the gravity spell
just a blank screen
I don't know what to make of dark magic, it could go bad
HoodyNinja: or what you are saying is she can teleport to places she have seen at least once?
Stallion_of_War AND sher taught Twilight too :P
she*
Diamond_Tiara_2012: No, The Buffer Show is on:3
Ah
mitamaking thats why it's called dark magic
08,01so i just got the numbers for the premiere from our analytics
Hello everyone...that premire the other day REALLY was crazy, huh?
Its Canon, Twilight know dark magic now as well.
Or someplace very near
08,01yesterday, we had 16,591 unique visitors
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Its the buffer show!
VenHur: Yep
:C
Yay
Is that a lot?
taylor swift
is that all?
This commercial I'm watching on the Golf Channel is about a girl named Cadance.. my god..
HoodyNinja: that actually makes sense :)
Pff 17k
Did that beat the wedding?
this guy is selling a ps3 on craigslist that works but sometimes it shows a red light for $20... wonder if i should pick it up and try to fix it...
08,01that's the highest viewer count we've ever had
Over 16,591 Bronies?!
I dont think so.
nice
Wedding was about 20k, no?
YES, THE FORCE IS BECOMING STRONGER EVER DAYS!
Gak
08,01Lil_B: what date was that?
*every
over 16,000?
Stallion_of_War: :o your right
Hey guys, Pinkie Pie has her own episode. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KKfym7NuoE
Is Twilight's middle name Raven?
Stallion_of_War: I want one, how much
6:O
welp I just sudenly got a Stephen Fry adoration
I dont know if you should
It's not my art; I found the link
6I guess it would be worth a shot..Idk..
Twillight is Raven confirmed
Twilight R. Sparkle?
it might be
Ponies have middle names?
Twilight Raven Sparkle
Stallion_of_War: Hillarious and interesting since Twilight and Raven are voiced by the same actress.
Now I want twilight to yell her magic words
Tara Strong.
Yes
I mean 21st
dammit
CrystalPhoenix: Azurath Metrino Zenthose
Pinkamena Diane Pie, right?
CrystalPhoenix: PONY FRIENDSHIP CANNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Goodbye everyone
I wonder if Tara uses her maiden name as her middle name or if she uses something else.
Azeroth Metrenos Zenthos
bye CCCP :)
Pinkamena Responsibility Diane Pie

bye CCCP
It's Lyn, nevermind
latas CCCP
lol
worst case I smash it and get $20 worth of fun.
With those numbers - Season 4 25,000 uniques viewers! I'm writing that number down, putting it somewhere safe (pony drink recipe book) and this time next year, we'll see if Im right
best case I fix it and give it away to a friend or something because i dont care for console games
Wow, Tara Strong is only 159 cm tall?
idk if i found the episode..
Cypresswolf: 50 bucks if you are
11,02Hai Noert :3
but princess rarity
:O
HoodyNinja: writing that down too :)
Cypresswolf: Depends on how good the rest of season 3 is, but with a Trixie episode....
:$
/me Hugs SuperBrony64 :3
TRIXIE
and crystal carriage
11,02o.o
Ponies dont all have family names, and these are not part of the ponies names. For example, Twilights first name is twilight, and her last name is Sparkle. But her family name isnt Sparkle. Applejack just has 1 name, but her family is the 'Apple' family.
hey thar SuperBrony64 !
/me hugs thelonepony back :3
11,02Lil_B: Hai :D
SuperBrony64, when was the last time you streamed something?
Keep an eye on the numbers for episode 5 this season, I am expected Canterlot Wedding numbers there
/me gives SuperBrony64 cookies :3
Rex_Mundi: Oh no, pony culture. I'll get the aspirin
Hello
Rex_Mundi: what about the Cakes?
If Celestia also known Dark Magic...then I hates to see what's her mother's magic are.
Canterlot > British Royal Wedding
11,02CrystalPhoenix: Couple days ago I think O~O
Hi Punkie_Pue :)
/me noms on the cookies :3c
SuperBrony64, can you be a bit more precise please?
Punkie_Pue: Hai :3
Pound Cake.
:3
What was Cup Cake's maiden name?
SuperBrony64, hows the wiiu countdown :)
Cake family
so Sumi finally decided to have some sleep already? :D
Let me just say, season 3 may be just a bit darker than the first 2
or would that be filly name?
ok
I think Pinkie Pie and the Cakes are related
Pie and Cake
YAH DARKER SEASON!
[09:45:17] <Rex_Mundi> About time we saw enslaved ponies though, that happened all the time in G1. Ever hear about how the Gewle eyed ponies in G1 got those eyes?[09:45:41] <Invi> Rex_Mundi, wat?[09:46:21] <TROctavia> Gewle eyeed ponies?[09:46:28] <FlutterMEDIC> hey guys[09:46:35] <Invi> hay FlutterMEDIC [09:46:36] <TROctavia> hello[09:46:40] <Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi[09:46:44] <thelonepony> Hi FlutterMEDIC :3[09:46:45] <aniderp1> hi[09:46:49] thelonep
The 5th episode already came out?? I haven't even saw the 1st episode of the season 3 :c
Can Cup Cake become a waitress, so that she's Hostess Cup Cake?
hory shet!
um
/me dat textwall
what?
WHAT THE HELL
JamesClydesdale, yesterday was teh premier
11,02Season 3 was horrible, RIP MLP :(
waaa?...
:D
waaaaaaaaaa
I know but I didn't catch it
SuperBrony64, why?
:C
Silly SB, S3 isn't over yet
Want me to do it again :D
Lol dat SB
6xD
SuperBrony64: ...We haven't even finished the season.
no
SuperBrony64, I'm curious about you opinion
3:
im thinking about game ideas that should be made but will not be
SuperBrony64: But we havent seen the rest of the season ;3;
it hasnt even started yet
Also, come on bigger role for Spike this season
Trolling silly foals ;)
King Sombre = Lost Smoke Monster?
I haven't even seen the 1st episode :c where can I find it? :O
11,02The show has already jumped the shark after only two seasons.
Alchemist: Is that any good? I didn't catch it
SuperBrony64 I think the franchise redeemed itself with Season 5
to be honest the more I watch the premiere the more I love it
HoodyNinja: me neither, though I'd like to.
SuperBrony64: But we havent seen the rest of the season ;3;
6I've done that too x)
SuperBrony64: You're not much of a "Super" brony
HoodyNinja: He is 64 though
11,02Moo :3
is the first episode on youtube?
Lol
6Brb,need to kill a Bat Drone..
SuperBrony64: Well, it DID jumped over the shark, but can it jumps over Mount Everest?
11,02HoodyNinja: ;~;
Yes
CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, once you dont have the ubnreasonable expectations that Discord and the Royal wedding made, its easier to enjow.
Oi! I liked the premier.
the problem I have with bronies, myself included, is that we are comparing Sombra to Discord, we are comparing any villian, to JOHN DELANCY being Q :p
JamesClydesdale, indeed
JamesClydesdale: yes, just go find it
:3
HoodyNinja you mean super "brony"
sillieh SuperBrony64 is sillieh :3
of the 3rd season i mean
11,02i liek silleh :D
the 1st episode :S
Punkie_Pue: THEN IT'S THE GREATEST MASTERPIECE OF MY HAPPY MISERABLE LIFE!
i wish they would make games people think of
Ryunosuke: Chrysallius(sp) made it out okay)
JamesClydesdale yup
Lil_B: I don't know...
Why does everypony hate the premier so much?
okay
11,02The premiere was OK, I just hope there's a Derpy episode :3
^
Thanks guys, and bye!
SuperBrony64, there won't
TRIXIE EP
11,02Later JamesClydesdale!
Stallion_of_War: hype, same thing happened to me with the wedding
what Sb said :3
and stop putting Derpy in the high pedestal
i hope theres a princess only ep
...Discord episode? [fangirl squees]
Discord episode? SHIT!
pony_7777: So a Twillight episode
but theyy wont which sucks :(
I hope there's Octavia ep
pony_7777: i hope it's a luna Episode
Season 5 was best, writing by Michael Bay and Uwe Boll, starring Tommy Wiseau. It couldn't not fail
princess only episode would make more sense
CrystalPhoenix: I hope there's a Derpy ep :C
People hated the premiere? thats news to me. I thought most people were okay with it. I think it was pretty good apart a few annoyances.
Venhur: I was responding to something else
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Magic Fillies episode coming
Octavia episode would be horrible
NEXT WEEK
:p
HoodyNinja, there won't
I love how it was Berry punch randomnly in the stand rather than Derpy, what was she doing there?! http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/5224/crystaljousting.png
that's why you learn to make games and make it yourself. :)
What
How dare you
CrystalPhoenix: Something's missing...
EY everypony
iirc next week at 1030 is a new episode as well
People usually make the mistake of overanalysing this. In the end we are talking about a kid's show, not fraking Inception
Chrystal Ponies.....Everywhere
What could it obviously be...
WHAT THE FUCK
like a luna episode where they show her doing stuff in the palace and talking to celestia and stuff
How is Berry Punch in there
Berry, go home
wat
So did anypony ever find Derpy?
I will say this
You're drunk
Berry Punch is the new Derpy
it's official
I looked and didnt see her
No, no
GO HOME BERRY PUNCH. YOU'RE DRUNK
Berry Punch heard legends of crystal pony brews?
We need more lemon pledge
after s3 ep1-2 Cadence makes a HELL of a lot more sense than when we seen her at the wedding
people made minty x pinkie vids
VenHur: to late, HoodyNinja already said it
too*
11,02imma moo \:3/
who wants a luna ep?
QUAAAAAAAAAAAACK
Mooooooo
Still don't know why she was princess Candace in the wedding
Moooo!
Ryunosuke, there was something odd with her to begin with
suddenly a wild SuperBrony64
Me! memememememememe
Does Prince Blueblood rule over a kingdom of lawful good Vampires then?
or better yet....
with the Hair and all
GUYS!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4XAVxhlwGQ&feature=related
:3
Forget moo, GAK is BAK
thats what im thinking about doing ut i dont knoe how i would be able to use spyro
AT WIKIPEDIA
mitamaking, apparently she is the princess of the crystal kingdom?
HOLY SHIT!
Ryunosuke: and I love that it seems the writers already knew what they were gong to do with her character.
FUCK! TRIXIE APPEARS AND THIS TIME SHE WINS THE FUCK OUT OF TWILIGHT
Ryunosuke: They just found that out now though
if you don't make money off of it, they would probably allow it.
VenHur, :D
they don't care as long as you don't try to sell the game
Ryunosuke, apparently? SHE IS there's no denying that
true
It's like fan art
links or it didnt happen
Twilight becomes the Avatar this season too, apparently.
Verspa: let's not talk about future episodes, pls :S
It's technically not allowed but no one cares about it
even one of the crystal ponies said it
Mkay
well, bye everyone, see you all toimorrow :)
i liked king sombra, he seemed like a sentient monster.
bai b
Bye Lil_B :)
well true :p
I don't think they should concentrate on Twilight too heavily :S
RobotdragonX, YES THANK YOU
it still makes it apparent :)
RobotdragonX: Smoke Monster from lost
It's not long until the fire nation attacked, Stallion_of_War.
I get that she is the Crystal Princess now, but she wasn't at the wedding
CrystalPhoenix: not to mention that her cutie mark is actually the crystal freaking heart :D
CrystalPhoenix ur welcome
/me hugs TROctavia and thelonepony :)
mitamaking, how do we know she wasnt?
cool design as well
Alchemist, that as well
then im going to make it but not sell it for money for fun
she was just "a" princess
Ryunosuke: Are they showing it out of order?
but didnt specify of what :)
For awhile I sort of though the whole Chrystal Heart thing was a metaphore and they we're going to power up Cadance's butt.
I think hasabro/hub is trolling us :p
That... would be interesting
Since her cutie mark is the crystal heart and all
What is a powered up butt looks like?
I wonder if dark magic is very limited and dangerous...
Stallion_of_War i lold
VenHur: WE MUST HARVEST THE DARK ECO
VenHur: Well it nearly drove Twillight and Spike nuts
Ohai Bronystate :)
Yeah, I think 'Prince' and 'Princess' is simply Equestria title for lord and lady. Celestia is only "Princess" because there can be only 1 queen and she doesnt want to seem more important than Luna.
Hi MadSurge !
VenHur: If we can even slightly bring Raven from Teen Titans into this, given Twilight shares her VA, then yes; yes it is.
Ohai MadSurge
I also notice how in the episode it use a double dimension play
HoodyNinja eco freak >:p
Haio MadSurge
Stop being on fire
from what I gathered, and thought about, and makes the MOST sense, is that Cadence went into exile when sobra cast his... disappearing spell on the crystal kingdom
Hello eveyone~ :)
Hi MadSurge :)
hello
Hoody ninja oh wait that was supposed to be another face..
ello Klumzeedragon
that would explain why celestia knew alot about it, and why cadence was there in the first place
Hi Klumzeedragon :)
Ryunosuke: That is a background story they really should have mentioned if true
Long time no see
by that I mean like when Twilight was searching for the heart she used Hatred toward a crystal to reflect a dark world
Tara Strong also voices lesser known characters.
SWEET CELESTIA!
Hey SuperBrony64, you gonna wait in line for a Wiiu?
/me nons on Klumzeedragon and MadSurge :3
Ryunosuke: I dont think Cadance is long lived like Celestia and Luna.
STOP POSTING IM TRYING TO READ
Ryunosuke: but that was 1000 years ago, and when she was babysitting twilight she seemed to be in her early teens (if that makes sense)
Ember from Danny Phantom, Timmy Turner, and Hello Kitty.
with all that sh*t happening no wonder luna decided to go vigilante style....
for free
VenHur: You will remember her name
Wasn't Luna in the moon 1,000 years ago?
thelonepony: Do I taste good? :D
then at the bottom she used love to the dark crystal at the door leading to the staircase
Klumzeedragon: Yes :3
CountDoofus: This was before she was banished
1000 years is a rough estimate
CountDoofus: maybe she was cast out after defeating Sombre.
CountDoofus: Another thing, think Sombra's rise had to do with Nightmare Moon
however Luna looked like a filly in ML:P premier and grew up by the time of luna eclipsed :)
Wait.. was she in the moon or on the moon?
*In* the moon.
so did she experience the 1000 years?
The Mare IN the Moon
Ugh, pony theories
i thought the mane six turning into crystal ponies was pointless. its not even 30 SECONDS!
or was in like, a few seconds to her
This makes my head hurt
K, I gots ta leave
11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh, but I'll have to wait in line the morning of, there's not going to be a midnight launch for it at my GameStop :/
See yalls lata
The Sillouette Celestia and Luna from 1000 years ago should have looked different.
RobotdragonX: It's a......... Rarity...;p
bai
One thing we don't know is WHY whould Celestia banished her sister to the moon in the first place. And no, it's not the bananas.
11,02Cya TROctavia
Probably some kind of cryogenics going on there.
Cya TROctavia
Dat SuperBrony64.
SuperBrony64, go there super early to be first in line?
mitamaking i see what u did there.....
11,02Later HoodyNinja :)
11,02:)
mitamaking, that quote from AJ has spark my shipping sense
I meant bai HoodyNinja* o.o
See ya TROctavia.
VenHur: yeah all we know is that Luna "went nits"
SuperBrony64 Saturday right?
Hummm.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
VenHur: DO YOU LIKE BA- *slap*
*nuts
extreme jealousy?
CrystalPhoenix, :D
11,02DerpyMuffins: Sunday morning
SuperBrony64: :3
pack a tent SuperBrony64 :3
Wonder if we'll get to see more of the Crystal Empire.
11,02Pinkie Pie will beat meh :<
hi Afflict
That or Freakazoid.
hey
CountDoofus, that would be nice
2nd is the best though
maybe a vacation stop and all
11,02Crystal Empire didn't exist, it's like Wyoming
SuperBrony64, pinkie will get all the Wii U's
but I doubt they will do that
Pinkie Pie will be first and take all the systems.
Oh, that's another thing. If it's a Crystal EMPIRE, then why was it KING Sombra and not EMPEROR Sombra?
I'm still looking for the Fortress of Solitude in the premier...
why hasnt there been sombra shipping yet.....i know its just a day after but come on, this is a big fandom....
hi
Lol, Wyoming.
CountDoofus: Same reason it's not Emperess Cadance?
CountDoofus, heh blame the writer
CountDoofus: Illusion of not having that much power
CountDoofus: Good point...
CountDoofus: because he wasn't the legitimate ruler, duh
The Crystal empire proves that nations of ponies exist besides Equestria. Im wondering that if the 3 tribes of ponies that made Equestria werent the only pony tribes and that there may still be tribes of ponies that havnt joined Equestria yet and are still distrustful of each other and Equestria.
tbh CountDoofus, emporer and king are synonomous :p
This is from S1E1. Thats all we know why Luna got banished: the younger sister became resentful and was jealous that under Celestia(daytime) ponies were happy and busy, while she could only rule the night.
CountDoofus: Because Higharchy.
RobotdragonX: Ship Sombra with Gak!
SuperBrony64, Pinkie doesnt know the meaning of pre-orders
Also, dem pings.
RobotdragonX, because he didn't leave a huge impression
CrystalPhoenix ouch :(
:>
11,02Then...she'll have to meet an unfortunate fate o-o
CountDoofus lol
also I could imagine King Sombra being the G4 smooze
Sombra: "RAWR I'm here!" *ponies: place Crystal Heart* Sombra: "Aw, maaaaaan."
CrystalPhoenix: Have you seen the necklace?
So if Celestia and Luna rules the day and the night, who controls time and space then?
And no, i'm NOT pulling a Pokemon here.
SuperBrony64, implying you dont meet an unfourtante end first
VenHur: Dr.Whooves
:>
So there wont be a new intro for seasoin 3? Or will there be a first show after the premire episodes like last season?
VenHur: Time Turner/Doctor Whooves
mitamaking, not closely
Of course...
Cosmic Matriarch.
VenHur: maybe time and space isnt controlled, its just "is"?
Alchemist, heresy.
moo :3
CountDoofus i have retur-OH SH*T *ded*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo13WMTQJ84
TROctavia: dont burn me at the stake.
CrystalPhoenix: If it is what I think it is it is a continuing story
Lol we good
Rex_Mundi: You...son of a jackal!
G3 is canon in G4 now :)
King Sombre(ro)?
Next step
make G4 Canon in G3
Season finale: Twilight's studies will allow her to become an alicorn. I'm calling it.
11,02i liek cookehs \:3/
im starting to think the gak meme came from here...didnt it...
Was that face's G1 or G3...
My guess HAS to be G3, isn't it?
Correct RobotdragonX
possibly
RobotdragonX: Correct.
oh gosh *lols*
Have you watched any of the G3 cartoons?
CountDoofus: Well it is pretty obvious now
Inb4 Bronystate becomes more well-known for the Gak Meme.
/me gives SuperBrony64 cookies :3
hell no
no
Dat Pinkie face.. if i was a lot younger, that'd of creeped me out
sumerpan vs the GAK
CountDoofus: NO! I hate the idea of Twilight becoming an Alicorn, that would bring her to Mary Sue levels.
Any FiMfiction on fimfction with Gak in it gets you permabanned as well. Talk about a short fuse :)
i prefer summerpan
/me noms on the cookies :3
First thing you gonna play SuperBrony64?
VenHur: ..... Never >:I
fagit
Hello SuperBrony64 Not seen you for a while.
11,02DerpyMuffins: New Super Mario Bros. U :D
Oh.
:>
hehe they found derpy in that episode yesterday ^^
Of course
11,02Lunac: You too o.o
Invi: Where?
Invi: in the premiere?
ja
Invi: coz thats a lie
If you say the opening
11,02Yeah, she's in it
http://cheezburger.com/6755188992
i drew sombra marrying that one purple maned crystal pony.......cuz i can.
dat ban
Invi they just found a grey pony showed from the back
Rex_Mundi: I don't like the idea either. But there have been plenty of signs. It might just happen.
Alchemist, from the side
WEll dang
Alchemist, with yellow eyes and mane ^^
Invi there we go
Although, if Celestia becomes anormal pony for an Episode and twilght becomes an Alicorn Ruler in the day, and she messess up royally because she cant handle it... it would be entertaining.
Invi: MISSION ACOMPLISHED, DERPY IS SAVED
thelonepony, not sure but a ban has been made
NOW I SHIP DERPY WITH BERRY PUNCH
Invi: but no confirmation of derped eyes.
Alchemist, well believe it or not ^^
Alchemist, oh come on now
Butbutbut... grey coat, blonde mane...
Rex_Mundi: I would much perfer watching Celestia be a earth pony
Im still wonder how and Why Berry Punch is there?
6Hey ^^
Changelings.
Rex_Mundi, travelling buddies
Did she even have wings?
That is Derpy
whats going on everyone
Got drunk and wandered off
watching season 3 episode 2 now
i feel like sombra may have been a anakin skywalker of the crystal empire. corrupted by evil and stuff..
Rex_Mundi: There was cider
Alchemist: No, Berry Punch is an Earth pony, theres no reason for her to be there... she just IS.
Bye everypony
Bye
Later Ponies47
I'm just programming at the moment
bai Ponies47
Bye Ponies47 :)
bye ponies47
bai Ponies47
We'll miss you!
RobotdragonX: Wait, wait, wait. Corrupted? By evil? ...Oh shit, Twilight must NOT overdose the dark magic!
nothing here eithe?
Rex_Mundi: I was talking about the grey pony they think is Derpy
VenHur oh crap...
Twilight gets seduced by the dark side.
prgogramminng what?
Rex_Mundi: We can only hope
In a storyline sense
twilight gets seduced by darth vader?
^i lold
....
and destroys the jedi using dark magic
the end!
I mean look at me, I am hoping for continuing stories, a darker outlook, in a show for 5 year old girls
You guys thing the gates of tartarus would open and let monsters out? As well as whatever big bads might be there.
Inb4 Twilight goes chaotic in an future episode.
just some small 3D editor, I have it as my graduation project
Though the door showing a character's biggest fear was a nice touch.
Watch, she absorbs all the evil and ends up bringing in every villian theyve faced so far. :U
o thats cool
CountDoofus: Don't you want to see the other mane 6's
6:O
all this talk about darkness
Klumzeedragon thats the idea ive had FOREVER about the series finale!
I want to see Celestia talk in the Royal canterlot voice. shit be epic.
This is what i see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzqaeKTqWCI
A Discord/Chrysalis/NMN/Sombra hybrid... By Celestia's beard...
I just got done programming... decided I'm going to put off the rest until later
TROctavia: That's my favorite game
RobotdragonX: You know what they say about great minds right?
How about an epic pony war? War... war never changes...
it can do only some basic stuff at the moment, but I'm going to improve it a lot and use it afterwards
ohai
Klumzeedragon yep
mitamaking, it's got such a great storyline on top of the great gameplay
TROctavia, better video http://youtu.be/MzxQ61b-gOo
Interesting fact. Tara Strong's birth name is Tara Lyn Charendoff
I didnt know that.
darkness
CountDoofus: I don't think Sombra is dead. His horn flew off into unknown area, Im sure he's going to just regenerate.
darkness
Darkness.
Klumzeedragon: Dr. Whooves Style! *does a silly dance*
Revelations
I can see a 2 hour villian throwdown
there was a revelation that i had!
Im wondering how much pony-like creatures are counted as ponies, are there Unicorn-zebras for instance? Zorses?
champagn with grape wine is delicious
what do u guys think was the dark book luna held at the end of the premiere
CountDoofus: Something like that. :P
pony_7777, examine the logo carefully
pony_7777: Necromancy!
pony_7777: The royal check book.
Rex_Mundi: What about Donkys?
it has two stars and a swirl
pony_777 "the avengers initiative."
Hai Rose` what you been up to?
pony_7777: Something about stars and swirls, where have we heard taht before
I think Twilight becoming an Alicorn (except if its for like, just 1 episode and then back to normal), would be a shark-jumping moment.
The Hulk in Equestria... Ho boy.
^
ok
One Fluttershy Stare later: "Ohai Bruce."
mitamaking well that will be an odd episode
lace underwear for me
CountDoofus: "Puny pony."
*men
wtf?
CountDoofus that can only end well
oooooh....
carefull everyone
If they add Starswirl I will be very pleased. I wanted to see more lore in S3, and it might be the case.
there are fake screenshot roaming loose
Id like an episode where the mane6 temporarily change races, Id like to see Twilight become a pegasus, Rainbow Dash dealing with being an Earth pony, and what chaos Pinkie can wrote with a Unicorns horn.
alexxm: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8u7px_GzWQ
I can sums up Kingdom Hearts as a whole in one word.
aw boy..
Darkness.
Darkness?
I want Lauren Faust to play Celestia's Mopther
Darkess.
Darkness...
darkness
Light!
guess what?
pony_743: I think we all do
if a glass of wine a day is healthy
Dark!
darkness
Rex_Mundi: Well... Rainbow had to deal with that during the Discord episode.
This here screenshot is FAKE http://cheezburger.com/6755188992
CountDoofus: I take a potatoe chip... AND EAT IT!
then a bottle of wine a day is usper healthy!
RoseLove`it really isnt healthy
Kingdom Hearts is not Darkness ............... It's light
Klumzeedragon: and tangentially in the fall weather friends during the running of the leaves
It's fake?
FFFFUUUUU
faaaaaaaaaaaaaaake
^ikr
poo
CrystalPhoenix: of course it is
Klumzeedragon: But can you imagine a Unicorn Pinkie Pie!!!
well it fooled me, id be too lazy to go back and check
Pinkie Pie with Magic.
That scene with "..its light!" is just like the ending of the premiere
Rex_Mundi: That may be the plot next week
Alchemist: Aye. I was going to mention that. :D
DOOMED!
im gonna go now, see u guys later
Later RobotdragonX
I'ts like the Joker with a Green Lantern Ring
cya robotdragonX
Rex_Mundi: She'll DESTROY US ALL! Destroy us all!
It just writes itself
Destroy us all
Okay, so I decided to cash in on the Gak craze to get people to see one of my vids:p. Cause I had Gak reactions on one my videos even *before* the Season 3 premiere: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E5YM_SPDBI
I wouldnt dare to give Pinkie the power to do magic though...
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic in a nuthshell.
Friendship.
VenHur: OHOHOHO goo1
lol
BERRY PUNCH IS IN THERE THOUGH
Alchemist: Something tells me she can already do simple magic when no one in looking.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgQ60DoNRJs
deponia is deserted
Earth Ponies can have magic in their bodies
what do u paln to make it do?
meow
dont jduge me
it's just not as concentrated as the Magic in Pegasus ponies (feet and wings)
Or Unicorns (their horns)
Alright
I'm not sure about this but http://i.imgur.com/iEtpV.jpg
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: "The Crystal Empire", Parts 1 and 2: Episode Followup
CrystalPhoenix: thats what I was talking about: no visible wings and eyes, could be anypony
CrystalPhoenix: Eeeeh... Maybe, maybe not.
Alchemist, it's as close as we can get though
CrystalPhoenix: wouldnt be the first if there weren't a Derpy sighting during an ep, right?

You need a hobby RoseLove`
Everywhere?

RoseLove`if that is the case, you need something stronger
like absinthe
he gave me only 30s to react...
PreCure, an anime thats for little girls but is watch by a lot of older views, sometimes described as the MLP FIM of Japan, appearently, next weeks episode has the mane characters turn into multy colored horses.... interesting. I dont watch that show but that is what ive heard.
RoseLove`try some whisky
but imma lady, i only drink wine, champagn and brandy
RoseLove`: >_>
Vodka is where its at
Absinth
vodka is a peasant drink
drink some grass... I mean absinth
no beer is where its ath
lol
absinth is an anarchist drink'
Water is where it's at
beer is a poor mans drink
TROctavia: ikr
Cider
Seems to be a trend with new people. =/
wine is where its at
water is a water nymphs drink
No one talks to them for half a minute and they just quit
that Compass
RoseLove`, every drink has water in it
cowvarkian
RoseLove`:
no stream still?
Mead is the manliest drink, its slightly alcoholic and is made by the manliest honey ever...
therefor i am a waternympo
nope no stream
aniderp: we're watching the buffer show
Water is the strongest drink of all. It carries freaking cargo ships on it's back!
still the buffer show
This is Precure, correct? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/Precurenewstage.jpg
VenHur: yep
RoseLove`: because its fuckin water
I saw him
meow
I would suppose you like darker brews then
VenHur: One of them, Precure has had several generations, like 9 different shows or siomething. Been around since Sailor Moon or something.
RoseLove`try some cranberry vodka
Buffer Show is the best part of Bronystate
The part where Shining threw Cadence... "WHAT?!"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXz4P6EpX3s&feature=plcp
TROctavia: if I drank I probably would
I wish I could stop drinking

VenHur: It airs after those on the channel
I'm underage, so im good with water
oh my
mitamaking: me too, it was just one of those "Huh?!" moments.
TROctavia: same
crazy russians
that horse is amazing :D
Im 22 but I dont have an ID so I cant prove im over 21 so i cant get alchol if I wanted it!
but i can drink in my country
anyone want to play Board Game or Xypssy
RoseLove`: good for you
they are just crazy
maybe later, zamer
LOL I love that car with the pile of hay
RoseLove`: ... so which country is yours >.>

:D
05cowvarkian: medicated
okay, youtube
05cant be arsed with typos
Wrek: ah, ok
You started quite a few arguements in here Wrek
I dislike Penn and Teller anyways... Anarcho-capitalist and anti-religion. They might as well worship Any Rand
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i-1h82jSvDI/UJ77JRr0s8I/AAAAAAAAGyA/3KuSJXWe9oI/s1600/2577437132.jpg
Rex_Mundi: I like them more now
is there a stream?
nope
:3
I miss the stream
oh good
ill go back to watching deponia playthroughs
here, have some music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBYZ5puz-lk
05i liek them because even if they bring you your views. they present some facts in biased light that makes you think. and on some points they actually are right. i persoanlyl dotn agree with everything they say
05but beats watching jersey shore
cowvarkian: Objectivism= Anti-religion, Anti-government, pro-capitalism, anti-charaity
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=4tQZmooQc28#t=1079s
anything beats watching jersey shore
Cypresswolf: true
6I like how the guy crashes and then just picks up his bag and walks off like nothing happened..
Rex_Mundi: yeah, I know
Well
So basicly Wrek got banned for showing opinions
Is Jersey shore even still on?
Since the begining of time, mankind had evolved from a cell...Scienctists called it...The Gak.
G3.6 > Jersey Shore
Honey Boo Boo and Jersey shore are close
Derpy_Hooves: naw, the episode he showed was about porn
Rex_Mundi: they cancel it :3
05so it had some cut shots with tits
Tab fail
DerpyMuffins or basically, something people were too immature to handle
05ie jsut aas movie night tends to have
141
05but no matter now
so how long are you banned for Wrek?
05anotehr 7 days
Til the 18th
7 days
till this sunday right?
I think JS finally got expired or cancelled, I dont care which
05but yeah
So is that basically the same as dragons den?
05theres a reason behind there not being as much streams lately
Afflict, yeah
Did anyone actually like that show? It seams that everyone hated it.
usa version
what is it?
midterms
theres a canadian dragons den too
and a UK one.
my brother watched it quite a bit
Rex_Mundi: if nobody did it wouldnt get this far
Out of all the modderators I've missed, it had to be Silverscreen and DCD.
How does the streaming work?
Nobody liked this, but it got made. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymKLymvwD2U
we offer a virgin sacrifice to the Buffer Goddess and pray for a streamer
;)
Rex_Mundi: check the likes vs dislikes. It seems those who watched it mainly liked it.
Why does it need to be a virgin
okay, the booze are kicking in
o_O... is this guy serious?
and i fel cuddyl right nwo
because Berry dranked all the booze
*feel cuddly right now
Rex_Mundi well it was the child of will smith, you either expect them to be cool or end up like their dad during his rapping days

TROctavia it's supernatural law.

Still drinking 3 bottles isnt good for you
DerpyMuffins: yeah, this is true

what exam is it
DerpyMuffins: 21,025 just done. That's my writing for today done.
yeah...
Don't know how a commercial that is twice as shown can suddently be an meme.
hey Hypercynder
GilDash: :$ :$ :$ :$ :$ <--- in my stash :D
Ohh, Internet, U SO RANDOM
you know what I like about Sombrero?
DerpyMuffins: That's the toral, not today's word count. XD
VenHur: because the internet is a series of tubes
Oh
Total
VenHur was it only shown twice?
not a big truck, but a series of tubes
Deacon: Yeah.
If the internet is a series of tubes, I would hate to have the job of cleaning the tubes that run 4chan.
If you put the internet into a tube, it would extend twice the size of the universe.
The pressure would be so great, that.. you wouldn't want to put the internet into a tube.

http://fav.me/d5ksdzy
without me
cause
and how; that sombra comic XD
oh snap rarty got trolled
ahhahaha
having visitors to the crystal empire seems at odds with the the fact that nopony knew anything about it
god speed
except for celestia and luna
Jageman: well, maybe everyone knew about it 1000+ years ago
Ooh, Shizuka's playing GTA IV.
maybe everyone forgot about it
I had a hunch she'll be streaming.
then celestia would have known about the crystal heart
Jageman: she gave twilight the task to find it
and told cadence about it
im all out of wine
Jageman: I dont know, it was contrived enough
and this is a problem
im losing so hard
is there a stream?
Jageman: Maybe she didn't tell cadence
RoseCat`stop, seriously
Wait, question; Aren't the crystal ponies thosands of years old?
HAVE THEY NEVER AGED?!?!
theyrw made of crystal
cuddly_kittehs: yeah, but they're aging stopped for some reason
cowvarkian: she knows about the empire but not evrything about it
*their
RoseCat`another bottle of wine won't solve your problems
cuddly_kittehs: they were asleep or something, who knows
gak
T_T
Why would she risk the lives of the main 6, cadence, shinning armor, and an entire empire to teach twilight a lesson?
Shizuka stream
cowvarkian: thye have been banished to somewhere
It IS the magical empidome of the world
flutterfan99: No >:I

6Νιάχαχαχα!
Oh.
lol
Whoops
So, I wonder if the streamer is a focused, responsible individual who will use as little force to reach his objectives. Or whether he is like me and each mission will include hiding from police to and from the location because of some unneccesarry bloddbath
What GTA has been on before?
