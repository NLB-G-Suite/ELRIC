Hollywood doesnt make parody's like they did decades ago
Lol
urk
I usually write fanfic during the weekends.
1,3she thought Derpy was a boy
Tovler: Agreed, Blazing Saddles was creative and kooky, whereas Epic Movie just spouts references.
04UH OH
SOO DAWWWWWW
I, for one, didn't notice until I read the article
dem ears!
I've almost got my charactor to Equestria
i know

Fucking can't even pronounce a letter correctly.
1,3she wasn't told otherwise
hip squee is win
04LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A BADASS IN THE CHAT
yeah, she just doesn't know anything about an unimportant background character
yes, which causes further manly tears from others :U
This ep and Baby Cakes seemed determined to be as adorable as physically possible.
here it comes!
11,01I agree with the insecure one in power!
but seriously
abcdefghi etc.
when filthy rich was poor, he was called dirt poor
hater
lets put the movie epic movie to /b/ for epic trolling
So Granny Smith can hardly walk, but she can hop like a boss?
"ya old jezzebell!"
be a fan of your own show
11,01This show is terrible!
But I still need a name
HAHAHA
SQUEEEEEEEEE
Dem ears

chickens_tired
Derpy still talked
i'm just happy Derpy was voiced at all
Some kid at our school got filthy rich today.
I swear, If derpy is in the next episode I will shit so many brix

it feels good even to see Diamond Tiara after that
I've finally named mine StinkomanFan. :P

Age of Wings and Steel
I need a name
And this is the episode that made is all hate Diamond Tiara-- and what the heck IS her talent, anyway?
What have I missed?
Diamond Tiara makes me want to punch a bunny

What are these things called "Ears"?
She's a fucknig troll
yeah bad things happend there.
Oh shut up Diamond Tiara
@Failmeter Epic Movie
oh dari we love you
Then I'm afraid not.
RAWRity, I suppose I was, and I appologize for that.
It's just that Apple Bloom in a bunny suit is so cute it's borderline illegal.
In her defense, Derpy isn't a very feminine name
Kencolt: Being a bitch
^wolf
No one likes you!
I never understood how comfy sitting in only your boxers was until this moment.
how does she fit her tail in that get up...
*sigh* Trolls...
When fluttershy's parents named her, how did they know she was gonna be shy when she grew up?
Dat Diamond Tiara trolling
^
hey the water needs bunny magic to make apples
bunny ears are attacehd to the ears on her head
He's so filthy
this god-damn show is ruining my life

0,14SuperBrony64|AFK, it never happened.
Fleur are you okay?
DSNesmith1: it's a story somebody wrote about finding a filly RD in the real world, then having to give her up after raising her. It's essentially a Boy and his Dog story, but with Ponies.
Nah-- she's just like me. Getting on in years.

SuperBrony64: yes, you lucky son of a griffon
does Granny have to choke a filly?

dem clowns
My personal problem with MLD is taht it doesn't feel as if they person writing just had a story to tell that was sad. It felt like they were trying every cliche/trope they could to try to make me sad. Didn't feel like an organic story, but rather manipulative.
SweetieBelle.exe has stopped working
Look at scootaloo omg
Sucks for her.
I was like "Wha?" when i read it, too

applebloom makes a good impersonation
Miss CHeerilee is so naive!!!!

so filly granny smith is in the early 1800's, normal time is in mid-late 1900s?
nice thing about writing far past fics is you get some leeway with the geography
I hope fimfiction has insurance on the servers
0,14I got a kirzstryfe on my tail! I can't shake him!
The song is pretty good
Anyone wonder why Granny Smith's hair is still white, even though she's supposed to be young?

The forest is not fit to enter... so Celestia gives the Apple family a homestead next to it.
at least she gave them land
:D
I dont think I'd mind too much
Celestia is too busy looking at this to care what happens to ponies. http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lets-get-to-that-party-quick.gif
Where is zecora?
years of scavenging skills > forgotten once they settle down
Mines5: Actually there's a person on YouTube who used information from one of the past videos to prove she's 400. She's only 600 years younger than Celestia.

Math is the human equivlent of unicron magic...

also, it was really nice to see the CMC doing stuff together that WASN'T about their Cutie Marks
10,02Which is why to never forget your elder relatives, always give them a call and say hi every so often. It might not be much, but to them, it means a lot.
Iweywrt: I'm thinking series finale.
Big Macintosh is tallest pony
And not a single "buck" was given that day

Thinking about getting some Spyro pieces...pry not a collection though :P dont got the money or resources for that

I watched half of Blazing Saddles, and I couldn't stay longer :c
going to BroNYCon so I should be able to XD
>_>

fimfiction being down and all
I might just watch ponies and talk tothese guys

mines5 techincally it was her husband

thought we were going to see Titan AE///
It's so pointless.
FUS RO DUH
We have too many friggin mods
everypony should see it
but
damnit
DSNesmith1: where do i recognise you from?
ud want to hug her husband
I rather like the PMV to THis is War. Not sure WHY I like it so much...
btw not nota the song is sick
10,02Correction, the room is #Vinyl_Scratch
I'm asking cause if you wanted to collect skylanders
It tries harder than God damn epic movie.
um... bronystate?
your going to have a real hard time getting the rare ones
0,5^GO THERE NAO
10,02But I'll let you know when requets are taken
And that's hard to do.
oh theres a space
im not very far into it
*feels emangamer¡s shame*
I've been here since mid-July
DSNesmith1: eeyup, Shizuka is a mod now
so far so good
THe song is pretty good
StinkomanFan: not true. 2 mods per channel on a saturday requires 14 mods
So, I take it not all the videos are pony related?
Alrighty guys im gonna go, nice IRC'ing again with ya :$
0,5Well not nao but when SB64 says so
how do you thro stuff
emangamer: not here he isn't

*throw
g'night :D
Powers revoked.
Night bro
is it too dark?
but this room doesn't need the mods, we're all perfectly little angels... right?
0,5DIDST THOU ENJOY THE MOVIES?
not at all
0,5>_>
No.
my opinion on Blazing Saddles was that, while it had funny gags in it, a lot of them were either ruined, or messed up by poor editing.
no
Well then that's less shameful Al
i go sleep now cya all ;)
that was to Cynical
like will i sleep okay?
LordCelestia|AFK: no. I did not.
I thought about applying for modship, then decided I prefer screaming in the main chat over having to ban people for posting video links and talking in colors
To be honest and blunt.
how do you do that emangamer?
The story get's pretty violent but not as bad as cupcakes, more Rocket To Insanity gory
Sorry, it's just that I'm new here :P
LordCelestia no.
Pfft.
ok good
/me gives SuperBrony64 a hard smack on the flank
yay new draw friend on eqd
The 2 movies averaged a score of 2/10 for me so...nope.

Don't worry, I won't request Cupcakes this week, I've got a more awesome video to request anyway
Meh, I personally didn't think cupcakes was a very good fanfic.
Skipper: I am the god of IRCs
/me gives HUGS FOR EVERYPONY!
I don't like grimdark fics so I never read cupcakes
Epic Movie was a travesty of a film
It'e very overrated.
Me and a Collector have been working weekly to find the uncommon figures

G'night everypony, hugs for everyone :D
"coolness that defies gravity"
GASP

It really was out of character and just downright awful
AJIsBestPony: oh my god...you aren't going to survive here....
It hasnt been real easy
Hugs All around

Everlasting_Joy: Exactly what I say about Blazing Saddles
LordCelestia|AFK: your kidding right?
I found it funny at the time LordCelestia|AFK, but having been through the whole of them now I find the amusement rapidly declining.
thsi is madness

There is not a single funny scene in Blazing Saddles.
10,02Never saw Revenge of the Nerds before ^_^

/me pulls a pinkie pie and hugs everpypony
If I could get popular just by writing something extremely gory and vile, I wouldn't because I'm bigger than that
And I'm gonna leave

SPOILERS
3No pony is fine, I love it
YEs I love this song
idc
good day :P
My Request!!!
Yay!!
im not reading this if she dies
No pony is best pony.
3:3 great LunaTheBeloved!
DO THE LOVE SONG CMC from powerpuff girls.
Thank ye
dashie is best pony
Twilight Sparkle voiced by Jeff Gollbum
It doesn't specify at the end
Do a video of when derpy talked :3
my video is a review of epic movie btw. so much better than the actual movie
NEXT video must be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuQy5dY2JzQ&feature=g-hist&context=G2921f5cAHTyDslwAMAA
*gulps*
and Rainbow Dash voiced by Sylvester Stalone.
To whom ever is running the stream... THANK YOU for leaving the title of the vid visible. No more need to ask what we are watching... THANKS!
is absolutely hilarious XD
/me doesn't particularly like Mumford and Sons
No, really, there's a cliffhanger
And now we play the waiting game
Colt_Magnum: No, I think if there's a G5 it will just be G4 continued with new characters. The Mane 6 will have gotten old and replaced by characters just as loveable.
Derpy is good therapy
Request it in #vinyl_scratch
i do believe you have an interesting concept their Monkey.
/me feels bad that Taby didnt know Derpy was a girl :(
g5 = cmc
LunaTheBeloved is back !!! : http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/588/
"I just don't know what went wrong"
this ain't doing it for me
There was no suh movie!
I wonder... does Luna get pinged whenever someone pings LunaTheBeloved?
which is unusual because RAWRity and I have polar opposite tastes
It lets you use your imagination
I think FIM will run for 3-4 seasons then we will get a spinoff, probably with the CMCs, and probably not as good
It would be funny if it was scripted right.
Derpy 's voice reminded me of Ed from EEnE.
What was that link some one sent me?
Howdy BronyTOM
Am I the only one?
The 3 CMC, Snails, Snips, and Twist are all the new Elements in G5.
RawketLawnchair: not really....yea you are the only one
It would be funny if it was scripted right.
LunaTheBeloved: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/588/
this just feels like watered down Folk Punk to me.
Lol twist?
Bah.
fim will have 7 seasons then get canceled midseason in the 7th
LOL... Mammoth died int he gate to teh fort
<3
there's nothing catchy in this
I hate country music
this syncs up suprisingly well with "live & learn"
it's just bland
so much
3that sophisticated Luna x3
adorable :D
At least bodies go "no clip" when they die
/me smokes on his corn cob pipe "quite LunaTheBeloved....quite"
StinkomanFan: this...isn't country music.
She's a late bloomer, she gets less hated when she's older.
well i must agree but also state that most anything scripted correctly would be appealing in a comedic or other sence
still funny... it takes the entire arch.
/me feels like Fancy Pants
/me puts on her monocle
I'm just saying
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved
lol
So are the B movies always like epic movie?
good evening everypony
wow, that is fancy
08,14I wub woo~
my mother loves country

10,02B stands for BETTER
srry messed up

/me pokes Shizuka
Good taste TopHat.
Well Welcome, Bronies are widely varied in attitude XD
I'm just assuming in my own little dream world and in my bubble of personal mental safety that that is how MLP will be continued and it will be just as awesome. Just be super duper overly optmistic. Don't want to think about MLPFIM ending.
Scoot-Scootaloo: you crashed my browser

Hey, easy with the wub button there, Shizuka
Wubbity wub wub

Fluttershy fans are mute.
Rarity: RAINBOW DASH...please....stop moving...your going to ruin...my dress!
Why Scoot always get the blame!
/me pulls everypony into a glomp pile
I don't remember who, but they mentionedIron Maiden earlier
Yeah, I see what you mean, enjoy it while its here, no need to think about the end of it
mlp will not continue, g5 will be a relaunch
Too much wub. Cab we have some wike to clear our palates?

no way
Rainbow dash:*incomprehensible mumbling*
i was brony since november
Me gusta
awww, I hope you do my video, it really is funny
*grin*
SHHHH! Pinkie's singing.
Country can be good when it's actually about something genuine, but 99% of the time with most modern country songs, you just get a lot of "Oh yeah, life sure is great here in Nashville. and I like Jimmy Buffet."
I'm not sure they usually do a pick as much as a "roll down the line"
oh boy
uh oh, this sounds like it's going to get screamy
because the timbre wolves
this song is actually hilariously awesome
MirrorImage: I feel aweful for Iweywrt....
3All the wub and glomps!
Bwahahahahahaa!
1,3$20 this was Lasharus
mmm, maybe not
Excellent a newfoal!!!
Yeah
Dr. Robotnik is BACK!
I am the Eggmare, that is who I am. I am the Eggmare, I got the master plan.
what for emangamer?
but depends on the moment I suppose
MirrorImage: this was his first BMN
Hello everypony.
0,14that's a safe bet, kirzstryfe
the only country song I've ever liked was "what was I thinking"
Dr. Robotnik is BACK! MWAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!
herro
there are times when I wonder if the skylanders toys will just sell for real cheap a year from now
:P
who else could it have been kirz?
we need more of The Great and Powerful Trixie
Goo Goo G'joo
What is My Little Amnesia..? It's in my recommneded vids, but I'm not sure that I want to click it...
/me performs a sonic rainboom to impress Rainbow_Dash
Came back
Yes, yes and YES.
hey there
Dr. Eggpony
And what a good guess kirzstryfe. :P
:D I approve of this
Lasharus: his name is robotnick...he makes robots and turns things into robots... its ROBOTNIC
Perfect in every way.
Skipper >u<
1,3:)
That's a good one.
Can't remember who though
so this is where I can watch the newest episode?
Trixie for Queen of Equestria 2012.
/me is unimpressed by Skipper's trick
We better get a The Great and Powerful Trixie episode either this season or next
/me hugs Fleur
/me became a brony this past summer
I think in my case it was about August, or so... maybe earlier. Heard stuff on the Net... wondered what the fuss was about.... had the Hub on my cable... and fell into the herd.
Yes.
Back
IshBestPony: I though you were going to stop giving Fleur hugs
/me frowns at emangamer
I am the eggman
Thanks so much guys for the warm welcome :)
I hate that my family wont SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP at 10:30 AT NIGHT
what would happen if a parasprite got a taste of princess mollestia's god-blood?
emangamer - actually, it's ROBOTNIK.
yes Al?
Everyone spells it wrong.
I am the eggmare, oh man.
emangamer then Lyra left
/me summons the great and powerful TRIXIE to attack emangamer
Lasharus: I hate you
y u no like skipper 8c
March of 2011 I became Brony
i am the derpyman
Or else I'll kick the current director's ass out the door and bring in the bronies to assume control for the sake of making a Trixie episode.
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen, I am the walrus. GOO GOO G'JOOB!
IshBestPony: what?
Love you too emangamer. :p
thats how most convert, are curious and find show entertaining
so no Johnny Horton fans here?
I think they've confirmed there won't be a trixie episode
yo no is talking
Oh crap there is a parasprite
Come early and watch us rage at Strawberry shortcake.
Not sure if best pony is Dashie, Fluttershy, Twilight, Luna or Celestia.
poor seth
Are you a troll?
emangamer because ponies
In the near futre
What? But The Great and Powerful Trixie must have more time in the spotlight!
Also, Celestia is best pony.
Skipper: There is only one other pony who's name you could mutter to make me hate you SO MUCH more...
yep
IshBestPony: seriously...what?
There is no best pony they are all awesome
Praise the Sun!
So have any of you guys seen my famous picture?
all of the above
It's just bitch bitch bitch with these people
She is the GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE!
And emangamer - was that a reference to Escapist's Unskippable?
maybe
Scoot-Scootaloo: that one? yes
trixieburg...*shudders*
emangamer meow
That works
Fuck this, The Great and Powerful Trixie will take over the show
Well... I am best wolf. ^_^

famous picture?
and i have to figure it out
it's NOT Eggman
Lasharus: INDEED...you get 1000 points and a brohoof /]
They need to, but I don't know, I guess we'll just need to wait and see
it's ROBOTNIK!
You aren't even a wolf.
Seeya CaptainSkyworthy
And Twilight said that she has to learn her lesson. I MUST KNOW IF SHE LEARNED HER LESSON!
Robotnik is the true name!

CUPCAKES!

Hey! SuperBrony64 you taking requests?

#Vinyl_Scatch
This intro
Then I saw Italians.
I don't know, this is an awesome intro, but it seems like it gives too much to us.
CANCERRRRRR
this theme
Darf14 i don't remember it being so long
the italian opening
#Vinyl_Scratch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRx_iXgLAyw
UBERCANCER
3This is really great opening
/me snickers
20% cooler opening then ours
Heh, they got a brony with After Effects knowledge to help. XD
This theme is so much better!
It just felt long
That's the idea-- Italy imports a LOT of anime.
Nightwing - it's an extended version
will we have to deal with the adds during the episode
indeed that is good
WTF is up with nonstop ads?
it's so monotonous
Iv know
We need this opening...
lyra has talking lines in italian, of course their theme is best pony
I don't even watch the intro
Do epic pie time. Its with ponies
the song's enough
This feels like something out of an anime.
THIS OPENING FILLS MYY SOUL
and stereotypical
Our opening is 20^9001% cooler!
kinda like how the season 1 pokemon intro had the "tv version" and the "full version"
Yeah
Yeah
It is so epic
huh, I wonder what the lyrics are on this intro
/me joins TopHat
italy is best pony
05,15This opening is awesome! THough it does feel a bit anime ish to me
> Anime Fun
It reminds me of an anime opening.
i concur cynical
EPIC PIE TIME! please!
Germany is the best pony
I really like this theme. :O
PONYYYY
NEEDS EPIC PIE TIME
1,3.1: you have to post that in the actual chat channel, and 2: you probably won't get rainbow factory played
^
yes more applejack!!!! this pleases DERPY
watch the allcaps people
>Anime Fun
This opening is pure win!
But Germany and Italy to-geather makes the best lulz
its not rainbow factory
in harmony, great adventures they shall have
is it "non ti fermade"?
Die in a fire derpy 88
it's too anime for my taste as well, but I won't negate it's awesomeness hehe
I made up the first part of the first chorus' believed translation: "Cause we are My Little Ponies, weekly entertaining the bronies!"
MirrorImage i was talking about the last one
y'know
HAHA but why? it's a good song!
This song if sold could solve the debt problems of Italy
MirrorImage: You're not a mod, silly filly. <3
Are you sure this isn't the Japanese opening?
xD
as to the music: it's like a really bad dance party
plus the song is effing addictive Dx
1,3not yours BronyCon, not_a_cannibal's
the italian intro is pretty damn good
Hahaha!
I have no words
stfu or gtfo mistafish

That is an awesome opening!
3So great!
If I was gonna request something I would say epic pie time
who agrees this is pretty damn good?
wow italians know how to make a dang good opening!
Jigglypuff??
...speaking of season 1 pokemon...
italian sound like spanish o.o
The singers are what help sell it in my opinion.
I AM A MEME VERMIN SUPREME!
maybe i will!
wow... im stunned
what is this amazingness?
:D :D :D
Epic Pie Time!
PLEAASE
argh,i come back on our craptacular intro

How about Coolness That Defies Gravity by Jackle App?
Jiggly puff ._. oh gawd

Italian words are based from latin, so if you know portuguese or spanish you can actual recognize some of the words, and Japanese music.... Well it would have giant robots in it.
Obeyyyy
Celestia is a boss
tYou know what... If I was the EU and I saw this I would be like... ok you know what Italy you dont have to pay anymore

Are these really requests?
I mean, it's neither pony NOR funny. It's quite good, but huh?
im on ps3 WAY more often though :/
the hole is a feature!
Moar ponies, plz?
A Star Wars game how original
If they're gonna play a game trailer, play the Skyrim one!
the sinking ship effects everyone so its not a bug
Trailer is pretty.
In Star Wars... No one is gay.
I actually had hope for this game after seeing this trailer
oh
Star wars, *jizz*
Pity the game doesn't look as good.
then I saw the gameplay
Everybody's seen that.
Well, im going to bed everypony!!! Gotta wake up so I can see you all here during the new episode! :P
um what do you mean not so great?
seriously i mean... SERIOUSLY?????
In Skyrim, everyone is lesbians
oo
still torn on whether or not the game is worth the money
Except C-3PO
I used to play Xbox
man, games from 2009 are so blocky
I am not impressed by trailers that are nothing but CGI and no gameplay
Alrighty guys! Its time for me to hit the hay (lol puns). I'll see you all later and its good to be back!
night RaveBrony
What's your PS3 GT?
05,15well anyway, I'm going to bed. Goodnight eveypony, See you all in the morning

it's a BIOWARE star wars game!
They're releasing Star Wars in 3D soon.
I'm not seeing any ponies here.

I was joking, I wasn't trying to offend anyone
Star Wars, the universe where you can tell good from bad by laser color.

In real life you can tell good people from bad people by how good their mustaches are.
heresey toy_pon3. han shot first
well, to be honest, there's not a PC existing that COULD pull off this kind of graphics in online gameplay, and anypony who thinks otherwise is a dolt.

But the commercial showed nothing in the way of story

and they didn't pay in kisses
And I PITY the empty minded person who expceted the gameplay to be like the trailer.
You're welcome.
Ken: No one blames them for having a shiny trailer and weaker video, honestly....it's more the fact that the trailer misled them into thinking it was different than it was.
anyone here skype?

dubstep is awful
Al: you too, hope to see you tomorrow for the livestream
also dis song
piano? good luck
Dubstep = alien messages
have fun dreaming about epic movie
dubstep is the reason jesus died on the cross
Hey i like dubstep
10,02bluestrom_S: wub wub wub
Dubstep does not sound like music to me...
dubstep killed JFK
I see all classrooms as a communist type of area....
mmmm radiation... I actually had a real life Nuka Cola Quantum once... It. Was. GREAT!
Heh
lol dat headbob
night Everlasting_Joy
Needs more blues
hate it
Dubstep, you can't explain that
GAH! Thank goodness I don't dream.
true lol
Aliens
Thanks (:
To each their own
dubstep assasinated martin luther king jr
.
My body is ready for tomorrows episode..... It wasnt ready for last weeks episode
epic movie was saxy
why i dont do public school anymore :d
but then you cant dream of pony
Nice skills
Which is the SAT and which is the ACT again?
I'm in a small charter school :S
I head bang that quickly sometimes XD
YOU KNOW WHO DIDNT ASSASINATE ANYONE?
Hey, there's ponies alive in here!
okay
fucking classic rock
Eh, I'll take electronica over dubstep
ACT prepares you for SAT i believe
It's harsh I don't get to dream of ponies, but if it spares me of nightmares like Epic Movie, it's a decent payoff.
you said that already
bronystate is too fast for me.
uh no
But I can dig some wubwubwub every now and again
WHAT IS LOVE
Epic movie was an epic fail
BABY DON'T HURT ME
Classic rock and the blues bro
DON'T HURT ME
ACT and SAT are two different tests
Vinyl appears to be having a siezure at her turntables, somepony should call her an ambulance.
NO MORE
hell yeah
can we move on to the next part of the song?
Das Essentials
Act scores in 2-36, SATs have numbers like 1780 and 2400
oh
ZZ TOP, DEEP PURPLE AND STEPPEN WOLF ALL DAY EVERY DAY
I know the feeling TechRat
/me noms TopHat
havent hit that part of high school yet so i have no idea :P
I'd learn to play blues guitar if I wasn't lazy.
get rid of it, please dubstep is my only weakness, apart from arrows to the knee.
My neck is getting sore
We've replaced Vinyl with a giant bobblehead. Let's see if they notice.....
i play keys
night Everlasting_Joy sleep well
that headbob
I've been having rather unpleasant dreams lately
/me noms on SuperBrony64
hey Fenrir, I lied, the ACT was the one i didn't study for and did fine on
And I could find the strings for my brother's guitar
something about sharks
Well i'm off to read, Goodnight everyone Bye~
The headbanging is to intense it lags the stream
I don't recall the SAT
I'm tasty, aren't I?
they're gone
Damn, Vinyl can bob her head FAST.
you are what you eat
it didn't end well
damn it!
I have diarrhea
Robo-Dale: No, PSAT is prep for SAT. ACT is another test entirely.
heh
how do those glasses stay on?
same for my brother buytoast
/me wears kirzstryfe
vinyl is a bobble head
MINE ARE BIGGER
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
wow, its been a long time that I did the SAT test
SAT is a lot harder than the ACT
Cancel that ambulance, it's a bobblehead.
PSAT is easy, though
he got drunk and had no sleep before hand and still scored above average
dep purple is bigger than dem guys
see how it feels
yea thats one the prep one is named i couldnt think of it to save my life
HELLO!!
yeah, and it's a hundred times worse during the new episode pony_8127. Ugh.
or at least, people said 27 was fine
I made my own Nukacola Quantum. Took it to the launch of Fallout New Vegas at the Gamestop where I work. Beautiful electric glowing liquid! :D
TO BE USED
And i will be back at some point
stupid amths

Gnight guys i'm off to read, See ya Bye~:)
name me one person that doesnt know smoke on the water
I took my SAT the year before they changed it to Reading/Math/Writing. :3
oh wait
And it's very liquid
depends on what college you want to get into
Deep Purple, great band and one of the god fathers of metal.
you should shoot for at least a 30
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT sleep well
True
I have to go to bed soon so that I have a good sleep for the test. I am so worried about bombing it
hell yeah negro
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
wat
see you tomorrow for sure
But still...
okay to be honest I didnt take the SAT because I'm not planning on going to a UC
what's the AJ one????
>.>
I hope
>_<

Also, I just noticed I'm not signed in.

And to some extents Steppenwolf.
If I had remembered how to do Geometry I probably would've gotten a 30.
Black Sabbath
DASH FAIC
<3
heres that faec again
Stupid shapes.
bc it's slowly dieing down
27 will get you into normal colleges. 30 is helpful if you intend to go Ivy League.

/me glomps Fleur
http://www.nuka-cola.com/
well the ASVAB isn't quite the same as SAT. but 97 is pretty good
i already passed it last year, but my school didnt offer anything higher, so I am just taking it again to keep it fresh in my head
I'm glad to know no one noticed my embarrassing statements
Hey guys, long time no see. Hows everypony?
my SAT wasn't so hot
lol Analysis Connection
I'd have to dig for the SAT.
I got either 28 or 29, sommat like that. Had no trouble getting colleges to beg for me to go there with that. You do not need a 30 to compete. :p
I go 2040: 680 in each Category
pony_7779: I took SAT when it was 1600, I got a 1120
i noticed them
SAT 1760
guyz i did it!
Well now that you mentioned them...
cause in Pinkie_Pie the party never stops
1300/1600 for me
Everytime the have a group hug, I just D'aww on the outside.
and screencapped them
I didn't care to notice.
im on mirc!
......shit
and printed them off
might as well leave until the mane ghat starts getting spammed
Darn chat, always ruining cakes.
32 ACT
Don't remember
my math sucked
and mailed them to your mom
was probably awful though
chat'
it just has nap breaks
didn't pay attention to the essay because it didn't matter
SAT, code for suck A** test
dawwwww
I always ran out of time on the math bits
Is this song from Titan A.E.?
I want my "GO GO POWER RANGERS" moment from them
no
BUT ! My military aptitide test was 79/99
: (
that scene chokes me up every time
680 Writing, 680 Reading, 680 Math. I may not be in the top, but damn if I'm not consistent.
Thy shalt not leave until I get Retsupurea
I got, like a 2 on the essay
What's Mirc?
Good at math, but my current Professor is harsh
Dragonshy came close
lol RAWRity
i dont really care she would just give me more pepto bismol
So very very close
Or it turns to one oclock
But not quite
wow rawrity. those are awesome scores
consistancy is good
I don't remember what my breakdown scores were at all
1:44 in the morning
watching ponies
I got a 1280 on the SAT, back when it only had two sections and that was considered a decent score. xD
690 reading / 610 math. Its why i'm a history major
they should play Titan A.E. for next movie night XD
If I had taken Math before taking the SAT, I would have done better
i do enjoy this song. it is quite nice.
What is 9 hours from now here...
they are
its 00:48 here
I'd rather have a hard prof than one who just doesn't care about teaching the class
6am
8|
yay it works
is good song
cosmic you aint a real fan
maaaaan
I go to a research uni so none of the profs want to teach
one of my academic advisors actually said to me "That's some balanced fucking knowledge"
I wish I had friends....Um, I mean, I'M VERY SOCIAL!...confound these ponies
Well...buck.
they just want to do their research
:P Hey guys!
Oh hey, can I get colelctive thoughts on some pictures?
damn yous a poser
Why?
im an engenir..enginir, enjineer,....im good at math
YOU AINT GOT NUTTIN ON MY YO DOG
that sucks DSN.
BRO FISITA
which means you're boned if the book isn't good
I kept getting high scores on just individual tests, getting canceled out by low scores on the other for the overall
Could have retaken but would've needed to take the Writing section, I said screw that.
:D
HOE DISSIN YAH
good teachers can make or break how you do in a class
I'm in lesbians with you!
Who?
true
What?
I'm confused
my E&M teacher is awfu
/me slaps not_a_cannibal around a bit with a large trout
i may need to obtain it for my music collection.
It's a joke.
he just throws equations on the board
Not just you then
o_o
From a movie.
doesn't explain the physics at all
Scott pilgrim ftw.
I know
Yes.
anyone here a history major?
I fuckin love
and I got the wrong textbook version
i hate it when teachers do that
it
Yo soy no comprendo!
Scott Pilgrim pwns.
D8
yey
They should play it one Ronystat.
but im confused by the rest of the conversation
Maybe it's just a smushed cake
I'm going to a tech college so I essentially teach myself for the most part. Teachers are just there when you fuck up the computers.
im homeschooled and i have a retired science teacher whos real awesome i can go to for help on my stuff :P
nuetrinos, the scourge of physisists
Man the college history course i took in hs junior was DANG HARD
I don't get out much
/me hugs every remaining pony

scott pilgay is overrated hipster bullshit
My E T Teacher is the worst, 1st day of class instant test!
I'm doing kind of the opposite of particle physics
hooray for astro majors
Alright, My Little Bronies. I'm calling it a night. See you in the morning!

Looks like we have some neighsayers in the audience
Ever hear if there was anything done by that MLP studio-employee who put out a request for OC ponies? Other than his email exploding. And yes, the cake was in the box and it all slid to one side.
love astro!

I do recommend retaking Calc I in college unless you're REALLY sure about it, though

I opted to take Honors Junior English instead of AP. Holy Fuck was that class boring.

This song is simply the best. Never before have I heard such sweet tunes from anyone besides Rebecca Black. In fact, she was my idol when I was 4, she saved my life when I was deep in depression. Throughout my life I cannot help but pause and give homage to this great turn in music history. May the name of Rebecca Black forever be remembered along with the names of Bach, Debussy, and the Beatles.

SuperBrony64: who is streaming?
It's a star rod that has awesome powers.
Woona is one of the most adorable ponies
just thought of it
That'sall you gotta know.
Link to vynal?
This game takes about a day of playtime to finish, if you know what your doing. It's one of the longest I've ever played.
/me HUGS OTAKON
2001 Nintendo?

The cake is a lie

The cake is always a lie
Needs commentary
You said dere would be cayke.

The game is a lie

This is one of my favorite games
I'd buy a 3ds just for paper mario

Desert Toad is best toad.

the graphics in mario 64 seem worse than usual
10,02O U

super paper mario*
Say Yay if you think N64 was the best console Nintendo ever released!
Bon nuit
SuperBrony64: why such a roundabout route for him to stream?
Yay.
their paper
I still have the game for the N64, too bad the joy stick is too busted up to play it :'(
its paper mario but not sure why its 3d
thats where the secret switch is
Wait. Is Paper Mario coming to the 3DS? If it is i'm going to get one just for that!
Mario always looks stylish.
Super paper mario was sidescroller
2.5D?
Yay! But mostly cause it was my most played console
Darf14:Amazon has some you can buy
just get it for wii
wiiware that shit
Mario always dresses in style
Red and blue do go well together.
it's sorta the motif for the game, it's more apparent later on
WTB logical explanatiopn of this game.
The Wii one is way different though
rainbow dash always dresses in style
cool, thanks Luna

looks like I missed the movies
But it was good nonetheless.

The star rod grants wishes.
Taking a moment to pause in my saving of a woman in Skyrim to say that YES, Twilight is Best Pony! :)
That's some serious renovations of the basement.
Celestia helped bowser
He just wished that his castle was under Peaches.
And them bam a castle.
i dont understand this gaim
i don't remember fully for this game, but for the second one, you could turn sideways to fit through narrow passages, poke holes in enemies to do damage (since they are paper) etc.

pony_7770: this is live...
I'm just remembering how great the intro to Paper Mario was done
This is live
emangamer:Pip pip and whatnot
oh the new episode wont come fast enough
#vinyl_scratch
Mario : Beating Young Koopa Children Since the 1980s.
This playthrough really needs some commentary.
i thought there would be movies n stuff
ouch
LunaTheBeloved: I say chap, do you care for a spot of tea?
LunaTheBeloved: No thank you mi lady.
this is the shtuff I rekon
This video had better not end. I need something to watch tonight.
why doesnt he block?
idk
it might be muddy
lol
TOY_PON3: no...this is mine and LunaTheBeloved's thing...you dont even get it
If this had commentary it would be perfect
brb food
use your summoning esper!
i think they finihed the other stuff?
He needs the lucky star item before he can block and use action commands Quin
brb cookies
i wouldnt exactly call gameplay of paper mario a movie
btw, since Epic Movie got WMCed, what's on tap for tomorrow's B Movie?
emangamer:Be nice to the old bean, he means no harm
*heartbeat* In a world...
Revenge of the Nerds.
I should totally commentate... =p
Requires more yays.
emangamer: care for a duel of fisty cups?
Star Wars Uncut: Director's Cut
brb.....oh yeah...i hae no food...
Monty Python.
*inception music*
LunaTheBeloved: Quite right, but I simply would like to show how much I endear you...
so the local gang is head by shrooms ? is that ironic or what?
00,10RAWRity, 15 min of scootaloo on a scooter looped
Also there's like 3 Seltzerberg movies for you to pick.
emangamer, why I could simply die for a spot of tea, thank you my good man
emangamer: I dare say, what seems to have your knickers in a twist and your sensibilites all in a kerfuffle?
Sumica: Jolly good.
10,02Sumica: That. TONIGHT
*heartbeat* ...where everything is made of paper...
please no
Wooo
emagamer: Might I intrest in one of these scones?
huh, I wonder why its loading at a fast speed?
RAWRity: such fowl language....I dare say you should go and sleep...
I would watch that
*heartbeat* ...one man...
THE FINGER WAVE
YES
LunaTheBeloved: Scones? What a TWEEEEEST
why cant he just jump on them is the action scene realy necicary?
the videos broken
Who's staying up all night for the new ep?
*speeding heartbeat* ...must save the one he loves...
derpsalot: referesh
Me
emangamer: ah you and your draconian sense of language. tis modern day ol' chap. No need to be prudish about all this.
I'll try
everytime mario fingerwaved i was like "don't disrespect"
I wanna watch this
*rising atonal music*
emangamer:I say old chap, this stream is simlpy riveting
When does Lady Bow show up?
*silence*
She's near the end of the game
chapter 3 i think
10,02Lol, any Mod that stays up all night is going to regret it tomorrow >_<
wow....Lady Bow is a ways in.
Way later Tovler
*SUPRISEBUTTSECKS* *MOLESTIA*
Title: PAPER MARIO (only in theatres)
she is like 4th companion
RAWRity: Quite, but I simply wish to reserve the old fashions and tributes.
not until chapter 3
/me dons his monocle
i'd pay for it
(and piratebay)
Her attack pattern hurt my fingers
Goombas: "I never asked to be a art of this!"
/me gets her pocket watch and cane out
emangamer = The Big Cheese?
so, is this the streamer playing, or is this a lets play?
needs moar explosions
emangamer: can't keep on dwelling in the past my boy, only leads to being and antique in your later years.
LunaTheBeloved: <insert picture of nigel thronberry> I SAY...is this what westernes think of us?
buck
or pirate it i guess
its streamer
cool
hurry up. Lady Bow is the best thing ever and everyone here needs to see her.
I got work tomorrow.. BAH! WORK BE DAMNED! I"M STAYING UP ALL NIGHT!
Though its in dire need of commentary
XD
as much as i like mario, i dont just wanna watch you play it all night
:|
Theres usually a back screen when transisioning from one area to the next, I wonder why its jumps to the next screen immediately
Oh Mollestia..you and your fillygraping ways.
No
emangamer: I am appaled at the very though of such injustices to us!
*appalled
RAWRity: But, then good sir, do you attribute this new fangles "steam punk" fashion going around this so called interwebs?
cute goombas
Iwewrt: we are the commentary
mkay ill write the screenplay
RAWRity: What* my most sincere appologies
only with text
Once you get back to town how about we do more requests?
Twilight's parents probably knew what Celestia was doing to their daughter but didnt say anything because it would mean Twilight's future would be ruined.
/me puts on top hat
rapping
Now I'm fancy quite
micheal bay directs and every two seconds there must be an explosion
LunaTheBeloved: What What. I say we go and teach those westerns what for. Are you up for a round of fisty cuffs
/me removes the top hat from TOY_PON3
AH brilliant idea for a fanfic
/me smacks emangamer's hand with white glove
Such a fashionable hat does not belong on a WHELP such as you
With how fast the streamer's going through text, we'll at least make it to the first dungeon
/me becomes a top hat
/me wears Midnight_Tempest
except that would never be succesful in the general community
i say i believe we have a duel on our hands
emangamer:I do say though, I am rather tired. I think I will, oh how is it the westerneres say it, "Hit, the hay".
/me now feels classy
TOY_PON3: Do not try your hand at things you do not wholy appreciate..."good SIR"
Then years later repressed feelings would finally well up in Twilight as her friends worry and question the things theyve seen done to her by the princess.
/me eats Phase4's brain
*westerners
._.
emangamer: Ah yes, that old codswollop. I'm afriad that while the notion had a bit of merrit, most of the artisans seem to abide by the delusion that simply throwing gears and switches around higgeldy-piggeldy, that they can somehow capture a feeling of grandness.
gnight LunaTheBeloved
LunaTheBeloved: Perhaps you shouldn't hit the hay, maybe you should just partake a nap upon it?
Make sure that you don't give Mario any lines. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpLXo55yfw
No Twilight, thats not just a game you and the princess like to play!
how long till mario is done
/me will be awake untill the episode
sleep well LunaTheBeloved
Cheerio, LunaTheBeloved!
its 17:37 here
RAWRity: Higgeldy-Piggeldy? Since when did you partake of such slanguage?
I think I shall
suddenly
wtf was that?
lol what?
Goodnight everypony
voices?
yay
later LunaTheBeloved
in MY head?
/me hugs everypony goodnight
SB64 had a MIC and wasn't using it?
lol i heard egoraptor in the background
night dear
RAWRity: social language* (slang)
did anyone hear talking in the background?
Tovler: nah, it's from a pony inspired video
lol at awesome reach
lol
DUDE SO
dude so
oh nvmd
that my good sir, is what one would call a portmanteau....
yea...
ARE YOU READY
SO DUDE
whoah ya
FOR HALO REACCHHHHH
around
emangamer: why, since I was a lad! I spent many a summer's evening perusing through the grand novels of Robert Stroud and the like, and I dare say i enjoyed picking up my fare share of the common tongue.
I think im so tired im hearing voices
i just recall the horrible mario movie from like the 90s
:D
Either awesome Reach or the altered Brony version of that flash
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved goodnight
XD
i recall hotel mario
emangamer: I take it you mistake me for some country folk am I correct?
Halo may have Reach, but Mass effect has flexibility
eats popcorn
the brony version is awesome (not trying to be redundant)
never seen hotel mario. curious...
that was a joke.
RAWRity: Your father would be appaled at you. Talking and dressing like a sheer commmoner like TOY_PON3. You are the kind of person that shall reduce this country to the dark age once agiain.
again*
@pony_7770 there's only tea and scones in here
/me merges with the Internet 'I am INTERFACE!'
ARRRRRRG! NEED CAFFEINE TO FINISH MY DRAWING!
0-0*
Super Goomba Bros!
hmm. it might of been...drats.
red vs. Blue!
/me gasps
Wuh oh
wait, no horderves?
first thing to come to my mind
noteworthy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmVeZEB-Qmg
Red Oni, Blue Oni.
there was a trick to this one I think
Will you take the red goomba, or the blue goomba?
its simmons and caboose :D
emangamer: how absurd I...I...>.>
as goombas
That, indeed, one damage.
No thanks, I take all my caffeine in pill form
Probably the only good part of that movie.
omg this scene
emangamer: Bah, my father has as much respectability about him as a common tramp. He carries nothign in his pocket but lint and what pitty pettance he has for his next opium dose. The man had less to do with raising me than Attila the Hun.
Oh look dear chaps, I have reduced the streat urchen to tears HOHOHO
HE"S GOT A BOB-OMB!
Who the fuck
stole my nickname?
Dashi did
OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS
Whoever designed this game was on shrooms
ahhh hell no
IVE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE
dashie: hello there
emangamer: pah. A true gentlemen does not resort to belittling others like it is common sport!
heart box time
RAWRity: But I dare say that Atilla the Hun was a rather remakable and ingenious commander.
HOT DAMN
so pumped for tommorow morning
so
SO
HITTING THIS BLOCK

GETTING STARS
SAVE THE HELL OUT OF MY GAME
This is pretty much all you need to see.

RAWRity: I quite enjoy it. You see I have money so I can, oh how do those westerners say it? "
10,02IKR
10,02:D
RAWRity: "Screw the rules?"
Watch your caps rage there buddy :P
You should be ashamed of your actions. For it is not what a man comes from that is important, but rather what he does with his life.
"Screw the rules, I have money", I believe
10,02lol allcaps
i remember yoshi was in it, i think, and he was literally a lizard, i believe

BOY THAT X SURE LOOKS SUSPICIOUS

Simon: i blame you for my internet problems today,

hmm, it might. i know livestream does sorta
/me hugs Simon
OMG! He just hit fluttertree!!!!
I want to suffer with you guys but I got School ELA :'(
Simon, do you like bananas?
It's like the intro to Transformers 3. it's brilliant and it makes you want to watch the rest ...but don't.

Derpys so awsome he inspired stuff before his time.

RAWRity: Are you perhaps issuing some invitation of a sort of challenge/
all caps =/= yelling

Well, you aren't getting any
/me hugs Simon "we dont hate you, we just hate your choice of b movies"

00,10Dont we ban for WMC
Streamer is really bustin through it
render fail
did Simon pick epic movie?
it should of been what every kid dreamed about, instead, it was just...terrible
I dare say RAWRity, do you consider it ok to reduce OrangeEliminator to nothing more than a smoldering pile of a boot print for his excessive shouting?
Quin: yup
Did the movie end alreadu?
sadly, yes
already?
dude
yeah, its definitely a ROM
not cool
10,02Dat seizure
dat rom
3Wow sorry about that
and we are going to heckle him about it for the rest of time
Yep
Thanks for the movie simon!
emangamer: no, I am reprimanding you for acting below your station. As one of the higher calss, it is your duty to provide an example of moral fortitude to others, and you have behaved quite to the contrary of that. FOr shame, good sir. For shame.
Good thing too
/me hugs Wolfy
THE END

This here tobacco is nassty..
emangamer My swagaliciousness is composed entirely of goatee, trenchcoat, shotguns and other swag related swag
I say my dear fellow Pony admirers, should I continue to don my monocle or should I partake of the common form of verbal communication
emangamer: i completly misread your sentence, ignore me
kk osry

TOY_PON3: Do you wish that I dispose of you before going to this masquarde party and acting like a mere commoner such as yourself?
otakon: hello professor
that n64 emulator is PERFECT!
well....close to perfect
SuperBrony64: le streamception?
Phase4: yes, you are now reading it in his voice
10,02Yup
otakon: do not smash upon SlurryMoon he is simply trying as hard as he simply can...
emangamer: I shall not
emangamer: Enough with all the fancy talk mister yer givin me a head ache
he's doing well
damn you otakon, the entire chat is in his voice now, even this as a type it
SuperBrony64: tri-streamception?
yay
Oh my~
emangamer: I am currently dining on a steak made out of a cow that was fed on only the coolest corn ever. The corn had to past a cool test - a test that judged the corn on its geled up hair style, sunglasses and leather jacket. The cool and swag seeped into the cow, and it now seeps into me as I eat it
tl;dr
Who is sitting in a dark room with the computer as the only illumination
EEEUUUGH...my tongue has shared words with one that defiles our language like that....for shame TOY_PON3
OH GEEZ

OrangeEliminator: wow

3this is insane x3
le stream flash
10,02IKR
is this real life?
OrangeEliminator: were you raised in a barn? Your sense of the proper english language is appaling.
OrangeEliminator: how did you see that over the spaz
ok this is my first time here at bronystate
emangamer: are you saying my mouth is making promises my legs can't keep?
go to here #bronystate
Yes!
more bronies there
emangamer: your message implies i give a fuck
OrangeEliminator: disrespect much?
Hey all!
That spinning roof derped things up
TOY_PON3: i simply have no cognative idea to what you are reffering.
emangamer I would love to see you throw down with AJ
hi Randomnerd
emangamer: its 'Proper english'; 'language' is redundant :P
Oh man, shooting stars.
Beware, toad town cant handle the awesome of this game
mine too rinicbob
Suddenly stars
emangamer: yer darn tootin I aint
phase4: years of watching F1 racing has conditioned me to notice small things
>.>
Hey, Simon
t all?
At all?
Stars! they are falling! Catch them!
I find this game's lack of SMORG disturbing.
dashy9: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeMCXKSk5c
OrangeEliminator: try typing part of a name, say 'pha', and then press tab.
Phase4: I dare say that Phase4 has lost the ways of the PROPER english language, as it compares to the common filthy language that TOY_PON3 and OrangeEliminator speak.
I remember trying to see if it was possible to catch one of those stars
sim Hey. Hey. Look at all the fucks I giv- oh wait I cant find any
Please?
i love that song
save up for the good ones
emangamer: Perhaps you are right good fellow.
Oh my lads, look that the misuse of the tab button that OrangeEliminator had done.
Phase4: Quite *dons his top hat*
emangamer: welll sorry if ceslestia didnt give me a fully function brain
3lol this emulator thing is distracting me from Peach
Hey Regulars
le flash here we go again
dat peach
le stream glitched
wow playing paper mario 64
emangamer: Indeed *dons his own hat, not quite as tall as emangamer's*
emangamer: if you where any more elitest, yuo would be jewish Royalty that also likes partaking in the occasional genocide while you sip Starbucks coffe and read obnoxious blogs on your iMacPro, while wearing a 100 thousand dollar suit
Needs more yay
what game is this
TOY_PON3: I dont think that Celestia has a bit of anything to do with it. I think it pure inbread genetics that has done that ot you.
10,02Rinicbobbrawl9931: Yup
mmkay im gonna go write some of mah fic
Paper Mario
Paper mario
Paper Mario
LUIGI

Where's Luigi's chin?
OrangeEliminator: That would imply that I am, oh what do those westerners and their confounded language call it?, a hippyster I suppose?
so much "yay"
yay
EmperorJewel: you still here?
I like Luigi more than Mario
hi guys. ooh paper mario
Phase4: I dare say that you have earned that top hat that you have so cleverly adorned.
I thought luigi was going to try to stomp on the goomba there.
Out of reflex.
what time does MLP start?
Perhaps?
emangamer: cant tell if homeschooled and shelted by parents and knows nothing about society, or a trying too hard and getting nowhere troll
Alright, going to bed. Will definitely come back next week.
9central
putting it in my to be read folder
emangamer: what are you tryin to say mister?
dark toads
Those toads look...... legit
The emulator was working fine until you got into town...
my brother is watching fresh meat, I lol'd
Kinda hard to leave this awesome playthrough, but I wanna get up to ponies, so...
OrangeEliminator: I believe you are simply outside of the circle as to where my language patter comes from.
You have to go to the star road first
i think emangamer is trolling quite elegantly
it's that dang spinning roof messing things up
Anyway, later.
kk? what is 9central?
What the fuck is this?
emangamer: and that is?
You gotta talk to someone I think
fake and gay
00,10oh god why
i think merlon is out...
emangamer, the sophisticated troll
fyi, gay = happy
TOY_PON3: I am TRYING to say that your parents simply found the closest person of the opposite gender, their cousin or sister perhaps, and mated with them.
^
so much lag O.O
hahaha
9:00 am central time zone
reading a thesaurus for words no one cares about while you type =/= sophistication
go up, right, the upper path, and climb the mountain that leads to star road
Oh the irony
3Okay this is too much
dat verbosity
oh goodness the lag
damn chat is damn derping tonight...................
OrangeEliminator: it inside of the joke my "good" sir, using the loosest possible definitino of good.

Go to star mountain

Or if you check the countdown above the video, 8 hours, 4 minutes from now.

3I know that, but this emulator thing sucks so bad

TOY_PON3: Quite right old chap, I do appologise.

Could you play a video while getting this straightened out?
being a hipster is so mainstream SuperBrony64
ok, currently i'm leaching of my neighbours internet, so i'm going to stop the stream. shouldnt use to much bandwidth

OH GOD
All of them were
That face indeed.

I'm here now
oh joy
Bring me a pony so that I may brush its mane!

I died again
My soul has been utterly crushed; life is but a twisted mockery of existance to me now.
The horror.
I believe that I might be taking my wealth and affluence too far, but I am simply too lazy to find a single care with which to give.
ello tophat
when i got majoras mask, i was too scared to go into any dungeons, so i just stayed in clock town
yeah, I liked MM more than OOT

gotta make my mind up
thats why i doint like it
why?
I do believe that I may, as the westerns might say, hit the hay. Although I am rather certain that I would never result to physical confrontments with inanimate objects.
I'd say MM or Link's Awakening
confrontations*
chrono triggerk?
have fun eman
confrontments is fail
Go to bread.
*resort
emangamer: >claims to be sophisticated

I was playing chronno trigger today.... I suck so bad

*can't
lolno
3Well, as much as I love Paper Mario... I can't say that was easy on the eyes

never thought I'd see the day where emangamer could actually troll somebody.
guess not
DAWWW stupid stream crashing
I'm...I'm so proud :')
/me gives SuperBrony64 a risque and rather promiscuous smack on his rear.
emangamer: If i was being serious, i would be calling my buddies from Vietnam to get a hit out on you
i dont know whats going on.
sorry tophat was on bronystate
10,02Dat smack O___O
lets keep itthat way
You weren't there man.
OrangeEliminator: I do believe you may be getting too large for your britches. Do I have to put a filly in it's place?
its 2 for me too
You weren't there.
soooo tired
the fun never ends that way
well Im sure I can hear crickets in the background
RAWRity: You do not glempse me in my good moments...only in my poor ones sadly.
what the...
How do i suggest? Can I haz link?
emangamer: >bitch about e taking you seriously >take me seriously
then sleep?
Shasa.
emangamer: mostly because you seem to have a lot of poor moments.
or do you plan on staing up until 10?
Ha-g.
RAWRity: quite...quite
OrangeEliminator: Was that supposed to make sense?
Can i have link to vynal?
well... sinse we're on the topic of vidya, how bout that bioshock infinite
Shhhh.
Pony, is asleep.
and how bout that 1999 mode
Do try to use your words and do not resolve to using primative symbols
Talking to emangamer is interesting. although he types like an upperclass cool cat, her has the personality of a child. it is a truly strange mix
idk
Her?
i kinda want to stay up all night
Orrrraaaaaaaaaaange!
OrangeEliminator: You are being positively primeval.
it looks quite intense
What are you, an idoit?
USA ftw
to celebrate my joining of le herd
00,10Dont make me seprate you all
OrangeEliminator: and i dare say that you might have to look up that word in the dictionary.

USA CABLE ENTERTAINMENT.

Buytoast: Indeed good sir, indeed

Ohai Lyrachat
oh, I should log into that chat room too

WHER!?
i have no idea how we met lol
good idea
im entertained
:O
i think someone is streaming this stream
Sumica: Do you hear the words that spout from that wretch's mouth?
So much talk.
I wonder if Lyra can see us?
i know she has that
it is simply habberdashery.
is this jonlajoie?
?
Words of wisdom
so you're at your gf's house
and you're watching ponies
yep. it is.

I wish I were you
My word, this video is rather obscene.
00,10Not unless he is ban evadeing Darf14
Time for force myself to nap.
It is possible with a Proxy Server
treaming this stream?
Lyra is probably here
and then...silence in the chatroom. not a single soul was talking
Time to hit the Inception BWONG button.
There is a spah here
Sumica: i do believe that Lyra likes to be refferend to as a female. However I am not sure of "its" real gender.
*tumbleweed*
lol
/me has a feeling Lyra is a guy
lets cheer things up with pinkie, now where is she?
Just look at the muzzle snout thing.
I believe Tom is a spy sent by Lyra
she couldnt of gone far now.
she has the design of a femal
e
:O
TOY_PON3: I do have the percise feeling sometimes as well
That usually differentiates the males from the females, right?
pinky <3
and the eyelashes
TopHat: we are not speaking about the Chacter, we are referring to the IRC chatter.
err... pinkie*
/me shrugs 'was a guy with gender issues when I first meet him might have corected it by now'
oh
yay
sorry
Pinkie is best pony! then comes fluttershy.
Sumica: that would explain a rather lot actually.
I just got here ^^'
pinkie frightens me after I had read a little somthing called "Cupcakes" Anyone firmilliar?

OrangeEliminator: yes it was ironic but you were acting like an idiot
I'm 18 and I haven't had a job

Huh thats funny.... my name's Gabe too....
This is better
i dunno if emangamer has replied yet, but if he has, its probably sometihng like 'arg blarg im upperclass and you are ignorant but i will not notice my own ignorance because that is a common symptopn of being an egotistical jackass, we dont notice our own faults so i dunno how i am. Also i am UPPERCLASS GUIS"
i worked in a restaurant, wasn't crazy about it. Then again my boss was chinese and barely spoke english
hat
Sounds good fun.

then when you don't smoke they get mad like I owe them something
I am ready!
:)
Dont wanna work hard on the weekend huh?
:D
:3
lets do it then!( nohomo
yay for following the rules x3
then I zoom off and laugh!!!!
oh yeah new episode
10,02^__^
um...
yaaay~
god i love poniez
:P what movie is this?
I do too.
10,02IKR
This is why Brony State is good: pony marathons are good but dang, it's a lot of pony.
been chatting for about 2 hours. LIKE A BOSS
monk tv show
you people need to get your mind of the gutter a bit
10,02That's why I'm here ^_^
I wish it was 7 hours in the future
10,02IKR
and im glad to finally have joined the herd
lol
thank you
So then. What are we watching now?
That's damned specific
Good for you Quin
new episode discussion?
I am glad I joined the herd when I did
i have liked ponies for a while, but just recently i got into the hardcore stuff
Wow
my mind can be where it wants to
Playing xbox360 and chatting at same time. like a baws
I sometimes cant belieave that ponys are more manly then vampires now.
10,02Ohai Randomnerd :3
Funny enough ponies made me immune to fore
gore
yeah...... but cartoons or something else next?
o.O
vampires?
I hope poor AJ doesn't get overshadowed again
elaborate
10,02I like poniez :3
bronies are magical unicorns
Like the movie twilight
Reading Cupcakes make it so everything else is so pathetic
:O
I heard they sparkle in sunlight
ponies are the best thing ever made ever
twilight has no plot
And the sequal..
who all day spread love and tolerance all over haters
I'd rather be a pegasus pony
Or anything. Vampires have been romanticized and turned into a teenage thing.
im too scared to read that
Is mlp or twilight more manly?
I forget the name. Something like... um.. I forget.
unicorn
Sold the book a few dozen times...but never read it
unicorn master-race here
But it had Rarity. And removing a univorns horn is wrose.
ur sick Iweywrt
Compare: Twilight Sparkle vs. sparkling in Twilight.
10,02Ohai!
I read it for... well... I wanted to know about it.
Cupcakes didn't bug me, but I think I'm a sociopath
lol
Hi!
Probably.
*shudder*
So true
10,02Most everypony talks in #BronyState ^_^
the high class
is is strange that ive been watching these livestreams more than my own cable?
personally, applejack''s one liners always kill me. i don't see why so many don't enjoy her...
LIKE A BAWSS
No
But while I didn't get freaked out. I can now watch something really goring and feel fine.
10,02How is everypony doing?
just knowing what it is scares the shit outa me
i used to want to be a pegesus, but now i want to be a unicorn because of a fan fic i read. oh fuck i never thought i would ever say that
10,02You enjoying the stream?
I would rather be a unicorn who is so madvanced in the power of magic that I can change into other pony- like- creatures
your cable doesn't come with integrated chatroom
hello superbrony
i'm doing great
Im fine, how about yourself
true
Is the sound out of sink all across or just on my screen?
no on hates her. Her popularity is just mere
10,02I like being a pegasus ^_^
*sync
do u think ill be less scared if i read it?
00,10My cable only has one use any more
True.
it's off too.
or will i be scarred for life?
you are just a boss, bro
But I knew the plot before i read it.
10,02WOAH
I like AJ's voice
it's laggy and very quiet here
I tried to read Twilight because I believe in giving things a fair chance (like MLP), I couldn't get past chapter 4. It was boring and had the equivalent of female spaghetti (if you're aware of the awkward spaghetti joke)
Welll.... Sort of both.
That makes sense.
If you think you can handle gore then boy, do I have some manga to show you.
but in synch
Also, Monk? Odd choice. Not bad, just od!
If you know the plot isn't too bad.
*odd
superbrony, are you the one incharge of the stream?
Oh is it?
Sorry.
i like monk
God I can't type tonight
10,02PG13 Chat please
I will not now.
I was so suprised to find out that mlp was actually a good show.
3Oh Monk is odd
Aww.
I will stop now
applejack is my least favorite of the mane six, i dont hate her or anything
lol i knew that :P
10,02It's alright, I still wub woo all ^_^
YAY!
I wub woo Super Brony
3Monk is also the greatest! :3
It's a good show, I'm just used to coming in and seeing anime! :p
10,02:3
same here, Iweywrt
:)
But not you Quin
10,02:<
she will be the MANE charecter in the new episode
:'o
time for a change
10,02Love and tolerate ^_^
i know
get it.. MANE...
I only love quin
sad that the papermario stream glitched out ;_;
something different i guess
i know they don't hate her, but it seems too many dismiss her
not wub
10,02ORSOHELPMEILLTURNTHISCARAROUND
lol
10,02:3
3lol just call this time here Slurry's Crime Time
HAha... ha.
lol
because...ponies have MANES
10,02SlurryMoon is a silly filly like Monk :3
I lost the plotline...what is he doing there?
But again. What are we watching right now super brony?
lol
hense MANE charecter
Francis Ford Coppala? Not sure if that's a huge get this day and age :D
Watched first episode, obligated to finish the two parter. Watched the 3rd episode to see what was next... then had to watch the 4th. : ) You all know what happens after that.
YAY
awkward YAY
MONK!
wooden toaster has sum good stuff
woooow
yaaaaay~
i never was one for aj
Uh, uh . . .monk!(?)
It is clearly some TV series. But I don't know it.
lol
Cant wait for the new ep.
hahahahah
/me loves this show
monk, how dare you tell fluttershy to be quiet!
MANE
best part of the night
Oh MOnk. Thank you Great Sako!
yay "oh shut up"
lol, yay was appropriatly timed
3Sharona is so annoyed!
HEEY!
I knew in episode 2 that I would watch them all
after the manticore scene
guys do you think 1000 years was harsh?
I think SuperBrony64 might be my favorite mod
10,02O U
MANE charecter
no
GONA B AWF DA CHAYN LYK RAINBOWZ MAYN
for me it was such a surprise
So far I would agree with you.
didn't regret it
Then agian... there was one called Luna
me too ^_^
I watched the first episode half rolling my eyes
And Luna is awesome
YEA BOEEY
indeed it is
10,02I'm your favorite Mod? :O
yeah luna is awesome
alright, what's mips.tv and why's it keep showing adverts?
Then I figured I'd just finish the story and watch the next one
i find this weird but i wish i live in equestria as a unicorn. Anyone else wish what i wish?
yes
I watched the first 5 rolling my eyes
Then I figured, hey, what's one more
aww
Superbrony are you awesome?
once i had to spend 3 days alone in the woods
It started off girly but it did get way better.
Then another. Then another.
it was horrible
everyone ever wishes that, bro
And now here I am
Twilight Sparkle's lonely, friendless life and how out of place she seemed in the MLP universe really drew me in.
i cant imagine 1000 years on the moon
10,02I think I'm awesome...that all depends on what everypony thinks about me D:
:'( monk
install adblock plus, Corwyn
/me hugs TopHat
your not alone *brohoof*
but it was the summer and i had nothing else to do so i kept watching
OK then. Youare now my favourite mod
hyreia: Agreed!
:)
lol I ended up watching the entire first season in 1 night
SuperBrony what do u think?
everyone should have this plugin anyeay, Colt_Magnum
I would love to control the weather
So if I think that you have the ability to make toast out of thin air, can you?
poor monk...
Hehe, my second ever legit brohoof
1000 years too harsh?
everyone should have this plugin anyeay, Corwyn
so
You are Super.
I definitely remember thinking "why the *yay* am i watching this?!"
Iweywrt: I did something similar :D
10,02Thanks ^_^ It means a lot
i wish i was a pegasaus
My friend said the moment Spike smacked the floor in episode 1 he knew he liked it.
there will be many more where that came from, my freind
sry
3Poor Monk... :<
I'm suprised he allows all that paper to be strewn across his desk
O_O answer the question
Now! Um... Make me feel special by saying my name is Jewel
monk woman
you know what? screw unicorns I want to be pegasus
Its funny becuase when I watched the entire 1st season in 1 sitting I stated hallucinating ponies everywhere o_0
So Nun then?
ive been a brony ever since season 2 ep 2 and ive only ever had 2 brohoofs
Is there a Monk pony?
no he must answer the question first
nope..nope the fantasy is not real. he would have attacked her hair.
No@
!
I think so.
10,02Which question?
>:O
lol
cos I want to fly
ive watched around ep 9 I think
Iweyrt: lol. There's never such thing as too much pony, but a mind can only take so much at once.
...right now
The one about my name being Jewel
was 1000 years too harsh a punishment
lol
well, just keep on keeping on, and you will get many many brohoofs,
i wanna fly too. i wanna go fast
for luna?
moar please
I HATE ADS
I am multitask. Skyrim, Fringe, Monk (barely) and pony chat! :)
Bah
That's great, you hallucinated.
ikr
I became a brony as soon as I heard Art of the Dress
Now I want second half of episode.
10,02Yeah...but Luna is back so it's all better ^_^
curious, how old are most people?
BOOM!
Duck!
lol unfitting music
three or four days after I watched the show the second pony war on /b/ started...it was fun...17 bans in 4 hours
yay
14...
damnit, seen this one
18
i became a brony after the sonic rainboom
soo actual......
see wat i did there
18
The point is if it was for the best.
16 myself
10,02I think so
u sir are the embodiment of pony
13. winner
next is something else?
Relogging!
i wub woo
Man I love Journey
i turn 14 in 2 months
I hallucinated that rainbow dash was in my room and we had a conversation... I thought it was a dream....
dashie logged out, i get my name back
Maybe delaying her age for 1000 years is best.
10,02She wasn't being very nice and even when she got back she still wasn't nice
15*
Now say my name is jewel!
13
not 14
oh gawd i feel old now
im 17
Hellz yeah
not gonna lie, for the most part, I don't like "bronies" who are under the age of 16, but you guys seem ok
yaaay~
i like to think she had a spell so she could sleep for 1000 years
Congrats on getting your name back
love you guise
otherwise she would have gone mad
It's a slippery slope, them ponies. Your watching them, then posting as Fluttershy on AV Club.com, then making PMVs, then doing pony RP on twitter!
18 in july
lol, note I'm 18 too, so youre not alone
and thats why she was still bad
10,02I'm okay? :O
:)
NOT YOU ASSHOLE
why not just use the /nick command Dashie?
happy early birthday Dr_Cheesum
Exactly. Like she was frozen in time for 1000 years
I've only been a brony for about 3 months
Tankyou
more than ok
wasnt aware of its existance till jsut now
it's easy
Celestia encased her spirit inside the moon
any time.*extra special birthday brohoof*
You don't know IRC commands?
Hello
I still like Celstia.
she didn't just put her on the moon
/me is shocked!

OGOD WHY!!A CRYING FLUTTERSHY EMOTOCON!!!

i just had the worst B'AAAAWWWW moment
hmm
SaYS YOU!
http://tindeck.com/listen/yopq
But then again her voice bugs me. I do like how her name was used.
You could nap too.

But I do like how much power the brony universe has now
u r right
i could listen to dat yay all day
lol
just like nothing peter molynax says is really that innovative
Night
Exactly. The fact she is cannon is great
/me hugs SlurryMoon

I thought this was Orange

Even if the voice is off.
It fits perfectly
http://cdn.theakiba.com/images/2008/09/20080929032.jpg
hmm - canon doesn't urt anyone - it hurt only fanon
but srsly, rainbow factory is long, disturbing, and one of the most creative fanfictions vevr wriYAY
:)
hurt*
written ever
3Dat pony_1337
LOUDER!
00,10me nah, I was't realy around for it i just was lurking
why just not write new fanon?
hey take it easy on all caps
Well yes. But at the same time. We are shown to be a really powerful force
that fits under canon
and I love that
sorry. -zip mouth-
i don't agree
Didn't use a cross-cut shredder.
we not a force
but fanfics... they take away from the actual show
No?
sound derps again
i want for us to be powerful enough for a twilight x dashie romance
Didn't BURN the paper.
i like upheaval Breaking point
