why does Twilight sound manlier than Spike?
latin or klingon or something
oi applejack
oh good lord AJ's voice
http://derpy.me/0JjjU
00,03Almozar companeras =\= Soups on, everypony
I was thinking Klingon, but the vocabulary in that language is limited to a Klingon mindset.
http://i.imgur.com/1V2Zh.jpg
Ahpelbluwm!
00,03Because people wanted a pony episode...
The closest thing to a greeting in the Klingon language pretty much translates to "What do you want?"
Haha
EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
hmm
spanish!Twilight doesn't appear to have that scathing sarcasm in her
Maybe Elvish would be good, or Esperanto. A Latin translation would be lulzy when it comes to Luna.
Dat laugh :D
RD
Haha Excuse me?
BAAAHAHAHA
I guess Klingon IS the most famous conlang.
hmm
(\
Klingon would be the most hilarious
Esperanto could be interesting
Los Wonderbolts! :D
I'm already used to it
Yeah yeah that's easy in a second
Los Wonderbolts!
no one speaks esperanto
is esperanto really a language?
Exacto!
or a gibberish translation
:)
It's not gibberish if I can understand it

Goodafternoon
Well, at first, I didn't even give specifics when I suggested a conlang fandub. And the first thing that came up was Klingon.

Time for some Fluttershy

I once downloaded an open source bible program called SWORD Project. It contains a lot of freely available translations of the Bible, and one of them IS in Klingon.
Abosulty everything

Poor thing
It even has a Klingon Alphabet, probably based on code meant for East Asian langauge.

Japanese usually takes 3 years to learn, it is not considered hard to learn, only to write

Tjis doesn't even sound like the same piece at ALL. Its totally unrecogniable. Well, until just now.
The last Norwegian series I read was Isfolket, and that's written by a swedish lady- and it's not ALL that good. Crazy perverted with no agelimit as well

1, 2, this one, the next one, 5, 6, even
He like's dick's that's for sure...
7 not
Rowling is a sadist
13unless dumbledore can sense stable time loops, he had this planned very early on
Maybe he just hates gingers
13what with stalling the executioner
Gud luck
muffins?6_9
Maybe it's Maybelline
Muffins>Cupcakes
05,15wow
dumbledore changed acent for a micro-second :D
hi Bronyshit
well how is it
Bronysith* XD
Lol
lol Bronyshit
05,15So how come they never use the time turner again?
13MYST REFERENCE
Hermoany
13mein heart~<3
also
it's handled to mcgonnagal in the end, and they break all the other ones in the 5th movie
A lot can go wrong when you time travel
:D
00,10lol
FIRST
13fluttercry: part of it is that it creates stable time loops
good punch
thanks
13so the fact that [insert event we're supposed to fix] happened means that no time travel was used
How did she not cause any time paradoxes using this?
i like how you can hear the stop watch still ticking
00,10still say she should be 3 years older
05,15oh yeah...
too time philosophy here
Becuase it would make the rest of the movie's pointless.
How Harry Potter 7 should have ended
That's probably why they don't have time travel after this
buckbeak
00,10no i meen she is liveing every day like 3 times
13a stable time loop is one theory of time travel where all travel takes place in, and modifies, the same universe timeline
Snape already did it
great pumpkin :D
i hope the executioner paid for that damage
heloooooooooooo
00,02morning
13we find that harry and hermione traveled back in time to cause those events
13because things progressed relatively safely, there's only one timeline
How did she not fuck up reality at this point?
dat snail
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYWT5Q_R_w see?
oh
It got felt across time
that hurt
Snape went back in time at the end of #7 and killd Voldemort
THE POWER OF TIME TRAVEL
13but because they do things in such a way that past!Harry and past!Hermione safely get to the hospital wing and can travel, the loop is stable
lol
Threshexcutioner
Just assume things happen as they happen
stable loops are no fun, no universal implosion, no time rifts, pfft
ths JOJ
CAW!
Hermoine knows what's going on
caws everywhere
!
crows
in b4 hackers
13when really they're just making more timelines
Solid Snake with arthritis and a bad back... :)
ni snake in mgs1
13for hermione, she's been leaving stable time loops all over the place this year
Why did they give hermione this time device?
Lol
yummy
Except for the first time you did them
ferrety
Dubbletroll
05,15Shizuka you think these things out don't you?
13ron notices her every single time, with his "did you see her come in" lines over the course of the film
Terezidore?
^_^
a large brandy
wow an advert of a dating sight poped up
Dumbletroll
glad to help
nice tits
13Major: at a given time yes, but the duplicates then end up traveling backwards until finally just one of her leaves the loop and continues forward in time
screw time
Dumbledore like to get his Drunk on
smashing pumpkins

Just as I said that, he goes offline on Skype.
05,15haha

how've things been Saturn
hi Saturn :)
Saturn: Yaaaay~
Saturn: HORRAY!
05,15yaaaay Saturn
1,11Either that or sorcerors are actually wizards that have a talent for doing magic without a wand.
13because time travel
08,01because i'm stuck at work while i bring some nodes up
13the best fiction is the fiction that's internally consistent
ya we got saturn tonite the circle is complete
08,01Shizuka: like Past Sins!
/me 08,01runs
ello everypony :)
try and look for the couple boning at the corner
00,02XD
08,01it's 11:40pm for me right now, and i'm still at work
13or say mass effect, everything is derived from "here is a thing that, given a charge, changes mass within a field"
Saturn WHYYYYY
yes just in time for the rifftrax credits :P
08,01Chrysalis: because servers
One thing that all ways bugged me in the Potter movies, mind control
00,02Shizuka, to be fair that would break physics prety througherly
Saturn ouch, i thought still unpacking at this time was bad
13well yes
screw physics
It's 23:43 here
time travel alone breaks reality
But they also teach school children to make potions that do similar things
uh time paradoxes
Evening ponies

patience people
13well they're down there for hours and hours
but then, surely it would suck all the heat from the people
00,02Shizuka, or the part where there's no energy in static preasure
08,01because i'm too lazy to check
13that too
But... IT'S A MOVIE!!! :(
