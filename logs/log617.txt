She will either be dead or alive at the end of the story, I'm sure.
you do realize whose playing right
DickShep!Sum
if someone can die, they will
probably
anything can be made in minecraft...with time
yeah, like a few weeks
The thing i love about ME3 is that rep isnt dependent on staying in the dick or the wet blanket side of the force.
/me is always wet blanket
running time
So a paragon shep can now and then dip into the the renagade opptions now and then.

I remember at the beginning of this game I was so mad when all the stuff in my cabin was gone. Then I found my space hamster and most of my models in the cargo hold, and all was better. XD
was she on the couch?
I was still mad that the Alliance killed all my fish. :(

i'll see you burn for that
I think we should all take this opportunity....
flutterchu you not making sense. >.>
To praise Lord Smooze.
i need to come oute more :D
Praise Lord Smooze!
is Tali Adam jensen now?
oh i thought they would see the chat on the right i though you would record the website not the gameplay *giggles*
lol
lol:D
Tali never asked to be an admiral and then she took a thermal clip to the knee.
dude thats been overused
Well, I took a mace to the face.. :P it hurt..
my brother says my nickname suck he says it's the worst crossover ever
robot chicken lolz
I took a sentry rocket to the chest
MASF123|Disconnected: Did you die?
you remind me of CWC's creation
lol
Sumica: Do you play multiplayer at all by any chance?
shepard could pretty much buy every female quarian Tali's suit and be happy with any of them
Pinkie_Brony yeah but I spawned later so it was ok.
Yay~
Sumica: Well theres like 1-2-3 new multiplayer DLC's you can get
kill em all :X
Yay~ Old team is best team
MASF123|Disconnected: No spawn campers right?
Adds a good deal of new maps and guns and everything
the next conversation is funny in mission
Spikethrower's nice
Pinkie_Brony only Engineers
wait this is on xbox oh i only have three games with no live my mother is to poor to pay it
MASF123|Disconnected: No Madics?
Give her damage and accuracy or something cause ammo is of no concern
she is a quarian with a shotgun and loves to tell you about it all the time
*Medics
Pinkie_Brony I was dead screw Medics at that point
Defibrulatorere MASF123|Disconnected
Pinkie_Brony not in TF2
I see, ha, that is another game I have not yet played.
I love how almost all game are just letters and numbers now, like cars
Thats the worst storm there is..
Sumica: I like how you use the exact same team setup as me, Tali+Garrus is just a combo that's pretty good
im just glad i dont have call of duty i think everyone would think im weierd since my words are diffrent when i say them and i dont fell in correct fit to reavel my age
hunt for red october joke
I made Garrus and Tali romance each other
Sumica: Been using em since ME1 :D
yay it... yay it harder :D
Here comes a good reaction
1 to 5 kids are born and 1 to 2 people die every second
lol Turian chocolate
the cat fight between ash and tali is classic
Their suits somewhat remind me of Dead Space..
The zero gravity is even reminding me of it
ME came out before Dead Space
^
And dead space has so many jump scares
this website would help http://www.breathingearth.net/
series of tubes
I know that :P Kind of obvious, js it remoinds me of it

this really remind me of miles edgeworth
Joker is best pony. :3

DeadpoolDash: Good thing a soldier can carry all type of weapons and have a surplus of ammo every mission
maintenance
perhaps it is a relic of quarian programing
00,02Sumica, its explained im me2, they all talk wirelessly
00,02infact its explained in 1 iirc
00,02ded
guns suck
00,02imagine how much faster their ships could be if they didnt have to carry all this crap around
I think weight has no matter in how fast the ships go
Fights like these were why I gave my Shep Overload.
mister streamer is this game long like kingdom hearts i heard some people on my street talking saying kingdom hearts is to long then they looked at me and the a started running from them chasing me just because i was listening
Look at the reapers, They got the most powerful mass effect engines
And they are over a kilometer long
flutterchu Kingdom Hearts is not long. It's average
Gold_Demona: well that's what you get for listening
huh?
do you have them set to auto use powers?
weird
they usually spam powers on that setting
stange
strange
weird
we could upload a virus
00,02wait
00,02what?
00,02fires in space
00,02in space, no one can hear you oxidize
nonono its space fires
its different
they ded
i just learned what color is a mirror thank vsauce /)
shaft
lol
ash and tali have a damn cat fight if you romanced ash in number 1 and tali in number 2
No one brohoofed me either, flutterchu, and you don't see me complaining. :P
oh no mister streamer these are just links to diffrent vectors explaning my emotions
O_O
pro duck
The force is strong in this one :3

Oh come on Sumica don't ban people like that.. :D
Wrek would've banned harder
sumica is secretly celestia with a bag of bananas
Deadpool|Dash lol!!
<.< >.> nick fail.

Ruuuuuuuuun!

Whey-up!
/me runs panicking.
I'm surprised Tali didnt get her ass caught in it
Good morning everybody! how are we?
Sleepy
there used to be a gliche on this level where if you are scoped you are immune to the blue space magic
Blue space magic?
the blue crap coming at him
what does it do?
I think its an EMP
shitled wipe?
shield even
take away shields/barrier
biotic powers = space magic
that crap doesnt look like biotics tbh
00,02wait
00,02are the geth using biotics
^
tech is almost the same as biotics
00,02whats that thing that flys by every now andagain
Electro Magnetic Pulse!
tech burst-biotic explosion
looks like they are entering the warp :D
WTF
WAIT
An electromagnetic CANNON?
00,02oh
Oh wow, Sumica's on FIYAH today! Mass Effect 3 all day!
the shielding must be really heavy :D
as such "one big gun"
00,02gauss cannon
gauss or rail
00,02little slow
Hmm, So its a gauss/railgun, not an EMP cannon
00,02DeadpoolDash, theres a difference betwene the two :P
thats more sensible
not much Phase4
00,02gauss cannons use electromagnets, railguns actually use two rails
00,02essentialy the same thing, magnetic acceleration, different methods
Railguns pass an electrical charge down two rails, Gauss guns use a series of magnets
yep
You can make a gauss gun with a few bits of wood and a ball magnet
railguns are more complex however :D
she wants shepard penis

Don't you listen to mean ol' Rarity, Bloomberg. >:C
Hi all :3
Hi Major
00,10heya
What? You're Bloomberg is evolving!
As much as she might exaggerate it, trees need care during uprooting
Its National Waffle Day today! =D
Hey Major!
I imagine so.
DAT TRUMPET :D
Congradulations! You're Bloomberg evolved into a 20% cooler Bloomberg!
WE'RE TREES!!!
YAY!
And a meme was born
lol
Fluttertree
AGH
Scarity!
it was funny when she was in the tree disguise
UNFABULOUS
SO unrainbow
DeadpoolDash: yep :D
Spike took treehugging a little to far
those stallions are pretty damn boss
eeyup
QueenMaker: treehugging? He's sleeping with it already! :D
BONK
00,10not much for music in this one.
Sumica: still, nice music background!
00,10aye
00,10braeburn theme
And Sumipony dances :D
Compadres?

DeadpoolDash: the puns, they're awesome :D
00,10that's the point
luna_pony this is BGM only version
oh thats good
BOOO IT'S JUST APPLES
Twitcha twitcha twitch!
classic sneaking
00,10You know I think pinkie knows exactly waht she is doing.
00,10it's just she dont care.
Pinkie is the honey badger of the group
Except not mean
Sumica: I would like "Spectrum Scramble wreaks havoc on a stereotypical western town", please :D
00,10wah huh?
sounds like a request
Sumica: Youtube Poop :P
00,10never heard of it
long long long long long long long
Sumica: eh, part of the Grand Galloping Collab.
00,10oh that
It's amazing how even RD is less hotblooded than Pinkie :D
Wow, this song SUCKS without Pinkie's voice o_o
whoohoo
Pinkie Pie: Starter of Wars

I just need to change a very small amount of things.
Gold_Demona: terrible message conveyor :D
o.o
lol yup
apple ammunition
XAX: that's an amazing skin! :O
Spike eats when he's upset. =P
MadSurge: Thanks :3 But it's still not done. But you can't exactly see what's broken still in that screenshot.
But the things that ARE broken make it not very nice to use, so I still need to fix it.
Gold_Demona: it's like munching candy
winnie the poo rainbow dash
pooh
RD, thinking is not your job!
PINKIE YOU ASS :D
Epic pie fight
Delicious ammo!
Badass Golden Harvest!
NO AMMO
RELOAD! Shoot outside of the screen!
does AppleJack birth Apple Trees?
thats wat she said
00,10only if you have enough apple sause DeadpoolDash
/me has all the sauce
Aw yeah, Offspring!
lol
00,10damit MadSurge
00,10why you kill chat
Got my face in my other computer. Fiddling with my desktop pony. =P
Hmm, Discord is a Draconequis, or whatever. A hybrid pony/dragon. If Rarity were to ever accept Spike's affections, another Draconequis would be born from this.
00,10I kinda like the fandoms version of their kid
Gold_Demona: :D
.......chat. Dead. Now.
R.I.P. chat
Oh, I just thought of that just now. I should've figured I'm not the first to think about that.
Kandarihu: whatever, it's a fantasy world. Genetics are all over the place anyway :D
32 seconds!
lol
PINKIE :D
good morning everypony
I killed the chat for 32 seconds!
00,10morning
Yay!
True, MadSurge. I mean just look at the baby cakes. =P
Hey spitfirecolt!
Gold_Demona: I like the way they explained it tbh
lol pie flavor
00,10so much deinterlacing in this
MadSurge: Me too. I'm just saying it's really random and genetics are super flexible. =P
00,10this is what it would look like if I just streamed directly from my capture gear with out using compresion
Pinkie would say "screw gravity" :D
oh great I got frozen up
00,10you were frozen today?
wait
I love this video
And I'd be the only one to say a word about it, I'll bet.
POLKAAAAAAA
whats are movies tonight
spitfirecolt: It's a surprise
00,10word about what Kandarihu?
About the absurd deinterlacing
cursed internet conectio why cant you let me enjoy my pony's?!
PINKAZOID :D
00,10good thing I am OCD about what i show then Kandarihu?
00,10I would not stream crap like that
Sumica, thank you.
^

Yaaaaay!
Going to bed and realizing mum removed the third pillow I had from the spare room when she decided to clean my room on her day off.

Well, the makers of FiW posted a new video. It would be nice if we could see it here, although that might be a bit tricky.
Let's see fluttershy is a tree scootalo is a chicken spike is rainbow dash am I missing anypony?
Kandarihu: something that isn't a new episode?
they did episode 7 not the new one anymore
00,10I learned at a young age to cause an absolut shitstorm if any one went in to my room to orgnise any thing
MadSurge, not a new episode.
Sumica: you like your stuff as you leave it, I assume
00,10whats this about new FiW?
00,10yep
its a lie, A LIE I TELL YOU!
00,10it's my mess, if some one disturbs it then i dont know where any thing is
Lol Sumica. It's what I feel like doing every time my room is re-arranged, but I don't because I'm beta as fuck.
And yeah, I know what you mean by "my mess".
00,10oh I am realy relaxed about most things
00,10but a few things realy set me off.
Sumica: I hope you're a little more organized in your job :D
Sumica, no new FiW. Just a short video posted on their channel.
00,10my job is not my house.
Are moon pies good?
00,10if it's my stuff I treat it as such. i wont treat other peoples stuff the same
hey have you seen the begining of ponies the anthology intro ''My little jackass''?
00,10ah
Don't you pretty much run the place though, sumi?
00,10anthology is what got me hooked on ponies
MadSurge: I've heard they taste like cheesecake
00,10I run it but i dont own it
Ah.
Derpy Cardcaptor FTW

I forgot.
PinkieSpice: background music only episodes
00,10potter was last weeks event
^
movie night?....*several seconds later*...Oh, its friday
XAX It's a mystery
._.
Sumica, are we even HAVING BMN this weekend?
;o
00,10yes
Sumica: darn it, wanted something familar after the horse apples i had to deal with yesterday
Oh someone kill me and put me out of my slow internet misery
So what are we watching tonight, then?
^
/me glomps Kiryu instead of killing him.
Kandarihu: Surprise as sumi told ya
:D
/me feeds kiryu a supisous cupcake
00,10as I said, it's a mystery
Cypresswolf: sounds like a hard day
wat we watchin? ;o
Hmmmm glomp or cupcake
I'm never doing anything involving downtown Houston again
Why is the audio on this louder for music and almost silent for dialogue?
eosforos: episodes with bgm enhanced
Sumica: i hope its something the hopsital internet moderatiots won't mine XD
killerpony7733, so Sumica said it's going to be a surprise?
MadSurge: Oh you answered my q
tSparx|Reading: that's the point, more bgm
MadSurge: hm ye.. but why xd?
eosforos: Why not?
wait show it again my player laged! D:
eosforos: because bgm is awesome!
tSparx|Reading: dk ;o nvm
Kandarihu: Pretty much. No one knows what's going to be on movie night, Mods will be surprising us
eosforos: There is some incredible music in the show that we don't notice because it works well as BGM
00,10we have seen all the eps so many times normaly
00,10the BGM needs more love
Dat sweat
Question - is it a common occurance for city drivers to honk at the person in front of you at a red light, because you didnt have enough space to get all the way in the lane?
00,10because they do a great job on it and it goes mostly unnoticed
god now I see why people hate modems
^^das^^
tSparx|Reading: ah.. right... how didnt i think about it.. :D
00,10I have them honk for not turning left on a red arrow Cypresswolf
00,10morening Scoot-Scootaloo
Am I.. deaf?
Sumica: I got that quite a bit, even out in the sticks
00,03And mornin'!
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo! nope, only bgm episodes
I swear, I'm not being sarcastic when I say this. But that clears up a lot of uncertainty over this issue. Just getting official word that it's supposed to be a surprise makes it better.
Cypresswolf: only if the driver in front has room to move forward to let the driver behind get into the lane.
/me licks Sumica and Scoot-Scootaloo
lolgod
00,10deaf dumb and blind
Mornin' Scoot-Scootaloo

Bronysith: Morning

/me hugs Sumica back
My, the chat got lively again!
Dat apt yay
Gold_Demona: I didnt have more than a foot or two, but that didnt stop the .... behind me from honking - then looking like a bigger idiot when he couldnt move up anyway :)
ugh
have to use the bathroom
this is exactlyh what i get for having taco bell for breakfast
baAaAaAm
Cypresswolf: Yeah, you get folks like that a lot, especially in higher populated areas. :P
00,10poor AJ
00,10also why is pinkie leaving?
00,10dont she live there?
sumica try and put ''PILLS HERE'' when twilight gets the pill alright? :D
Pinkie is going to stop Mr. Cake from throwing out all the sugary confections
Sumica, I think she has her own house, and she only works there.
00,10could be.
00,10but i always figured she lived with the cakes seeing as she had her own room there in party of one
Pheonix are quite sensative to temperatures
I'll have to look at that again. And unfortunately, PSO2 uses Gameguard, and Gameguard hates MPCHC
00,10ewww they are still using gameguard
:3 FS: Take this pill - Philomena: I'm not swallowing that - FS: well then Good News, its a suppository
Sumica, yeah.
00,10figured they would have learned seeing as how easly it failed last time

Oh, I heard about that happening on the GCN version of PSO Ep1&2
PSO2 is going to be gewd
Spongebird
Sumica: Gameguard has been proven to be almost a virus. To name a few of the features of gameguard, it can record keystrokes, stop processes,
00,10yep
and other stuff I can't remember.
STOP Youve - oh, its only Twilight
Haha Bronysith, enjoying your Dark Souls?
00,10it alays pitched a bitch when I used voice overlay
Bronysith, I'm playing the Japanese version right now. It is pretty cool.
Kandarihu: tell me all about it later please
MadSurge: yes, now to get raped in the butt by zombies
Alright

00,10tisk tisk Bronysith
Bronysith: ikr

WHERES MY FILE?!
WTF
00,10twi you so nurotic
/me hugs everypony :3
PILLS HERE!
/me hugs Tarku :P
If Twilight thinks Celestia would throw a pony in the dungeon for something as slight as taking her pet pheonix, She's seen things
darn too early
Cypresswolf: She's seen some sh!t.
mrstreamer i mean Sumica that was an accadent a while ago might as well call it accadental spam
I swear, the more I watch, the more connect the dots

Welp.

Frankly, among the three major villains, Queen Chrysalis has the best potential to write an aesop around.
>U(\
my brother left his laptop on and I saw this
Kiryu: As in you are new and am watching the stream?
Don't you know it's rude to go rummaging through other people's stuff?
^
00,10Unless you are dragonborn
00,10then it's ok so long as you dont take it
well I was going to turn it off but saw this on
fus ro dah
spikey-wikey is a dragonborn
You can take it if you put a courtesy pot over the owner's head.
Kiryu: So you are using his user on here or? i'm quite confused
YAY
Sumica: Needs Spiderman.mp4
MadSurge, you're familiar with the Kleptomaniac Hero trope, right?
i think of ponies 24/7
well to my knowledge he fell asleep before he could close the browser ._.'
(\'U,/) derp
Kandarihu: virtual heroes are entitled to everything that isn't nailed to the ground :D
Kiryu: Sooo was this on and you are using the user he logged in as?
Pinkie :3
i hope i get a luna episode in season 3
Yay
Needs spiderman though
luna is best princess
Woopwoopwoopwoopwoop

Kiryu: Ah, Well just saying if you are new to the site. I would advice reading the rules. Also girl/guys=bronies. pegasister is a bit degrading IMO

Hey Spell-of-Gaming
hey Fisheh_Fish and Spell-of-Gaming!
Goodmorning Fisheh_Fish and Spell-of-Gaming
so what's next in the stream?
Hello Fisheh_Fish and Spell-of-Gaming
MadSurge, sorry. That joke bugs me a bit. And you're right. That retaliation wasn't right.
BBQ ribs are in ze oven!~ >=D
Kiryu: Depends, Mods may or may not be around. And they could have something to stream
Kiryu: So you gotta wait till a mod decides to pick up the stream
And in 8 hours, it will turn into dinner. :3
Kandarihu: it's okay, as long as it's on chat :D
Kiryu: But else you are sure to know theres a stream in 9 hours and 54 minutes since that's movie night which is a set stream
Gold_Demona: mmm meat!
MadSurge: Hellz yeah. XD
IS there somewhere to find out the movies/episodes for the week?
Nope
did someone stop the stream
It's a secret to everybody
Marky: Surprise movie night so yep
I would love to listen to pinkie's gypsy bard :3
Ah.
flutterchu: Stream is offline till another mod has time or wants to stream and is around
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06U3Z60_s6g
hooray we can send links
The Everfree NW convention sounded horrible
mods are asleep! :D
AdamTheDuck: im not watchin it
Kiryu: Not exactly.We may have a mod or two lurking
flutterchu: No one is making you watch it :P
Spell-of-Gaming: those are only horribly inflated rumors, it was great I heard
lol Barber Shop Quarter Seaponies. Awesome AdamTheDuck XD
AdamTheDuck: Lmao
Spell-of-Gaming: for my part, I can assure you BUCK was awesome :D
oh man I remember this one time my friend got kicked from 4chan by posting a mods are asleep image :D
MadSurge: I sure hope so. Applebloom's VA kept saying that the rumors aren't true

AJIsAwesome: Tired, excited to move back into my dorm today :) you?

Metronome: Mystery

Kiryu: Mystery
AJIsAwesome: *yawn* to tired to say hi

Spell-of-Gaming: that said, the CMC panel was adorable and hilarious <3
Someone ask for ponies. :3
^^^^
I ask for ponies! That is... if you don't mind. I mean. If that's alright with you.
I dont know about you but im good with luna walking on sunshine :D

no god please no no... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
BRB.
say hi to ALL bronies
I'm going back to my book now. It would be nice if someone could ping me when the stream starts back up again, so that I can decide whether to put down my book or not.
oh i cant send links if my brother see's it on the recomended video's heil kick me and ppinch and-.........and hurt so hard the scratches are permanent and he lies
Umm... Whoa, ok...
i meant he lies that he doesnt make em
A'ight
flutterchu: Go on google chrome incognito, I don't think it will be in the recomedded videos
my brother's recomendations on youtube are nothing but pony's and a few smosh vids normal... right? o-o
*Recomended
00,03inb4eye color war
MLP_Brovakiin: oh well he find me on this anyway once he wakes up (all that tourture.......*hids behind her mane*)
D:
/me gives flutterchu a couch to faint on.

*yay*
MODS ARE AWAKE! :O
Gold_Demona: too late *brother wakes up COLTON WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ON MY COMPUTER (punches kicks pinches blood)
00,03moment...
I like it...it's True Crime without them trying to be cool. It's serious.
Scoot-Scootaloo: No dark side for Vynil, only calm and SWAG sides!
True Crime was too wannbe gangster.
when did he get a dark side
:D
But your a cop. Like wth
lol Scoot-Scootaloo, is that your ping? XD
was that nowacking?
I heard a Scratch.
Well that startled me haha
Gold_Demona: yes it is :D
00,03brb...
LOL That's awesome
Vinyl is not a he.
^
friend here does not understand why i went to bronycon and spent money on swag he just does not understand
Oh well. Back to making an imageboard.
I love her voice in pokemon bridged xD
Is there still a debate over Vinyl Scratch's eye color?
spitfirecolt2: You can never have too much swag.
swag is much needed how does your friend not understand?
Magenta, canon has renderd this the unarguable truth.
thats right all i buy is pony swag
Kandarihu: Oh, you know the Internet. Argues over everything.
No matter how stupid.
Kammerjunk, yeah. Point taken.
still waiting on my nmm collection still on backorder
I need pony shoes.
No, I don't mean hoof-themed.
Funny
haha
My webhost doesn't seem to have permissions
Im starting to remember the comercial that apeared in the credits of my little pony ''secret but fun'' :D
Secret butt fun!
00,03To entertain you ponies, I'll just let my OMFG playlist run until I finish a super secret project
I might be getting a titanium spork and an RD t-shirt this coming B-day :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: Ooooh mystery :D
Ooh~ Super secret project. =D
00,03I should probably turn that of...
00,03off*
:D
super secret project is secret
That is totally Scoots' ping sound.
Super secret
Hmmmmmm
I like secret.
Kammerjunk: yes it is :D
00,03For the record, Nowacking made that ping for me. She's a pretty cool girl!
I knew it was nowacking! :D
Hah, my file manager shortens "Permissions" to "Perms"
i really wish we could get a vinyl and tavi episode
one can program different sounds for their ping?
DoctoDoctorWho: A lot of us don't use the embedded client
00,03Probably should have made it louder...
DoctoDoctorWho: And usually changing it on a non-embedded client is usually easy
Well, I didn't give mIRC a custom ping sound. I just changed my Windows sound used for the default ping.
So now I hear "yay".
sweet, once I find out how Im totally changing mine to the sonic the hedgehog ring sound effect:D
Kammerjunk: Oh well yeah that works too haha, but I'm not sure I wanna hear Pinkie Scream every time I cause windows to beep
tSparx|Reading: It wasn't really intentional, it just kinda happened.
as discord would say, priceless!
so can we see some vids? :$
Kammerjunk: that must be confusing during Sumica's streams
It does.
00,03Not yet
So I might change it to Luna's "ha ha!"
00,03Until I'm done with my "super secret thing"
the fun has been doubled?
00,02getting lotsa buffer here
I know that feel bro
Running smooth for me Phase4
00,02strange
Scoot's just streaming songs anyway
00,03You an your other side of the world-ish internet :p
What do the permission numbers "777" mean? :P
Phase4: Fine for me too
Lucky 7
Spell-of-Gaming: In UNIX/Linux?
how bout some gypsy bard?
00,03I just do what I can :)
00,02seems to fix itself when i refresh
I'd love that
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, everyone can read/write and execute
:O
I can't
Yay Twilight theme
Ah, thank you, Phase4. I was thinking it was that.
I'm making an image board. :P
:) Twilight aproves of this
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, its octal, bit order is rwx, numbers are for owner/group/other
HAHAHA, HEARD THIS LIVE :$
But anyway <3 <3 <3
How about "644"?
tSparx|Reading: there's a song called that?
I wonder if there's transformations in fighting is magic twilight could go rapidash :P
DoctoDoctorWho: Yep. It's by Muse, and while it is used in Twilight, that doesn't matter. I really, really like it, even though it's not exactly the prog music I often listen to.
tSparx|Reading: Oh God really? Twilight OST?
hmmm, gotta look that up sometime
or just get their albums
Is tea good for the soul?
DOUBLE RAINBOOOOOOWSSSSSSS
double rainbow dash ALL THE WAY!
:D :D
AdamTheDuck: As it turns out, Stephanie Meyer is (weirdly) a huge Muse fan, so she asked if she could use their song in her movie.
I really, really like Muse, worth checking out
hey i herd about a remix of the mlp theme glitch something ummm whats it called?
MLP Theme Glitch by Alex S.
Then it's not really an Original Soundtrack.
oh thanks and whats the name of this mix by the way?
I can totally see twilight running a university for unicorn mages in the future,
Spell-of-Gaming: Preciesly
DoctoDoctorWho: Dumblesparx
What will Twi do in the future?
Kiryu: Search for Ballad of the Brony and check out the credit song, it will have it there.
dman chat derped
tSparx|Reading: suck it hogwarts!
Is that miachel jackson! 6_9
well not this one the last one
Twilight will go on to be the Merlin of Equestria (she's only a young lady and she already kicks so much magical flank it's ridiculous).
Not that I'm biased or anything :P
Kiryu: Think that was "The Offspring"
Dumbledoor translated into different languages can literally mean "The door is dumb".
trust me you dont want to know what harry potter means
tSparx|Reading: I want to think that she will reactivate magical talent in equestria, making a "order of high mages" style thing
Harry Potthead?
Hairy pots?
A potter is someone who makes pots, so I don't really see how that would translate bad. =P
She will be the next Starswirl the Bearded
DoctoDoctorWho: I could also see her essentially studying the limits of magic, seeing what she could do.
Twilight... you are a wizard.
One does not simply watch one episode of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.
yeah trust me I tried big mistake
Twi's a wot?
Aye.
Twi's a book
sweetie belle is a dictionary
MASF123|Disconnected: I saw the first half of the pilot a year before I started watching MLP. The friend who showed it to me later admitted she should've shown me the whole pilot xD
tSparx|Reading: little off topic, If starswirl was a powerful mage in his time, and the time spells are located in his section of the library, does that insinuate that he was a time mage?
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm pretty sure he just experimented with time. Time can be a dangerous thing to tamper with.
There's a T-Shirt with Twilight loking pissed saying, "This book called Twilight, we must kill it."
I want that shirt.
DoctoDoctorWho: I assumed it meant that he was a studier and pioneer of temporal magic, whether that was all he did or not, or even if it's his specialty, I would've venture to guess.
i guess you could say that
MASF123|Disconnected: :D
back to equestria dun dududud dun duuun
he was celestias advisor on magic
MASF123|Disconnected: I want that shirt too, haha
Seeing some Pinkie Pie Symbol Art in PSO2
Are they still making Phantasy Star games?
AJIsAwesome, yes.
AJIsAwesome: I have the perfect quote on why not to buck with time, brb while I find it
so scoot's how is the project coming along?
ps this song sounds like something from kung fu panda
/me turns back to her book
his*
i need a kindle fire for my fics
possible text wall inbound
geting kinda bored from this music
You return home from your jolly time travel adventure in ancient Greece, having saved the world and being careful not to upset history and.. hold on a moment? Are those swastikas?! Hanging from the White House?! Looks like you've been hit by Godwin's Law of Time Travel. Talked to the wrong person? Nazi victory! Left technology back before the dinosaurs were wiped out? Nazi victory! Stepped on a bug? Nazi victory! Left a tap
yay time travel
DoctoDoctorWho: :D
you bastards you did it! you actually did it!
Kiryu: Did what?
wow time traveler is unpredictable and dangerous
planet of the apes reference :$
orignals were better
Counseling a young Adolf Hitler to resist anti-semitism? Nazi Victory (although it would be a good thing in such a timeline)
where was buck at looking up plane ticket prices
T-Sparx proved that time travel can be unfun. Though it seems that in the MLP universe your free will is limited a bit if you go back in time; it seems amazing that Twilight would say the EXACT same thing she heard future-her say to her when she was future-her talking to past-her
Oh, wait. It still wouldn't be.
DoctoDoctorWho: This reminds me of that adventure game i've been recently playing. (Killed the inventor of coathangers? Nazi victory!)
o.o
stoping yourself from going back in time... NAZI VICTORY!
wow its a nazi victory no matter what
any fellow tropers among the brony community?
whats a troper
Think he means trooper.
I read TV Tropes from time to time. I don't do much editing, though.
spitfirecolt2: Trooper.
cause I got this from Godwins law of time travel
kill the jews before nazis were invented... RACIST NAZI VICTORY!
nope
spitfirecolt2, AdamTheDuck, Troper refers to users of the wiki TV Tropes
Right.
thank you Kandarihu,
Tvtropes? For the Love of Celestia; DON'T link it!
dat whistle <3
SirGanjalf, I know. It's 99% text.
SirGanjalf: not even the dreaded evil overlord list?
TVTropes? Nononononono.
I don't want to be addicted to TVTropes again
umm whats so bad about TVTropes?
Its about as addicting as bronystate, If not worse
Kiryu: It's easy to waste several hours there
Even more so than it is here
is such a thing posible? 6_9
It's like reading Wikipedia aimlessly, except the articles about your favorite culture tropes
Kiryu: It's not just possible, it's real.
Oh Tropes, I remember being on this site a while ago
By Celestia's name my boy, It's possible
*puts on sunglasses then takes them off* mother of god.
Does anypony know where to get the client for ponychat
*takes off sunglasses to reveal another pair of sunglasses* we are doomed,
SpectraClouds: You can go to any of the theatres on BronyState to use an embed client joined to this channel
*takes the sunglasses from doctorwho and puts them on and then off* I agree
For other ponychat channels, idk if there are any embeds, but any third-party client (Chatzilla, mIRC, etc.) can attach to irc.ponychat.net
ok thanks
Oohhhh... What's this band? :3
Kiryu, DoctoDoctorWho: http://horobox.reager.org/u/Jojje_1341584044.gif

Brb.
the_inkBot: Shh... It's a secret... :P

talking about that my face when I herd season 3 was close --> http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/245-hory-shet-spongebob.jpg
what is this my beautiful music my ear's ar hearing? 6_9
Hmm... Stay awake and find out what the surpise is, or sleep... 6_9

Everytime I see someone get trolled. http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/4623-u-srs-brah.gif
that's better
no seriously whats the name of this song? :[
mods forgive me, this cant wait http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxy9mrKplzA
*doctorwho has mysteriously left*
Apples apples apples sweets
00,10hardly woth knowingly breaking a rule no?
well what a coincidence >_>
thx adam
Is that a ban hammer behind you Sumi? :P
Kiryu: Oh no that's not the song name
00,10leave that one up to Scoot-Scootaloo, as it'
I just felt like writing the lyrics :P
00,10his stream
DoctoDoctorWho: It's about whether he thinks it was worth it
then what's the name of the song
Idk
Well I don't think anyone knows Kiryu
00,03Hmmm... technically lazy stream is lazy, so I'll allow it just this once.
well fffffffffudge
00,03THIS
00,03ONCE
o.o
I'm scared.
o_O
ONE. DAY.
what are you talking about scoot's? 6_9
Scoot-Scootaloo: A thousand apologies my lord, It wont happen again. I swear.
So, joc, during a stream, posting links should be cleared with the streamer first?
DIS SONG <3
oh my gosh I dint know! :O
im sorry for the link :'(
Or is it just youtube/video links?
Any type of video link
Just non-image links
DEAD OR ALIVE!!!
I only put a pic
was it a long link?
AdamTheDuck: So images = good. Else = ask the streamer, ask a mod, or just don't do it?
Kiryu: Don't worry, only non image links aren't allowed
Use derpy.me to shorten it
tSparx: Oh you can ask a mod.
well that's a relief
AdamTheDuck: And that's during a stream?
AdamTheDuck: Or just in general?
umm im not sure what im doing on this irc client is there anything or anywhere i can go to get help to connect with ponychat
only when a stream is up
tSparx: If no stream is happening then any links are allowed
Alright, phew, thanks all.
00,10SpectraClouds yeah, #help
SpectraClouds: If you're running a third-party client
who first heard this song on the scooby doo movie?
Oh I see we have some newcomers here
tSparx: If there is a stream, whether the streamer is afk or not, no non-image links unless one has permission.
SpectraClouds: ie not the one embedded on bronystate
I first heard this song on a Trigun AMV
What song is it?
im using hydrairc
SpectraClouds: Then type in "/attach irc.ponychat.net" (without quotes), then "/join #BronyState" (again, no quotes)
My laptop is muted
allright evrypony gotta go
MASF123|Disconnected: Dead or alive
Night Kiryu !
Bye kir- oh well :/
I don't recognize it...lyrics are?

MASF123|Disconnected: Refrain: I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride, I'm wanted, dead or alive
oh...
That was on Holes
Yeah
With Kissin' Kate Barlow.
Lol loved that book.
She killed many men. :)
You make me disapoint
Yes Barbetos|AtWork ?
MASF123|Disconnected: "I'm a cowboy... On a steel horse I ride... I'm wanted... Dead or alive~
We dissapoint ourselves too
This accompaniment does not fit with this song...
What? Why'd that other one take that to pop up? O_o
SO. Yesterday. New York. Celebration that the nation went a WEEK without a voilent shooting. This morning there is a voilent shooting in New York.
that long*
That song would never play if you were reading that part. Lol.
00,03MERRKIA!

lol
no I don't
Mare-i-ka
lameassponypuns
How do you spell gone-or-re-yah?
gonorrhea?
yeah
ok
Fun fact: A linguist said that gonorrhea was one of the most soothing word phonetically. :D
Haha
AdamTheDuck: and cellar door was the most beautiful combination of words
Gotta love studying linguistics. :P
I'm bilingual
Allistair Crowley is the template of names that most English-speaking people happen to respect the most
The same number of sylabbles and same pattern of emphasis

I plan on singing "flutterwonder" when I attend my first bronycon

Hallo Vivix
Hejhei MLP_Brovakiin
Vivix Scoot's streaming, working on a secret project and playing music til he's done
Aah
I wonder if the show musicians listen to some of the PMV now :D
Captain Friendship...he's a hero gonna stop hatred down to zero
MadSurge: I think Ingram said he had, well at least listened to some of the brony music and remixes
And...? His outcome was...?
Vivix: that's nice :)
00,03Daniel Ingram listened to this song specifically
Gonna help us, put asunder, meanies who like to hate and plunder!
(You'll pay for this Captain Friendship!)
/me noms Vivix
00,03He said "Oooh Trance, nice!"
The friendship is yours!
Hehe
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D

I love parody so much haha
00,03No worries. I''m almost done!

Well that answers that, time to stay up a little longer. :3
Okay!
How you doing Vivix?
I'm good, you?
Yeah alright :3
You know, this is the second Scoot stream I've seen
Which is a bit odd, since I've been here a while-
then again, I had never seen a valthejean stream either until a few days ago
Vivix: Hm, I've been here 3/4 days and this is at least my second, and I think I've seen more
by scoot? Hm
Maybe my- timezone is offff or something
one more*
I'm GMT-5hours
GMT +1 here

I just found out that one of my favorite Muppeteers died yesterday... :'(

Aah- that's sad
09:24
what is this one?
00,03I heard phyllis diller died some time ago :(
Scoot-Scootaloo: Yeah she did
Scoot-Scootaloo: A few days ago :/
Oh I see
what is this song?
DoctoDoctorWho: Sunshine and salary stalks.
but I think- I can't remember what the firest episode I saw here was
I'm sitting here wondering what #BronyState is like on Xmas
Anyone here ever seen Fraggle Rock?
Oh dear god Fraggle Rock
thanks
;~;
I've seen some fraggle, Fragglene it's called here
hi all
Aren't one fo those puppeteers now working for Valve?
Hi Eli
Helo Eli
Hi Eli
Vivix: Yes, Karren Prell
She was Red
Ah, yes
Eli... I liked that movie :P
I know I've asked before, but could all the Ruby Gloom fans on here now please raise their hoof?
She animated Wheatley :3
AdamTheDuck: what movie? :3
/me ESTACTICALL RAISES HIS HAND
Book of Eli.
00,03Alrighty, I'm done with this peice of dumb! You guys wanna watch videos or listen in to the Vinyl Scrath tapes again?
Gold_Demona: Ah, that's cool. I heard from the book she really likes working for valve- sounds like fun place
AdamTheDuck: :D
That was a great movie indeed AdamTheDuck
Vivix I'm 20 years old, and about a month ago I found it on Netflix. Watched it all in one weekend xD
AdamTheDuck: ahh... yeah, nice movie. but that's my real name though
estatically* :D
00,03AHEM
Vivix: I found out she was working for Valve while listening to the developers commentary in Portal 2. I recognized her voice. XD
MLP isn't the only little kid's show I watch
/me pokes Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo: Ambivalent
oh hell yes
I watch tons of animation things, I just love animation- mostly western
Me too, but I also like some anime.
Gold_Demona: Aah, that's cool. Have you read the making of book? She talks about her experience and a bit about her past jobs there
gsyu! how i computer?
Vivix Me too, but I also LOVE Japanese anime (and manga) (and culture in general)
Vivix: I didn't even know there was a book. :P
vinyl pic with ruby eyes? sweet! who's streamin?
Scoot-Scootaloo: If Its all right with you, I think a DBZ abridged marathon is in order
Scoot is, Eli
It's on steam for like 2 euro, it's the making of Portal 2, with tons of interviews. Really cool book, like really cool
Vivix: I'll have to check that out. =)
tSparx: Ah yes, I don't watch alot of anime, the animation style is quite my thing, but that's not why I don't watch much. I did read a lot of manga as a teen though
/me glomps Vivix
nemnemnemnem
/me struggles
Vivix: Forgive my ignorance, but about how many USD is 2 Euro?
What is God was one of uuuuuus?
I know it's not a huge exchange rate but
if
tSparx: uuh give me a sec and I'll check the exact price
2 Euro is like 3 bucks, isn't it?
HUGE estimation there
No exact math :P
:O
Still, all I need is rough
like... 2.50 tSparx
/me waiats steam store page
Scoot-Scootaloo: can we please have a DBZ abridged marathon? pretty please with fluttershy on top?
You know what always confused me? Pounds. Like in the U.K. it's all about pounds.
00,03Nah, I have something else in mind
DoctoDoctorWho: We were watching a ton earlier.
For currency
awww, I missed it
BOOO it's Rainbow Dash :D
00,03Am I the only one that likes this version better?
MASF123|Disconnected: Well, yeah, but at least it's deci-pounds and not the old conoluted system
Okay, steam is acting up on me, the book is called Portal 2 - Final hours, USD Euro and Pounds should be listed depending on where you live
Vivix Thanks! I'll look it up :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh this is a cover? Doesn't sound too different.
Sounds awesome. =)
I like ESP Pony's covers
DoctoDoctorWho, it seems that DBZA has become Caramel's thing.
00,03My thing... is something else
DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah but not like a ton ton. I wouldn't call it a marathon, you didn't miss a marathon don't worry :)
Oh my god.
ok, we gotta have one later tho
itg 3 =o
00,03This is probably gonna kill me..
DDR? :D
Its itg
There is totally a pony on that screen, and she is looking even more badass than usual <3
:O RD!
Hah!
Haha, this is so fast my computer can't even keep up xD
nice
She's looking bipedal, though
bipedal ponies make me sad
/me coughs varius artist names
Kandarihu: No, she's just flying with her rear hooves toward the ground
She's flying right at us!
O__o the arrows, they are rebelling!
/me glomps Vivix

BOOM!
MASF123|Disconnected: No, In the Groove
Wuuut
Wow. ITG 3 has some awesome features
That's funky
I miss playing 2 all the time at the arcade I used to live near.
Ok, who the hell could play with so much stuff screwing up your vision?
It seems like RD would be distracting as hell >_>
Ouch
Apparently she is
wow.
I have tons of DDR games on PS2. It's pretty much the only form of exercise I like to do. =P
DED
Nice save
Though, of course, since I'm not trying to play, I don't mind it :)
Hah!
bombs
I forgot about those
Oh noes!
Bombs?
Bomb Up!
Hitting bombs makes the meter on the left go down.
So essentially, this is DDR on acid?
lol
tSparx: I believe so.
DEFEATED
DoctoDoctorWho: Good with it how?
Scoot-Scootaloo: are you doing this on keyboard?

Eli: You're not alone...
No way! :D
Eli: I don't get a lot of these jokes/references.
so back to my problem,
Eli: Bronydom is deep and detailed and grew so quickly, there are a ton of inside jokes and whatnot.
It's from an eminem song
a lot of us who don't like memes don't get the jokes
tSparx: don't question them, just go with the flow
my faic
oh hell nah

DoctoDoctorWho: I can comment just fine :o

Hey bronies have you seen the video rainbowlicious?

Lotsa spaghetti
00,03Smoke weed everyday~

Scoot-Scootaloo: If only

Weed is never the answer.
Indeed
Uhh sooo sleepy... Goodnight everyone. :)
Goodnight AdamTheDuck
Good night AdamTheDuck
Cya AdamTheDuck!
Kandarihu: Well, no.
NIght AdamTheDuck !
Goodbye AdamTheDuck

That sounds like Sabrespark
The hell is this :D
Kandarihu: But I only did things because they were answers, I probably wouldn't be here right now, so :P
00,03It is SaberSpark :)
I wish we saw more of Luna
what are we watching?
Luna Eclipsed luna Is best Luna
00,03one moment
tSparx: more princesses in general
hello bronystate
Those bits
Hey DaringDerpy :)
Hallo DaringDerpy
MadSurge: Only if Celestia's character gets developed more. I feel like she's very 2d as presented, but that there's a lot more to her
00,03Because this game never get's old >_>
I really like her canon personality
Omg :D
Yes tSparx :D
Haha I watched this earlier :D
mainly because, she's what, 4000 years old? If not more or less, and if she shows too much emotion- that feels weird
Slendeeeeer :|
XD
there was nothing?
AAAAHHHH THE CAT
Aaaaahhh!!!!
this is like the new bandwagon lets play game
CCCCAAAAAAAATTT!
Vivix: But Luna's like 3992 years old, and she gets character development and emotion and stuff.
lol
XD
so much drama
tSparx: true, but she's inexperienced and unstable
oh my gawd
I like how cold Celestia can be
lol "How do we surviiiiiiiiive?"
Vivix: I just think the staff could make it work and that I'd like to see it, that's all.
aaaaaaaaaand average gamer
Is this Slender? Who's playing it?:D
I love the face-cam at the end :D
tSparx: I'd have nothing against it, but I don't feel she's too 2d now
yay
what is that noise?
Vivix: Like a Mary Sue?
"Shit just came out of me"
Nice
AJIsAwesome: Micheal and Gavin from Achivement Hunter
This game suuuuuucks :D
AJIsAwesome: whatn ow?
I sometimes walk behind people at night, playing a keyboard
Super duper helpful not useless Slender map: http://i.imgur.com/rFFWv.jpg
I love this one
So what the hell am I watching?
Vivix: About Celestia being 2d. You know what a Mary Sue is, right?
Oh yeah, but I didn't see the connectoin
AJIsAwesome: yeah same as Vivix here
faster!
C'MON ON!
OH SHIIIIT RUUUN!
NOOOO the cat stepped on the piano again!
seriously wth is this
tSparx: a bad game called Slender
It's achievement hunter
MadSurge: Based on that Slenderman person
:o
noo bufer :O
I'd love to see more of all the Princesses in season 3
^
00,03:(
AJIsAwesome: Vivx: I don't feel like she is 2d, but I feel like there's a whole lot more room for depth in her character
AJIsAwesome: Maybe, but I feel she's nice now. Like I would not want an episode where she's sick and is tended to for instance- unless it was done really well. I like them to be a bit--deity ish
tSparx: oh yeah, true
celestia is the only main character that had no psycho episode so far
:D
NUUUUUUUU
:D
Royal Canterlot Voice!!!!
00,03:(
Vivix: Oh I want the exact opposite. I wanna watch Celestia run in with the mane 6 and get her hands dirty
YOU FUCKING MOROOOOOON
Aah, I like her to be royal- and a bit distant
er, hooves dirty
In fics I really dislike when she says "don't call me by my title" and stuff
LOL Pill pushers XD
:D
Vivix You remember the episode where Fluttershy steals her bird?
yeah
:D
Kidneys is best suit
I love the "rake" one :D
Lol!!!
Vivix That's where I first got it in my head that maybe, maybe, she would like to throw aside the royal stuff sometimes and just enjoy a nice dinner with the denizens of Ponyville
LOL
LOL Took him a second to get that. XD
tSparx: Oh, same here.
Wow :D
ROFL
Orgasm. Yes.
you are correct
I like the South Park one best
FACEPALM
tSparx: truue- but I dunno, I would love to see her have a casual dinner with friends, but not- take of her regalia and play in the fields of ponyville. For instance-
MOO
What the crap?
FAIL
Vivix: Agreed. Honestly, I don't have a direction specifically I'd like to see her go in, I'd just like to see her go ;)
Dohoho!
LAWL
lol
PENIS
HAHAHAHA
tSparx: hehe, yeah- I'd love to see more of her in general
PINGAS
BREASTS

LMAO!!!
Wat
DoctoDoctorWho: And you have a account right?
Whoopeeee
Clean your strings before putting an instrument away. My main bass was out of comission for 2 weeks or so, it's strings have rusty spots on it- ff
um....
Oh....my....god :D
yes, it does this even when Im already signed in
WHOA LADY :D
Vivix Well, if you play with rosin
lag :(
no
I can't use rosin on an elbass
DoctoDoctorWho: Odd, never heard of it
I have played with viola bow on my bass, had ot use rosin on the bow
MOM SPAGHETTI
Gyawd, I'm slow at typing...
spaghetti
ponies?
So much spaghetti
spaghetti
Weak arms are heavy
yum
Vivix What're you putting on an elbass that'd be corrosive to it?
Flying Spaghetti monsters!
I want spaghetti now
me too
00,03Now for... this
tSparx: sweat
Developed for television by Spaghetti Spaghetti
SPAGHETTI!!
Vivix Though I'd understand if it was just enough sweat
Ah, see ;)
Ooh! I love Talkartoons! =D
Gold_Demona: I already am signed in
yeah, it is- I got new strings but I'll change after playing
46 minutes until they open the mystery package
:O old timey cartoons! :$
Vivix Well, glad to have a fellow bassist on chan
DoctoDoctorWho: Hmm..... I don't know what to tell ya. =/
OH NO NOT THIS
tSparx: ah , you play too? What kind?
oh cool, this
THIS IS THE CARTOON FROM HELL
DoctoDoctorWho: Have you tried multiple browsers?
tSparx: What's this about?
Old cartoons are great
THIS IS THE MOST BAD ACID TRIP CARTOON OF ALL TIME
Follow dat chicken!
I lvoe those
THis particular episode that is
This takes me back to before I was born and still swimming in my father's sack.
Vivix I started off classical, but now am elbass
MASF123 wtf lol
RaveBrony: like firefox?
oh, old cartoons, you so creepy and fun
Favorite black and white cartoons are mostly Betty Boop.
AJIsAwesome: Horror. It's about horror. This series as a whole is okay, but seriously this is one of the most fucked up cartoon bits of all time, just watch
I love how creative old cartoons are
If this is the one I think it is, of course
Gold_Demona: I liked ahrvey the rabbit
Yep, this is it!
Tiny chicken!
DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah. A while back DA didnt work for me on Firefox, but worked on Chrome :P
cowvarkian: Haven't watched a lot of Harvey. Not as easy to find
yeah
wat
o_o
Dis Bimbo?
:O THE DEEEAAAAAAAAD
Hmm i wonder. Scoot-Scootaloo Would you know if you guys got a certain cartoon movie that can be choosen for movie night sometime?
creepy :O
tSparx: ah, cool. I started out with elbass 9 years ago, really want a cello though
wait, are people ever actually scared by this?
hai Eli
Cold feet
heya CCCP|Colt45
00,03If it's chosen, of course :)
RaveBrony: Ill see if that works and get back to you
This was recently in a Cracked article for the *x* Darkest Insane Cartoons of All Time
Scoot-Scootaloo: Ok i'm thinking of ''Who framed roger rabbit''
tSparx: Seriously?:O
This was a kids show? CREEPY AS HELL!
Scoot-Scootaloo: I wonder if that's a movie that can be shown
cowvarkian: yes, Its creepy as fuck
For Rent :D
im scared
00,03I dunno lol
cowvarkian: Just this episode. THe really creepy parts haven't started yet
If this doesn't scare you to death, you've been on the Internets for too long
Scoot-Scootaloo: Welp i hope it is, Cause that movie is awesome
the lag is killing me :(
DaringDerpy: Well idk about to death, but it is certainly creepy
I'm bored
What are you guys watching?
I think there was one with the KKK members. No joke.
It's not very creepy right now
wait, but this isnt scary
MASF123: After watching Birth of a Nation, no KKK-based cultural touchstones shock me anymore
Yeah it's not
this is just a good old cartoon
MASF123: Doesn't surprise me. People weren't NEARLY as concerned with political correctness back then.
deserves him right for stealing a chicken
-de
People weren't frickin pansies about it back then
DaringDerpy: kinda :D
not really
Gold_Demona, political correctness didn't exist until the 1990s
Gold_Demona: Ikr .__.
Okay dafuq xD
GHOST ASS
Kandarihu: This is true.
Gold_Demona: if by "weren't pansies" you mean "they lynched lack people for misbehaving" then yes, you're correct.
00,03CCCP: No, it was mostly 1930's. Even then, they were frouwned upon by the maority of the population
it was --removed in the 1960s
Makes perfect sense to me.
CCCP|Colt45: KKK was a deep south thing
then reinvented in the late 90s
this was probably a tech demo
00,03frowned*
00,03majority*
Because honestly, I'll take people being too sensitive about the word black over race riots and murder.
RAWRity: That's not what I mean at all.
Scoot-Scootaloo i see
RAWRity: indeed
oh wait, are they lynching that cartoon because he's black?
Yeah, PC can and often is taken to a ridiculous extreme, but the general idea that we should just be nice to people and respect them is what MLP's all about, eh?
D:
now it gets interesting
I don't know why I don't like these cartoons.
cowvarkian: most likely because he stole a chicken
cowvarkian Is it bad that thats the first thing a associate the South with?
Yeah, here's where it starts to get FUCKED UP
It's what started it all.
I am thoroughly convinced that nothing can suprise me anymore
yeah, but it happens CCCP|Colt45
I ust think it's fun to watch on a technical level. I mean, this was all done by hand.
...what am I looking at here
i know
hai RAWRity
even though its true
What are you guys looking at
EQUINE_excite: an episode of a cartoon *clearly* inspired by acid
DED :D
morning everypony
Considering the time it was made, it's not a charactiture of black people unless he has big lips.
00,03You know what? I think I will show a pony episode today!
That's it?
Scoot-Scootaloo: OH LORD
I smell troll incoming
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh, no.........
SCOOT YAY!
Scoot-Scootaloo: NOOO
I like traditional animation a lot but cartoons like this bore me.
I think the creativity of old cartoons is usually better than most moderen cartoons
;P
Scoot-Scootaloo ewwww
OH THIS :D

Aw man, it'd be fun to hear a Latin dub of MLP
PillowPoni|Reading: RABLE RABLE RABLE

Lunar means "of relating to the moon"
Chicas

Thank you! Enjoy!
NIHONGO PONIES
Spike, Y U SOUND LIKE DIEGO FROM DORA THE EXPLORER?
CrazyHippie1234 well, as I said, only when you have good translators who try to do their job right XD

What does elementos mean? =o
I understand this. Lol.
hello :3
Eli: I don't think she has in Norwegian either-
My native tongue
cowvarkian: Yes! A real live boy! :D
jajajajaja
Halo sonicandmario85
Barbetos|AtWork: HMM I WONDER :D
No...hahaha not jajajaja
Its pretty easy to know what shes saying when you've seen this episode many times...
Lil_B: But the Chinese one is awesomely OK. Especially since Spike's name seems so long
Alright. I just saw a third MLP Symbol Art on PSO2
jajaja is Spanish for hahaha
No, jajaja
spike was realy lucky he didn't land on her horn...
MadSurge: no.. really... =|
hajahajahajaha
I know
But I hate that
jajajajajaja
jejejejeje
Domistic Abuse isn't funny. Imagine how many times Spike's been beaten like that and she didn't give a toss?
jojojojo
wat.
Lalalalalala
Barbetos|AtWork: o__o just remove that o
Barbetos|AtWork: It means Elements
did I come back to.

yes
*episode
Jmo: BronyState
^
Next episode: Japanese fandub
MASF123: What and that means other languages are completely banned?
Thanks PillowPoni|Reading >.>
Japanese Japanese Japanese
Scoot-Scootaloo is there a special reason why spanish or are you generelly do multilanguage Ep1?
guys i you know the moon is name luna in real life?
Importante!!!
:D
did*
I woulf like a good japanese fandub
Gold_Demona: damn right. this here is AMURICA. WE SPEAK AMURICAN
MadSurge tSparx lol =P
*would
Gold_Demona no dummy I just find it annoying
Jmo you're welcome
The sun is named Sol, I think the Moon is Luna, but I'm not sure
>.<
hi thar Jmo :)
Jmo: Spanish ponies lol
CMC ep is on the Hub right now :P
Vivx:yep it is
dah, sun is sol
Even in YGS they were making fun of jajaja
:O
'ello Lil_B
Vivix: yeah. i think italian's the same
i guess the moons where luna got her name XD
MASF123, YGS?
As a Hispanic, I find that line of thinking annoying...
Vivix Sol is Latin for sun and the name of the sun deity, Luna is Latin for moon
Your Grammer Sucks
How's my fanfic?
since the moons named luna
Kandarihu: Your Grammer Sucks
MASF123: well sorry if I don't speak english in my country, sciocco :P
Gold_Demona: then take the stick out of your ass and get a sense of humor :p
Oh, I see. Thanks
you're welcome MadSurge
tSparx: while celestia means heaven :)
tSparx: yeah, but I think you are supposed to say Sol in science texts if you are talking about our sun
must to correct grammar* :/
http://derpy.me/BfJf0
/me takes stick out of butt.
MadSurge, you can't speak English oh boy
Not in Latin it doesn't
Ewwww
Holaa
Lil_B: :/ Grammar
How about fandubs in languages that are either dead or conlangs?
SWEET APPLE ARCES
CrazyHippie1234 : )
Eli Caelus/coelus is Latin for heaven
Eeeha? :D
http://derpy.me/LgsWo
klingon?
why does Twilight sound manlier than Spike?
I would love that Kandarihu
Kandarihu: Ancient Greek My Little Pony!
MASF123: Of course, can't you see how my english is poor and disarticulated? :P
latin or klingon or something
oi applejack
CCCP|Colt45: Dat Draw friend stuff :D
MadSurge haven't noticed.
oh good lord AJ's voice
http://derpy.me/0JjjU
RAWRity: heh Hellenika would be fun ;)
RaveBrony: :P :D
00,03Almozar companeras =\= Soups on, everypony
I was thinking Klingon, but the vocabulary in that language is limited to a Klingon mindset.
Yeah Madsurge, your English is certainly passable
MASF123: I studied english since middle school :D
AJ doesn't have a SOuthern accent yes now you all know
Scoot-Scootaloo is there a special reason why spanish or are you generelly do multilanguage Ep1?
http://i.imgur.com/1V2Zh.jpg
Spanish parallel to cowboy dialect?
Ahpelbluwm!
MadSurge, you speak decent
00,03Because people wanted a pony episode...
The closest thing to a greeting in the Klingon language pretty much translates to "What do you want?"
MadSurge... don't say "my english is bad" and disarticulated in the same sentence
Haha
EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
Scoot-Scootaloo: they ask and they shall recieve lol
Im half Colombian, but i dont know spanish :(
cowvarkian: I heard a few tell me for someone who has learned english, By myself i certainly have a very good english compared to some english users and my friend knows since he is british
hmm
http://derpy.me/qHBfw is this supposed to be a referance to Shadow of the Colussus?
RaveBrony my friend is Puerto Rican and he can't speak Spanish
Eli: why not?
spanish!Twilight doesn't appear to have that scathing sarcasm in her
Maybe Elvish would be good, or Esperanto. A Latin translation would be lulzy when it comes to Luna.
Dat laugh :D
RD
Haha Excuse me?
XD Doctor Who FTW
CCCP|Colt45: Indeed :P
Hackalot: /)
BAAAHAHAHA
I guess Klingon IS the most famous conlang.
hmm
Major ^-^ hai
(\
CCCP: yep
Kandarihu: You don't think it's Esperanto?
MadSurge: Well good you are quite good at english. I had to learn it myself :)
sounds like i'm missing out on something, what is playing on the stream at the moment?
The only and original
CCCP: hi :3
Klingon would be the most hilarious
Kandarihu: its just the most used
Esperanto could be interesting
Los Wonderbolts! :D
killerpony7733: where are you from?
I'm already used to it
Yeah yeah that's easy in a second
Los Wonderbolts!
no one speaks esperanto
Hallo Major
is esperanto really a language?
Exacto!
Im loving this :D
better try elbish
RaveBrony: We all are
cowvarkian: not really :D
or a gibberish translation
:)
cowvarkian: yeah, attempt at international simple language
/me demands a Swahili Dub next.
cowvarkian: It's an artifical language, just like Elvish and Klingon
MadSurge: Greenland originally. Currently living in Denmark, I'm purely danish by blood
ah
It's not gibberish if I can understand it
I'm part of that thing, killerpony7733
Dat AD
DEUTSCH PONIES ODER JAPANESE PONIES ODER BUST
Haha your expression on your face
cowvarkian: Part of?
Los Wonderbolts ot Los Pegasos
XD
Rarity time!! <3
DAT RARITY!
Beautiful
die deutschen ponies klingen seltsam
inb4 raritys VA is horrible
HER!
Shes fine :)
sonicandmario85: you're not missing anything new :D
Goodafternoon
RAWRity: That's actually prtty good
Well, at first, I didn't even give specifics when I suggested a conlang fandub. And the first thing that came up was Klingon.
cowvarkian: Ah i see.
5 Upvotes and 6 Downvotes with 56 views alltogether...Not bad for my first fanfic
Needs more Wahaha!
RAWRity i think shes alright
Oh my stars!
DaringDerpy I think they sound good, they still portrai their chraracters right
so far
Hairstyle not "mane"
WTH
dont question
RAWRity: did you hear any really terrible VAs for Rarity?
I will
because I can
she's not dead yet!
if translation is hilarious, just laugh
sure
http://derpy.me/rSGW2 is this an OC?
MadSurge: But yeah i got ace at my exam before summer, So i got a really good oral english. Though i can certainly improve on both written and oral.
Time for some Fluttershy
Fluttershy!!!!!!
Ok gonna stop the stream until my Steam is done updating the games XD just too much lag
CCCP: I think so
That was more just a precautionary thing. From what I can tell, Rarity and Aj's voices are always the hardest ones to get right in other languages. SOmething about the Southern or Mid-atlantic accents just doesn't translate well.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, and then pack up my life to take it to my dorm.
When something gets translated into every language in existance, someone will always translate it into Klingon just for lulz.
I just decided that I learn my next language by watching ponies
Fluttershy is the best pony in the entire show, even though everypony is equal she breaks the rule
Klingon is always for the lulz
Kandarihu: I demand a Na'avi dub.
I wonder if theirs a bible in klingon
Soy Twilight Sparkle
cowvarkian, there is.
killerpony7733: well I got a really good time at BUCK, and people seemed to understand me fine :D
unsurprising
lag
cowvarkian: yup. there was a guy selling them at Otacon
o_o
too loud
Haha
oh good lord.
hmm
Brueno
<.<
Keep working
Very good
Good morning everypony
Squeaking is too loud :D
that's...horrid
hello Dovah
Hey, Dovah :P
RAWRity what is?
batcha?
Un bebe drag?n! ^^
CCCP: Flutter's VA
hey Dovah
Soy Spike
Dovah: Morning!
Wait Wait
I once downloaded an open source bible program called SWORD Project. It contains a lot of freely available translations of the Bible, and one of them IS in Klingon.
WHat do you call him?
D: RAWRity i dont agree :P
Goodmorning Dovah
hi Dovah
Noooo :'( don't ruin 'Shyyy
Abosulty everything
/me demands a Dub in Mermish, the language of the Merpeople
Dormirrr
I remember talking to danish people a few years ago...
They do a decent job actually.
fun language that
Poor thing
It even has a Klingon Alphabet, probably based on code meant for East Asian langauge.
killerpony7733: same :D when I get going I get as excited as Pinkie :D
you guys should l watch the Photo Finish Episode in Spain... Fluttershys rage scream is terrifiying XD
Danish sound bizarre to all us scandinavians, kinda sweet though
Yeah, the VAs arent bad, its just that FS squeak was way off :D
/me glomps Vivix
Lil_B: I've seen it.........:S
yeah
Pinkies VA is great :D
Lil_B: Heard that :D
SUPRISA!
She actually sounds like pinkie
Burrito?
SI SI??
:D
sortof
Vivix: Hey now. Danish is ok, but it's more about our accents when we speak english with it
She said I'm bored.
pony pony pony!
DERPY!
Not burrtio lol
This is great since Spanish people talk really fast :D (or at least my spanish relatives do)
the first time i met Pinkie Pie i didnt really like her that much...
I love Pinkie's spanish voice. XD
killerpony7733: oh yeah, I think it sounds nice, but it's bizarre when you can understand like half of it, and not all of it. You know?
Aww...she's crying with happiness!
UNce unce unce
Vamos!
00,03LOCAS!
What? It's delicious!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Colgate's Toothpaste Canon Commercial
Locas!
Well, if you understand one of the scandinavian languages, it should be easy enough to get most of it, unless my grasp of languange knowledge is less then I thought it to be
Vivix: Oh yeah like hearing swedish and norwegian and sometimes losing the track of what they are saying
You know what time it is?
mimimimimimimimimimimimi
It's a party!
Best italian VA is the Fluttershy/Applejack one, but Twilight's and Pinkie's are pretty good too :D
killerpony7733: yeah, it's kinda fun to half understand something that way.
Hmm, Pinkie Pie likes hot sauce on her cupcakes, but rainbow syrup is too much for her, I guess?
cowvarkian: yeah we can-understand eachother pretty well, but a lot of words are reaaally different. It can make full conversation hard
Vivix: Swedes has some odd words that can be understood very ''differently'' in danish
ah, ok vivix
yeah
Kandarihu: rainbow is too much for everyone
Vivix: Don't remind me what a cow is called and sleeping bags >_<
Heya :)
MaxTheBrony: Oi
of summer?
MadSurge, true. It's not meant for consumption in that state.
WTF
In my language its Ku - kyr and sovepose
I, as German, don't understand anything of what they say. Not even sure if Scandinavian or Dutch.
I can has spanish! :D
No es bueno D:
Wait a minute. It's not meant for consumption in ANY state.
I can speak Spanish I win!
Kandarihu: probably it's like eating raw jalapenos
Ay mucho poopo
o_o
Oooh she's good
Nightmare moon sounds like a black woman
Black snoootie!
Black woman?
cute
StinkomanFan lol
Oh wow

Thats Racsit!
She sounds like bubby?

What the fuuuck
my earbuds oowww
somepony didn*t read the script
Wait wut
oh, but that is still rather quiet for Spanish, to be fair
Oh, i saw this on EqD
Eli isnt english considered one of the hardest languages to learn along with japanese?
Hmm
bye erryprny
Bye CCCP
Cya CCCP!
Goodbye CCCP
Japanese usually takes 3 years to learn, it is not considered hard to learn, only to write
CCCP: Bye!
bye CCCP
english is suoer is though
/me hugs Fisheh_Fish RaveBrony MLP_Brovakiin AJIsAwesome and CrazyHippie1234
See, the problem with the Spanish scream is that it's actual SCREAM... instead of Fluttershy's not quite a scream and in fact it's barely a squeaks I'm soorry about that scaream.
DoctoDoctorWho, English is considered relatively easy language
fgggggggkkkukukukkk,
(and so is Japanese)
LAUGH AT THE TREES FLUTTERSHY
ASDW
WSAD
This is pretty cool :)
ASWEQ
PONY: indeed, not many verbal declinations
PONY: Yep i'm self taught by myself and video games. And i'm pretty ok
DoctoDoctorWho: Hardest? I think English is one of the easiest laguages. One of the reasons why it's so popular
DoctoDoctorWho: WUT? really? i have never heard that, and frankly, of all the languages i have ever looked into, i find english the easiest. heck i prefer it over german!
Kencolt: You're right. If the VA read the script correctly, she would know.
This is amazing.
Somepony ping me
trippy, but fun!
TheKoreanBrony1354: PING
TheKoreanBrony1354: LOTSA SPAGHETTI!
ok, guess my source was horribly uninformed
TheKoreanBrony1354: Hallo
English is popular because it's widespread, but it is one of the easier languages, and so is japanese. One of the hardest langauges is Finnish I think
trtbro hoof MadSurge AJIsAwesome
TheKoreanBrony1354: Hai
Eli, definetly easier than German, less grammatical rules, and more flexible build
HAI Fisheh_Fish
I want what she's having!
There's a list over hardest languages by some language society thing whatever, and english is not high on that
DoctoDoctorWho, your source was either horrible bad at English, or over proud of it as a languaage.
Fluttershy is a pretty pone
Vivix: Well the language you gets the most far with. Is english cause it's become a requirement and the higher your level of english is the better
Yay, cute Fluttershy! :3
00,03dAMN...
That was cool
fluttersh #1
rRAINBOW APPLE
DoctoDoctorWho: but it also depends what your normal language is. english has the same origins as german, thus it was easier for me to learn. french and italian have difrent ones, so i have problems with that
THAT WAS EPIC.:O
00,03Well, Fluttershy getting high is canon!
Zap apple sonicandmario85
SirGanjalf: she's having a blast so...*cocks shotgun*
killerpony7733: yes, it's modern days latin. It will, like most things, probably die out at some point, but it's our international language, you need it for many job things
anypony up 4 TF2
fightig is magic :3

DoctoDoctorWho, NO PAW, SHE'S MY PONY. I'LL DO IT.
00,03Up next, Wrek will be streaming a little somethin' somethin'~

Scoot-Scootaloo: Well, maybe she exploring the very deep depths of the Everfree forest. The depths no pony has ever seen.
*she's*
Oh joy.
/me is a PONY
And anything fanmade can never be canon
Vivix: In basic it opens a large amount of doors for things if you are at a decent level or even more at higher levels
yeah
but as a langauge it is really weird
/me usese the stare on sonicandmario85 (just so)
it lacks a ton of pronouns, and is a mix of three strong languages-
it's Weird
/me stare doesnt work
Scoot-Scootaloo: done with that super secret project yet?
Keep typing Vivix
00,03I've been done! :D
Wrek, Skola mig Svenska :3
you know what's a funny language? swiss! we do NOT have a simple past :3

LOSE YOUR SELF
Vivix: And wanna know something odd. I'm starting to think english has become more of a primary language for me as i'm actually a bit sucky at my own language like not that bad. But i certainly seem to have it a ton times easier and can speak alot more in english
O_O
i am not surprised
inb4 Shining throws the garter
TheKoreanBrony1354: You seen 8 Mile?
More Svenska
YES
dat Fry
Good movie :D
ikr, Eli... i'm german, and to me swiss sounds like somebody who's got a sore throat (no offense meant)
killerpony7733: I am better at written grammar in English than Norwegian, but - english is more lenient towards that anyway, right? I love my language, but it sounds weird in poetry and art
:D
Pie

Pie
00,03Oh darn, where is Wrek...

Aaahh!!
killerpony7733: know that feel. Lots of times, i don't know german words anymore, but i have the same word in mind in english
Dat scream
Scoot-Scootaloo: he's lurking in the shadows....Stalking us....
TheKoreanBrony1354: Nope. Reaction to Swedish Spitfire.
EAR BUDS INN
WHY?!?!?
Vivix, to be fair, the poetic meters norwegian was used for aren´t used much anymore
00,03I found a video!
dead god why
Im doing my work listening to the full theme of the ginyu force, everything I do becomes(pardon the overused meme) 20% cooler:)
That Fluttershy's a bloody Changeling!

Vivix, that I can agree with, the modern norwegian writing scene has *alot* to be desired
Applejack has power over trees
can't stop laughing
that was terrinle
That was... was... bad.
yes
Eli, only three? Well that's a relief
show crush kill destroy swag
Unnr: yeah- sadly. I'm sure we'll recover, but- there's mostly Crime and weird attempts at sounding high class
well it wasnt that bad
And this is going to be worse, isn't it?
To be honest, I'm sick of all the This Day Aria remixes.
TheKoreanBrony1354: Magic.MOV?
THIS IS SPARTA!
Unnr: I think it's a pretty language, and I like speaking it, but it's so hard to write fiction in it, for me
THE BURNING OF THE EYES WITH THE HORRIBLE ANIMATION AND THE FIRE AND THE oh wait its over,
AJIsAwesome: I love that song so much, that I have sworn to never listen to a single remix. Woo! Still not broken
Why remix a song that was already perfect to begin with?
Yes
Vivix, the best you can do is hope for a norwegian answer to Låt den rätte komma in
DoctoDoctorWho:they are G4 toys and its fan made....
Kencolt: because remix wars? :3
Unnr: I haven't read that, new book?
Eli, noch mein Deutsch ist besser als du Finnisch.
Is TF2's birthday today?
Older swedish book, its the text that Let the Right One Is/ Let Me In is based off
Speaking of remix wars....I can't wait for the entries for RW V to be released
Ooh
and by older, I mean 2004
Hehe
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Epic Art: What Friendship is All About
could be better, PONY
Yeah I hope we get a cool new book, or a series.
Would be good, I need an excuse to practice reading modern norwegian
Tjis doesn't even sound like the same piece at ALL. Its totally unrecogniable. Well, until just now.
The last Norwegian series I read was Isfolket, and that's written by a swedish lady- and it's not ALL that good. Crazy perverted with no agelimit as well
dat stock arpeggio
sonicandmario85: if mlp was really a half-assed gimick to kick off a toy line like haters say one would think they would have made better toys,
ROBODA, you don't born best at anything, I've merely had a year, which from I haven't had too much time to study.
Who9ever you are,m Kingspartax37-- I'm sorry but you FAIL.
Brb.
ok, for a year's study that's quite good
That was awful. Sorry. But that wa AWFUL.
Vivix: Isfolket, is that the wayyyyyyy too long series by Sandemo?
ROBODA, I haven't even studied, this is just some I've pretty much caught from the wind.
This is quite catchy
guys guess what? i found this video on youtube XD
the exact same one
Unnr: yeah, It's kinda fun but I read it when I was 14, so my memory might be glorified. It's a bit trashy and-- dude it's crazy perverted, despite originating from a magazine for housewives
sonicandmario85: What is it called?
yayayayayayayay
It has like demon guys with horse wangs doing ladies
Explicitly described
MLP_Brovakiin:dr.fluttershy
Vivix: Oh my.
I'd go to Doctor Fluttershy
Of course its trashy originating for a magazine for housewifes
i think
And no agelimit, books don't have--agelimits it seem
Hehehe, Unnr you have a point
Anypony that has ever read a romance novel coult tell you that
It's weird, all those ladies are perverts
Well "all"
Who is streaming this evilk, anyhow?
That SFM
well I have work to do, see you all later
so much SFM on youtube
Later DoctoDoctorWho
Kencolt: i think it's Scoot-Scootaloo
Goodbye DoctoDoctorWho
I kinda liked Isfolket because it spans from 1500-1960, so it has a lot of--time stuff and eh familyttree in start of book, but- yeah I wouldn't read it again
tf2 XD
DoctoDoctorWho, we will meet again.

D= My--luungs
hello ppl :)
hi HellsFortune
Hello HellsFortune
jsut gona let you know that
i tried dark souls today
if i was ever a mod when i see no stream on here id just stream a game like super mario galaxy XD
and the port is a fuckign disaster
and it was shit Wrek ?
otehrwise id stream that for you
the game istelf is great
the port
if a fucking discrage
I feel happy enough to even get it on PC.
well Jmo
same as darksiders 2..... they ported everything and didnt make the options
im just glad i can use a 360 controller on it BUT I LIKE KEYBOARD BETTER
due to the horrible port and all the controsl being unusable
or even a .cfg file for it
and im sure im never gonnabe a mod because of hpow i act xD
i cant play it
how*
gonna be*
what game?
Dark Souls
Ooh
I'd be trying it with a controller due it being a straight port.
Wrek: would you recomend getting Dark Souls for pc?
to*
Yeah, get a controler for bad ports-
onyl if you have a pad
i dont
Wrek: Use a console control on you PC
the worst port was Gta4, which used way more than it needed
*Your
MLP_Brovakiin: I DONT OWN ONE
if you have ps3 you can use that
well I do so when i get a bit more money I'll get it
lol
haha
bewm
DED
but yeah if you have a pad
good for you
you can play it
if not
then youre screwed like me
casue its unplayable in its current state
Time to party in Dark Souls.
Too bad- bad ports are terrible, obviously
i miss t-dog
:o
the companies need to stop making games for consoles then doing a half-assed port to pc. But its not happening cuz consoles make the moneys
Worst I've ever head was eh Stronghold 3, wouldn't even launch thanks to countless bugs
Mfw i havent realized my chat has been dead for 6 minutes :D
What happened to the days where they made games on pc then made an awful port to the consoles? LOL
those were the days
dat song
this song is familiar
wait, this is the song Jessica Rabbit sang in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
FlutterMEDIC: i dont think so?
I hate watching people play games I ussually play. It gets me pissed off at who wrong they do things.
FlutterMEDIC: And you win 1+ respect from me knowing the movie
i distinctly remember the "Get outta here" part in her voice
Did wrek beat that Sunset Saspirilla side-quest?
think i might play some Tf2...see you guys later
cya
Goodbye NocturnalBlade|Youtu
FlutterMEDIC you are right btw
It was in Who Framed Roger Rabbit
And JEssica did sing it
I LOVE this song
man, that was an awesome movie
Probably why it is in this movie, on top of it being a big hit in its day, the song that is
er.. in this game
Barbetos|AtWork: did not no that
*know
My school's doing a musical where one of the songs from Fallout 3 came from
South Pacific.
dat yodling
BAM
BEWM HEADSHOT
I wish I could find a gun that powerful in the game for close combat
dat knife
now THIS is a knife.
verily
HUDDA HUH
i'm afraid not.
I'm a fraid knot
So, this is Lonesome Road?
StinkomanFan: Nope. Vanilla with all DLC
He is currently in new vegas
holy timing
Ello there, everypony.
hi der
Hai Malavolent
Hallo Malavolent
good day kind pony
Hm. Quite.
Vivix you're too quiet for your own good, what're you up to o.o
Godwrath, He did something to deserve it apperantly
Wheyup! I have KFC
You killed a man who has a family he is trying to feed, KARMA. GAINED.
oh look, he has Scootaloo
<3
Scootaloo
Scoots is tasty
/me steals Golakka's chicken
GRAB THE CIGGARETTES
YA NEEDS YA SMOKES
/me begins to slowly rise off the floor and glow red
GRAB CIGGARETTES, SELL TO HIGHEST BUYER!
You... Did not just teal my chicken...
oh yes he did.
He totally made it teal.
somepony is ded
He tealed it.
tealing is wrong.
Wow, this music fits well to slow motion muder :D
eeyup
Sorry Golakka here *Hands back chicken bones*
now you are ded
They did not have anything he cared for lol
Dirty SAVE LOADER!!
everyone knows slow-motion murder is best committed with classy country tunes.
^
Sexy tunes.
who is streaming this afternoon?
spam that F5!
Wrek Golakka
or whatever quicksave is in Fallout, whatever
But, no desktop onies?
Fallotu ate them
Litterally.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
brb, bog
reminds me
just told my family i watch my little pony and if they have any complaints watch Ballad of the brony
I REGRET NOTHING
do it dude
Thunder-Crescent: I wish you the best of luck.
^_^
good luck
im back
hi
ah well.
Golakka: Welcome back!
FlutterMEDIC: Hello!
it's LoL time i guess.
hallo Golakka :3
seeya folks later.
hallo FlutterMEDIC
Well Wrek is in a pickle it seems
hi MLP
Wrek, shoot ANYONE that moves
i wasnt gone you know
Goodbye Godwrath
also, i have constant ping noises....
Its Wrek
BOOM
HEADSHOT
oh silly wrek
Wrek sure loves killing the innocent
Forget the head shot. Shoot him in the toes. That is real pain.
There is no such thing as innocence
They are feral ghouls
only degrees of guilt
Remember the time he slaughtered those kids because they made fun of him?
Imagine stubing your toew at 600 mph
Feral ghouls are muts
Yeah.
Golakka: Oh god that quote
Lol
/me stares into killerpony7733s soul
I WILL SPLIT YOUR THOUGHTS OPEN!!!
whut
Golakka: Hah good thing i got no soul
:3
*fails perils*
NO CLIP!!
*explodes*
I saw one video where he popped two testicals pop with one bullet FlutterMedic
Robaz?
But you know what's more satisfying? Watching HITLER'S balls getting shot off!
go somewhere with huge rad/secs
like 300 rutgens an hour :D
HOLY HAND GRENADES
oh lol
LOL!
NICE
Yes
MONTY PYTHON REFERENCES EVERYWHERE
He took wild wasteland didn't he?
heh
Hitler man, never has it been more fun than to blow hitler's brains out.
everyone, press arrow key up on your chat. And watch what you've said flash by your eyes
or his testicles
otakon17, why not?
Look out for Vorpal Rabbit!
o.o
Hmm... I don't remember saying some of this stuff ._.
So many weird things in history
Oh wow, I love this tune <£
gud song is gud
I don't want to set the world on fire <3
Hmm, Vera Lynn would work well in fallout
some people do want to set the world on fire
Well theyre nuts
exactly
otakon17: which kind? Cashew?
Acorn
No
so what movies are we watching tonight
Almond
=0
No idea alexxm|colt
Almonds are good.
Acorns arent
Almonds are evil!
otakon17: Then how do you feel about Almonds Mounds?
I have a phobia of almonds because traumatizing childhood experience
dems good eating
Or whatever that candy bar is
Pure delicious evil
Suddenly frame drop
>candybars
>Wrek
oh boy
Well I am coconut. So I guess I am in the clear.
Almond Joy
^
Isn't there a mounds one though?
somewhere in the world there is
Or am I crazy? You know what, don't answer that. I already know.
Wrek, you know you WILL have to play Dark Souls right? :D
MadSurge: Nope
i will not play darksouls untill they fix the controls
i litteraly cant
you know what i cant wait for? Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed 3
i keep hearing ping noises
Wrek: Get a wired controller, it'll take less time
for what money?
I am getting one today myself.
Do it. noaw.
Remember. Toe. Shot.
Pop a nazi scientest in the kidney
600 mph stubb ya toe.
worst pain EVER
no. Ball. Shot.
Exploding Testicles. We need zem.
Both. At the same time.
SO
SATISFYING
Dead Rising 2 was more satisfying. Suplexing a zombie is best thing ever.
Holla everypony! :)
Back
GilDash|Gaming: Hiya
Hiya GilDash|Gaming
It's more satisfying to see a nazi GET A BULLET THROUGH HIS HELMET AND INTO HIS SKULL
No
Through the scope
Even better if it comes out his eye
And calm down there
StinkomanFan: Still the most cringe worthy is nut shots
definitely
Wrek: That place is pretty clear of loot tbh
I feel this song atm
Ping?
Cringeworthy, yes, but what's the most funny one you can think of?
otakon17: but quest T~T
Shoot some dude in the ASS, went out his testicals. SO WORTH IT
i think a cool one is Remote Detonation of grenades
Wrek: Oh well you should pop on a Rad Suit
Hmmmm
otakon17: He has a mask from the lonesome road DLC, it asd 40% red resistance
It only stops the rads up to one point of radiation at a time
Nice
Wb Terminus-Bot

HI EVERYPONY!!
Hi Kakumy
and now the first thing i say about the video is fallout equestria..
Hallo Kakumy
oh pocket dimensions are so fun...
Kakumy: Hello!
hey kakumy
dat gun
Fallout now reminds me of F:E
good
Um
goan do this
then draw
bare with me :P
we shall
Fallout inspired F: E you know.
Wb TheKoreanBrony1354
otakon17: thats what i think of watcihng this video
Mhm
Wrek: what is that revolver?
hi otakon17
howdy everypony im back also is the movie scott pilgrim tonight ?
Spectrum_Rush: Lil Macintosh :P
isnt it just a 357?
.44
Spectrum_Rush: The Strangers Magnum IIRC
mysterious magnum
ah, ok
danke Wrek
Thunder-Crescent: That was about during the summer. So no tonights a mystery/surprise
dat holy frag grenade
if the Scott Pilgrim movie is tonight, then AWESOME
otakon17: i just killed the gaping dragon!
No idea
It isn't tonights a surprise BMN
that sounds dirty Bronysith
is it the same movie on all or is it the same movie on all channels
Bronysith: Bah, hes easy did you get his weapon though?
otakon17: yup, cut off his tail
Bronysith: how dare you speak of Dark Souls when I dont have it yet!
Thunder-Crescent: Theres one stream and that one only.
I wonder there will be a fallout 4..
Dovah: should i level up my strength like crazy now?
Bronysith: Did you fight with Sunbro?
otakon17: the actual one like from F3 or not quite as powerful?, and iknow this is F:NV
you wonder when, or if. Kakumy
Thunder-Crescent: All movies and episodes is streamed in order with pauses of course
awesome then i don't have to check
cool
because when is the question, not if
cowvarkian: when
Spectrum_Rush: Just a nod to the MS from F3
k
Bronysith: depends on what type of character you're makeing usually I dont level my streanght past 40
I used to be a ranger like you, until I took a big-iron to the hip
it'll probably be anounced when a new console is
Er, oops
*not including the wii u
Bronysith: but if you want to use heavy weps get it to 60
cowvarkian: Fallout 4 with better graphics than Skyrim
yeah
Brotherhood of balls of steel
And a supposedly better console generation would be needed
for some reason
I'll play Fallout 4 on my Alieware 51x
alienware oh god no
The CPU is worth it...
unless that giant ass one hell no..
Kakumy: You could still build something better then a alienware for less then what they charge you
But eh your choice though
Its fallout new vegas it must be wrek streaming right?
Not my money my parents money
Kakumy: i dont care if fallout 4 has bad graphics. i just want a good game
yep
No fallout 3
Brb guys
Kakumy: Ouch for them
Fallout 3 has the bunkers
:O SELF DESTRUCTION
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
Bronysith: Same here, but most people like better graphics over a better story
so I hear
i prefer story
Oh is he blowing up the brotherhood?
hai :(
cowvarkian: no. most assholes prefer better graphics than a better game
Hallo CCCP
We need Jessica Rabbit singing this! :D
OH Wrek, you and killing all humans
Bronysith: the combo will be the best but i want good gameplay and story
CCCP hai
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin
I'd also prefer better story over better graphics
^
/me Huhs CCCP what up
Nooo be friends with them dont hurt them
hi FlutterMEDIC *hugs*
*hugs
Too late
Hey CCCP :)
He blew it up
i like this song :3
/me hugs MadSurge
He blew it all up
Asshole Courier? :D
eeyup
its wrek
chat derped
Wrek wrecks the Nevada Wasteland
Dat pun
when's the thing gonna blow?
otakon17: his playing Fallout 3 dude...
Nevada already is a wastland
Bronystate needs more "game nice guys" :D
Kakumy: Its New Vegas
Gauss rifle!
Kakumy: Hes got a soundtrack on
Kakumy: Its not :D
otakon17: idk... i can't see difference
IDK SHUT UP!!
/me hugs kak
Lol
MadSurge: Hey i'm a nice guy in all games i play
ooops
really, so the whole desert thing and the eye robot doesnt throw you off?
I love the bos
He was in a huff
killerpony7733: me too
Jingle Jangle
me too killerpony7733
Huffy the Kakumy
Kakumy *hugs*
what? I close my website by accident...
/me hugs killerpony7733
/me hugs CCCP
dat enclave armor
:3
dat gauss
Man, I just had the craziest experience in PSO2 just now.
jingle jangle!
Whassup CCCP?
How so Kandarihu
MadSurge not much, you? :(
all is ded in bunker
CCCP: I need to shave tomorrow :D
MadSurge :3 oh
Fallout is like Elder Scrolls but with guns :D
its exactly that now
sortof
and flying robots
It's very far from that Kakumy
The first two games were different ALOT
Running the Caves, the Vol Dragon spawned and killed me quite easily. I pretty much filled my party with NPCs and died a few dozen times before the thing finally went down.
killerpony7733: and some more other stuff
only it has more role playing elements then elder scrolls strangely...
Fallout is it's completely own thing. Comparing it to scrolls is a bit--silly
as far as I can tell
Oh now I see Las Vegas
I HAVE NO FOOD :(
New Vegas
:)
Kakumy: NEW Vegas, please :D
/me Gives CCCP a muffin :3
New Vegas, Las Vegas I say Fallout style or Real world style :P
*dumps food into CCCP's inventory* here.
/me nomz the entire Fucking muffin in one bite MLP_Brovakiin MOAR
I think the last Caves map is going to have the Vol Dragon as an end-boss, meaning that if I die and return to the campship, I have to start over from the beginning.
New Reno was--darker than New Vegas, but New Reno had no walls to protect it
/me eats FlutterMEDIC
*muffled* why?
/me gives CCCP a muffin factory
MLP_Brovakiin yay!
What game are they playing
/me teleports out of CCCP
FlutterMEDIC im just sooo hungry
new vegas pony_4484
4484: Fallout: New Vegas
ok
I see you took the only reasonable choice. Kill Mr House and take New Vegas for yourself. :)
/me throws shit loads of muffins at CCCP
Kakumy yay
I've done that a couple times DaringDerpy
i see your muffin factory, and raise a PASTRY FACTORY
I work at the pie factory :D
dat high note
CCCP: what's your actual favorite dish?
Here some pie
Muuuuuffins :P
Im going to go get a peach
/me throws pies at CCCP
brb
*dumps tons of muffins on everypony* MUFFINS FOR EVERYPONY!
Yay thanks FlutterMEDIC
/me dives for muffins
MadSurge thats hard... im honestly not sure, i like alot of variaty
/me works at the liver & kidney factory :(
*Catches muffins* :P
Isnt that where pinkie works?
English chocolate muffins are delicious!
*mountains of muffins continues falling from the sky*
muffins are fine :)
Yum :P
FlutterMEDIC: please continue :D
/me is eating peach like muffin
I mean apple
Im going to paint chat. see ya!

MadSurge muffins are still falling from the sky
whats with all the food throwing? http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF182-Food_Fight.jpg
Its raining muffins!
Goodbye pony_4484
FlutterMEDIC: then I'll keep eating!
Alchemist: hahaha
hah Alchemist
NOAW I THROW CUPCAKES INTO THE MIX! *cupcakes start falling along with the muffins*
Alchemist: Ikr, food is meant to be eaten!
http://captionsearch.com/pix/thumb/3ny5knu5n-t.jpg
food
DaringDerpy: o u
Thats harsh
now these are just getting offensive
never experienced the magix of a food fight yet. Might actually be good :D
funny to me
jsut gona find the dam
well paint chat is empty...
thats a big gun
*muffins and cupcakes are still falling from the sky*
dam is east
Near Boulder City, I think
Wrek - hell of a gun... you going to protect the president or do him in yourself?
Ikr. 0-0 you could kill godzilla wth that
Midnight: What is paint chat, I was thinking ablout checking it out
both...AT THE SAME TIME! :D
Some of you might seen this pic
Its at the top
It says Paintchat
Its empty though
I know but what is it
they are cute
well
you can draw
and chat
Hello everypony!!
do you jus draw shit
hi VinylScrath_wubs
hey VinylScrath_wubs
hello vinyl
Heya VinylScrath_wubs :)
Hallo VinylScrath_wubs
hi VinylScrath_wubs
:D
hello
Alchemist i love it :D
its the radio man Alchemist
apparently broadcasting towers are still up
Dat music
pop culture got stuck in the 50's forever
Go find raiders and kill simple as that
the thing just evaporated
:O
Is that the Little MacIntosh mod?
StinkomanFan - no, i think that's just a plain .44
StinkomanFan: thats the first thing you would think of no it just a Myterious Magnum
^^ say i like trains and your screwed
StinkomanFan: I don't think wrek has any mods on
I never got fallout, If they where so advanced for a global thermonuclear war, then why did they go back to computers from the 50's
It's been 200 years.
MLP_Brovakiin - because EVERYTHING dun broke
nukes tend to break stuff
Midnight: I like trains
nukes are like .... EMP
except broadcasting towers :/
MLP_Brovakiin: It's 60's idea of the future
well...they actually were ready for thermonuclear war in the 50s
FlutterMEDIC - not every broadcast tower is in a place of "tactical significance"
Cowvarkian: *Train runs you over* i warned you. :O
The 50's werent as good as the 60's
they already had fusion bombs and neutron bombs at this point
MLP_Brovakiin: The idea was after WWII things wen't to hell and all, And alot of tech became advanced like alot of nuclear power and everything.
cus they didnt have Hippies
compare the desolation you see in towns like Washington DC to out-of-the-way locations like Novac here
they did too
Novac is a mess mostly from abandonment. DC is a mess because kaboom
actually, the bombs in fallout fell in 2077
Ok wait... Fallout New Vegas is ya placed at Vegas then what about Fallout 3?
Hello everypony
Kakumy - Washington DC
itÄS jsut that society somehow stuck in the 50s while technology kept advancing
MirrorImage: wow...
Hi Spademagnes[R]
hence, "Capital Wasteland"
technically DC should be a giant irradiated crater...
Kakumy: washington dc
Anyway our entire culture for the past decade has been based arounf the internet and shitty memes :)
<Spademagnes[R]> hello
HOLY BIG GUN
hey Spademagnes[R]
what is this? I want one :)
THAT GUN
Holy shit what is that
norly cccp
What..is that
i think that's the Tesla Cannon
Wrek gonna show off :P
@Wrek what the heck is that
Dark_Horst: And nuclear tech became the most used type. And the managed to develop some advanced technology at all
TESLA CANNON :D
cowvarkian for the most part yesh
they*
Where the hell did he get that?
Spademagnes[R] - a gift from the Brotherhood of Steel, as i recall
Dat bannon...
by gift, you mean stolen
*cannon
holy
Is it a part of a add on?
yes, judicial use of quotes when i say "gift"
Spademagnes[R] - don't think so
Or is it in the main game?
Woah.
one sc
MirrorImage: Still a better and unique somewhere in the world that is like alot more power
damn thing is a bazooka
powerful*
Spademagnes[R]: You find it in a crater with a crashed vertibird
It takes some ammo
theres one in big mt too
So what ammo does it take?
the one at the vertibird is not the tesla cannon though
Dark_Horst: Unique tesla cannon i short
looks the same though, only orange
in*
oh
out of no where flare gun
Whos the person playing the game?
microfusion cell probably
wrek VinylScrath_wubs
VinylScrath_wubs: wrek is
Just ignore the big cannon
ah cool.
I love how no one reacts to that
...at least i think
Lol
i need to get fallout.
pay no attention to the man beghind the curtain
hard NOT to ignore it
VinylScrath_wubs: yes, you do
XD
im gonna see how much it is on steam right now...
3 dollars
times 20
VinylScrath_wubs - GOTY edition i believe is $20
oh
if we're talking FONY
FONV*
fallout new york
I am level 50 on new vegas, It kind bores me now :/
yes... great idea for Fallout 5... NEW YORK
VinylScrath_wubs: i recommend fallout 3 first. did the whole wasteland athmosphere better. new vegas is pretty much western
well i have enough for that
that'd be cool
Ultimate is 30
MirrorImage: you mean fallout 4
20 seems a bit cheap
cowvarkian - New Vegas is "Fallout 4"
VinylScrath_wubs: also, it's cheaper than new vegas d to coming out first^^
ya i played new vegas, mosy fun ive ever had
bah
Fallout: new jersey
lord, Jersey
fallout new vegas is just the odst of the franchise
ha that would be fun
wont be many changes then
like a brotherhood of steel, or tactics
oh dude i hated halo odst
I liked Odst
what about Fallout: St. Louis?
Is this music part of the game?
its not a numbered game, so its not fallout 4
Yeah, really not to par with the other ones, IMO :3
Odst, that is
like fallout tactics or fallout brotherhood of steel
oh yeah, bunch of bronies started on a complete converdion mod to make fallout 3 into fallout ewuestria
I feel like his ognna use that cannon to shoot at the president..
monsterproject, that one
So who is Wrek allied with?
Fatman? :D
It is rumoured that the next fallout is in Boston
Spademagnes[R]: Yes Man
NCR i thinl
Dark_Horst: no point there's a project where their making an entire new game into F:E
think*
I went the Ncr route
Spademagnes[R] - himself. i believe he's on Yes Man's route
Dark_Horst: no mods it's an entire game
no spoilers
Kakumy: that'S the one
He's gonna shoot him
there we are
A second sniped
Dark_Horst: they still need lots of people dude...
Why u no haz fatman? xD
did he find all threats?
did the picture just freeze for anyone else, or is my computer just crap?
did it just freeze?
*defines
damned chat lag
mine froze too
No
Oh, he's not killing him? :I
It just lost focus
oh nvm
der we go
here we are
I wonder when will the next RPG come out that will feature a whole world, like Earth in FO or Nirn in Skyrim
Suddenly plane
ohai poner pepple
sudden plane entrance :P
otakon17: hey what do you recomend for weapon upgrades? is raw good or what? what should i do?
otakon17 - ZE PLANE, ZE PLANE!
well, elder scrolls online...
Ohai IshGirlfriendlesPony
FIRE ZE MISSILES
why do vertibirds look like falcons out of Halo reach?
Vertibird otakon17
Hallo IshGirlfriendlesPony
because future
ZE MISSILES ARE AWAY!
I am noticing a lack of Fat Man here
Im getting Fallout 3!!!!!!
there we go
I really want a fallout game with the new creation engine, or that's what i THINK its called :S
vertibirds existed before halo
Flyboy: The game was before halo you silly thing.
VinylScrath_wubs: Fallout 4 soon don't bother
VinylScrath_wubs: get new vegas
i will when i get more money
Flyboy: Ahem ''series'' i mean
Bronysith|DnDarksoul: Raw is straight up stength boosts
Get both
ii just wanna play 3 for now
killerpony7733: good point. i geuss its just a good shape
OH HELL YEAH
that's a change
So whats the difference between New Vegas GOTY and Ultimate?
YEAH BOY
Vegas was released in 2008 but who cares still good game
WOW THE MUSIC
How many people has Wrek killed today?
I played this music for arma
Ultimate comes with all DLC
346
from songs written in the 20's to 30's to this
Kakumy: Series started back in the 90's and FO2 had the first vertibird
Then what does GOTY have?
Hallo PillowPoni
All DLC
Spademagnes[R]: all the add ons
killerpony7733: though FO1 and 2 we're 2D
Hallo MLP_Brovakiin
I'm confused
GotY is FO3, Ultimate is FO:NV
Kakumy: *were
dat push
Whoops
Kakumy: werent they like, top down
Kakumy: So? still better then FO3 and to some point FO:NV
Dragonmatte: nope, I think you hear the pings through the stream
Dragonmatte: those are Wrek's pings
Aha
For the type of game it was it was extremely good
Ded
le ded
See?
Well that explains it
Pfft! Everybody knows that Call of Duty is the best game ver made!
what about the bomb?
It's really confusing xD
Oh god
ikr pony_8042
He's gonna shoot him
COD... really...
BIG GUN IS OUT
No competition
Kakumy: joking
Dragonmatte: yes it is
ya i know :P
I dont really like CoD, you die too fast xD
Where is the nuke?
Dat Tesla Cannon
You barely get to play xD
There needs to be a nuke
Or maybe that's because i suck at it xD
I actually like some of the stories...
"Don't mind me, just pointing my giant death gun at your face"
Brb
I might not get BO2..
I probably will
Dragonmatte: also all enemies are wimpy humans :D
By probably, i mean will
CoD has the best graphics and is a realistic representation of real like warfare.
>.>
08,01it's friday night!
not sure if serious
08,01but i'm stuck at work
Graphics dont make the game
why it is
or just troll
Wrek: check the vertibird!
rofl at work on bronystate
OMG! Graphics determine the game!
pony_8042: Do you mean story mode?
Wrek: the engineer might have done something to it
Story mode!? STORY MODE!!?!!?!
Multiplayer is the game!
Flyboy: Oh my god Jc a bomb!
Ok, so he be trollin
giant laser canon is best canon
08,01MirrorImage: no idea; i've been busy this week
08,01you may have noticed i've not been in here much

08,01Kakumy: too long...
Lol

08,01it's 7:45pm
pony_8042: i mean, CoD isn't close at all, in multiplayer, i think :I

08,01MadSurge: yup
pony_8042: I dont think marines run around with knifes and stab 30 people, when they have a rifle :S
cowvarkian: he using the the current best tactic to spark a flame war and twist panties en masse. :D

Spademagnes[R] - What one?

ENGINEER IS SPY
08,01MadSurge: i'm a research intern at St Andrews University too at the moment

Hi Shizuka

He needs to walk away from it too!
killerpony7733 k
lol exploding bullets
WHUT
DaringDerpy: He was breaking a rule. Can i not be friendly enough to tell him that?
Shizuka: that rule is optional actually, but most of the time it is better to look away
Well, it's dangerous to REALLY ignore an explosion. But pretending to ignore it can still be cool.
he needs to walk away faciing the camera in slow motion while he puts on sunglasses with rainbow dash in the background
killerpony7733: calm down :)
nopony knows? well k
nife
DaringDerpy: I'm calm. Please don't assume something i'm not

wut?
omg this is skill right here
/me is trying italics
like that?
DaringDerpy i lol'd so hard :D
DoctoDoctorWho: thumbs up!
/me DoctoDoctorWho is useing italics
Just don't over use it :)
^
/me got banned for that
Brn
Brb
/me thinks the mods were overreacting, but whatever
I am, for one, glad that they enforce the rule
because apparently speaking in the third person whilst using italics is roleplaying
lol
I would not chat here if all I saw was...
/me goes to the market to buy some apples
all the time
That would
Ugh
MLP_Brovakiin: but of course! this is the internet, where everyone is polite and holds to intelligent conversation!
barbetos, what rule?
DoctoDoctorWho: haha
cowvarkian no excessive rping
/me sigh
DoctoDoctorWho but thats another world, where in this world we live with idiots
it gets annoying
....
ok
I have somthing to do in 30 mins :(
wow wrek is awesomw at drawing
ikr?
so i guess speaking in third person somehow is rping
/me having a conversation in italics is okay though
cya later everyone! be back in a few :)
bye Resonant
bye!!

Goodbye Resonantwaves
Back.......<3 Twi
bye Resonantwaves
http://fav.me/d4hn1wm
I liek Deadmau5 :3
/me waves
/me did not know that speaking in italics whilst using third person word things was role playing, but whatever
/me listens to Cha La Head Cha La (Animetal version)
I still wish wrek would do my twiromancer... sigh,
this painting is amazing!
Me too........when i have one
/me thought that role playing was you know.... playing a role
llol
/me the media sells it, and you live the role
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah? and I wish i could find some god damn slime!
Dark92Enigma: If you like DBZ tunes try the ginyu force full theme
wb Dark92Enigma :)
/me wonders if he has heard this song somewhere other then a wrek stream
Dovah: minecraft slime?
I should probably stop "roleplaying" before I get banned again

Invi|colt mostly Analysis , what is in the whater and/or how much of it is in there , not that mushc of actual producing something
Chrysalis: Dat gildash. but yeah the hair was what made me miss guess
yeah, understandable
Lil_B, oh ok. and what ya gona do after the apprentienceship? ^^

Chrysalis it's funny, you look exactly how I pictured wrek, and wrek looks axactly how I pictured you XD
:O
im not sure how to take that
otp
Wrek how should we take that?
Lil_B come over to the surface chemistry side. its really hip nowdays :D
doubtful
Lil_B: I kinda knew how Wrek looked, his OC pony looks a lot like him :D
Chrysalis it's just something I noticed XD not insulting/complimenting anyone
Invi|colt I have no idea honestly ... I wish I could just become a Beamter at our local waterresorvoir and do that for the rest of my live :P
Lil_B, then i would loose all respect I ever had :D
Alchemist what exactly is surface chemistry?
Lil_B, i meant you would loose it ^^
hey guys does anybody know what there showing for movie night
Lil_B, mit Lotus effect unn so zeug. versiegelungen etc glaub ich
dat The_Browncoat
dat TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Lil_B: it deals with dispersions, adsorptions on surfaces, nano technology, optical/electronic properties etc
Invi|colt whats so wrong about beeing a Beatmter XD
so that's how you do it Wrek :P
which program is that?
Hi, good afternoon everyone
Lil_B, yeah, what is so wrong about being one... xD
hi there kirzstryfe and TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
Invi|colt well, I ask you XD why would I loose your respect?
These songs sound really sad :(
Hallo kirzstryfe and TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Lil_B: basically if a system contains small nano scale particles, their surface becomes so soignificant that they will have special properites and thats what we are researching.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Good afternoon!
kirzstryfe seems like adobe ilustrator
Lil_B, well all Beamten i know don't deserve my respect ^^
what program is he using?
That cutie mark
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Applelicious
Alchemist: so it's not just a nick! :D Is your cutie mark a test tube?
Alchemist oh, I think I get it now, I would actually really like to work in research, it's more interesting
I need this program for making things :D
Hai everyone
Does that say appleicious?
Lil_B, because they get money for actually not working. we even have to pay them to make a copy xD
who's streaming?
Madsruge: yes my nick is not a coincidence :d But I dont have an OC though. If I had, I think the for elements would be more fitting.
MuffinNuffin: our mod Wrek is
*four
MuffinNuffin: Hello! Wrek is.
Hai AJIsAwesome
Alchemist: neither do I, so no worries :D
ITs a nice program right Golakka?
Yeah :D
Wrek is le good drawer
so any idea what we're watching tonight
Invi|colt well... that's my goal XD sitting in the lab, watch the PC, make one or 2 tests a week, and stay on bronystate the whole time XD
Lil_B :D but don't start getting greedy like these local idiots ^^
alexxm: Don't spoil
Anyone know what this is?
mitamaking: He was just asking :P
.
mitamaking i didn't know i was asking you guys
MadSurge: It's Wrek drawing.
ya
MuffinNuffin: I know but I want to be surprised
Lil_B: and by making tests you mean you throw the smaple in the IR spectrophotometer, automatic titrator and wait for the comp to spit out the results :D
Invi|colt well, the only thing I could potentionaly take money from you is when you try to get a tour XD otherwise there is nothing there anyway
MuffinNuffin: Yea but if anyone answered, technicly it would be their fault for spoiling it XD
Alchemist yes :P maybe a HPLC too
I don't think we know yet what the movie and episodes will be
oops I replied to myself? LOL
MuffinNuffin: dont worry I speak to myself too sometimes :)
haha

not sure if hurt my foot, or what
MadSurge: Its only like, 500 years old, if that
City Boi! City Boi!
MadSurge yes XD I hope they have enough reference pics to recreate it XD
and then mute was hit
ikr
cowvarkian: it's still pretty old
not ancient though
ancient is cave paintings
Man in 5th grade I still remember how ugly my literacy teacher was, she was llike Nikki Minaj and Ke$ha had a baby o.o

VinylScrath_wubs: aw :D
VinylScrath_wubs: I wonder what your cutie mark would be, a messed up drawing?
yes

I think I would be a cmc....
or just a nerd
I'm good at that
I dont rly know what my talent is XD Im good at drawing in real but im not a pro at it.
I think we've already debated the cutie mark mechanics in here at least once.

05,15I'm snappy the small crocodile
Fl00tersh41: Even though Malfoy was given ample warning to not anger the thing, he did it anyway because he's Malfoy. Now that it attacked him, he got his father involved in it. And the Minister of Magic.

Riders: It's a secret to everybody
by super mega bitch
Silverscreen: lol
Fl00tersh41: I'm not saying that but Malfoy was told by Hagrid himself to not antagonize Buckbeak. If he had listened and not been his usual smart-assed self Buckbeat wouldn't be getting executed
right over the head
animal crossing isnt that coming on 3ds
Pudge: since 2008

Atlas Shrugged raises some very good points

Shizuka: aww but then Meanwhile wouldn't get to see it
13fluttercry: there's a series of youtube videos reading the speech at normal speed... it's still like five hours
PillowPoni: It's not the fault of the child who got mauled, it's the teachers responsibility
and instead of pony eps we are going to watch telletubbies
Quick_Thinker, really i rather liked that book
nice filters
13skip past galt's speech when you get bored of it, but the rest of the book is quite solid
omg wdf is this fuckness
Pudge: Enough! NO
Fl00tersh41: sounds legit
pudge What!?!
I'm so evillll!
>one speech
Did i heard " Mustard" ?
my smokes...could you had them to me harry?
>5 hours
wuuuut
Fl00tersh41: Yet Dumbledore allowed this, considering the kind of creatures Hagrid deals with.
Fl00tersh41: Well the ass decided to annoy the thing even though Haggrid said NOT to get near it
Atlas Shrugged is a decent book, but isn´t the best illustration of Objectivism, even if its held up as such, We the People or The Fountainhead is better in that regard. But the movie was pretty meh.
05,15lol. Now I actually want to do that.

troll dumbledoor
He like's dick's that's for sure...
7 not
Rowling is a sadist
SeaponiesofLiverpool: you already sais that :)
13unless dumbledore can sense stable time loops, he had this planned very early on
Maybe he just hates gingers
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Every book has Harry fainting.:D
13what with stalling the executioner
that's true
Muffins! :P
Gud luck
muffins?6_9
Maybe it's Maybelline
what if dumbledore is the doctor?

welcome back Bronysith :)
oh God masturbation
Lol
lol Bronyshit
05,15So how come they never use the time turner again?
13MYST REFERENCE
Is dark sould out on PC yet?
Hermoany
13mein heart~<3
muffins pwns cupcakes
fluttercry time laws
also
so much fail on my part
I love Myst
Dr Whooves got involved
it's handled to mcgonnagal in the end, and they break all the other ones in the 5th movie
fluttercry: Because that would make the story too easy
A lot can go wrong when you time travel
fluttercry: look at the HISHE
05,15But it's so usefull....they could just go back and fix ANY mistake
:D
fluttercry: because the writers were too stupid to write it in the script again :D
Hermoine: Dave Strider's mom
00,10lol
FIRST
13fluttercry: part of it is that it creates stable time loops
Chrysalis well David tenant did appear in the next movie
Crow knows all about time travel
fluttercry: Paradoxes?
whats with the narrator dude
the timeturners got destroyed when the death eaters attacked the ministry
good punch
thanks
13so the fact that [insert event we're supposed to fix] happened means that no time travel was used
but fluttercry, what if you go back in time to kill yourself before you go bacck in time?
How did she not cause any time paradoxes using this?
fluttercry, go back and smother child voldemort with a pillow
Spademagnes[R]: IKR?:D
13since you'll notice the first time we saw this scene, you don't ACTUALLY see the executioner behead buckbeak
i like how you can hear the stop watch still ticking
00,10still say she should be 3 years older
Spademagnes[R]: magic :)
05,15oh yeah...
What is a stable time loop?
too time philosophy here
Becuase it would make the rest of the movie's pointless.
How Harry Potter 7 should have ended
That's probably why they don't have time travel after this
fluttercry: oh and if they went back to when voldermort attacked Harry they would have to wait years to get back to their time :P
05,15Only a few more movies Sumica
buckbeak
http://cheezburger.com/6529757184 BANE as a TSA agent
fluttercry: Go back and beat up Voldemort while he was still a little kid?
Shizuka yup, you just hear the THUD of the axe hittin the fence
00,10no i meen she is liveing every day like 3 times
13a stable time loop is one theory of time travel where all travel takes place in, and modifies, the same universe timeline
Snape already did it
great pumpkin :D
i hope the executioner paid for that damage
why did they never use timeturners to go back in time and kill voldemort when he wasn't as powerful
Hello Phase4
Sumica: yeah that's why she's so haggard this term
heloooooooooooo
So the event that changes wont cause a paradox?
13we see harry get hit with a rock and the executioner hit something, and hear someone go awooooooo later
Charlie Brown reference <3
00,02morning
alexxm: plot convinience
alexxm: Paradox?
13we find that harry and hermione traveled back in time to cause those events
Mornin' Phase4
hi Phase4 :)
SPOILER ALERT
13because things progressed relatively safely, there's only one timeline
Heya Phase4
How did she not fuck up reality at this point?
dat snail
Hallo Phase4
hi Phase4
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYWT5Q_R_w see?
oh
Spademagnes[R]: I'm sure McGonagall and Dumbledore warned her of the risks
It got felt across time
that hurt
SeaponiesofLiverpool: no video links please
13Spademagnes[R]: that's part of what makes it a stable time loop, if they had done something that prevents them from later time travelling (say, killing themselves), then you'd have a problem
Snape went back in time at the end of #7 and killd Voldemort
so the executioner hit harry with a rock and he went "awooooooo" ?
THE POWER OF TIME TRAVEL
otakon: my brain hurts now
Spademagnes[R] no its the power of love
is he a final fantasy villain?
13but because they do things in such a way that past!Harry and past!Hermione safely get to the hospital wing and can travel, the loop is stable
lol
God this is more convoluted than Sonic 06 time travel, but thats just me talking out of my ass...
Threshexcutioner
Just assume things happen as they happen
00,10is my ass realy that big?
stable loops are no fun, no universal implosion, no time rifts, pfft
ths JOJ
13compare back to the future where every time travel backwards creates a new universe and timeline
Sumica: yes
CAW!
Hermoine knows what's going on
caws everywhere
!
Shizuka: i call that the multiverse :)
crows
So what movie is playing tonight?
So a stable time loop is changes in the past that doesnt affect the timeline too much
Matt: we dont know
So basically Snake in Metal Gear 4
13there, because old!Biff takes grey's almanac back, and marty and doc are travelers, they're all shunted sideways into 1985A for evil biff, and can go back to correct it
Shizuka: but what about when Hermonie goes back in time to get to class and such?
in b4 hackers
Sergio_Scriptor: do you know which movie it's coming tonight?
13when really they're just making more timelines
Solid Snake with arthritis and a bad back... :)
ni snake in mgs1
tom servo .... CROWS
must have stable time loops or dead daves start piling up
Count-Bleck: nope
13for hermione, she's been leaving stable time loops all over the place this year
dead daves are the enemy
a stable time loop is one where whatever you do has already been done by you, so your actions have absolutely no effect on the timeline
Shizuka: eeyup
Sergio_Scriptor: Will you stay here for the movie?
DEAD FERRET!
Lol
Count-Bleck: of course :)
yummy
Except for the first time you did them
kirzstryfe: Thanks for clarifying that.
just so she could all those classes
Spademagnes[R]: So she could take a few extra classes
13she's present for some class, then appears in the other classes, and since she never encounters herself and doesn't do any interference, the loops are stable and she exists in both places at once
ferrety
Dubbletroll
shenanigans
05,15Shizuka you think these things out don't you?
13ron notices her every single time, with his "did you see her come in" lines over the course of the film
ah the smell of time travel
Terezidore?
fluttercry: she is all knowing
Shizuka: but then wouldnt theyre be three of her then?
but Slowter, if it's a stable time loop, there is no first time, because you already did what you needed to do when you did it, or there'd be no loop for you to not change in the first place
but dont they have to do all this stuff for them to go back in time in the fisrt place
SO MUCH TIME PHILOSOPHY
That hurts my brain kirzstryfe
Meanwhile
^_^
a large brandy
wow an advert of a dating sight poped up
Dumbletroll
glad to help
nice tits
13Major: at a given time yes, but the duplicates then end up traveling backwards until finally just one of her leaves the loop and continues forward in time
Sergio_Scriptor: Will you go to facebook?
Meanwhile
hiya kirzstryfe
screw time
Dumbledore like to get his Drunk on
Count-Bleck: probably not :\
dead daves are the enemy
So how does she avoid running into herself all this time?
/me glomps into kirzstryfe
smashing pumpkins
PUMKIN IS DED
>_>
Shizuka: so this is pretty much a giant loop?
GET TO KILLING HITLER!
Just as I said that, he goes offline on Skype.
05,15haha
That pumpkin wont be hungry anymore
She plan's out her route's
Lets kill hitler!
Hoofler
shes only one day in time she probely remembers where shes been
:D dat doctor reference
That pumpkin was 2 weeks from retirement......:'(
Howlmoine

"Shut up hitler"
13Major: eeyup
Willowshy!
ima take a piss on fluttertree
Baaaaaaaaaaatsssss
Major can I have some candy?
XD!
WE WILL KILL YOU IF YOU DO PONYSTATION
Shizuka: so this will go on for the rest of time....
PonyStationVita: :S
otakon: wouldn't work
Malk: arnt you candy?
HOWLmoine
Major no
Spectrum_Rush: why not?
Hi :)
It was earth all the time
hi MaxTheBrony :)
It's simple, we KILL Hitler
Weatch

MaxTheBrony: Hello!:)
Malk: well I aint got any :P
Monie Monie ride the Ponie
hi MaxTheBrony :)
Harry goes back in time
Hello MaxTheBrony

Time shenanigans
this witch has WATCH OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Chaos control!
WIATCH!
hai MaxTheBrony
xD
No chaos swiss roll!
definitly getting better at my puns
Heya Sergio_Scriptor AJIsAwesome AdamTheDuck thelonepony :)
13Major: basically picture time as a literal line, you have original harry and hermione from all history, they enter the loop as hermione decks malfoy
Harry is his own dad.... I sense time travel shenanigans
05,15also I believe the year at this time is 1995
otakon: ssimple, killing Hitler makes him a Matyr
Major why not? everyone should have candy in their back pockets just incase
i wish i had Chaos Swiss Roll
Spectrum_Rush: not if you do it BEFORE his rise to power...like say when he's 10
13after aaaall the stuff, harry and hermione A travel back in time to form harry and hermione B, existing in the line with harry and hermione A
Undivided flavour
HOWLmoine
Malk: but we dont wear pants....
wheres shadow when need a swiss roll
So that was that noise
00,02i wonder if wizards have ever gone to space
otakon: you could also killing him while he was at world war 1 :P
SPAAAACCCCEE
but HP5 had flat screens, 00's style clothes and such
13they do this stuff and get back to the hospital wing just as harry and hermione A travel back
Shizuka: Ill just refer to Back to the Future logic :D
THIS IS SO CONVOLUTED
otakon: theres still repercussions that can come up
no they just die
Sergio_Scriptor: no, he can fight back better then
13harry and hermione B (though really they're all the same) continue time forever
oh great scoot
Major ok if we dont wear pants and dont have pockets where do we put our wallets?
buffering
Hamhock. o.o
So what happens to the duplicate ones?
Malk: um....Magic *snort* *snort*
behind you
\:3/
i was pretty sure time was more wibbley wobbly timey wimey.....
Heya SuperBrony64 :D
The original ones go back in time, the others go forward
13the duplicates (in this case, the harry and hermione in hagrid's hut) are running around the forest right now trying to find sirius
Well Major I think we both know where we put it
SuperBrony64: Cousin! =D
BRAH
Malk: We pull a Sonic 06.
Doctor Who would be pissed with all this time travel
Hai :D
Time Traveling Gilda
So much time philosophy
Ohai SuperBrony64
13eventually they'll find him, we fade to black and they're in the hospital, then travel back to become these two
/me goes back in time and encourages hitler to persue his artist carrear instead of going into politics
Hai SuperBrony64
Spademagnes[R]: he'd be like "YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG!
dementors
This is a very simple time travel plot
Hey SuperBrony64 :)
Dat nekkid SuperBrony64
GarrettBrony: that could work
IT'S THE LAUNDRY !
SuperBrony64: why arnt you wearing clothes? @////@
inb4 Patronus
Its him
Is this the movie where the wizard meets the lion and some witch in a closet of some sort?
otakon then I wouldn't have to kill him
SuperBrony64, why are you naked??
SuperBrony64: Wrong movie btw
GarrettBrony: true
and the toothpaste is the patronus
Ginger-vitus? *me uses this later as an insult*
is he getting his memory sucked out since they both feel pain at the same time
SuperBrony64: :P you so derpy
SuperBrony64: You so silly :D
PillowPoni|Cooking: Cause i liek nekkid :3c
Harry sure does want his dad to come alot
:S
HERE IT COMES, GUYS
:D
CALLED IT
hiya SuperBrony64 ...why are you nekkid?
EXPECTO PATRONUUUM
Dat music
WANDY LIGHT THING!!!
SuperBrony64: wow lol
KAMEHAMEHA
BANKAI
13the whole "i saw my dad" thing harry does doesn't work well in the movie
WANDY LIGHT THING
And awesome soundtrack song
;D
otakon: Becuz he likes being nekkid
:D
:O
Shizuka: enope it doesn't
MARRY STOP FLASHING YOURSELF
13since we can't even see who it is, much less make the jump to assume it's his dad
HADOUKEN
Bedknobs and Broomsticks
*HArry
Spectrum_Rush dont you want your dad to come alot?
Shizuka: rarely anything works in the movie
can we watch that?
discordo applonum
Dracorum satus D... awesome Bedknobs and brromsticks reference
Hello everyone
Shizu: Not to mention that the stag isn't visible at all the second time. >_>
im surprised no one did that retarded shout thing
hi Thrackerzod
DAT COSTCO JOKE
LOL radiation burns
Hello Thrackerzod
Hi Thrackerzod
Thrackerzod: Hello!
caps
Wait so how the hell did he get here to begin with?
/me wraps a towel around SuperBrony64 while giving him a hug and a filly Fluttershy
Harry used Flash...it's very effective!
so when harry A passout does harry B as well?
so what movie at 7?
LED is the way to go
Hi Thrackerzod
There's no way Harry shouldn't have been able to see himself from that distance across a small pond. >_>
ha yah Thrackerzod
They'll return, and in greater numbers
can we have another Rifftraxs one?
Malk: MY DAD IS DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me smacks Malk
MY DAD IS ME?
Hello Thrackerzod
00,10time loops how do they work.
He's not really that bumbed that his dad is still dead
Harry ....and his mom?
How did nobody hear their screaming?
oh great scott
Sumica: like magnets
1,11BOMBARDA!
So he saw himself, does that mean he broke the space time continum thingy?
PillowPoni|Cooking: magic :)
KA-BOOM
PillowPoni|Cooking: bc of the Dementors
1,11Fuck other college students. The fire alarm went off again. -_-
Not so Flutter_Shy, because he thought he saw his father
Flutter_Shy: He didn't know it was himself
wut movie?
oh hi Trackerzod how is being a regualt pony?
OMG SIRIUS BLACK VERSION
Sumica: reffer to Back To The Future :D
So thet way these stable time loops work, you could learn a powerful time traveling spell from your future self?
yeh haa
Flutter_Shy: It only breaks if the past sees the future.
Silverscreen: not good
in an alt. timeline Harry and Hermoine are Harry's parents
/me shudders
Spectrum_Rush so is harries
13Major: well see back to the future has no loops
okay brb gotta feed the pooch
my eyes
SeaponiesofLiverpool: :O
great scott
00,10but how did harry from the future save harry from the past from death.
And latter you just go back in time and teach yourself the time traveling spell
just like Naruto is his own dad
Harry...will you do me the honor of marrying me?
Sergio_Scriptor: I think I'll go now
Sumica: Thats a good point
Malk: and does that make it better?, let me answer that... NO!!!!!!!!
The spell you learned from your future self...
13it's entirely new universes coming into being, original!Marty, Doc, Jennifer, and Einstein just get carried through the new universes because of the ripple effect and they are travelers
Shizuki except for loop holes
Count-Bleck: ok,see you tomorow :)
I thought Tobi was Naruto's dad
How the hell did Harry get saved from him self before he went back in time?
lol to the commentator
what movie at 7?
When did Hagrid lose all that weight?
Tovler: FOOL even i know that narutos dad is the 4th hokage
Spademagnes[R]: it's a paradox
Yeah, but technically he realises he saw himself, so even though it wasn't immediate he still saw himself
Spademagnes[R]: Don't think about it
Hello, SuperBrony64!
13HI HO BUTTSTEAK, AWAAAAAAY!
Loops break when you do it
Spademagnes[R]: it's a paradox,and a time loop
Hai AJIsAwesome :D
Naruto time travels and becomes his dad
Uuuuh, gotta go to bed... will you guys repeat the mystery movies tomorrow?
Shizuka: every possible outcome and scenerio exists
I am so confused
ahem
ikr
13Spademagnes[R]: that's why it's a stable time loop, timetraveler!Harry was there from the start, that's what makes it a loop
MadSurge: Hey ^^
dead ferrets
This is more convoluted than Sonic 06
MadSurge: well bye Surge,also i think not :\
And we NEVER see BuckBeak again! :D
Chrono Trigger...the movie?
I'll be waiting for the couple boning in the creditgs
but its no use!
SuperBrony64: wat?
imax shot
Bronysith: Super Nintendo o3o
00,10but how did the loop start.
13see and there go harry and hermione A
I'll bbl ^-^
did waht?
Nawww, Dumbledore isn't creepy at all
13harry and hermione B have completed their mission and will continue in time from here
MadSurge: <---- SnowyFluttershy
did wat
it never started and it will never end
And so reality exploded
Dumbletroll
Sumica: it didn't it's a time loop :|
We teleported Ron
13the thing about stable time loops is they don't start
lol if its Mortal Kombat ill do a shit fatility
Fucking trolls
/me DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE A HEADACHE AT THIS POINT?
Shizuka: They never end?
You cruel idiot
13it's not like BTTF where everything starts with marty screwing up his parents' meeting
Rofl :D
00,10ron you are a wizzard and you are freaked out by teliportation.
13the loop will always exist at that point
Satan's birthday! :D
lupin's quitting
I AM A LAMPOST
:D
none
Shizuka: So the only way they wouldn't completed their mission is if they went back in time again?
did i heard "sacked" ?
*wouldn't have*
whatever happened to Percy?
13if harry and hermione B had gone back in time again, *eventually* they would catch up to where harry and hermione A left
Hello, everyone
in the movies
1,11Lupin's great werewolf sack.
hi Reactor :)
Sergio_Scriptor: BloomxTiara if you know what I mean
13it's called The Long Path
Reactor: Hello!
so you are pretty bright then Flutter_shy?
hi Reactor
lupin is best DADA professor
Lolwut
He's being fired? Just beause he turns into a murderous monster once per month?
?
Hey Reactor how are you?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: He went on to star in his own movie in which his father was Zeus and kind of a dick
Shizuka: So the loop continues forever?
13you can jump back in time to any point, but you can only go into the future at a rate of one second per second
I'm doing great!
Count-Bleck: i know :)
wizard = need wands..... Sorceror = no wands
00,10there is a PMS joke there Fl00tersh41
Sorcerors > Wizards
Sergio_Scriptor: litter
Shizuka: Where are you gettikng this information?
Sumica: That too
sorcerors mean inherent magic

Lol Sumica
Lupin :'(
Walk him :D

hey hey hey. Don't sweep my shed
Fez_Quick_Thinker: he is is seriously?

Hello Michael

Rat race is pretty good mive...
EXPECTRO PATRONUM/10
00,02i want to read a book where wizards go to space
1,11I'd like to think that sorcerors DO exist in the world of Harry Potter. They can perform the exact same magic, but they're much, much less powerful than wizards since they don't have a magical element to aid them.

13to everyone else, there's only one version of the timeline
Time Travel Logic is confusing/10
13for harry and hermione, they do a loop
since we nvr see her do magic....is Sweety bell a squib?

08,01hello, everypony!
this wasnt the movie
05,15AlienWarhead this wasn't the movie
it's not the movie
hugs are awesome :3
00,10it convenatly skips the harry dieing part Shizuka
08,01i shall be joining you all for BMN tonight!
Yay
08,01for the first time in AGES
Shizuka: Why try to make so much sense out of it? It's just a movie...
1,11Either that or sorcerors are actually wizards that have a talent for doing magic without a wand.
13because time travel
08,01because i'm stuck at work while i bring some nodes up
13the best fiction is the fiction that's internally consistent
08,01Shizuka: like Past Sins!
/me 08,01runs
ello everypony :)
try and look for the couple boning at the corner
00,02XD
Shizuka: did you see the cutie mark crusaders together in the pilot?
Major I am not a snowglobe!
08,01it's 11:40pm for me right now, and i'm still at work
13or say mass effect, everything is derived from "here is a thing that, given a charge, changes mass within a field"
yes just in time for the rifftrax credits :P
All we're missing is Nittany_Discord and the circle is complete.
08,01Chrysalis: because servers
One thing that all ways bugged me in the Potter movies, mind control
Shizuka: Even so, if you have made sense of something fictional, and it's internally consistent, you just ruined countless movie's or show's.
00,02Shizuka, to be fair that would break physics prety througherly
oy Chrysalis how are you? forgot to say hi today
Don't forget SuperBrony64
13well yes
And SuperBrony64.
They have a forbidden spell that can do this
what movie at 7?
Fl00tersh41: what do you mean ?
screw physics
Bronysith im pretty good, still feelin wierd bout the move
It's 23:43 here
but im here in manchester now :D
time travel alone breaks reality
But they also teach school children to make potions that do similar things
00,10says the guy who uses 50 fins on a rocket in place of a parachute Phase4
00,02heck, if we had 'eee-zooo' we'd be in space right now

hai PaladinDrakkenwolf
00,02Sumica, worked didnt it
Hey PaladinDrakkenwolf
13take The Core for instance, unobtanium converts heat/pressure into electrical energy, except that would mean they'd burn through their coolant damn fast because the heat can't go anywhere but into the shell
i'm the only one with no idea what movies are to be show today ?
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Hello!:)
OH GOD I MISSED ANOTHER RIFFTRAX??!!!!
sumica what movies tonight
fair enough
PaladinDrakkenwolf: yeeea XD
So what is the wizard worlds position on using mind altering magic on others without their consent?
05,15It's a mystery
13ignore the part about stopping the core of the earth, even the most basic macguffin in that film was broken
05,15on purpose
what's the movie?
PaladinDrakkenwolf: Yeah....
we canz have more rifftraxs?
00,10wait and see
up next?
13here, the time travel is consistent
Shizuka depends how quick it absorbs heat
riiiiiight
NEIN
tell us
Sumica: no. the movie is [bronystate gold] remember?
05,15<.<
patience people
08,01so what are we watching this week?
/me hugs fluttercry <3
13well they're down there for hours and hours

00,02Shizuka, or the part where there's no energy in static preasure
08,01because i'm too lazy to check
13that too
But... IT'S A MOVIE!!! :(
