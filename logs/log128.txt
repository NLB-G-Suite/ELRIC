Why not?
Zoom, enhance. That cracks me every time

Welcome to 80s cyberpunk
how did he do that then/
?
I'm sort of surprised "yay" isn't registered.
Yes.
yeah, but it was supposed to be ambiguous, and the director felt that it suggested him being a replicant too heavily
see the blade runner curse
Polaroids are classics.

Snake? What's going on? Snake! SNAKE! SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!

Saaaake?
LIQUIIIIIID
I KNOW RIGHT
I think the fact that she can talk to OWL should not be ambiguous. It should be left up to the reader to decide if she's crazy or not. Spike certainly wouldn't accept that she could.
This is LITTLE INDIA, kinda
INCOMING JAI HO
Ghehe, that's fair.
X3
Why'd it have to be snakes?

i was thinking of that joke during the zoom in scene

Mane6 stream had +1k
I actually haven't watched the movie
Actually, this came out either just before or round about the same time as Tron
Later
I was going to make a smartass comment about ships
Let's see if we can break that
Everytown is chinatown
well, a good pony
(with respect, of course)
it's over 500!!!
all I know is that this is cool looking
Has anyone in a film ever said: "I don't know him?" and has actually been telling the truth?

gingerbrony666: Yes. I don't know much about celebrities and whatnot, I only know like the most famous ones. lol
I used to hate the concept of shipping. Then these damn fanartists made me go "D'aww".
It's not cyberpunk without drugs in a dystotopic city

Lady Gaga would NOT wear that
Called "that gun"
Some time after this one I think
get outta the way sirry chinese people

sklar/join#lobby
SHEPARD
how do you go to over rooms?
It's like the cars are going ... nowhere at all.
and the author achieves it with maestry
^
Nowhere at all.

Bloodsplatter
Such terrible aim.

Sad music is sad
Boom Headshot
That'd be sensible lastone.

Drakengarde: she does that because "that's how it is"
I like it
DO A BAREL ROLL
except her
Anyone here read spiderses yet?
would be way more blood
She sorta did Drankengarde, but she didn't realize it was wrong. She thought it was just something she had to do and people onjoyed it. Although that slipped near the end.
dramatic gun shot
POW
ouuch
POW
its the future lol
Blodd?
Moar glass.
similar to Feeling Pinkie Keen, she won't explain it
POW
That's why you should just wear normal clothes
no one minds
And she's still runnnin
*Blood
it's interesting, but seems difficult to do properly.
that's actually a near impossible shot
PCHOO
Slow motion escape.
Huh.
ooh watcha saaaaaaaaaaaay
the blood shows up well in the plastic
Oh
spiderses is awesome
I listened to the dramatic reading of Spiderses. Priceless
Time for the Explaination of the placement curse!
How is she still running?
glass everywhere
and that is a gigantic point on it
PEW
Is this Battlefield Earth?
He is? Oh snap. Let him know that I got my stream working.
XD this movie is ridiculous
Hey, sorakey
Well, like I said, I never actually read the fic

Three plains of glass and two bullet wounds finally took her down
oh
bitch got shot
Why not?
"Grimdark as FUCK"
High constitution modifier
it was awesome!
She's one of the replicants he's looking for
Hi!

You guys know me?
Yes this movie is weird, but it was hot s**t back in the day.
Please don't mention food, I'm far more hungry than I should be right now
she was a filthy replicant
Pretty accurate
05nope, hai
Why did he kill her, anyway?
he forgot to teabag the body
lol
Snatcher
I guess
Was there any reason to?
Blade Runner
blade runner
or
LOL
Spiderses
IMO best fic is Past Sins
And no one give's a f***
I am asking to have spider sex with you twilight
she's already wrapped up in the bodybag and everything
rape?
All the takeaways are closed over here, and I'm outta snacks.

not evil, just misunderstood
they make the murder victim package themselves
05what a sahme
05shame*
altho I havent read that many fics
:P
There are all the people!
What's even funnier is now every PieDash ship out there references it somehow. Pinkie has a bad dream, Rainbow freaks out thinking Pinkie would hutr her, etc etc
lol
MOVE ON
move on, move on...
MOVEON
was wondering why he blew her away
okay it works now
move on or get shot
MOVEON
move on, move on, move on
Um, I'd just like to inform the mods that the links in the theater to the rooms didn't work for me, and I had to manually add "applejack" to the URL to get in here
Move On
MOVEON
Move on
Well, for one, she tried to kill him
I guess he has a license to kill
everything is in working order
NOTHING TO SEE HERE FOLKS!
move on... move on... right.
Such an awkward movie.
she clicked the wrong Aug
or just hosed down
because its plastic
yes it was good
Eh, yeah, DaveKenroy. It's kind of a hard subject to get away from.
its LA
move on...move on...move on...
nothing to see here
Also, more product placement :)
omg that'd hilarious
EYEPATCH
...
not disturbing at all
well good plot i guess
Live on!
yeah but this looks more like deus ex 1
not NY
13lol
Eyepatch, ahoy!
05I shouldnt have to tell you not to skeep saying move on right? RIGHT?
lol
It's the equivalent of the "Human Centipede".
plot twist
Budweiser tastes like the sweat on the floor of a changing room.

Heh.

Haven't read many other fics though
SOMETIMES I THROW UP
skinjob
haven't read that one
Oh yeah
But why is that a reason to kill her? Isn't he a cop?
>No Narrative
He was just called a skinjob...
Just to know
I'd like to watch the stream in HQ, if I keep getting the time out is there any way for me to or am I stuck on LQ?
Taking out the voiceovers is pretty much the best thing about the recut
9yeah I know
I like his hat
should have played that
I still laugh whenever I think of it
Get to tha choppah....?
OH
I'm not entirely certain whats happening in the movie
the author put a lot of time into it
i have never had an apple fritter
that's essentially my goal. to highlight the ...less than savory things some people have come up with related to ponies. The only thing I'm not touching on is clopfics, because I would never be able to write anything of the sort without just outright hating myself
OOPS
maybe
how do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?
might try one
Webpage is not available on player
There's four skin jobs?
halp pl0x
What's this?

HQ doesn't work for me either

No, you certainly should have clop-fics have an effect. But only in a humorous way. It's perfectly possible to have sexual tension without anything explicit happening, or even questionable.

Has she ever heard of overpenetration?
Rarity is best marshmellow.
mib_eyn0hr Haha, that was simple. Thanks
This reminds me a bit of Die Hard movies...
"Whens my birthday? you forgot again! didn't you!?" PUNCH
Aye
Sure..democracy...democracy which was set up by the tyrant Celestia!
I had to look away for a couple of seconds
streams not working for me
And to think that's her INDOOR coat.
0I HAD FIGURED THIS OUT BY NOW
@magneto you did this didn't you
I used to like Fluttershy
:P
Though I just had an interesting thought.
I actually had adrenaline rushes reading it
>_>
07Combustiblelemons which site are you at?
Is it bad that I always read Boom, headshot in the Sniper's voice?
and now I'm out of popcorn...
season two is just around the corner!!
But then I realized Apple Bloom was far cuter.
Braver.
Celestia isn't a tyrant. Luna is just a jealous bitch.
Glad to know it's not just me :p
And everything.
Ponified version of Coupling?
When Bridge to TeraBithya came out
That kid Jesse
2,14 lol...whatever you do...DON'T share it with me :P

Celestia is still a douche.
0and the ponies begin
Shit, I forgot to make popcorn

Excuse me but I am clearly the best pony.
Also, Luna tried to kill every living thing. she deserved more than just imprisonment on the moon.
in the futrue is everything metal?
ut,who would Frank-N-Furter be?
I want someone to write a fic where they are both eveil ( :
Blade Runner has about 50 minutes left i think
:(
2 hrs
How do I join a specific room, like fluttershy/etc?
Did anyone put the "No wars over leaders in the theater" sign at the entrance?
This is Blade Runner?
LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY..........
Luna is of course, in this context, quite the evil pony.
Cry me a river Celestia.
damn!
It's a comedy
I think fluttershy should rule equestria
SirDerpsalot: Yup.
more blood spray from a headshot
about 87 hours left of the movie
Yuck.
No, I'm the best pony.
That women looks menacing for some reason
that was remarkably clean
SirDerpsalot: Yup.
Mmm, my Finger is tasty
I prefer comedy or normal stories :P
2019

Hello everypony

Celestia < Magneto.
Does anyone have mindbleach handy?
OH FUCK WE BROKE #))
Next up is My Little Pony The Movie
Don't wanna know.
Rarity is best everyone knows that, why is it evena discussion
Best normal fic ever

Fluttershy

"We've evolved higher than we were one second before! With each step we move farther! THAT is how a Unicorn works!"

If I may ask, do we have a specific time for season 2 airing?
07indeed

Ooooh, plot twist

I've never been able to get through the G1 movie all the way
RANDOM JAZZ?
I saw some G1, it's actually alright
No problem.
"Who the pony do you think I AM!?"
Saw G1 as a kid, hated it

Not that I've tried particularly hard
Crap, gotta wake up early >.>
Ooh splendid, thank you.
Dat chest hair
Use /me (message)
When did the future in Back to the Future take place?
its g3
...uh...what is that Central?
SON OF A B****!
the waiting is killing me!
Scootalo is the best dodo too.
lol
It's certainly not as bad as G3
i watched a commentary of it
I.e. /me is getting a drink, would lead to:
"I have to kill all the cyborgs!" but decard, you are the cyborg" and then decard was a cyborg.
it'S G1
0Its...a little sad at the end...
If anything, she might appear once.
/me is getting a drink
Wait, do I hear sax?
Dat old photos
wow that's kind of amazing
2015
2015
any pony before g4 is bad
I suck at figuring out time zones
i like it
:O
Celestia is always lame.
ahh cool
When is Season 1 starting
That's really all I expect
525
G4 is FiM
dat music lol
it is decided, veemi just hates me
also G1 has some pretty awesome villains
Everything went to shit in four years apparently
wow
In one month's time.
I work at 9:30 but I think I can watch the stream on my phone
TaraStrong: when the movies are done
If only we could link things,I could show you a picture of real chest hair!

SILVERMANE ISN'T THERE

6Marethon begins at 11PM EST

The first 2 RE movies were OK
0that one was cool
@cbpony9001 agree
How far are we into the movie?
13Itd be really awesoem if they took my name for her and used it in S2. lol
how much longer is this?
/me 11knew about /me
This movie has more twists and turns than... I dunno.
ty
can someone get me into the dash channel please
G1 is ok IMO, everything after that till G4 was pretty meh though
I'm still hoping Luna was corrupted by an outside force...John de Lancie for example
I'm interested.
HUSH NOW QUIET NOW
TaraStrong: the other movie is actually bearable
far
~13 Hours until S2
i saw that
50mins
don't mention it again
hahahah XD
G3.5...*shudder*
They're making self tying shoes
I done told you, it's rade blunner.
haha isnt there going to be more derpy?
But they showed up in tons of episodes.
*shoes
I doubt she'll even have a role other than maybe show up in a scene.
G3 was terrible IMO
Celestia, knows twilight has five friends...
Derpy won't speak
Starring Rainbow Dash, the stupid, selfish vain pro-segregationist.
wut
Blade Runner is 113 minutes
The RE movies were watchable, but I wouldn't say they were good
Look it up, Nike got the patent in 2009
What's wrong with you?
@kinggummy341 get out
sends her two tickets
Someone needs to put that saxophone out of its misery.
She'll play a 'Where's Waldo' role.
the res evil franchise has gone downhill in the last few years :(
on a scale of one to five I'd give this women a 3
yeah, i heard you're supposed to ignore G3
Everypony, favorite pony quote?
oh great now I need brain bleach
We're about 70 minuites in

/me hugs back
KingGummy34: That's not appropriate...

Aaaah Blade Runner is such a good movie
Hush now quite no-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

We lost people :(
Pinkie Pie is best pony.

Pinkie is frigin boss ok?
Everyone knows that unicorns belong in Unicornia
I think RE gave up on being a horror series years ago. Now it's more action-y.
Or, y'know Dash, being able to create bacteria
waiting to see that in season 2
Technically.
Not in OUR back yard!
Haven't seen that one

that Celestia doesn't deserver the hate at all. They know the difference between Canon and Fanon, and they know the facts that Luna did try to kill everything.
the music just got reaaaaally creepy
NECKSNAP
i agree
I think that it might be mispronounced in the episode, but as long as it's consistent you can't really call a name mispronounced.
Why these androids have grammar bad?
0I THINK...THEREFOR I AM

But seriously, hope you're okay.

it's pretty boring
how was it?
Coca Cola!
with something like 32 people

These characters in particular are replicants, which Deckard is supposed to kill because... well, that's just his job. These replicants are especially bad because they've become self-aware

There's a scafolding at the top of the building
he dropped it a while back
*could
He lost it
he's about to die because his makes made him die 4 years after creation
Oh, unicycle, whoops.

he isn't sacry enough
it's about 100 mins into the movie
oh SNAP!
Where are you going?

He just wants to be like spiderman
MuNova, i wasn't aware we were having 'that' kind of convo.
WHAT'S IN THE BAG
There has GOT to be a more practical way for him to get around

I'm going to stop talking now.

Shit, I was waiting until he actually said that line

Story tiem!
Use www.bronystate.net

G1 and G4 are the best in my opinion

Time to die.
Anyone else here participate in MLP-ATG-Alumni?
G4 > G1 > G3.5
yeah that's probably the reason
That is all
Die already.

Spiderses was great because it summed up all the worst parts of FiM fanfics in one neat package
Ponies can make anything happen
OH SNAP

dat symbolism!
*cries*
Thunder_Dash has it right
twilight>g3
0SYMBOLISM!
0sux for Roy
Well, that was anticlimactic.
Just kinda. . .showing up. . .whenever he wants to mess with the ponies.
Did he died.
SYMBOLISM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
symbolism
He's a replicant, designed for slave labor off-world. Ones that come back to Earth are hunted down and killed by cops called Blade Runners.
DED!
Everything in existence > G3.5
SYMBOLISM!
11Did he died?
hey look, the atmosphere
wtf just happened
I watched the pilot two or three weeks before the finale, but my headphones broke and I wasn't going to watch it without them
Well
Epic
Dramatic villain monologues are never a good idea. Except for the fact that the good guys never seem to take advantage and just kill them.
That...
Suddenly sunlight
BEST SCENE EVAR!!!
time to die
lol he BSODed
He died
OMG IT's the SUN!
Was fucked up
That was epic

whatever happened to Vangelis?
No it doesn't.
Quiltone yeah that too :P
because its streaming for me....right now

AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
Because the replicants are the humane ones in this movie

It's a trap!
0Norse AHAHAHAHA

wha
Sparta kick!
Ribs grow back! (No zey don't.)
Dumb telephone.
friggen ploy twist
.....was that the camera behild them?
540
No, the point of the scene was to show the dude how he felt
I have NO idea whats happening right now
aside from when they killed some people
All he wanted was to live a little longer :(
PurpleFridge THAT
All I know is that it is currently streaming...embedded, and is working fine.
I was gonna everything>G3.5 but someone beat me to it

At the moment I'm going through http://dinkypage.com/bronystate-theaterlq to see the stream.

Why would we use it?
I was pretty sure I was gonna like it before watching it
We have a .net.

The proper response is to give them a hug.

No. This is the 90s cut.

G1 had pretty awesome villains.

My Little Pony G1 had villians, had adventure, it just was badly made

Time for the sex scene
silversceen Yes

I think it's implied at some points
Gun has not enough triggers.
No one seems to care
DOAR OPAN
yet.

/me is now pleased
the LQ dinkypage stream appears to be the same quality as the HQ bronystate.net stream. huh.

I don't have any merch. don't really want any either. Except maybe plushies.
I was like
carebears were hardcore

Care Bears is something like Telettubies

THEY SHOOT LASERS FROM THEIR CHESTS

The MyLittlePony movie is definitely not bad, it's not amazing, but it's not bad.

That is win right there, people
As I recall G1 had the ponies solving problems by either crying or forgiving people.
