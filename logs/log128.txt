Ready?....I WAS BORN READY!!!

I am a spiedr now *sadface*
The sheer volume of replies to that thread unnerved me at the start Silverscreen.
MLP

I should post my glamorous brohoof
I didn't tell anyone for like, 3 weeks
Do you get paid to proof read?

I should have slept all day today so that I could watch the entire stream. Silly me
Tovler, sideburns and a gunslinger stache, can't go wrong.
a hop skip and hump

as a brony who loves and tolerates I've tried to respect all the creatures of this world ;)
i don't have any other insect intruders

Precisely.
Ooh, this is the part where Leeloo gets a multipass!

Moths on the other hand..... I hate moths!
I liked Of Two Minds personally

I can take g1 ponies but not g3.5
I see no-one cares about the trout machine,ah well.
yeah, i got a spider buddy where i work, kills tons of flies for me
i listen to metal, play violent video games, kinda random for me to suddenly watch this
Yeah, what gen is the MLP movie?
But there was no contextual reason to.
and I mean to read that one about Applejack going to a fashion show with Rarity
Hi

Dem synth keyboards
It's the 'Precussion of Evil' of Mlp-fanfics even.

I still think it's obnoxious when people try to shove things down everyones' throats.
sirderpsalot: thank you, that laugh was refreshing
what movie is this?
i might post it in a bit , but they wont get much out of watching blade runner ^^
a hop skip and hump
Are ppl ignoring me?
She wanted me to tell you to hook me up, but I am unsure of the meaning of this

I wish there were more bronies where I live, but Idaho is not a popular place for them.
I still hate them though, but I've stopped killing them.
>mfw Idk what MMO Champion is :?:
I'm recording S2 so if I ever oversleep, I'll have it
MLP is G1

HE IS A COW
I'm going to try coop
Why can't I watch?
/me starts building a bigger machine
Why do skinjobs smoke?
MMO-champion is pretty much the prime newssite for WoW Zephirdd.

Hm? What's with the constant shifting of i?

Zephirdd - It's a news and analysis site for WoW
idk if im a closet brony both my parents walked in and saw the videos before blade runner started, my dad asked if i was going to frolic or study
if you got a pony them for xbox
you can make themes with modio
Meanwhile, I can do sideburns no problem but that's about it. Hopefully this cool weather will make my face less irritated.
It always rains in the future.
What is CANCER.?
i didnt know theres a pony thread over there :D
/me trouts a random brony
So yeah - hi, Wrek
G1 isn't as bad as G2-3.5.
YO...When does the movie end, time wise? It's 5:41 where I'm at YO!
who is that?
would anypony like to help me think up a scene, I need an interesting way to introduce that Twilight (currently crazy) can communicate with owlicious through head notds and hoots
I mean, I get why +i but not why it keeps shifting.
Doesn't the G1 film at least have good villains?
I would be instant jelly

Rarity is a replicant, it all makes sense
Suddenly a unicorn?
Random Symbolic Dream Pony is the best pony
Actually, it wasn't that bad. The ending was buttcheeks though

Anyone know how long this movie is?
Newborn Cuties doesn't exist
Is it considered a serious medical issue if seeing the mlp movie poster causes your eyes to bleed?
I

Well since a few of us dislike grimdark, who was following On A Cross and Arrow?
This is so wrong
Best pony

That scene is really random
This is true.
soooo who's ready to stay up all night?
NewDCD: no?
Hiya Nittany_Tiger
RARITY
I

One of the things i really like about MLP FiM is that the humor is usually the innocent humor, not crude humor like today
I said it first. :P
3CRITICAL VIEWER LIMIT REACHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why not?
Floppy horn says hello
it was awesome
I wouldn't have gotten into G4 if not for a friend I have who likes to draw. He started a pony pic and I, a disbeliever at the time, asked 'what's the big deal?'
the scene isn't quite as random in the director's cut
I SERVE NONE BUT KORROK

Karl Pony would be bald and just be: Alright o3o

But that's mostly because I blush whenever someone mentions the word "sex" two cities away.
This movie is so incoherent.
MLP/Blade Runner crossover? strange and inane unless really well done
enhance*
Han Solo?
nice hand

puppy you could maybe have somepony walk in on her and Owl having a conversation. Maybe OWl makes a nod and Twilight laughs?
I followed it from chapter three I think. Did you squee (or make simular gesture) when Twilight went to meet Dusk?

He asked me to give it a chance; and, since I figured I owed him at least that, I did. A few weeks later, I'm correcting him on the various details of the series
So many things to do... Iz tearing me to bits!
No that's Han Solo
UNCROP. ROTATE 90 DEGREES.
I'm sure it has like a nine million by nine million resolution, at least
Gotta take a shower.
this is like those awesome CSI cameras that could zoom to impossible spots

You'd think that in the future they would have better graphics cards.
EmmettBrown narp

So basically a character is the rainbow goddess child
13Depends.
Wow, That camera has a very good screen resolution!

Uuhh... Why can't I access the stream=
Oh OWL you're such a tease! hehe
Almost the first hour, I think.
I'm already on a couple of channels, but still

Rarity comes to the door looking for twi', but spike answers and suspiciously refuses to let her in. When she leaves, spike closes the door and it is revealed that twilight is in a state of insanity, books are flying everywhere and such. After noticing how different twi's become, spike shocingly learns twi can speak to owlicious
I think I did a multitude of things, one of which was definitely D'awww
What happened to cartoons back then? A lot of them decided to make baby versions

That would change the movie quite a bit
I had a wad of troubl to connect tot eh stream but now when I switched to Chrome, all is fine and dandy.
9and this stream is still holding up
05DoveyQuill seriosuly?
Runs a bit slow on an emulator though
Why not?
Zoom, enhance. That cracks me every time
If he'd have ended it on Chapter 11, fine. But adding that last one was just evil.
lol tovler...oh you

sorry
YAY
Never played.

Welcome to 80s cyberpunk
I used to hide that i was a brony at school till i found out one of my friends is a brony xD
how did he do that then/
Google Chrome.
i went onto dinky page then back to brony state and stream works fine now
?
What movie is this?
newdcd: does the number of viewers really make a difference?
I'm sort of surprised "yay" isn't registered.
Yes.
yeah, but it was supposed to be ambiguous, and the director felt that it suggested him being a replicant too heavily
see the blade runner curse
This future is cooler than what turned out to be true
Polaroids are classics.
100 more bronies to go
HEY GUYS
yay
@elky yes.
BIRD
Ummm... Am i on the right livestream? Cuz as far as I know, equestria does not look like... this...
WHAT IS THIS INDIAN MUSIC?!?!!?!?
Lol
this has really good music
Though in fairness, given that Dave and me are the ONLY ones discussing it, perhaps we should take it to a PM conversation Dave?
yup 50mins of the 117mins movie
Zed: Actually, welcome to 2019
Bird on head
friends know im a brony

Snake?

Birds suck, look at philomena

There we go. Finally got it all working
eeup
Yeah, they enhance it until it makes sense.
Snake!
snaaaaaaaaaki?
I hear you'll be able to do that in Phososhop CS6

Snaaaaake!
Why'd it have to be snakes
He make the snake out of BRONIES
11If we're talking about fanfics, perhaps I should mention my TwilightxTrixie shipping fanfic. :P
Why did it have to be snakes?
that isnt harisson ford is it?
Hello all, how far into the movie is this?
SNAKE!
Good grief.
My entire year doesn't keep up with all things internet
HE HATES ARTIFICIAL SNAKES
whats with the indian music?
And now Dave vanishes on me :(
Naa, I think we discussed most of what we needed to discuss, though if you have any other fics to d'aww, squee, or yell about, as rainbow said: "Sure, Why not?"
When are they going to stream season 1?
golfing gets boring after a while
...?
Snake? SNAAAAAAAKE

Ponys?
so I'm pretty sure I'm the only brony in my high school
according to Harrison ford, he intended for him to be human. but again, it was supposed to be ambiguous
I spotted a pony
John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden
As we can see, Asia has taken over the world around this time.
Were those ostriches? O.o
yes it is
Harrison Ford will always have to deal with snakes.
Snake? What's going on? Snake! SNAKE! SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
same....
Saaaake?
LIQUIIIIIID
I KNOW RIGHT
this must have been hell to shoot
I think the fact that she can talk to OWL should not be ambiguous. It should be left up to the reader to decide if she's crazy or not. Spike certainly wouldn't accept that she could.
This is LITTLE INDIA, kinda
/me is confused by slar
INCOMING JAI HO
Ghehe, that's fair.
X3
Solarboy: This is the A movie.
Why'd it have to be snakes?
Artificial ponys.

Baby don't hurt me
mib_h2w65d After we stream G1

But seriously, enough of that.
don't hurt me

god now i wish they were streaming indiana jones
Confound these ponies. I never read fanfics before FiM.
Otacon, how do I crouch?
I'm not usually one for shipping Silverscreen, but provide a link, and I'll provide a read.
No more
Should be ambiguous&
Shoo be doo
thank you rawrity ^u^ I was told my beggining was too boring so I'm spicing it up
BUT THE BROUCHER SAID THERE WAS ONLY A FEW OSTHRICHES
LOL, Nah, I spelled Fluttershy wrong, I know
SEA PONIES SHIT!
zE GOGGLES, ZE DO NOTING
So the director disagrees with him?
Oh, thanks guys :3 I was wondering why it was so well done.

I can't see the stream
Because they're better at math
I tend to to dhat
The stream isn't working for me :'(
im in college i have no idea if there are other bronies
I'm coming in late but didn't Ridley Scott say that Decker was a reploid in the end?
mine don't even know what a brony is

Low quality stream to view!
@flutterfan why are you telling me this
there are lots of tings
Ah. :p
derpderpderpderp: I wish, but I'm afraid the b movie doesn't have sea ponies

FRENCH CANADIAN BRONIES REPRESENT!!! This is a census to see if there is interest to make a meet-up group in that part of the world

O_O
what the hell?
21st century pipe smoking.
:/
Though I do like Twixie ships
7So who's psyched? 8D
Let me move my mouth without talking.
>get a shirt that obviously signifies you as a brony
DAMN YOU FRESHMAN!
hello
Hey, sorry to interrupt but I missed a lot of the story so if anypony could help me the clear a few things up. If one of you could tell me what has happened before this moment, that would be greatly appreciated.
it would be awesome if there was an ostrich or an emu in season 2!
ha
No techno-music or Rammstein in a club? This is a fake future!
Those people are enough to drive you mental.
sceen of red
marethon, nice
OPIUM DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!
how many ponies you think will be on for the premiere of season 2?
11: /
>walk around town for a few hours
Elky: Maybe it's for the best, we would've needed sea ponies to save us from the flooded chat.
like since we can't understand the owl, we can't tell if she is really talking to it or not.
LP
The Great abd Powerful Trixie
bluh gtg
Opium den?
lol'd
I hate ships in general
oops
>i found 4 other bronies in 2 hours
Mr. Duck, I'd like to ask you some questions.
it's not cyberpunk without a tron homage!
:/ the sound is a lil off
except Flutter/Mac
Me! I hope Discord will put up a fight...
in my school instead of the word "freshmen" we use the word "faggot"
over 500
ValtheJean sure ill with you guys how do?
Ever watch ponies? All the time...pal.
that is too cute
0Bye Shutterfly...
500 viewers. Best stream since forever.
i want to see more zecora, more zebras even
But yeah Silverscreen, I can hardly read stories in potentia. :P
WHEN DOES IT START?
@Stonegaze REPLICANTS ARE ON THE LOOSE
i was thinking of that joke during the zoom in scene
at least 550
Faggot for fab <3
Mane6 stream had +1k
I actually haven't watched the movie
Actually, this came out either just before or round about the same time as Tron
Later
I was going to make a smartass comment about ships
discord is best pony
and I hope discord has his own theme song like hexxus have.
0I wonder...
Let's see if we can break that
Natleyn: No worries, the text color is still disruptive-like. I'll be a good girl. lol
indeed it is, Tovler.
Everytown is chinatown
anyway, i was saying that ripley has flip-flopped on deckard being human or replicant
god
well, a good pony
I don't care what kind of fic it is so long as it's well written
(with respect, of course)
it's over 500!!!
Bye Shutterfly!
ZEBRA PEGASUS
13Each week we do two movies, and typically two pony eps. But this week we're doing the two movies and took the pony eps out because we're doing a S1 marethon all night leading up to the S2 premiere at 9am est. :0

Luna: Probably 1000.

You could either try another browser or restarting chrome.
lol intresting
http://bronystate.net/theatre isnt working
lol
the idea for my fic is that as time goes on, all the fanfic, fanart, music, stories, and creepypastas that fans of the show have created start to impact the actual universe of FiM and all the dark and nasty additions and interpretations of the show and characters begin to destroy Ponyville and Equestria
Luna, so many... x.x
I especially liked Kindnesses Reward
The season 2 stream starts at 9:00 Am right?

All right.

gingerbrony666: Yes. I don't know much about celebrities and whatnot, I only know like the most famous ones. lol
I used to hate the concept of shipping. Then these damn fanartists made me go "D'aww".

Hey Wrek, do you still proofread for Lafter?
Yixion: Try switching to the low quality stream
it would be very racist and their motto would be "OP is a faggot"
...I shudder to think... PINKIEQUEST BEFORE S2 Episode EVERYBODY!
oh gawds not over 9000

Inevitably.
Come over here, i want to jump your bones.
Imagine Discord taking Luna captive and Discord possessing her into Nightmare Moon again. That'd be awesome... right?
Ahh, Yeah, I guess I've read more than my share of fics
season 2 also needs moar luna
Holy crap, I haven't seen a channel move this fast since #nipponsei on Rizon.
Rofl.
*Brohoofs*
There's also potential for Fluttershy to not be able to accept that Twi seems to communicate better with an animal than she can.
05Foolonthehillz yep
Yixion: Go to bronystate.co.cc
No, I mean, like the Spanish galleon or something. xD
It starts at 9 Am eastern time right?

Man, I'm glad phonebooths will make a comeback in the future
I hope we see discord true form.

TAKE ZE PLEASURZ FROM DE SERPENT
Apparently referencing Cupcakes, but I managed to avoid reading that one so far.
aaah, so more french canadian bronies are present. good.
Ah
I heared there's going to be a Neuromancer movie
How do these futuristic movies always get the future so wrong?
Harrison Ford is in a lot of great movies
man this stream is going to take up SO MUCH of my bandwidth, regardless of whether i switch to low quality
when season 2 airs what are you guys gonna celebrate it with?
how long is left of this movie?
what is the mode?
You don't want to bring up Attack Of The Clones.
3RAINBOW DASH IS BEST PON3!
Howq long are the movies?
what's the special stream going on for EQD?
like Star Wars
/me yay
A Snowcrash movie would be cool as well
You want to go home and rethink your life.
k
And I intend to keep it that way.
first time in IRC
There is no Discord.
@Stonegaze Replicants are robots that are superior to humans. Blade Runners (basically police offers/detectives) have been ordered to kill all Replicants. A small group of them are in hiding

6Please leave the links out and enjoy the movie everypony.
Greetings
Celestia is best pony, you fool.
lol dat accent
I've avoided reading that too, but I seen so much about it from other material
Is Harrison Ford a good actor, or just in a lot of good movies?
god that week was amazing
07no worries fluttercry
2,14 again, no links please
Good Lasharus. I mean it's well written but it is...unsettling.
The thing I've never understood about sci-fi: Why do all glasses and cups look so weird in the future?
twi is such a troll
I want to mareathon all night, but I cannot. only enough time to watch the premiere and go to work.
same here I think
I'm definitely steering away from cupcakes and all stories alike.
There is no emotion. Only peace
No links!
Trollestia?
Celestia is a douche.
Until I return bronies, love and tolerance
07we are finetuning things in the background
rarity shows her her special talent
I pretty much know more-or-less exactly what happens anyway
Spike is best pony
Movie First, Links later.
@Lemon Dammit!
General Okay.
Its not too bad...
Isn't Celestia a Mare?
No spoilers in chat!
Oh damn, Snow Crash would be awesome
Why can't it actually be Discord's true form? Why does everyone think he's got another form
9Discord has the BEST VOICE
twilight instantly does it ten times better without practicing
Cupcakes is amusing
3Is movie not on for anyone else?
Everybody having problims with the sream go to the new webiste: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/dash/
The best way to read Cupcakes is to just piece together what happens based off of random comments.
how long left in blade runner?
so is this where the new season will be streamed in a few hours?
not a pony?
dat voice
Gore makes me nauseous. I can only imagine what in-depth described gore would do to me.
B)
Trixie
Lasharus, Yeah, that one was a good one. I like the pinkie-dash fics, even if they're not shipping
Think what you will, Celestia is my favorite.
I LOVE CELESTIA
My girlfriend and I are gonna watch all the ponies for like the 3rd time
I read cupcakes out of curiousity
Seeya [NLR]Lucid
So this movie takes place in 2019
Ok guys,what if the creators are just trolling us and season 2 is like G3.5
The movie is not on
no i don
is
Though it may require me to buy a new keyboard.
only true genius's can understand the greatness that is rarity.
best
she's ossum
she probably threatens to send you to the moon if you don't like her
/me hugs [NLR]Lucid goodnight
The author achieves what he wants perfectly
applejack works herself nearly to death harvesting
It's just gore for gore's sake
nice voice harrison
K sorry.
BROHOOF
and it is REALLY well written
07that is correct
THE MOVIE, ISNT WORKING
I don't know if its the antisipation or the decongestent but I am literly bouncing in my seat
Dammit Lemon, don't spoil us!
I would say good actor
KILL HIM WITH THE SNAKE
twilight pulls half the orchard down herself at once
I read it and all the sequels/spinoffs in one sitting
@rainbowdashfanatic low quality stream.
dat voice
High Pitched Ford just sounds weird.
MORAL ABUSES: Like my Voice <3!
Well, that one's tagged as FriendShipping Dave.
He did a great job as indy
hey all
Wow hat voice
She sure has a big snake *wink*
that*
Oh, I shall be back at some point before season 2
Harrison Ford, acting like a dweeb.
The next ten years are going to be interesting, going from now to self-lacing shoes and hoverboards to this
boobies :D
he does it good
i tell ya Vangilis really brings this film to life
13Drinkin in style? lol
SPOILERS ARE INSTA-PERMABAN
Wow that's a fast moving wall of text....
ValtheJean cool but nobodys there also i got out bitch time to pay!
All I know is that Rainbow Dash was graphically and horribly murdered in the most gruesome and violently gory fashion possible
Thanks
Gnomesmasher: Eeyup
It's like he inhaled helium between takes
Also, Dat glitter. And the snake
i'm gonna sleep now. night everypony
That's basically the premise
Oh crap... sorry. *ashamed of self*
6First time in bronystate, so whats up guys?
He can pull off that dweeb voice
05nn
Um I never saw 3.5
no boobies
Pretty much, yes.
2,14 sklar: what?
I told myself I wouldn't read Cupcakes, but that went about as well as water in a bucket full of holes
yo
the only person who twilight can't troll
and instead of actually reading it, I just...let my own imagine take over.
lol
Such convenient camera angles
DAT VOICE
+i means that you can't use /join to enter the room, and that you'd have to use the regular method of entering to do so.
no colors
maybe he did
Twilight is just overpowered.
is Spike
/me wishes all a good night
Ohmanwhat'sgoingonIdon'teven
I love this voice
15i dunno, there's just something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth about Cupcakes. it just strikes me as... wrong
lol boobies
05hi TwilightSpark1e
He' interested in what she does with that snake.
same
hi twilight
And I'm happy to keep my knowledge of Cupcakes so distant.
because he's too busy trolling her
Harrison with the nasly voice
That's not the terrifying part. It's how the killer acts during it all
"You think you know me..."
Also first time in bronystate
/me hugs everybronie
nice cover bro
inb4 no colors
Twilight, no colors :<
0oh my bad
Draken, what is surprising about it isnt the gore and the topic of the fic
I'm back
PonehMan: WRYYYYY
I can hear it in his voice.
Yeah, Twilight can't show up Rarity.
purple lol
dirty holes?
has anyone done a bladerunner pony xover fanfic?
13Night whoever is leaving. :P
NERD
Welcome Twilight
Little Dirty Voice
Caution!!! Abort! Abort!!
Is it possible to spoil Star Wars: the Clone Wars?
I mean HOLES
No colors noob
>Dirty holes
Sorry
I'm pretty sure whatever I can come up with hasn't already been written in said fic
heh
is this the minor nudity part?
Dirty Hoels
i did it first
twilight is clearly a replicant
dat voice lol
Why is she sparkly?
YAY PONIES
naked
Drilling holes? In 2017? Don't they have mini-cameras? Geez!
Or some spinoff
0I got it the first time
what is amusing, imo, is how the autho maintains Pinkie's character through the whole story
star wars the clone wars...
Holes, everywhere!
05play nice Darf14
yaaaaay
lol
I would say PRETTY good actor, but there are better folks. The scripts in his movies kinda make the character for him
tier separation. Twi's a wizard, rarity's a rogue-type with a few magic tricks, and Applejack something mundane like a fighter.
Um
ValtheJean nobody there thats what
people actually watch that!?
fffffffuuuuuuuu
Fishbowl hairdryer
THE FUTURE OF PERSON GROOMING
i think i spotted a nipple! kill the feed! lol
lol
Octavia you're light a puple beam of happiness in this randomness...
DO WANT THAT DRYER
sorry wrek
this movie is promising nudity
and how RD was a perfect character for the story
Though the fact it didn't bother me as much as it should have concerns me somewhat...
No comment. :P

she's a Shiny! use the Masterball!
personal wind tunnel
and not delivering
Evening, bronies
Dryer Dome.
She's been haning out with twilight sparkle
neat blowdryer
hair dryer of the future
so this is the brief nudity?
We need those.
now that's a hair dryer
... i hate snakes.
Dat' expression
the only problem I'm running into in mine is that it's hard not to feel my soul being stapped when I have Fluttershy or Rarity trying to do something that's outright malicious.
lol monster rehab
0About what time are they going to stream Season 1?
@c9317 it's okay.
Yeah, I was suprsied how well they kept in cahracter
Robo-Snake
yumm
He Hates snakes

I love how impractical the old future is.

BEWBS
Nah, we've had worse than this.
The stream froze up for me a while ago so I'm missing da boobies :(
Snakes.....
RobotPinkie, still alive?
*cough* sorry

I think a large part of it is shock value DaveKenroy.

Ohey Nudity.
lolnipple
My virgin eyes.
refreshing
Yeah... Well, while I wait, time to play some Metal Slug!
side boob
breasts
a high enough level wiz can do everything anyone else can, typically better
Why'd it have to be SNAKES!?
why'd it have to be replicants?
... unreal snake...
ooh. breasts!
yes
PLOT
Okay
Um
there it was folks
A future where fake snakes are cheaper than real ones
Alright, i'll see you guys in the morning! Later ponies.
Wut
ye were warned about brief nudity :P
O.O did I just see hooters!
bewbies
wooot
oh my
DUDE BOOBS? WHERE

oh hai boobs
Thats some sexy snake
/me shrugs. "I just have weird thoughts."
tits
BEWB
holy shit, I'm old
Is the movie on?
so if I've got dis straight: Are we going straight to the next film once Blade Runner's over? Or are we having a break
Wait, so no one can afford Snakes?
I got a thing for high heels
lol
Are them like udders?
movie just got 20% hornier
i do indeed detect breast
You knew what was coming, so you weren't as shocked as you might've been if you'd read it without foreknowledge.
huzzah!
13Dat slight nudity
pawnch
told
Someone else was supposed to be Indiana Jones but then the director saw star wars
dat ass
Bewbiez!
it wouldnt be an 80s movie, without boobies.
Darf14 launch cruise missiles just for shits and giggles :)
Bookfort, this is REd Lobster. Over.
CYBORG

Let him exploit you.
Books about math, come and get them at TIITS
groady
So pro
damn ninja!
KILL
KILL
KILL
Yeah, I've heard of that. What's odd is that I can actually imagine Pinkie doing just that
Lol, I cannot load the video fast 'nuff
I love how RD is almost always the one to get killed/mutilated/broken winged
that didnt hit
Bookfort, do you copy?
I barely ate 4
CYBORG KILL
Cya Azure
sneak attack critical!
lulwut.
FIGT
wow what a hore
0i know i just saw it sorry
lol, transparent jackets
Nice trenchcoat
Not realistic. Han Solo would never let a bitch slap him
guess she should cover up
er... actually a robot
she's a fembot!!
Copy Red Lobster, this is Bookfort
lol
FINISH HIM
wow they made clip on bra's
Sure that jacket covers you well.
PLASTIC BAG COAT
0...well then, theres a bit too many people in here, i'm out, see you guys later i suppose
ya clear plastic covers u well
Though probably not to Rainbow Dash
but not with as much style
Must people focus so incessantly on that one sscene?
depends on what you mean by snakes
she wears that body condom like a champ
FINISH HER.
lol
Wait, when does the B-Movie start?
Run in the clear plastic coat.
It didn't really shock me too much, I've read my share of dark/grimdark fics/stories (non-pony)
More like...just, in general
If you ever watched Happy Three Friends
^
I'd say more style
this is quite amusing
PLASTIC BAG COAT LADY, AWAAAAAY!
The pinnacle of style.
its easy to imagine cupcakes
FATALITY
wat
those clothes are made from the finest silk!
It doubles as a grocery bag!
why'd she push over that hobo?
she can run omg
dat budweiser ad
running through window time
Recovered from that neck injury pretty quick
It doesn't work :'(
just noticed bronystate has just broken the 500 barrier
Insert cool chase scene
Oh crud! A CRUISE MISS- *BOOM*
oops...
its the futre what do you expect
twilightsparkle: you can go to other rooms
EVERYONE GETTIN KNOCKED OVER
11Cupcakes was a gorefest that was as good as any Saw movie after number 3, which is to say not really good. It'd be better if it focused on the psychological aspect.
If she were to ever completely go off the deep end.
That's the best outfit ever
A bit.
run! run! run like a son of a gun!
I hated Happy Tree Friends
err i mean the 80's
Gore for gore's sake really isn't that amusing to me.
wha is the next movie btw? i had enough fun getting to where i am
Little did they know, but the costume design dept predicted Lady Gaga
There's that gun that was the inspiration for the gun in Fallout New Vegas
You're gonna get a lot of static electro shocks wearing htat sorta suit.
what
Um, nothings playing lol
Think I'll be skippin the scheduled B-movie tonight ;)
he just got his ass kicked by a girl?
Rarity's dress or GTFO
ITS OVER 9- Oh wait, no it doesn't
mother of god
yup
did you just see a woman in a clear plastic raincoat run by hear?
Evening bronies. I'm getting a time out on the stream window, should I just keep hitting Try again?
13Kihppy, its already playing
Love those light up umbrellas
which gun?
11^
True
Lady Gaga would NOT wear that
Called "that gun"
Some time after this one I think
get outta the way sirry chinese people
deckard needs some augs
See it DID do that for me, Silverscreen.
anon: go to bronystate
Yeah, the day Twilight threads a needle perfectly through a whole is the Day Pinkie settles an argument with logical debate.
Agreed, Silverscreen
OH LOOK ATARI

The movie derped!
have to agree with you there Lasharus
13Oh wait.
this needs to be a podcast too
Shit. Thought that was the Benny Hill theme kicking off
Harrison Ford gets his ass kicked by girls all the time.
most likely would
Literally called "That Gun"
she's toast

:P
Gee, those cars sure are going somewhere.
haray haray haray
*MuSt go to Low Quality Stream *
Hari Kristna
Cobalt: try low quality

Dat gun
07Heya Cobalt on which site are you atm?
Cobalt: Try switching to the low quality stream, it worked for me at least
hare hare
Quick: Drive over them for extra points!
13I was thinking Blade Runner was the b movie. lol
Well Silverscreen, that would be true if the author was trying to make someone feel sad for RD
*cough*...ugh did someone get the license plate no on the missle? *faints*
I DONT GET IT
Because Pinkie stayed so chipper and didn't seem to realize she was doing something terrible
When he isn't flying his helicopter around mountains looking for stranded climbers.
Anyway to move the Chat box?
Oh no, wait. Just needed to reconnect
Silly
but the point of the fic is to horrify the reader
13I'm doing SO many things at once, its hectic.

Not outlandish enough?
SHEPARD
how do you go to over rooms?
well lets all congregate in AJ again so we can make sure octavia isnt lonely :)
05Cobalt please pm a mod for assistance, the chat is so damned spammy >.>
It's like the cars are going ... nowhere at all.
WREX
and the author achieves it with maestry
Plus, while twi can make an awesome evening gown for the astronomical fans, she can't hold a match to Rarity's skill
What just happened? *guy enters strip club, gets ass kicked and chases some girl?*
^
Nowhere at all.
IMO
*other
she's the only one waering plastic

Just because it feels like you ate some bad mushrooms doesn't mean it's a B movie :D
shoe changes
He shoots his gun and causes no panic.
She's down
"SHE WAS A ROBOT"
hey, it's that gun.
Bloodsplatter
Doesn't anybody else notice the guy shooting in the middle of the road?
Such terrible aim.
awww yeah
Brohoof crazypie for noticing the atari sign *brohoof*
My favorite episode is Cutie Mark Chronicles
Sad music is sad
Boom Headshot
Rainbow-Dash is back! yay
That'd be sensible lastone.
Is it just me or is it difficult to follow the #BronyState chat?
Firing a gun near a crowd? What is this New York City?
music
Drakengarde: she does that because "that's how it is"
insert guile's theme
I like it
DO A BAREL ROLL
except her
Hey, what version is this? the one I saw didn't include this scene and kinda sucked
Anyone here read spiderses yet?
would be way more blood
She sorta did Drankengarde, but she didn't realize it was wrong. She thought it was just something she had to do and people onjoyed it. Although that slipped near the end.
dramatic gun shot
POW
ouuch
Guys, she's a robot. You can shoot robots.
POW
its the future lol
Blodd?
I love it
Moar glass.
similar to Feeling Pinkie Keen, she won't explain it
POW
herp a derp
SILVERSCREEN, ATARI PRODUCT PLACEMENT
They obviously stole this from Battle field EARTH
That's why you should just wear normal clothes
no one minds
And she's still runnnin
*Blood
So they got 4 hour life span.... why are they bothering to kill them>
it's interesting, but seems difficult to do properly.
that's actually a near impossible shot
PCHOO
Slow motion escape.
Huh.
ooh watcha saaaaaaaaaaaay
the blood shows up well in the plastic
She's not human, Dash
I'LL HEAL YOUR BOOB, LADY
MEDIC!
did I miss it?
Oh
spiderses is awesome
I listened to the dramatic reading of Spiderses. Priceless
so what did she do?
Time for the Explaination of the placement curse!
This guy makes it look like Legolas doesn't use aimbot.
How is she still running?
glass everywhere
so remind me, why is he shooting her?
and that is a gigantic point on it
PEW
dammmm she knows how to take some serious dammage
Is this Battlefield Earth?
He is? Oh snap. Let him know that I got my stream working.
XD this movie is ridiculous
Hey, sorakey
Those are some cheap windows
Well, like I said, I never actually read the fic
So much more dramatic than non breaking glass
spiderses!!
4 years rookealding
Where the hell is the blood.
lol 21 years of unlucky
or not..
woman stop breaking windows
Again, she's not human
Activate Ze Ubercharge!
Three plains of glass and two bullet wounds finally took her down
Tovler: Blade Runner
I still like how Equestria daily tagged Cupcakes.
oh
bitch got shot
Why not?
there's a new trollfic on ff.net
I liked Cupcakes
@everfreenights well, she did just try to kill him.
So, to be totally honest, I wouldn't really know.
well lets all congregate in AJ again so we can make sure octavia isnt lonely :)
"Grimdark as FUCK"
For some reason, in the future, we apparently still have weak-ass windows.
13Shes obviously the tank.
And still nobody is screaming or running away.
High constitution modifier
Besides, a bullet wound isn't alwys that bloody.
it was awesome!
Did... did harrison ford just shoot a bitch?
you know id pick to be bulletproof instead of a quick shoechange
She's one of the replicants he's looking for
Hi!
have you rapening?
Sorry, Pizza arrived
@everfreenights also, robot.
Tittle of movie plz?
*always
I'm all OTL 'cause I wanna read everything >_>
dat plot
Spidersex
All was did was be a replicant on earth
I love movies that have such a distinctive film noir tint to it.
cupcakes was good
everfreenights she's a robot and that's illegal
xD
She;s an evil robot that tried to kill him everfreenights
everfreenights: theres that
ok NOW hes jc denton
You guys know me?
i cant eat cupcakes anymore
so this is the final cut cause that was the remastered death scene
Yes this movie is weird, but it was hot s**t back in the day.
Please don't mention food, I'm far more hungry than I should be right now
No one even flinches w/ all the bullets and stuff?
she was a filthy replicant
Pretty accurate
05nope, hai
Why did he kill her, anyway?
Anyway, which fic are we discussing? Cupcakes still?
he forgot to teabag the body
Pinkie Pie is Pinkie Pie, and if you try to understand her you're oatmeal
lol
Snatcher
I guess
Was there any reason to?
Blade Runner
blade runner
or
LOL
A Clockwork Orange is another favorite.
Lucky git.
Spiderses
IMO best fic is Past Sins
And no one give's a f***
do androids dream of electric sheep
Or Adam Jensen
I can still eat cupcakes
I am asking to have spider sex with you twilight
she's already wrapped up in the bodybag and everything
His pistols are augmented?
rape?
All the takeaways are closed over here, and I'm outta snacks.
well that's just plaim rasicm
And everybody just keeps calm and moves along
take care guys i'm off to bed
0lol
omg not human!
This is the guy with the blade, and he runs
What has watching CSI and Dexter tought us?
My vision is augmented
that's how real men do it
boredom probs
I tend to not like bridging the pony-human gap. But that kind of story could ironically show why it's a bad idea.
HA
cupcakes cupcakes CUPCKAES
I think?
not evil, just misunderstood
they make the murder victim package themselves
Obviously, that coat is already on it's way to the dry cleaner
mallam. Seriously? You thought cupcakes was good?
05what a sahme
More or less. Though you have a PM Dave. :P
05shame*
SUDDENLY SNOW
altho I havent read that many fics
The original cut had a voiceover of Harrison going "I just shot a woman in the back. I am sad now."
:P
SuperBrony64: A skanky person running through glass a lot? Pretty sure it's Battlefield Earth
There are all the people!
oh my chat lag D:
What's even funnier is now every PieDash ship out there references it somehow. Pinkie has a bad dream, Rainbow freaks out thinking Pinkie would hutr her, etc etc
The difference between a well made story and a childish, immature story is the difference between Cupcakes and Apple Acres Massacre.
How does Lyra fit in? I'd imagine she plays a pretty important role.
lol
MOVE ON
move on, move on...
Just another day in New York
MOVEON
was wondering why he blew her away
okay it works now
move on or get shot
MOVEON
move on, move on, move on
Move On
MOVEON
Move on
Well, for one, she tried to kill him
lol video freezed for a min and soo did chat
There was gun shooting and all they say is "Move on"
I guess he has a license to kill
everything is in working order
NOTHING TO SEE HERE FOLKS!
move on... move on... right.
Past Sins...xD Oh god. Never read that one either
SNOW?
Tovler: Haha, okay.
Time for noodles
Such an awkward movie.
she clicked the wrong Aug
or just hosed down
because its plastic
Cupcakes was great
yes it was good
Move on, just a dead artificial body
its LA
move on...move on...move on...
nothing to see here
Also, more product placement :)
omg that'd hilarious
EYEPATCH
...
not disturbing at all
well good plot i guess
As a writer, I abhor cupcakes.
Live on!
i don't know why but that "move on" car was hilarius
yeah but this looks more like deus ex 1
not NY
13lol
Eyepatch, ahoy!
But I LOL at all the reag that Nyx gets
05I shouldnt have to tell you not to skeep saying move on right? RIGHT?
NewDCD, you're a mod! Change your colour! :P
lol
It's the equivalent of the "Human Centipede".
plot twist
Budweiser tastes like the sweat on the floor of a changing room.
Ooh, another fic I loved was Storm
13A clockwork Orange is a good movie.
thank you eye-patched liquor lady
0lol
Clockwork Orange...
move on
move on
move on
Heh.
I love product placement.
ONMOVE, oh, wait thats not it...
IT'S TWILIGHT SPORKLES BALLEWN!
You're confusing us normal people. :P
Sadface?
Yeah, I read it more to get the references in other stuff
Budweiser exist in the future, no surprise there
This future sucks. I blame our president for no reason.
I'll be down for AJ too.
Yeah, it really is
apple fritters D:
mallam why?
Budweiser product placment
Past Sins, I loved that one
weird as hell though
No narrative, no lessons to be learned, just scenes meant for nothing but shock value.
Yeah. It was phoned in pretty badly.
arrg i patch
Human centipede was funny
I've never seen the original cut, but I really want to
only awkward if you make it... :)
Haven't read many other fics though
SOMETIMES I THROW UP
skinjob
haven't read that one
Oh yeah
But why is that a reason to kill her? Isn't he a cop?
>No Narrative
He was just called a skinjob...
Just to know
Never saw human Centipede
Are you high, bro?
0i liked "the vinyl scratch tapes"
I'd like to watch the stream in HQ, if I keep getting the time out is there any way for me to or am I stuck on LQ?
Taking out the voiceovers is pretty much the best thing about the recut
9yeah I know
One question...
I like his hat
should have played that
I still laugh whenever I think of it
Get to tha choppah....?
human centipede was a great movie!
OH
I'm not entirely certain whats happening in the movie
the author put a lot of time into it
House hehe I like your name
As much as I liked Past Sins, I sadly saw the ending coming from a mile away.
i heard about human centipede from the yogpod
AJ is best. :3
i have never had an apple fritter
that's essentially my goal. to highlight the ...less than savory things some people have come up with related to ponies. The only thing I'm not touching on is clopfics, because I would never be able to write anything of the sort without just outright hating myself
OOPS
9was just stressed with my flash crashing
maybe
how do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?
might try one
what are you watching?
Webpage is not available on player
@LGNR, well she's just like a human, except super strong, desperate, and already having shown herself to be willing to murder over a suspicion.
am i the only one that thinks the name skinjob is funny
That's better. :)
@Wrek Do you add the "(tsk tsk)" yourself? or is it computer?
There's four skin jobs?
halp pl0x
What's this?
This is what happens when I switch tabs
Harrison Ford looks younger than he did in star wars
is he getting paid for this?
HQ doesn't work for me either
idk its better than most fan fics out there
100% medically acurate
ummm...
^^^This
angry midget says tyrell
I am Dave! Yognaught! and I have the balls!
/me is only in here because AJ is his favorite Mane 6 pony
No.
Oh yeah, Viny Scratch Tapes. Loved that one.
Wrek is wielding his banhammer for great justice :p
Yeah, but the build up to it was good
I don't know
it was better than transformers 3
FUTURE CAR DOORS
set it on fire
Oh, so she's one of those replicants?
They're quite good :D
i love that origami guy's moustache
I don't know about anypony else, but I was super-hyped for this stream. XD
/me is watching this, the chatroom, and Star Wars cartoon.
'sokay. I'm just blunt. And sleepdeprived. :p
even tho its a bit...gruesome
Human centipede was torture porn.
05its all me babey
Do so, they're good.
Do androids dream of electric sheep?
we all did djdexcat

0It really had the feel of Scratch and Tavi

Nothing more, nothing less.

Hello there i came late?
I don't like apples
I'm Back :D
Nice
Who does the Ink Spots pastiche in the background?
mallam It made me feel it at one point. It's just so pointlessly mean spirited
:l
anything is better then transformers :P
RobotPinkie, o hai :3/
i dont know how i will look at the characters after watching S1 in 4 days then reading lots of fanfic speculation
I LIKE FUTURE CAR DOORS
I've read quite a number, but I honestly can't recommend any since I don't recall half the titles I actually read.
i am dave! yognaut and i have the ballz!
Dang it Highgarden!

Good to see more AJ fans overall. She seems to have the least fans out of the mane 6.
Apple Bloom is my favorite pony
I thyink I just saw a guy holding a lightsaber
i have way tomany pics of scootaloo looking up to dash

<General_Hazard> The only thing you should feel is the redoil.
Transformers 3 is helping Hasbro pay for MLP:FIM

So this is the next best thing
Why must they dream of Electric sheep? Why can't they have real sheep...

YOU MISSED MY BIRTHDAY
TOLD
*recoil
No trivia silverscreen?
1 hr till i'm off work!
aaw yea
How old am I? *Punch*
Vinyl Scratch Tapes were definitely great
Luna is best pony ever!!!...does that count as a season 2 spoiler?
Is the chat window supposed to be below the stream, or is something wrong with the layout of my page?
wtf
FOR THAT, YOU DIE
That was the book this movie was based on wasn't it?
just watched an episode of g1 my little pony
No, you certainly should have clop-fics have an effect. But only in a humorous way. It's perfectly possible to have sexual tension without anything explicit happening, or even questionable.
9AM EST, I think
0yeah, but the build-up was done VERY good
steam punch?
I don't get it.
one day were gonna get a live action fim movie by michael bay
WAKE UP, TIME TO DIE

She's my least favorite pony.

so, where is everyone from?
She wears that big coat alot
I looked at Past Sins the way I looked at Party of One. Even though the ending was obvious, the trip there caught me off guard.
lol

11whoops.
We should watch Soldier after this, it's in the same universe.

Has she ever heard of overpenetration?
Rarity is best marshmellow.
MARK!!
mib_eyn0hr Haha, that was simple. Thanks
This reminds me a bit of Die Hard movies...
super appropriate movie before non-stop ponies
"Whens my birthday? you forgot again! didn't you!?" PUNCH
why does that guy keep getting his ass kicked
Aye
Sure..democracy...democracy which was set up by the tyrant Celestia!
well...there's a BIT of something like that in there, between 2 characters I will not name...actually you just gave me a great idea. BRB WRITING DOWN THIS DISTURBING/HOPEFULLY AWESOME IDEA
love that lighting
I had to look away for a couple of seconds
streams not working for me
And to think that's her INDOOR coat.
Dammit. I missed so much of the story I can't connect to it.
0I HAD FIGURED THIS OUT BY NOW
@magneto you did this didn't you
I used to like Fluttershy
:P
so in the future all drinks are consumed from impressionist shot-glasses?
Though I just had an interesting thought.
I actually had adrenaline rushes reading it
Naah, gotta watch Super mario Bros!
can someone please explain to me when the new episode is supposed to air on the Hub? I have that channel but I'm not seeing it planned for tonight or tomorrow
>_>
07Combustiblelemons which site are you at?
We should watch The Rock in honor of Michael. (It's the only watchable Bay movie)
@combustiblelemons switch to lowquality
0i don't like to read grimdark,
and now I'm out of popcorn...
season two is just around the corner!!
But then I realized Apple Bloom was far cuter.
Braver.
Celestia isn't a tyrant. Luna is just a jealous bitch.
Glad to know it's not just me :p
And everything.
Ponified version of Coupling?
When Bridge to TeraBithya came out
Burn your stream down with lemons
2,14 lol...whatever you do...DON'T share it with me :P
dinkypage
Prove to me that Celestia is a Tyrant
Looked exactly like me
brb
Light...
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT STILL DDOESNT KNOW WHATS GOING ON
Celestia is a douche
well it was better than the popcorn I burnt this morning...
Lies.
I don't have the Hub :(
0well, the doctor whooves I read, but thats about it
Go home and be a family man!
I love Alan Rickman
or how about some Rocky Horror Picture Show!
goddamnit I hate that book so much I love it
the Reanimtor is way better than this
Already saw Super Mario Bros
according to this movie we will have flying cars in 8 years
07switch to bronystate.net
we already saw that, Foxpony
Oh she's here
Along with life's house
the business of banging robots
TO the the moooooooon
i watched everything and i can't connect to ot
IT'S BUSINESS TIME
thats great!
0ohey guys add me on steam, coopmore
Ford's character is hunting replicants, They both might be replicants,
Grimdark does depress a bit too much, I'll grant.
There, now you know
thats why i bought 4 bags of popcorn
*looks around the corner* Hey your right
oh god...the cast of Rocky Horror as ponies...
Do you like mmmm bananas?
In the future,fruit has been genetically engineered to provide a 4 course meal
I generally avoid Grimdark because it's dull. Oh yay, beloved character gets murdered horribly.
you can't because there is no proof, BTW it's no democracy there. it's Feudalism, that's why she's a princess.
yes I'm in the buisness and buisness is good
....
What's the running time for Blade Runner?
Good thing those wounds heal up might quick!
Celestia is the best pony.
ok, all working now
light vs dark
TIME FOR BUISINESS
0lol
Don't question powderedlightning, just accept
lol
I don't know whtas happening either
not all grimdark are like that
i like all of them haha
has anyone done that yet?
how much longer till the movie is over?
powderedlightning yes yes you are
0exactly
^
Righty-ho.
13Fluttershy is my fav of the mane6, and Octavia is my overall fav obviously. :P
how long is the intermission
Celestia is still a douche.
ohh big buisness
0and the ponies begin
Quite a while Ivan
Shit, I forgot to make popcorn
I only read GrimDark if I'm in the mood for it. And if it's particularly well-written.
longlive the Luna Republic
Excuse me but I am clearly the best pony.
Eight years? My projections concluded we'd have flying cars in only four.
Also, Luna tried to kill every living thing. she deserved more than just imprisonment on the moon.
in the futrue is everything metal?
ut,who would Frank-N-Furter be?
i don't know what Coupling is...
I like the grimdark like Silent Ponyville
I want someone to write a fic where they are both eveil ( :
Blade Runner has about 50 minutes left i think
i have to make dinner after
:(
whats tonights lineup? i forgot :S
Magneto have you ever seen a gun shot wound, that is what they are like, the bullet will still be inside him but the fource will make a big hole.
No Zephirdd they aren't. And the ones I like usually aren't.
2 hrs
Magneto is new best troll in equestria.
Celestia smells funny
How do I join a specific room, like fluttershy/etc?
@waifles wouldn't it be more like a democratic monarchy
Indeed, how long?
>still does not know the characters as im focusing mostly on chat and making a CV
there are some good grimdark that don't involve pony deaths
nah, chrome :D
BUT WHO IS RIF RAF
This is Blade Runner?
FURRY COATS SO CUTE WE'LL BLOW YOUR MI-INDS!
what year is this movie set in?
LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY..........
Luna is of course, in this context, quite the evil pony.
Cry me a river Celestia.
Her shoulders are space marine material.
damn!
It's a comedy
I think fluttershy should rule equestria
I avoid grimdark anyways tho
SirDerpsalot: Yup.
everything in the future is chrome
more blood spray from a headshot
Meanwhile: Celestia is poorly written, but not a douche
about 87 hours left of the movie
Yuck.
No, I'm the best pony.
That women looks menacing for some reason
some grimdark here
I think Derpy Hooves is by far the best pony
that was remarkably clean
SirDerpsalot: Yup.
Mmm, my Finger is tasty
I prefer comedy or normal stories :P
2019
Riff and raff both have two r's.
making pasta
fluttershy and pinkie, i wish i could look at them the same after reading cupcakes and pancakes
8 years from now
Drowned
In the future, women have HUGE shoulders.

baisically that chicks a robot along with the two that just got killed Harrison ford's job is to kill rogue robots
but was made in 1984
0O.K. thats one exeption, i might read that when its done
@tovler how is celly poorly written
Riff Raff = Pinkie Pie?
Theirs a intermission between this movie and the next one right?
Aww, not firefox Xzite?
Or not
I don't know I just clicked fluttershy and I have both rooms at the top
...and 2001: A Space Odyssey
A great, great movie.
0hey guys im gonna brb
1982
I don't understand why people find it so hard to follow this movies narrative structure. but anytime I watch it with a group there is at least one person who has a hard time keeping up with the plot
Who is the worst pony? ;)

Hi
Fluttershy CAN rule equestria, I read it on EI!
Twilight is best pony
did he just dunk his head into his bloody water in the sink?
Fuast is best pony
Columbia = Rarity
So, 8 years from now, we will be living in a state of total punk?
Magneto is best pony.

Coupling...?

Tovler, all i've seen of Celestia makes me conclude her douchiness, seriously, i can't think of her without wanting to slap her in the face.
I did the same, but I only have "bronystate"
but I didnt like the game nor the movie
You can't disappear by going North. >.>
Shadow, I watched gameplay of Luna
The blood
faust is pony pony
Majenta = Fluttershy

Magneto was the best pony at the gala.
Twilight it best. IMO.
North? Go South instead
Kamiya is best pony.
Owlowiscious is a he. They say it in the show.

Hello Fluttershy and hello everyone here
Magnet ≠ God Celestia = Goddess; No contest

I like the movie it just gets very boring at some parts
oh
What is this?
Maybe just to Oregon
*AHEM* COUGH *AHEM*
yeah looks like you are...
That doesn't count though. Because Kamiya is best everything.
HARRISON FORD, YOU CAN NEVER LOVE A REPLICANT!!
0I never played, only zombies are L4D for meh

One of my faves when it comes to Normal fics is Sunny Skies.
If you go north you will eventually reach south. :P
Gilda is the best pony
oh dear...
khippy

Do people died in movies?
Hello everypony

Blade Runner

Derpy is best background pony!
i'm pretty sure owliwicious is male. the name the pun is based on is a guy's name IIRC
i hope my cousins come over tonight so I can move this to my tv and force them to watch/listen to mlp all night
Celestia < Magneto.
Does anyone have mindbleach handy?
OH FUCK WE BROKE #))
Next up is My Little Pony The Movie
It's a little hard to follow the movie if you've read the book first, since it varies so much.
07SuperBrony64 stop with the caps please
One? I think he owes her a lil' more for saving his life.
SH2 was an awesome game, and the movie wasn't terrible as game movies go
Ponybot: How do YOU know magnets aren't god?
Don't wanna know.
Rarity is best everyone knows that, why is it evena discussion
Best normal fic ever
AJ is best pony purely cuz she's a Badass Normal with no supernatrual powers
Lasharus i see what you did there...
Talk about ironic, I just finished watching this liike fifteen minutes ago XD
I'm still hoping Luna was corrupted by an outside force...John de Lancie for example
>mfw TaraStrong
rainbow, type /join #channelname
then around 2556 will be halo stuff
not that i would miss much lol
Rainbow Dash will always be the best
At the gala, with magneto, is where I'm going to be. We will talk all about magnets and mutant powers too.
magneto is best pony
Horror game. Pony style.
Owlowiscious... dat name.
6Octavia is my favorite too~ ;3 Mmmhmmmhmmmmmmmmmm~
WHEN THE FUCK DID WE BREAK 300
I think I'll go in my bunker before people start shooting guns over best pony.
lol
Yup.
Nah, Celestia > All
Agreed, Quiltone
all background ponies are annoying
500*
ohh what movie is this?
Just to clarify, Season 2 will be shown right here, right?
"halo stuff"
"This horn, is the horn that will pierce the heavens!"
>Rainbow Dash.
nah: not saying that Phil is a phoenix, and not knowing what Parasprites are. Her personality is based more on the plot of the particular episode.
>good
/me then proceeds into said bunker
but next year we all die! D:
TheTrollside: during the pre-show
@General_Hazard oh god
But wait, shouldn't we be under monkey rule by then?
I'm kinda bored
Celestia is a douche.
Background Pony #15A6XG7 is the best pony.
07correct
Nooooope
rainbow rash would be Frank-N-Furter ^^
What Cabooz said.
/me grins wickedly at BronyGuy.
Twilight FTW
Then in 3000... Futurama B)
beep boop
Magneto?....oh I remember now
Yes it will
Erecting a erection.
yes, Simplymilk
07we will stream season 2 LIVE!
Fun fact: Deckard's police car appears in Back to the Future's 2015
How dare you insult Doctor Whoof!
Silent Hill 2 is excellent
boop beep bop
Spike and twilight would be Brad and Janet
you're a policeman!
oh lol
luna 2012
CANON CROSSOVER
Honestly
oh god magneto
13lol VV :P
Celestia is a god. Gtfo.
LightningThorn, this is Blade Runner.
0Did anyone read the one where Derpy has the same day everyday, and that day is when Nitemare Moon comes?
I like Octavia's design a lot
It's gonna be so special, as Magneto gives a gun to meeeeeeee!
Twilight is best pony
cant be bothered to type tons of stuff of halo story
What if we talk about best channel?
i liked the nes style applebloom game
07this room is nice and calm
/me is waiting for the mare-athon
lol
LOL
CLESTIA WORKS FOR TYRELL COR lol
Background Ponies should be voiced by girl bronies from now on.
But I simply don't get the fascination with BG characters.
Silly buytoast, the fandom has given every background pony a name!
/me is pleased
Anyone know what the spider fanfic is called?
When MLP the Movie starts playing... all hope will be lost
Thank you very much. It started in Firefox.
what movie is this?
Obvious plot twist incoming.
I never saw G1
Rolls right off of the tongue.
They have no character.
Celestia is god of douche land.
lol that would be awesome
Fluttershy
Story of the Blanks
Yeah, I didn't like it
Zzzzz
just like fluttershy
K.
best pony
So...in the year 1 million we will be ruled by giraffes?
Haven't heard of that one
when you say not as terrible as game movies go... that's still a pretty deep hole lol
2,14 Combustiblelemons: check your PM please. Thank you
It was funny when Magneto was on the pony store
is she a replicant?
"We've evolved higher than we were one second before! With each step we move farther! THAT is how a Unicorn works!"
celestia dawning
Rade blunner.
but wait!!
If I may ask, do we have a specific time for season 2 airing?
07indeed
it's hard as hell to spell. I eventually resorted to typing "owlboy" for my fic, and then just doing a Find/Replace for it later.
@tovler she knew it'd freak the cast out, and that was for twi's benefit.
Lasharus How do you do that?
coincidence?
dat sax
Deckard's gun appears in a few Fallout games.
theres a mute button
Ooooh, plot twist
why? whats wrong with the movie?
No Doc, but now I want to. Groundhog Day+Derpy=awesome
6Season 2 will be live here tomorrow at 9AM EST!
I hope Octavia appears in S2.
I've never been able to get through the G1 movie all the way
Scootaloo is best chicken though
RANDOM JAZZ?
OH DEAR GOD THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE AND NO SILVERMANE TO SMACK
I saw some G1, it's actually alright
No problem.
"Who the pony do you think I AM!?"
Saw G1 as a kid, hated it
Trollestia
what did i miss
oh goodness, i cant wait for the mlp movie
hes O U T out
And 4 billions years from now, we will be served by cat nurse aliens in another galaxy
Not that I've tried particularly hard
so no listening to bad ponies voices
Crap, gotta wake up early >.>
Ooh splendid, thank you.
I HAVE CLASS AT 9 AM
Dat chest hair
the MLP movie I've seen already, I'll see it again too lol
More like god of being the best pony. Man, these are getting lame.
Use /me (message)
G3 is what sucks
When did the future in Back to the Future take place?
futuristic black and white photos
i don't know octavia
its g3
...uh...what is that Central?
SON OF A B****!
the waiting is killing me!
Scootalo is the best dodo too.
lol
It's certainly not as bad as G3
i watched a commentary of it
@tovler she was flying over ponyville, of course she could see everything. if she admitted that twi would have an even worse breakdown.
She's a BG char.
I.e. /me is getting a drink, would lead to:
"I have to kill all the cyborgs!" but decard, you are the cyborg" and then decard was a cyborg.
it'S G1
0Its...a little sad at the end...
If anything, she might appear once.
/me : when will the marathon begin?
/me is getting a drink
Wait, do I hear sax?
Dat old photos
wow that's kind of amazing
The MLP Movie? Disturbing lack of G4
2015
2015
any pony before g4 is bad
I suck at figuring out time zones
i like it
:O
Celestia is always lame.
ahh cool
I left for 2 minutes, what happened
lol yeah kirzstryfe. But I actually enjoyed watching it
so glad Season 2 starts on a weekend!
When is Season 1 starting
That's really all I expect
smooth jazz will be deployed now...
525
G4 is FiM
dat music lol
@tovler forgot a comma in there.
it is decided, veemi just hates me
also G1 has some pretty awesome villains
Everything went to shit in four years apparently
Fluttershy is best Tree.
wow
Episodic-type stuff is my favorite kind of fanfiction. personally.
nah: too many pronouns, what?
In one month's time.
I work at 9:30 but I think I can watch the stream on my phone
FOR ALL PPL WHO THINK THEY HAVE KLASS, ITS SATURDAY TOMORROW LOL
SOOOOOOOO MANY BRONIES @____@
TaraStrong: when the movies are done
Saw G3 wanted to kill myself so badly
I've never seen any MLP before FiM... little sister was never into it
If only we could link things,I could show you a picture of real chest hair!
I've never seen a good game movie
that is a very hairy chest he has there
6Marethon begins at 11EST
on all browsers, on both computers
/me 11is using the /me command
BTW, before we forget. Luna didn't spend 1000 years on the moon. It was Nightmare Moon, The mare in the Moon who did. So all those pictures depicting the lonely Luna on the Moon is in fact pure fanon fabrication. It was Nightmare Moon, and there's a big difference.
In the future, black and white photographs come back in style
/me oh
Everfree: Oh my god. Thank you for reminding me of that meme.
And then John was a zombie.
Season 1 starts after G1
Luna is best pony
yes i know :)
in about 3 hours
6 11PM EST
I cannot into time zones. How many hours till 9 AM EST?
even the googlcached version won't load
what time does the marathon on here start
0Res evil?
I have no classes tommorrow!
/me didn't know how to do that either
See? Silverscreen got it.
I grew up seeing the commercials for g3, but I never payed attention to it in general
I should have waited to do my Ponyathon until tonight. :-(
well, g2 wasnt that ba
I get it!
/me : I'm guessing after this movie that most of us are not interested in
Lonewanderer118 he had sex with the robot
SILVERMANE ISN'T THERE
I wonder how many people will be watching this...
awesome!
<3 herospirit
I have classes on Saturday, herp derp.
*bad
central time is at 7 am
watch the G1 pilot it is great
6Marethon begins at 11PM EST
why wub woo
Even though his separate text colour confuses. :P
The first 2 RE movies were OK
You really want pain? Try the G3.5 MLP Newborn Cuties
So are other ponies.
bronies, bronies everywhere!
0that one was cool
Celestia = troll
@cbpony9001 agree
How far are we into the movie?
13Itd be really awesoem if they took my name for her and used it in S2. lol
we are no where close to have some of the stuff in Back to the Future 2
how much longer is this?
NEW LUNAR REPUBLIC IS BEST REPUBLIC
I'm not sure whats going on at all, i don't even know what the movie is!
/me 11knew about /me
@tovler celestia was flying over ponyvile. she could see everything. celestia lied to twilight for the latter's benefit.
i would like to request the cupcake song on the piano
This movie has more twists and turns than... I dunno.
ty
can someone get me into the dash channel please
G1 is ok IMO, everything after that till G4 was pretty meh though
trollestia
Exactly. She needs more screen time. Celestia could be 80327498264982364x better if she had an episode.
Put yo Hooves up!
Spazturtle Oh cool
I'm still hoping Luna was corrupted by an outside force...John de Lancie for example
I'm interested.
HUSH NOW QUIET NOW
TaraStrong: the other movie is actually bearable
far
/me loves the /me command
~13 Hours until S2
That's what i saw....
i saw that
@tovler better?
50mins
don't mention it again
hahahah XD
G3.5...*shudder*
They're making self tying shoes
I done told you, it's rade blunner.
haha isnt there going to be more derpy?
What pony would you fuck if you could
Nike's releasing a limited number of self-lacing hoes
But they showed up in tons of episodes.
so wats playin?
ive only seen the newer ones when i saw ads for the toys years ago i was like wtf get this shit away
/me hugs RobotPinkie and herospirit
Sorry, I just heard the romance music, what did I miss?
*shoes
I doubt she'll even have a role other than maybe show up in a scene.
Walfles: Agreed. They should have been pics of Nightmare Moon scribbling "I hate celestia" and "Death to the sun" instead.
G3 was terrible IMO
Like BonBon and Lyra.
Celestia, knows twilight has five friends...
Derpy won't speak
Starring Rainbow Dash, the stupid, selfish vain pro-segregationist.
wut
Blade Runner is 113 minutes
The RE movies were watchable, but I wouldn't say they were good
/me salutes Silverscreen for his unearthly knowledge.
Look it up, Nike got the patent in 2009
SILVERSCREEN
Gummy
What's wrong with you?
everfreenights: ITS TIME TO GO TO SLEEP

yeah, i heard you're supposed to ignore G3
Everypony, favorite pony quote?

Aaaah Blade Runner is such a good movie
Hay, Bronies!
0I would love to see Nostalgia Critic do this movie...

idk
I need an adult.
Where was Gondor when someone disliked pinkie pie?
probably

I always used /e in WoW. Which doesn't work on IRC, I think.
@gingerbrony666 are you ibts
All british police officers should look like this. http://layton.neoseeker.com/w/i/layton/1/13/ClampGrosky.png

The saxophone is augmented
CUPCAKES

Don't hate Pinkie.
Should be 3 hours earlier, Tifa

I don't think Nostaligia critic will do Blade Runner, it's consitered a good one
How can you dislike the Glorious Pink One?
Brony is sposed' to like all ponies. Duh.
Hate Dash.
Wasnt Prince of Persia good?
I watched this movie when it came out. She was ridico-hot
8:30 central is Season II. Correct for your time zone.
pinke is my least fav but i still like her
nope.
Celestia has the biggest plot
0oh right
Flutterplot
I CAN HAS DASH CHANNEL?!
Tifa: 8pm PST, so in about 3 hours.
so at 9am tomorrow season 1 episode 1 will stream here?
FiM being the best thing from this decade? imokaywiththis.jpg
WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN DISCORD ESCAPED
cupcakes ftw
Doc, this is heavy.
I heard lots of people liked it
We lost people :(
maybe the pinkie room is exploding from randomness?
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
True Capitalist go real old real fast. Ghost only has like 40 phrases
Rohan, YAY! :D
yeah
I'm an adult :3
Pinkie is frigin boss ok?
Everyone knows that unicorns belong in Unicornia
I think RE gave up on being a horror series years ago. Now it's more action-y.
Or, y'know Dash, being able to create bacteria
waiting to see that in season 2
Technically.
Not in OUR back yard!
Haven't seen that one
Run! Prince Blueblood has been corrupted by the Nightmare! He's calling himself "Sapphire Essence".
0I thought he JUST did old ones
They're too expensive, if I remember correctly, you're not even supposed to where them
it was the 80s
Can I make you a cupcake? *maniac grin*
Never liked MLP in first place until a mate of mine tipped me about FIM. I first thought he'd lost it but i ended up enjoying it and here i am today. The older generations... no
Ed, Edd n Eddy is one of my most favourite cartoons
It states right in the pilot that Luna Became Jealous of the day and because of that, she was going to create an eternal night. How can she do that? By destroying Celestia, that's why when Nightmare Moon attacked Celestia, Celestia had to do something.
uh sex?.
.......what does that say about dash?
Is banished to the moon for becoming possessed and evil.
What are you saying Buytoast?
Yes thats his chest hair poking out of his collar
Oh lol, I remember seeing them in the stores
/me wants to see Octavia and Vinyl Scratch together in Season 2 :p
Pinkie Pie for Princess!
nom

NO! No one hates RD. maybe G1-3... but not G4!
I concur.
Her: Not Sure if Want
9am in which time zone?
COULD SOMEPONY PLEASE TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ROOMS!?!
just got off the stream and I made him shoutout cbpony
the new Thundercat's is pretty good IMO
He does, bad 80's and 90's stuff
Prince of Persia didn't have to be related to the game. So it being good doesn't mean much
Or interplanetary rockets
525!
woo is the stream working for anyone?
Prince Blueblood was always corrupted!
Technically?
emmettbrown HA, professor layton, never thought I would see that here
II didn't say hate, I said dislike. I just think she's overated
Where was Gondor when i forced this meme during the lord of the rings showing and have been keeping it alive every time since?
I need food

That awkward moment you kiss a robot your supposed to kill

HOW DO I GET IN THE DASH CHANNEL!!!!!
Problem Ford?

…So yeah guys, how bout that Blade Runner movie?
There is also no proof that even as Nightmare Moon was on the moon, that she was conscious of the whole ordeal.

Rough sex.

It isn't rape if it's Harrison Ford
New cartoons try to be funny by being stupid, but not even in a good way.
13They wont put it in the show.

how do I get to the other rooms?
Not sure if rape
There wasn't anything like RE when it came out
Doktah Jones! Doktah Jones!

The best thing about being an adult is proper debit cards.

Live action Generation 3 Ponies.
WHY SO SERIOUS
SUDDENLY AWAKE
She's herping
rarity is the best pony
/me fully admits that he's very much in the minority with his love of shipping.
Behold, the furute hang out places for LoL groups
this movie is really just plain weird to me, i don't get the big deal
I want to give Fluttershy a hug
0or can you?
I CAN PEEK
11IF YOU WISH TO JOIN A CERTAIN ROOM, YOU MAY HAVE TO RETURN TO THE THEATRE PAGE AND SELECT IT.
/me giggles
dont lose respect just love and tolerate,
anyone else not getting the stream?
Then again...
Bladerunner needs more ponies
Its a girl? I thought it was a guy!
Tovler: I'm glad he's not a pony, lol. Though Cheerilee said he (or his... species?) has "the head of a pony." I thought it was a goat. :(
Labyrinth?
yeah, twilight is more awesome than rainbow, with her epid avatar strate/super saiyan incident
She looks like shes from KISS
zoom out in your browser
6Hugs for everypony <3
Rarity pony is obv best pony
She looks derp
she looks like roxxie from scott pilgrims
Like Vash did: http://i.imgur.com/8AWbE.png
pinnochio over there is freaking out
why are we locked? we too cool for the other ponies?
11http://www.bronystate.net/theatre

0o thnx
Silverscreen isn't there the /join #room option?
Spike is best pony
I wish i could cuddle with Fluttershy
AT special episode with Fiona & Cake was the best
she is kinda cute for a replicant
What's the difference between the rooms?
/me 2: click on switch to low quality to get the stream
but Pinkie is best
I wanna rock and roll ALL NIGHT
What's with big nose man, I just got here a bit ago. :0
*epic
Derpy will be a full character right?
Does Rainbow Dash
Lovelovelovelovelove this movie.
What movie are we watching
Spike is worst dragon
/me slaps the stream to get it to resume playing
Twenty faaav.
I didn't really care much for Ed's and Adventure time. just not my thing
0For who?
MLP is the only cartoon I've watched eps multiple times
11FluttershY: they're invite only.
derpy has a lot to offer the mane cast
Luna= suck. Banish me to the moon
anyway, I think that the name started as a pun on Aloysius, an archaic but definitely masculine name.
lack of ponies, be back later
nah: I guess a better example would be if they made Vinyl Scratches eyes Green
So. Very. LARGE
almost reminds me of the chick from true romance
and Party everyday
Think of all the things they can do with that guy's nose.
aaw me too
Dark matter butterflies
0o thanx
Did the guy just say Aspreger's Syndrome?
no clue havent seen this before
Silverscreen: I figured out that you gotta add /[pony name], but does it work right now?
it's a B movie, what do you expect?
also, yes
Spike is best pony/worst dragon
If you pass the medical you end up working for WeylandYutani.
...
So many delightful possibilities.
sexy time
I'm on the Rarity room, and that's working fine.
this is creepy
Methuselah was hella old
OSHI-
PENIS NOSE!!! come on ppl

PonehMan: Nooo, I liek Luna. D:
Don't worry Saint, I can admot to liking some of them.. but it's really on a case by case decision
That's probably why it keeps changing.

He must have been banned from here

Blade Runnah
OH MAN LOOK AT THE WAIST
@tarastrong eeyup

I kinda want Luna to act like a cranky bitter old woman (like Slappy Squirrel) despite her being younger than Celestia.
Nevermind. Let's move on with the movie.
I'm here for the long haul.
That's not sting, it's rutger hauer
This movie is Blade Runner
bladerunner

Hey um... so when is the season premiere?

John Madden John Madden John Madden
I fuckin love this movie man, Harrison Ford is so badass

I'm pretty sure that's Sting.
13Well, Shadowx. I have a couple friends on the show and I know at least one has peaked in her once or twice. :)
PonehMan: I like the moon too... lol

But it's not like it's badly made
My brother doesn't see the big deal about it either
shadowrun

Whoot no college and took a day off of work for this.

07or if you leave this theme room you can join another
It's Film Noir man
11Or use the Popout link.
Hahahah. Ford is distinctly UN-badass in this
and then it dives into insanity at the halfway mark
Where was gondor when Blade Runner is.. I don't even know.
6am PST
It's the genre
hopefully my internet doesnt die during it
Man i have no life
My stream went dumb.
sebastion for big mac
>still playing chess
still love that derpy is fan-made
wiki it for full entimology
My glowing scienced!
You so perfect.
I hope she isn't emo.
in that case, I remember nothing from reanimator really
YOU LIKE BANANAS
o
not even hologrammed
about discord, isn't he voiced by one the guys of star trek NG?
I went into the Fluttershy room and it had everyone
The main dudes voice in TIE was sex.
2,14 for information on the stream schedule, please check the homepage
G4?
im a g4 tried and true :B
GENERATION 4!!!
wanna check out Highlander next week, never seen it
Couldn't get that to work, but I can see the screen fine, luckily.
most people don't understand that all the negativity surrounding Celestia, is fabrication or hyperbole. Of course the Luna fans constantly pump out this contrived stuff in the vain hopes that people will be blinded to Luna's evil actions of the past, and look at Celestia as the real evil. Thankfully there is intelligence in the Brony community that can see
Q
Yep, Q.
reanimator
6Be safe Navy_Brony . . . >:
lol
I want to pick a Highlander moive tbh
sklar: quick, chop your hand off!
6am PST is the time livestream starts?
G4 of course
"giving head" will never be the same again
Ohai everypony!
frelo is best pony
Yeah Lauren pretty much said she was going to be emo.
NEXUS SIX.
yeah so this happens every friday?
elky: a talking head on a plate of blood?
Lightning? I am THERE!
Oh wow, he's taking this really well
Hello Everybrony.
discord was supposed to be a colt
The Q stands for Qamazing.
0hey now...
in my pants?
Q is best letter of the alphabet
6Every Friday at 7PM EST and Saturday at 2PM EST
I just always think Harrison Ford is a badass man
hm... sounds familiar
you need to have the right mindset for film noir. I fell asleep during Chinatown, and refuse to watch it again
Do the caramelldansen, robot.
Yes.
Conistering they are PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW!
Us Celestia fans are of a higher caliber. [/sarcasm]
error massageeee D:
C9317: Yeah I heard that too. It's going to be clop-tastic.
He's just so...
We need to watch a Highlander movie the first one for A, The Source or 2 for B
Wink wink
that Celestia doesn't deserver the hate at all. They know the difference between Canon and Fanon, and they know the facts that Luna did try to kill everything.
/me packs his bags for Virginia Beach. It's only the entire country away!
the music just got reaaaaally creepy
Q.....
NECKSNAP
...I want Microsoft Sam back on my PC. Microsoft Anna sucks.
i agree
Q and Z rule.
these damn blind bag ponies are stupid hard to get out of the packaging
Twilight Sparkle room is best room
I think that it might be mispronounced in the episode, but as long as it's consistent you can't really call a name mispronounced.
still, maybe it was too late
I liked Evil dead III
Why these androids have grammar bad?
0I THINK...THEREFOR I AM
11...
But seriously, hope you're okay.

Manly, or grizzly

Drakengarde: Bwuh?

Stupid sexy robots.
One letter names for villains = cool.

The Source for B
Is anything playing right now, or...?
hey valtheJean, pegacorn's online
Deus Ex cyborgs >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Blade Runner cyborgs.

excellerated decrepitude dude
Pris always creaped me out.
0Speaking of which, is anypony gonna get "Chainsaw Lolipop"?
lol
Accelerated decrepitude!
the slapstick got a bit overdone at times but... it's evil dead 3!
Well, you've made that impossible now, Silverscreen
Oh got it now
Ponies are unstoppable
0FFFREEEZE
I thought we weren't spoiling.
However, usually only 2 pony episodes are shown per show. Obviously, this is a special event, so we're doing a marathon!
6Please do come back Flameshy! c; We love new regulars!
gotta move that gesr up
wait
Things will die.
o4o?
That sounds fun. I might just come here every week.
Scootaloo yup
gear*
WELL YOU GONNA GO BANANAS ON THE OFFFFFFFFFWOOORRRRLD BEEEYTCH
/me 13lives in OH too
Trollestia thing is quite funny, IMO. Though it's meant to be more humorous than serious.

deathstalker 2 was hilarious
Scootaloo, correct
this movie is creepy
I may be thinking of another movie
I will play the heck out of that game DoctorWhooves
Ponies of War 3...id buy it
Waifles: And I theorize that [dem spoilers] may have influenced Luna's jealousy and such
It had a magical boomstick

That guy's face looks like an orange.
You guys ready for SEASON 2?
Dude okay so the guy playing Black Dynamite is also Jax in the new Mortal Kombat Legacy series

Ninja'd. T^T

Scootaloo, is AZ PST?
I will for sure be a regular then
Purdy shur that's Arizona.

arizona
MOONBASE ALPHA
Dabate Time! Deckard, replicant or not?
freee to play on steam
@mrponiator_ arizona.
The Room was the first week I used a name, I was warning everyone about Tommy Wiseau's ass.
Yes
...I'm hungry; going to find some food
OOH just cracked my neck... me gusta
ok
AZ is GMT i believe
It wasn't even funny bad like I thought
Thank you
oh lemons, then you definitely want to watch deathstalker 1
NorseThunder *maths
obviously replicant
Waifles: Yep. I won't complain if it was all on her, but I think having her emotions influenced would... enhance some aspect of the story
MST, actually for AZ
AZ mountain time
8:30 central time
yeah I won the Room for you guys
Season 9001
@mattwhite924 debate.
Same here.
They sure took a sci-fi twist for s2

"#Fluttershy is an invite only channel."
*que black ops main menu heavy metal music*
Personally I always thought it sounded like the owl was delicious.
I think
I live in AZ.
i'm not welcome yet
0lol at RatedRPonystar
GMT is INGLAND
Darn you, illegal spoilers. lol
Definitely
Scootaloo, then it will be at 7 AM PST for Season 2
agreed razyn
it's MGT but they don't have daylight savings
otherwise nothing at the end of hte film makes sense
This movie needs more Flute
The channels lock if they are too full
This place reminds me of Alien.
have we seen Birdemic yet
Deckard: not replicant. Why? He lived too long already
Central will be around 7 am
5:22 here.
wow thats early
2,14 pegacorn logged off while I was typing the PM
OH MAN, THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET BRUTAL
Choco 8:00
Nice Owl
/me extra sleepy and has no caffeine.
oh
because that is a movie that must be seen
Hey its owlicious!
spelling fail :(
Go to the theatre page, it shows which channels are open.
Owliwicious!
2,14 it never got through
Mountain time, my bad

8:30? Lame
6:00 in Ariona
http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/twilight
that's stupid...
... TaraStrong's name is in light green and has no < or > surrounding it. I'm confused.
Just look at some pony timer and gigure out from there?
Candles? Seriously?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXNOz-HkoOM
so it starts at 9AM EST rite?
Owloysius
Oh
*Arizona
Owl. Is that where Futurama got the idea?
Neat.
...pegacorn!?
no pegacorn? D:
Great voice acting.
8:00?
FUCK
So have we speculated the general behavior and personality of LUUUUUNNNAAAA for one hour in season 2 yet?
so we are 3 hours behind, that means 6am for me?
when does the doctor show up?
FUCKKKKK
WHUT
So there's another hour... hm
FUCKITY FUUUUUUUUUUU
Scootaloo: I'm at mountain time. s2 will be shown 7am mst
Fluttershy doens't like being overcrowded like this. She freaks out easily
Not for me...
@MuNova Yeah it more than likely would. Though until I hear differently, all I have is Canon to go off of. Then again, I would like to see the Luna story more fleshed out, we know so very little about that time.
i dont mind that at all
IFORGOT TO ADD TO MY ORDER
At least that's what I thought at first.
DragonRage: TaraStrong is using /me
5:22 here as well.
My old film class said that the glasses on this guy are symbollic.
</3
but yeah, birdemic
The text-to-speech program on Moonbase Alpha sounds exactly like--assuming it isn't--Microsoft Sam
the 5 mins lol
Oh hello! I just remembered I have caffeine pills
the coat hanger scene
lol doctor in bladerunner
http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/twilight/
Is that guy speaking in "ominous echo"?
Owl? Reminds me of ARCHIMEDES
"DRAW RAINBOW DASH ON THE PIZZA BOX"
6:21 here
:O
Choco it is *:00
11Use the boost to get through.
SYMBOLISM!!
Yes. Yes he is.

And I was like, I miss Microsoft Sam on my computer
haha
it's amazingly bad
DAMN IT, DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT
I think I'll make ramen before ponies start
*8:00
XD
Gotcha
Hello?
6:21 here
"ah-loo-ish-iss" that's the name I thought it was based from
will it be streamed in this room?
Ah, that makes sense.
hehehehehe
THERE GOES $30 DOWN THE DRAIN
too bad
In keeping with the film's "Eyeball Motif"
that would be awesome
DO A BARREL ROLL
...Ouch.
nah, she just doesn't like being the center of attention
It's a specific language available only to ominous characters.
CYBER CHESS
and the editing
Can a girl be a brony?
05everyone hug Diftraku, or face the might of the trout!
what are they a symbol of?
NorseThunder: No colors :(
which is a dove?
the editor was the worst actor in the film
8:22 here
now its 6:22
I saw the coat hanger scene from Birdemic, I REALLY want to see the whole thing.
Yes
0and I was like, "whats goin in"
No
0Girls are bronettes.
Archimedes, no! It's filthy in there.
Hm... does anypony, when Season 1 starts, want to do a singalong for each song?
So who's staying up until Season II Ep I?
Maybe
/me hugs Diftraku
CloverCloud: yes. I'm a girl. I'm a brony. XP
checkmate!
If only for the fact Anna can't do the roflcopter correctly
Indeed
I have an epipen and six 4lokos
0Or pegasisters.
CloverCloud, yes
yo!
it's fantastic
I do not fear trout, Bacon is where the true power is at
what the hell are they even doing
Me
so... how did we get 527 bronies tonight but during the stress test we only got 200
Awww baaaaaallls
Hallo
I feel sorry for Pizza Hut employees everywhere
MLP Season 2, will it be streamed in this room? =O
I am
god i loved that video
Anyone can be a Brony (technically)
of course a girl can be a brony
ohai boss, it's 1 in the morning, have a chess move
Female Bronies are still Bronies.
@CloverCloud They're called pegasisters.
(Friend next to me recommended)
Pony requests and whatnot
0ya rly
birds making stuka dive bombing sounds and exploding
cancel then order another
/me feels the love
it ist sam
I thought girl bronies were pegasisters?
I'm seriously bummed right now
I'm staying up!
now you're making me curious about birdemic
...You know, it'd be hilarious if they drew G3.5 RD on it just to be trolls.
IMO best one
so much sugar!
Waifles: Yes again, lol. We need more Luna in general, and the whole NMM thing more eloration
Or sissies
It's a gender neutral term.
not seen any of the Birdemic
The traffic lights are all off @me
no they are NOT called pegasister
he cant do the erbrbrbrbr
The modern name is Alouiscius
YAY Milk and Cookies!
Is the season 1 pony marathon still happening?
Salmon >>>>> Trout
No one cars about stress tests
Scootaloo, yes
Everyone is a brony, they just dont know it yet
that is a dirty rumor
just tested :D
Heh. Twas curious. My bro said I wasnt a brony is all.
"Checkmate, I think"
He 'cannot see' the problems the replicants have with thier short lifespans
Archimedes is Merlin's pet owl >_>
Still though, there's always next time.
2,14 eeyup
0Eh, bronette sounds cooler to me.
05not enough hugs given, sigh...
there is metal music?
birdemic is hilarious
0female Could be called pegasisters.
what?
i agree with gender neutarl
Not suspicious at all
Thanks poniator
Dat Owl
Nah, they're pegasisters.
Yeah, shame it came with the worst update.
That said, if somebody doesn't want to be called brony, just call 'em what they want.
I do believe brony is gender neutral and applies to people over the general age target.
LAZER OWL
it's a love story
spidercar!
Screw them, this room is best room
dat owl
ROBO OWL
leamons becuase friendship is magic
Hoo.

Owlowicious
Screw gender politics, if you like G4 then you are a Brony
YA RLY
The eye of evil!
brony is unisex
13Ick, I dislike the "pegasisters" term.
hey look, it's owlowicsious
o rly
Pegasis works, bronette works,
I haven't seen birdemic
Yeah, nothing ws lighting up for me
You get pizza, so it's all good
Whoah, there was an owl.
Bright eyes owl
plus killer bird bombs
O RLY
Pegasister is an attempt to once again create gender specific terms.
Female Bronies are Pegasis, but
@celestia why are you telling me this
B
welcome to the herd.
Who
0lololololol
NO WEI
13I just call everyone "Brony"
Wait is season 2 episode 1 out yet?

who?
lol
its 10 30am
I'm already way happy i finally got the stream to work
imagine The Birds
^
I prefer pegasis, but I also consider myself a brony
Bronies is now a universal term for both girls and boys
owlicious
but with no script
Probably beucase my internet is derping.
Firefox is kind of weird about the traffic lights
sounds like a good b movie to me
Bronies is gender neutral
who?
less budget
I didn't want pizza
Dat owl
Hello everypony. Sorry to interrupt during Blade Runner. But I need some info about the S2 premiere. I don't know what time it will be.
13lol Hai :P
and even less sense
I'm a brony and I'm a girl
0Of course not.
I suppose brony is fair enough.
Just leave it up and they should light up.
Isn't it 17th?
that owl
It comes from 4 chan
I actually ordered Pizza Hut pizza today... sadly I didn't think of asking them to draw somepony
YAY!
Assimilate into the hoard
0It comes out tomorrow.
Post it to me
/me hugs Octavia
Had to boot the page up in Chrome
Rule 34 scene? Hope not. o_e
0Twilight's Owl?
Bronies gonna bron.
So you guys play minecraft?
Hi 'Tavi!
/me is a girl too
0But i'm female and i don't care which one im called.
How do I get in the dash room? I keep clicking the button but it doesn't do anything
Combustiblelemons: this is the real thing
>does not care for Merlin
this movie is READING OUR MINDS
How the fuck are we gonna know when the streans on...
I dislike the term Brony, no troll
After the B-movie.
I don't have any money for pizza
yeah
sounds good to me
:l
Damn it
9:00 EDT
who

Uh... Guy With Glasses there. Can't think of his name

Brony is derived from the "bro culture"
yes, Sklar
Looks more like Pigwedgeon

Terrel

@catface brony.
Octavia Brony comes from /b/ and /r/ and pony mixed
Merlin's cool... :C

That poor little field mouse...IT MUST HAVE BEEN OWLOWLISCIOUS!
In the morning?
who?
Anyone getting a vampire feel?
0There's a bronette in my class.
It's derived from "pony"
Why can't we just be ponyfans
Birdemic showed me that you CAN use a PSX to render special effects for a movie.
Hi Hi!
Girls are bronies.
Dr. Mace Tyrell
I don't have the time to get sucked into another game like that 0.o
I play it from time to time

11AKA That guy with the glasses
MOAR LIFE

The Facts Of Life
Brony actually comes from the combination of "Bro" and "Pony"
Did he say father or fucker? The world will never know
Fluttershy is full atm
Oh poo, can't find dem caffeine pills
11AKA Chester A. Bum
Bronies and colts. /b/ /r/ and /co/
/me 0: For the last time, season 2 will air TOMOROW at 9:00 AM EST
Fluttershy`: Same here. I just prefer to be called pegasis if I'm being pointed out as a female fan
0OF COURSE
Thank you SilkAMV. It's just I live in Britain and was having a bit of trouble finding out, as we don't get the Hub here.
dang, the story lost me
0It comes on Sunday at 8 AM.
in chrome it showed nothing but the adds, not even chat
Dat spacesuit.
you can see the status of all rooms at http://www.bronystate.net/theatre
Silverscreen, where's the random trivia
also, I'd suggest doing a /nick name change anon. It's hard to type out all that to address you
Drakengarde yea, it looks totally real
0Cutiemark Crusaders Chatting!!! Yay!
That's 11pm here D:
like on the batman mov
just look at the traffic lights ;)
I presonally don't see a need to seperate the genders for t with me.
D:
I think he said fucker
So it's 2pm for me!
technically this film does feature a unicorn pony
lolololo~
I hope I'll be able to watch it.
Only 21 rarity fans? :-/
In the Final Cut edition, he says "Father" instead of "fucker"
Dumori: it is good in 1.8?
what was that hitchcock movie with the guys afloat at sea?
Yay
Yup, first time I saw the term, it was spelled /b/ronies
MuNova I like being a tombrony XP
I heard Fucker
and Lupal
xD
Make of that what you will.
get ABP
@NorseThunder try a catchy song
it's a 1.8 seed
What is this movie? It's awesome.
I bet none of use will win the lottery
aww poor AJ and rarity
Myaaaah.
I can't say that on the phone...
Pinkie, Rarity, and AJ are open.
I made it today
why not draw Fluttershy on the ramen box :3
awesome
it's amazing
11Zephirdd: Had too much to prepare for with BronyState to worry about the trivia.
Fluttershy`: but if it's like "Mu is an MLP fan", MLP fan is interchangeable with brony
yeah, probably not
Brony just reminds me too much of the... more obsessive fans of the show
Blade Runner
it will be won my anonymous guys
Lots of science up in this shit.
tombrony or tomcolt.
With the slashes, to show it was from /b/
when is the lottery?
sadly gabe
@justanotherderp bladerunner
When I got here there were only 14
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS BLADE RUNNERS, YAY
who watched Batman the dark knight here?
so when do y'all think the CM crusaders will get their cutie marks?
gmarshal[tl] yes, it's quite deplorable
Also, are we watching movies right now?
Of course, I can't think of that scene without that one line from this one YTP I seen.
Oh, and in some versions, he says "I want more life (Father/Fucker)." Like, both words at once.
The lights don't light up for me in FF or IE. Whatever, Pinkie is best
Ah, nickchange... how do I do it?
0ME
none of which will be present
huge mounins rivers open air casams
...For fuck's sake, Spike! I'm trying to impress the goddamn king, and I can't fucking sing if you can flipping your dick sucking lips! *beating noises*

Did he mention about having Telomerase?
NEVAAA
0I use bronette/pegasister because it's easier to say than female brony.
MuNova: I think of myself as a 'tombrony' but I don't mind being called 'brony'
Dunno
6Need a pony to draw on ramen box? Why not Zoidburg?
"/nick *nick*"

lol xD
awesome quote
it is cool
C9317 Season 14272
season 3 villain will be tim curry.
Rainbow Dash just to be a troll, would require the highest number of crayons
I am to.
0Season 2 starts at 9 AM eastern.

Too little blades and running

how much cussing is allowed in /pinkie?
I NEED to win the lottery again. I will murder all the newfoals to win if I have to.
Trick question! He purposefully pronounced it so that it would sound like both. This was done to avoid unnecessary editing when they wanted to show the movie on TV later on
inb4 pain…
So that if one of you could give me a precition how long this movies takes because I don't wish to spoil it.
gmt will be 1400
I've...seen things
Fluttershy`: By that you mean tomboy brony, right? Or man brony? lol
05PrincessCelestia imokwithis.jpg
Silverscreen was bossmoding on that movie with the random trivia
ehh, what movie is this?
AND THEN DIE LIKE THE REST OF US
@pinkamenadianepie okay looky here
Think of all the things the CMC can try between the three of them...
I've seen Blade Runner about four times
@PinkamenaDianePie that has been asked before, but we're still not sure
when I got here there were only 8, and one of those was the channel server
<PinkamenaDianePie Yes
Yeah Elky me neather but my friend does he actually a administrator on a pony server they spawned like 100 ghast once i arena he built i guess lag was terrible
I will be dissappoint if Season 3 doesn't feature Tim the Enchanter

THAT RIGHT THERE PROVES THE OWL IS MORE USELESS THAN SPIKE
...yeeeeah, i might be back later
The fact I have no idea what's going on makes the scene even more astounding
0I'm confused
is this about vampires or something?
ICE CREAM?
COLORS ARE ONLY FOR MODS
Run man RUN!

I have a hard time caring about this movie
is this page right here the stream when the time comes?
@pinkamenadianepie now the white haired replicant just killed his creator because he couldn't make him stop dying
that's mindscrewier than Inception
0Yes?
i'm working on my drawings of the mane 6
that Owl's left eye...it looks like the moon. Symbolism?
it's almost over..
Seen this movie like a skillion times anyway. Still love it
the replicants have a hard coded life span
Now my head hurts.

fluttercry: *sishoof*

Why is my name yellow?
Meh.
I don't remember that from the book
the chat is at ludicrous speed
Did he died?
hmmm, i think it is trying to say he is just insane
He is now Bat Man.
Memento made me go nuts
Well, I was horrified the first time I saw it
He has met a terrible faith hasn't he
I have a funny word
brb
but it sounded creepy
Silverscreen is a Troper? Not surprising.
that's you
eeyup
they asked to live longer he said it can't be done
i might have to start taking off fridays and saturday mornings :D
LGNR with science!

Scootaloo you missed it, they made an origami of you

owlowiscious Y YOUR NAME SO HARD TO SPELL?
@c9317 if you know what i'm sayin.
Flying cars, we will have them eventually
My Little Midgets <3
0Han shot first.
*Smack*
it's such a good part of the moive and it makes nearly every one uncomfertable
hmm
Her special talent should be a pencil.
Around 12 Hrs till season 2 @MrSirPGW
There won't be an outrage here
Blade Runner
/me 's curiosity is piqued
0You win this round...but i shall strike back!
I see running in this movie, but I don't see any blades
MrSirPGW: About 11.5 hours, good sir
I'll tell whoever your parents are on you.
JustaBrony: Bladerunner
I dunno
Blade Runner
Treasure Planet
I remember nah
apok: and such a little chance to win
Do animated movies count?
that's because they did the "used future, business wear" thing
Probably too niche for a big budget one
Aliens did it too
0Y HALO THAR HARLEY
0Flying cars are implausible.
n1
Nah?...........nah
Thank you
Star Wars Episode 9001.
12 hours and 30 seconds for pst
And now they shoot at the same time.
yeah
that's why it doesn't look dated
RAWRity: All the better to get people to spell it correctly!
we already have flying cars, they're called airplanes
we don't have popcorn but i hate that stuff
these people will love and tolerate the S*** out of you
@hat THanks
I forgot about that one
Yep
Hello
Treasure Planet was SOME kind of ___punk but never did quite nail it

Mr_Santana: seconds?
I think I won a movie back in the first non-GET lottery
mmmm.... nah
lol i only have it if its fresh made
never saw it
What a nice, totally-not-oppressive environment.
nice DashOrCrash
does this movie ever get any better
In the bluRay Han calls the police who then get there and shoot for him
china music?
/me 13isnt a fan of popcorn either :)
I'm still curious
it's pretty boring
how was it?
Coca Cola!
with something like 32 people
11@NorseThunder: Actually, Han shot alone. Guido didn't even shoot in the originally released Star Wars.
sounds like chinses sweetie derelle
So I'm very, very late :p
They didn't have the technology to make it cheesy
It was fun and bright, that was enough.
@norsethunder the world's already 3d
I think in this it's only public service and taxis that are airborn
also
whats with the creepy blimp
I didn't make it up
0Blimps are cool, right?
Cocacola!
0It's also not steropiyical
Wait so when it comes out the streams gonna stream right o.o
minutes
the only time I've won I picked the greatest nick cage movie ever made
google skycar
Derp, I meant 12
....
The light fixtures are simply divine.
Oh, just noticed the stream popout feature. Love it
We're supposed to go to the derpy channel for technical problems, right?
Ohai
There is nothing in the rules about language, amirite?
and got denied
As any realtor will tell you
It's okay actually.
That's no regular blimp.
Han shot first!
heh
Kettlecorn > Popcorn
people are working on it
I wonder if that blimp will play a vital roll in the story
...
I just adapted the line to the situation
In the slightest Rated-rponystar
and the mods are still keeping mum about it
location, location, location
dont matter hero you didnt miss the S1 marethon!
That there is a future blimp.
lol
it will come
Owlowiscious Thank you, it's working too.
at least your stream if ok. I can't even see it. -_-
I'm just sayin, Priss needs to knuckle-bomb him
in the blue ray for star wars, alderaan shoots at the death star
They did have the technology to make it look old, though.
I remember that
stereotypes were being defined at that time
0Stream popout?
is*
That's no moon...
But I'm not crazy about either
Man, this movie is just...AWESOME.
I remember that!
We could never have flying cars now, because of 9/11.
It was an interesting interpretation of the novel Treasure Island
Silverscreen finally puts up some trivia, and it's not for the movie we're watching.
0What's it do?
dirigibles are awesome
maybe in 10 years, maybe 50
I think this chat has gotten stuck on at least 15 separate topics
lol
still waiting for that one...
JustaBrony: yes
Guido was unarmed and had his arms raised, begging for his life.
skyland meets rise of legends :P
special occasion :/
trailmix is my popcorn
I'm hoping for a thanksgiving surprise
I do that often...
maybe even 100
how long is this movie?
I wish we had a machine to do powerful calculations really fast. That would be helpful.

I'm just saying... We're getting all ramped up for episode one but there is SO much to go through. Wasn't it confirmed a few months ago too that season 2 is 24 episodes? This is going to be such a long year....

THE HOUSE HAS HANDS!
@violetvanilla isnt it at 9:00 pm EST?
11So who here is from ponychan and what board thereof?
Denied
One thin I really admire about Inception is that, while there ARE points where they had to use CG, many of the film's most memorable shots are straight up practical effects and camera work, with touches of CG to polish it.
PAWNCH
I just jumped
When's the streaming tomorrow for season 2 of MLP?
I did see the discord design, but nothing else
and the entire co-op the next day

Portal 2 is quality entertainment

He should have chopped off his hand instead

I haven't seen the spoilers
I'm from /co/, 4chan

That gun is so sick man
They should just make the first game free forever, it's great promotional bait for the sequel
Though I got the link from TeamLiquid
Leon was a dick, so he doesn't get a finger
Woah, wtf was with his hand o_O

I don't want to see him com D:
this is my experience with amnesia
I don;t recall seeign Gaff at all
and I know all the voice actors
sequels been announce but we probably wont get any more information till after Ridley Scott finishes prometheus (the aliens prequel)

I've been on it once or twice House
you'll make me explode in excitement
Agreed.
thank you

Pirates of the Carribean looks great IMO.

yes!
minus the awesome convos
XD
bodu rapist
Now I'm really confused.
I'm from /pic/ mostly, though ironically, I don't create visual mediums
Is the player not working for other people, or is it just me?
AND THEN THE MOVIE WAS OVER
MuNova: How's it going?
what's so bad about these characters?
He's going to come alright.
Am I watchig pr0n?
Shelltoon: Yep, it's a ninja-porny
O_o
ZING
this film is a real mindphuck
/b/ counts to 10
i remember it being "the first movie with a non-white damsel" in the paper
yea mostly because of the pony in it :D
And that movie is full of CGI.
If that happened to my precious left hand, I would cry
YUMMY
again with the corpse making out
Hey have any of you guys seen that new my little pony show?
he needs a few seconds with the body before he comes.....
that's also true. IMO Rise of The Planet of the Apes did a good job.
HMMM
Hmm.. it would seem that the robots have learned to love.
mmm, tasty blood.
i visit /co/ and /po/

vampires are supposed to shine in the sun... right before they burst into flames

well of course mulan doesn't count! she's too manly and badass to be a damsel!

That's not how you call a chicken
These characters in particular are replicants, which Deckard is supposed to kill because... well, that's just his job. These replicants are especially bad because they've become self-aware

can someone tell me if it was 9:00 EST or what ever voliet said?

Scootaloo actually they want to be using http://bronystate.net

So if in normal equestria we have a 4:1 mare:colt ratio
13Yes, we've moved to bronystate.net now :P
MuNova, i also have a goatee and sideburns
Why are all these buildings empty?
ArcticPhoenix: Those imba Phoenix/Void openers. :(
leamons nazis come out of nowhere
How long's the intermission?

<i'm with luuuuunaaaaaaa>
..riding a unicorn? AAAAAAAAH MY EYES
You ain't seen nothin' yet
vould have figured that
2,14 this is rather late, yes puppy :P
Well he's both a superhuman and dying. So he doesn't really care for pain or injuries anymore.
its actually not a bad film
There's a scafolding at the top of the building
Your mom's irrational.
it'd be 1:4 on the other world(thats what I suppose)
he dropped it a while back
*could
Octavia and Luna HUG
what can I do?
that howling...
He lost it
he's about to die because his makes made him die 4 years after creation
Oh, unicycle, whoops.
still, seems like the movie's undermining its own point
getting the hell away from you
he isn't sacry enough
Meanwhile: Well, this fembrony likes fembronies, not bronystaches, I'm afraid. lol
it's about 100 mins into the movie
oh SNAP!
0going to hell i think
Where are you going?
Oh ford, you so crazy.

13Yay hugs <3
If you can make it you can be free
unless the point is something else entirely
IS IT AT 9:00 EST................
but
Equestria!
/me hugs Fluttershy`
I can't imagine climbing that with two broken fingers
And this movie seems alright, I'm just like meh
spiderman, spiderman, anything a spider can
What about pinkie riding a unicorn riding a unicycle?
you dont need a gun when youre awesome
how much time left in this? I may go get dinner
That is pretty far up.
I'm hungry.
woot house to my self for a few hours
Celestia: Well, more yo mommaships and carriers were what I was experimenting with
I'm gonna half to rent this movie to see the rest of it... Also, it keeps cutting to this pause screen every few minutes
^
just about to end
Man, straight up goosebumps from this part till the end
I think he blew a fuse.
might I remind you he's doing this with broken fingers
Such a 8adass.
Wait, wasn't Ford's fingers broken a few minutes ago?
Wait, how is he climbing with broken fingers?
darn
He just wants to be like spiderman
so kind of like MGS
MuNova, i wasn't aware we were having 'that' kind of convo.
0wow such a ninja
WHAT'S IN THE BAG
There has GOT to be a more practical way for him to get around
there's considerably more stallions is Canterlot. It's just Ponyville that has a 4:1 female-to-male ratio
I need to see MLP
I remember someone making an statistic out of MLP and he concluded
Luna and Octavia we beat the limit at least but tis so many bronies hehe
i know
really? this movie went by fast
crickettwb I'm pretty sure that's a position in the Kama Sutra
he's gone all kertz on him
so I guess I'll skip the pilot of g4
Scootaloo: i had the same problem, you can just go directly to bronystate.net/theatre/dash/
he broke them back
Man, straight up <body part> from this part till end
Yes but Harrison Ford can climb a building supporting all his weight on two broken fingers.
Didn't he have his fingers broken?
I've seen it a dozen times anyway
4is it at 9:00 EST?
about 15 min left
<PinkamenaDianePie> he popped em back
That must of been hard with 2 broken fingers
He seems to be having a bad day
that 4 out of 5 mares should be a lesbian or un-paired
lol
and some cuts and bruises, and he's terrified out of his mind.
That too, I will never climb anything higher than maybe... ten feet. Dastardly afraid of heights
whats wrong with him?
Octavia: Idk how to do the hug/action thing here, but you can have a hug from me if you want! :)
I'm going to stop talking now.
is the chat across all Video rooms?
who?
no colors
Poor Harrison.
what a boss
I keep trying to get my friends to watch the show but they never get past the pilot :P
Deckard?
13No colors please. :)
Ominous bell toll.
or
Hahaha
ArcticVanguard: I don't think I've ever seen a carrier in ladder. :S I might just be too bad.
0if harrison ford is freaking out, you better damn well be freaking out
after the movie, it's only 12 hours left
He always gets beat up.
Norse: He's Harrison Ford, he does what he wants. Don't question him
Octavia: I should get Vinyl in here too though
yes
It's a skill Quiltone
the terrified is a plus
that's probably for the best
its 10:40am in australia
What is this playing? I just got in.
Alright, where does a clocktower fit in with this city?
movie has 5min tops
Woah. There's an autocensor?
...or drastically.
the stallions are always at home with the kids
*spoiler*
wow... 12 hours
:I
or Big Mac could really be the Ponyville Pimp
This just keeps getting worse.
damn, my liqourice has syrup all over it
13But yes, the premiere is at 9am est :)
blasphemy
Blade Runner
JustaBrony: You mean the Season 2 Premiere? Then yes, it's 9 AM EST.
I can't believe it's finally here
Oh great, everyone's favourite nu88y horned raging im8ecile is here.
goosebumbs aren't bodypart
For Ford the BElls TOLL
Bladerunner is playing atm
youd be suprised what humans can do when terrified
so does being in this chat mean you know who best pony is?
At the dramatic point.
oh
I'm successfully converting my sister currently
Clocktowers fit in everywhere.
Heeeeeeere's Pinkie!
Severus: It be Blade Runner, dear sir
It's like reverse Smurfs
Gentleponies.

Big Mac idea is interesting
I need to get one.

PinkamenaDianePie: I never noticed Octavia in season 1, I think. D:
The sets here are pretty damn nice
The only voice actor I want in an episode is the guy that plays Edward Elric
Because this is the rarity room, everypony gets smores.

Use www.bronystate.net
gaaaaah, discord
I concur there Silverscreen.
at the moment I'm on Dinkypage, going to bronystae.net itself does nothing.

ARCHIMEDES
hey look, the atmosphere
wtf just happened
I watched the pilot two or three weeks before the finale, but my headphones broke and I wasn't going to watch it without them
Well
Oh, so its a parody
Epic
Dramatic villain monologues are never a good idea. Except for the fact that the good guys never seem to take advantage and just kill them.
That...
Suddenly sunlight
BEST SCENE EVAR!!!
I'm confused
His last act was to save his enemy.
time to die
lol he BSODed
He died
OMG IT's the SUN!
Was fucked up
That was epic
Hoo
Q and Discord have the same actor.
suddenly friendship
uhhhh yeah it does....
Good night, sweet prince
he dead
Epic is what happened
Flying away... :(
Yeah it's satire
Aww I missed it. :(
Such a goooood scene
I want to see the B movie
Wait, he was trying to kill him then he just died?
poor guy
whatever happened to Vangelis?
No it doesn't.
I love this ending
Pretty deep.
I watched the pilot in the dead of night
And then Harrison shoots him.
Quiltone yeah that too :P
Archimedes, no! It's filsy in zere.
MrMaxaminus :D
robot just decides to die
because its streaming for me....right now
:'(
It has the old veemi stream.
WHAT
started watching pony april 1st
Silverscreen: Yes lol
Q= discord?!
so awesome he dies standing up
smart move gabe
mind blown
AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
Because the replicants are the humane ones in this movie
his lifespan ran out
wait. wat.
well to be fair this one was already dying.
Ford, push him off the building.
well SITTING up at least
not a very clever robot, is he?
then I started watching again the week of the finale
It's a trap!
0Norse AHAHAHAHA
same i wonder what it's like
so poigant
@desertman2 Replicants have about four years to live. His time was up.
just so I can appreciate how much better FIM is
vangelis still does film soundtracks
wha
Sparta kick!
I'm having a problem with the bronystate.net site though. Here, I'll copy/paste my question
Ribs grow back! (No zey don't.)
@desertman2 no, he just saved him, and then died
Dumb telephone.
friggen ploy twist
.....was that the camera behild them?
540
whaat iis thiis crazy human moviie aboutt?
then pinkie pie threw a party... the end
I'm having a bit of trouble reopening the stream through the main site. Going to http://bronystate.net/ then clicking Theatre brings me to the pony room selection, but clicking on a pony does nothing.
wow....great ending. That was a really good job
No, the point of the scene was to show the dude how he felt
I have NO idea whats happening right now
aside from when they killed some people
All he wanted was to live a little longer :(
Thunder_Dash: I remember nothing from when I used to watch MLP, lol. Should I continue avoiding the previous shows like the plague or what?
PurpleFridge THAT
All I know is that it is currently streaming...embedded, and is working fine.
MLP made me watch Doctor Who, now it makes me wanna watch Star Trek.
I was gonna everything>G3.5 but someone beat me to it
just rarely
but yeah, I went through the stages in about a month :P
I bet he was freaking cold after that director called cut!
;___;
yeah, short life-span
And Q was known for just popping up during an episode to mess with Jean Luc Picard.
Yeah.
that was amazing
Was that the medic/
Counfound these ponies
Howdy!
sorry march 1st
Heh, Leon wasn't
Moustache guy
and that, kids is why you shouldn't use your robot to download music illegally
0ITS A GERMAN TRAY!
first the 'wtf am I watching'
FAMOUS LINE NOW!
Are you using FF?
HI ORAGAMI MAN
The video won't load for me
I love his hat!
And would just teleport around the set.
13I've... not even really been watching the movie. :P
Is that Harrison Ford?
that guy looks like V
FF?
I ccan't watch that scene enough
They don't make 'em like this anymore
0As always, back up is late
Oh hey its admiral adama!
Man, the chat speed sometimes...
then the 'um... this isn't actually too bad'
Because walking is for losers.
Firefox
TOO BAD SHE WON'T LIVE

Of course it is.

If so, try chrome.

Edward James Olmos looks so different when he was young
Turns out the asshole knows english the whole time
07problem solved
I approve of his headwear
Hi guys, lost the link to the main stream, any help?
V RULES
But then again who does?
Inevitably.
i have at the derpy spots
No, this is why you should opt for cybernetics.
Shidoshi: You on LQ?
RobotPinkie I know right? ;__;
I hate how Ridley Scott is going to make a sequel
BUT THEN AGAIN WHO DOES?
Shidoshi try low quality
was better than i thoguth
wait, what happened, i missed it
I love it when the chat freezes, and then speeds up a lot.
Same. I love this movie.
orly?
watch us all become G1 fans next
13Too busy to. lol
then 'Fluttershy is my favorite!'
k.
thought
Luna: gonna just go download mIRC instead. ^^
I was actually going to be all omg you guys watch ponies what morons but then i watched and was like my god ponies.
07Barberaboy www.bronystate.net
I get broadband ads and 10'000 visitor messages
Less fatal errors.
It's so cool.
(not anymore :P)
HI SHIDOSHI!!!!!!!
deep man
MuNova; I dunno, I just generally avoid non-G4 on principle
everyone's so quiet, I feel like a loudmouth
07that works too
@Robikku no they don't sadly
>tossing a priceless custom revolver onto the ground
yea :D
A sequel?
G1 is acceptable I guess
so what is wrong with dinky page then?
Never!
Norse: Totally, right?
/me is on mIRC
0aa
then 'This is a great show!'
Mindf**k Alert: Harrison Ford is a Replicant.
i use xchat 2
Barberaboy http://bronystate.net
Anyway, how do I join another channel?
dunno
will it not work once the stream starts?
Scott is doing a sequel to what?
They're going to make a sequel to this?
Thanks luna!
I will give scott the benefit of the doubt till I see the sequel
How?
mods and their dutys, keep them away from their underlings
/me is on PCat
/me is on mIRC as well~
Words of wisdom from Captain Adama
Midnight Castle is pretty sweet
Because behind this mask, is an idea Mr. Johnson, and Ideas.....are bulletproof
*PChat
yeah
It's raining outside for me.
/me hugs Fluttershy` "I'm scared"
Nothing, we just don't use it any more.
then I let it slip accidentally-on-purpose to a few friends
and that's how equestria was destroyed by skynet
can anyone hear me?

Puppy The robot/thing decided to die. So he did.
0BOOM HEADSAWT
It must be awkward, holding your gun like that.
Yup
its definetly worth reading, i laughed my ass of
2,14 eeyup
not really
my Ex-GF slams me for it
I'm listening to Mulan's "I'll make a man out of you" behind this.
then bought some brushables.... then went full brony
....pinkie?
like I give a fuck
It's so awesome.
/me comforts RobotPinkie "shhhh"
I enjoyed this
hah, nope, never been trolled
Thunder_Dash: Yeah, same. I feel too old to like the older ponies, plus I dislike the old art style. lol
Why would we use it?
No, chat messages don't make noise.
he'd been dying for the last hour or so.
I was pretty sure I was gonna like it before watching it
Before I started watching, I saw a hurt and heal thread on a forum and didn't want Fluttershy to win, so I voted Rainbow Dash
We have a .net.
DSNsmith i make sure everybody knows
He let Harrison Ford live so someone could remember him.
I've never seen Mulan.
Ghost the host is best pony
ok, chrome works.
/me is going to change his nick...don't want that "`" there
The proper response is to give them a hug.
IDGAF about trolls
I was like "Okay, I'll give it a shot" And the I was like "OMG PONIES ARE AMAZING!"
i've seen a review of the earlier g's
so if anything, I can still use it and will be fine?
people give me the usual wtf man?
<Slowter> very nice use of that one
WAT
Shit got fingers broken, shit got saved from falling, then shit died.
im happy i joined this channel
So, I'm a little out of the loop. S2 starts at 9 a.m. EST right?
It's awesome.
0 10 MINS!!!!
I wonder if it will have the "happy" ending...
G1 ain't all that bad.
yeah
guys
Well it won't work.
they're built with a hard four year max lifespan.
but no dedicated pony haters
Oh man... I just made cream
uh oh dis dont look good
fucking love that quote
Luna and VioletVanilla I don't understand mIRC o-o;
just watch
13Indeed Shadowx :P
Eeyup.
Meanwhile: Missing out on a great movie!
II love iit when myy iinternet cordd pop2 outta my computer, ggreat dday
Well, i hope it will be better than the sequel to the other 80's sci-fi cult-movie: Tron.
.....mark?
Mulan is quite good
fans? doubt it. But I am exited to see what the movie's like.
Mmmmm<3
Rachel?
What's the IRC network? I want to connect through xchat
Let's get down to business
Sharp wit finishes a troll in one.
is there a way to get the HQ stream embedded?
I love the awkward looks whenever someone walks into my dorm
A troll tried to troll a pony thread on a forum I go to
RACHEL?
Harrison Ford is best actor.
No. This is the 90s cut.
When does this movie end?
are you going to watch the announcement?
why does it work now?
:D
G1 had pretty awesome villains.
Currently someone is streaming LQ, so that will work.
0Soon
and sees my little pony dolls all over my desk
And just think folks. This is set just 8 years from now.
Mulan makes me motivated.
But that's about it.
NEVER
To defeat
How Prometheus turns out will probably determine whether or not I have high hopes about the Blade runner sequel
Thx Crazyjay
Press X to Rachel
He failed miserably because we loved and tolerated him
the huns
I love it when, for a paragraph or two, the writing gets really good.
lol
ok
She dead
Pinkamena: irc.bronystate.net
Man this movie is shorter than I remember
Soon
Flying cars here we come!
and my mane6 wallpaper
wow, I just realized how much I've been talking on here
damn the made a total 1 80 with 4
But this is one of the only times we've streamed LQ and HQ.
Very soon, BronyGuy
Rookeealding: I may consider giving it a look then, if I end up with the time to... lol
And now to see what ending it will be.
2,14 he's so young in this...it's uncanny
Well if i win the lottery we'll see it next week :P
x
they always stop for a second
Pinkamena irc.ponychat.net
ill attempt to try a different browser
SuperBrony64: Thank you <3
What's going to happen for Intermission, today?
Midnight Castle is the only pre-G4 pony I've seen thus far that I've enjoyed
I should probably shut up...
glance over everything
Press X to Not Die
THIS WORLD IS MADE OF LOVE AND PEACE!
do it
RD is my phone wall paper
Hence the lack of Ford voiceovers
and then try to not mention it at all
DO IT
Almost 100% of the time dinkypage won't do anything for you.
do it
11You know what I suddenly thought of?
bahaha
it's hilarious
I keep getting this pause scene every few minutes. WHat up?
Don't do it
z
When's the intermission?
yeah it's pretty much us and trebthegamer
0boom
Just use the .net
x
Do it
Same here, it looks like it'll at least be better than G3.
2,14 intermission will be very special, you'll see :P
Press X
xxxxxx
We watched that movie 9 times in various classes Senior Year'
0headsawt!
He didn't press X
Two triggers. Cuz one isn't cool enough
For being a movie star, Harrison Ford is actually quite a good actor.
Whoops, I mean irc.bronychat.net
This movie shouldn't be as good as it is, I mean it doesn't have CG aliens in it or anything
Pinkamena
suddenly, Silverscreen thoughts.
X
Pinkamena it changed to irc.ponychat.net
boo!
Why eyes closed?
DSNesmith i go yeah i go i watch ponies and then there like what and then im like you want to get put down punk
aw she died...
11Care Bears redone by Lauren Faust.
My cousin gave me a strange look when he saw my fluttershy wallpaper lol
next week we should watch Cowboys and Aliens as a comparison for how much Ford had aged
except for the occasional guy who comes in
DSNesmith I'm laughing for real right now
Uh oh.
0gasp!
x..?
and goes
Random Movie Fact: Ridley Scott never answered the question to fans of whether or not Harrison Ford was a replicant. After 20 years or so, and the release of the special edition, he finally answered that he is indeed, a replicant.
ECKS!
ooo
Lol, I've been on IRC with my BlazBlue.com buddies
07Clonehunter try the LQ stream
LOL NO
i need more energy drink
I have a pony wallpaer, login backgorund, and browser
Rather she didn't press X
"My Little Pony?"
WHAT
and I go
I sense a jump scare
This is the 1st time I seen this movie
no no no no no no
She's dead, Jim
no
You should upfront ask one once: Which is better, Fluttershy or Pinkie Pie?
"Fuck yes."
13Intermission video sucks. >:|
I don't actually show my love for ponies
and they go
daddy why is she sleeping
cool!
Wut
Darth Vader: NoooooooooooOOOOOooooooooo!!
he's really old now.
wtf im sleeping
"Nice."
That sounds ominominominous, Valthe.
*LES DOUBLE GASP*
JESUS POWERS
NONONONONONONO
0(SPEARS SILVERSCREEN!)
Oh Gods no
Everytime a teacher asked what movie, we always said Mulan
11RANDOM THOUGHT: Care Bears redone by Lauren Faust.
NOPE
He's still the best thing in that movie
still great though.
How was that assumed?
eeeeenope Darf14
and a profile pic on facebook
or not
Gun has two triggers?
Octavia: >>
mind = blown
GORT get over here
heh I stick discreet with a new lunar republic background
It was hilarious
I'm still living in secret...
or....or not
sorry to ask this, but how much longer is this movie
It's irc.bronychat.net Pinkamena
0:D 10 MINS WOOT!!!
My Little Pony G1 had villians, had adventure, it just was badly made
wut.
I'd have to kill you...
13:D
Whoah, she's not dead.
this is where the spiderman kiss came from
id watch it
some guy in my dorm drew a RBD on the whiteboard
Time for the sex scene
silversceen Yes
SIlver screen..... no
0is the mlp movie going to be good?
Well, a year ago, we woulda said the same thing about MLP
Maybe, Silverscreen.
2 barells too
nobody can tell its mlp :D
but he's not a brony
I think it's implied at some points
Gun has not enough triggers.
No one seems to care
Silverscreen: can it be done?
DOAR OPAN
Silverscreen I don't think it would go over nearly as well as MLP did
yet.
cuz earlyer
because he drew the G3 one
/me is now pleased
the LQ dinkypage stream appears to be the same quality as the HQ bronystate.net stream. huh.
and LF could remake it perfectly
Dang, I was hoping for a scary scene
boo care bear2 2uck
yeah
And then her face explodes and an alien jumps out and shlongs Ford in the eyeball.
I don't have any merch. don't really want any either. Except maybe plushies.
I was like
carebears were hardcore
Also, Mulan music makes this better.
Care Bears by Micheal Bay would be better.
up next: lottery for next weeks movies!
NOOOOO
Actually, I'd like to see Lauren redo a boy's show. Add more girl protagonists and such.
Is there anyone here who doesn't have something pony related in their room?
RACHEL RACHEL God shut UP
@mallam no
Is it really that bad, Octavia?
Pinkamena no its irc.ponychat.net
I hope to hang out with bronies on the pony channel sometime. lol
much better...
it would be awesome
Care Bears is something like Telettubies
Eeyup.
well id try it
Stupid question: how do I join other channels? :|
so I dragged him out of his room
what server is this chat on?
Have awesome fight scenes
I have giant apiture chicken as my PC background
I actually still live in secret... I always hide the desktop and my pony browser theme
THEY SHOOT LASERS FROM THEIR CHESTS
I guess I'll watch the B movie
0ok lol
There was one guy I saw on facebook who is apparently a brony
I thought about a Strawberry Shortcake reboot awhile ago.
and showed him the proper one
The MyLittlePony movie is definitely not bad, it's not amazing, but it's not bad.
damn,I've got pis and needles in my foot
Atleast he can still do the vulcan salute
That is win right there, people
silverscreen: still crap, carebears has no capacity for improvement
DSNesmith thats a war crime
Quote from earlier: "That test you run. Have you ever tested yourself?"
For Science.
As I recall G1 had the ponies solving problems by either crying or forgiving people.
now comes the question: is Deckard a replicant?
Origami Unicorn!!!!!
Press X to Rachel
i need the server adress
!
as I was one of the first to find the image in the ARG
SNAP
Katida: /join "#Channelname"

G1 had a surprisingly high body count
"Shut up, guy in my head"
>mfw I saw one of my aunt's friends with Rarity as her default pic on Facebook
Then of course, there's the fact he seems to have no problem wanting to bang a robot.
With all the force of a raging fire.

Hopefully, the MLP movie won't suck as much as it should.

9okay guys, after the premiere tomorrow
EverYPONY!

DAVID SCHARF provided the electron microsope photographs
Alcohol is most likely a good idea right now.
fluttercry: I'd go with ramen
the .net site isn't working for em.
it will scare you
BE PREPARED
chips and dip, NOS and sprite. and fruit loops/milk for the premier
... And then I was like, Oatmeal?! Are you CRAZY?!
but I'm not sure if I will
FOR THE SHITTINESS OF MLP
does it have the monty python intermission music?
i dont think i can handle the level of friendship that will occur during the mareathon so i will be back tomorow OR DIE TRYING
what if it turns out that derpy is an evil enchantress.
well you can do it then and now, seeing how far apart they are
I hope Octavia was kidding about the video being bad...
Ramen
is there any way to make it so the stream and embed stay next to each other if they're wrapping automatically?
if it does, you win
:o
NOW...
SMOOZE
THE 1986 MOVIE

Can we expect any less from someone with such an awesome name, ValtheJean?
pmv, no to which

This music makes me want to build a robot so I can shoot it.

Well
Was thinking maybe Betelguese
mmm is there any reason this stream puts the chat below the video in such a way that you can't do both at once?
And lottery is today or tomorrow? Stream says today but the email says tomorrow
EVERYBRONY, GO TELL YOUR OTHER BRONY FRIENDS, LET'S REACH AT LEAST 600 VIEWERS
