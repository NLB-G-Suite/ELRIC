Oh snap that reminds me I was going to do a comic reaction >>
Typical.
announcement before or after lotto finishes?
clopfics.... why are we mentioning them in PG chat (im kidding, I know we are talking in context)
to that fanfic
i never red it
11which means it's time for this week's Movie And Episode Selection Lottery!
i dont intent to read it
When I want this to work.
It doesn't.
When I'm not ready for this to work.
4WOO
It works.
I read it. It encouraged me to be a Brony.
=___=
c:
/me 4hopes he's chosen for "A" film
thats sad
We dont talk about CupCakes here, dont even mention it in passing.
2,14 inb4 hax :P
Or at least, somewhat.
Quite its obviously a dystopian peice expressing how the violent nature of the ponies is self destructive ( or in more direct terms cannibalism) like seriosuly it's not just hoorible gore and evil
They don't call hax.
cupcakes spawned some great songs, though
I even read it at night, went sound asleep.
They called RIGGED!
11The mods will give about a minute for each selected brony to respond, so if you decide to get up to get something or go to the bathroom, you might want to make it brief.
It didn't bother me at all, gore never does...In fact, it actually made me crave sweets after I read it.
i give it credit for that
:P
13I hope I win lots of money! Oh wait... its not that kind of lottery... well that really rustles mah jimmies!
4IT'S A CONSPIRACY! >: O
LIKE A BOSS
but the original is shit

thats alright right?
not that transformers much, i just love the movies
13Gah! TO THE MOOOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAAA with you!
I'm a Sonic nut to be honest.
So... what rule is the one where there's a gender opposite?
07random number generator :P
Mario
I don't see Dayman on the list
4He picked Se7en a couple months ago
Looks like a definite A to me.
Spin: Needs to look more like FiM though.
I'm a Naruto nut myself.
13Its your choice, dude. :)
4That's why I have an idea in place
CrimsonFoxx: I think most bronies like sonic, judging by the fanart I've seen
07pcZuelo
11ah, so it wasn't recent then.
I'm a pony nut
6Octavia is not happy~ lolol
everypony is.
Rule 63, keyframe
I think that's rule 63.
KeyFrame: Really? GTFO
13lol I'm fine. Just pickin. :P
11Blade Runner is totally an A movie.
Ok
Not into Sonic all that much, but Dash and Sonic make a cool duo.
octivia whats wrong with my choice?
we good?
4Recent in my eyes
with sklar that is
Pony Nonsense
07yep
Nothing.
6iamokaywiththis.jpg
Ok.
07got it noted down
Hmm, I think the CMC would be better with the plastic non-brushable hair. You can't really achieve the appearance of their hair in the show with the synthetic brushable hair.
Dash and Sonic are the same person, basically. :P
13I'm not a fan myself, but its not my choice. :P
K, I found someone on youtube that does voice acting for the mane six.
Dash is very close to being a sonic expy.
lol.
I found another Pony pairing I bet nobody thought of: Tails and Fluttershy.
Also APPLBLOOM HAS NO RIBBON! What the hay?
2,14 don't see Dayman anywhere
07our second winner is PCZuelo
*Applebloom
And, Anti-Charger, Naruto is also popular in this fandom I notice. Mason and I are both fans.
Must have left then.
oh god, CMC toys spoted
Awesome

Good to have some Narutards here as well
It's like a stunt double, except I do the drinking and smoking.
and Charilee as well
07PcZuelo please tell us the B movie you would like to watch us
So I began a countdown until season 2
I'm slightly less bored than I was before
07with us*
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:11h:26m:29s
I've drawn 4 days so far
!s3
I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
Uh
13>watch us
Fluttershy be next.
07I fixed!
07>:
13Doing what?! D: lol
2,14 the movie.....IT'S WATCHING ME
And she actually came out surprisingly awesome.
I'm not so much a Narutard as I am a disenchanted fan from the olden days of Part 1, continuing to read the manga for closure.
Now
Octavia: Oho! ;)
07oh u!
13Movieception!
Eh
6PLEEEAAASE PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASSSSEEEE
I love all naruto
I'm new around here :-)
I'm taking my leave for a bit now
Although there are some aspects of the latest stuff I enjoy.
Going to go stock up on Lego Minifigures.
You've got the choice of a 'B' movie.
The latest stuff is great.
Later, Anti-Charger
13Well, what B movie would you like to see? :)
07Ah.. well you were picked in our lottery.. and you get to pick the B movie
bye bye for now.
So low budget or generally sort of 'so bad it's funny' movie.
Mason: Ironically, I didn't like Part 1 that much. But I watch the anime, primarily
2,14 or cult film
11Or cult films.
That movie trailer
13Cult classic, low budbet, that stuff.
Who said Naruto
13*budget
How dare they mention Naruto.
I'm getting no sound, Sketchy
I prefer One Piece myself
Shaico: Several of us.
No audio :(
MFW bjornfort is number 4.
inb4 bjorn bitches again
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
Thank you!!
D
=D
Naruto is alright, I've only seen part 1 so far but hopefully rhe angst will dial down in part 2
Please don't let PcZuelo decide to give up their choice.
XD
13Lmao
I honestly don't care much for One Piece.
lol
07*headbangs*
And, Dudeguy, that'
/me is on her haunches~
please let PcZuelo surrender the choice to me :P
Dudeguy: The angst zigzags in part 2.
I just wish that Dragon Ball Z hadn't gone overboard in the Buu saga
isn't gonna happen
Don't mean to press you PCzuelo, you got anything?
Wow.

So back to the matter if anyone is looking for an awesome yet short anime series look up Angel Beats one my all time facs
*favs
My Little Pony: The Movie (1986)
YES
Shaico, D:
11...
THAT WAS MY B MOVIE CHOICE
07oh yes!
AHAHAHAHA
BJORNFORT <3
13Trolololol
4Brilliant

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
:3c
11NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
13Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
07great choice!
FUCK YEAH!
problem, bronies?
that was exactly what I suggested for our "pre-chosen" stream next week
Sounds working now, Sketchy.
4Amazing choice
Trololo
Shaico: I'm very sorry our discussion has upset you so much. But please try to understand, it's not like we were deliberately trying to anger you or anything.
13DAT TROLLING
/me yawns. "Hi Octy."
U mad viewers?
4No prob from me, Bjornfot
2,14 I love it
Yeah, I like the humor in one piece too, though I mainly like that at times the characters feel emotions so strongly that it feels a lot more believable, and the fact that it has some of the most unique powers I've seen in any anime.
Solo relax dude. xD
13Y U DO DIS YO US?!
4You know
Anyone got anything else to say?
07Alright
6lololol
Not starting a flame war here.
07let's see who goes first
2,14 John Madden?
11eeenope.
Stream is also going more smoothly, Sketchy.
07Ponies or Blade runner
4I have to believe that Bjornfot did that for the marathon
4He's such a trooper
13To quote Zecora: You're doomed.
/me is disapoint
11NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don't care why he did it, I love him for it.
it seems stable, Sketchy_Sounds
Gonna have to speak up, though. Can't hear you very well. Sounds like you're mumbling.
13Dat singing voice.
Ok.
07and Blade runner will be our first movie
4Calm down, dude :P
2,14 and of course, now we're going to make sure the pre-show is ONLY sea ponies :P
how did ya fix it?
11...
4This fits great for us
Sounds good on my end
07resuming the show
Now to our B movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show
11I'm sorry, but this song kinda sucks.
13Yayy~
...
Alright, that's better.
Oh wait.

Another pony episode?

Octavia, XD
2,14 nope

11The accompaning rock does NOT match.
Eeeeeeevening everypony!
Octavia: How shameful. Of course he was only streaming it.
Hey
2,14 next week is our super special re-streaming of Season 1
Howdy, Leika
Ok, anyway.
Oh sure I said f**k but Octy mentions porn and it's all right. >.>

Ok, who knows what do to when they call Brad and Janet's name?
The entire movie isn't talking lips, right?
musicals arent really my cup of tea
Who's Tim Curry?
Those who are virgins to this movie-- be afraid. Be VERY afraid.

2,14 Idontwanttoliveonthisplanetanymore.jpg

he was satan once
He's also Nigel Thornberry.
ghosties: just don't actively try to dislike it
13Oh goodness, I've heard people used to do that. Dress up for the movie when they went out to see it. Little before my time though.
I mean tim curry
Ghosties, you gotta cheer up man.
Going to a real life show is waaay better than anything else.
So let me guess the extended part of this movieyis the opening.
DID SOMEONE ORDER A LARGE HAM
Back in the day, I went monthly.
Didn't RA3 not do so well?
6I DON'T WANNA LIVE ON THIS PLANET ANYMORE~
Bruce Campbell is BEST ACTOR EVER
Tim Curry voices Arl Howe in Dragon Age: Origins.
Val: Tim Curry sucks
Most of the cutie marks are at least a little abstract, Pokey Pierce notwithstanding
Octavia, I used to do it
red alert was still the worst one
6inb4 ninja'd o.o
I ORDERED A LARGER HAM
U mad?

Fun Fact: Leve Stubbs was also Mother Brain in Captain N
SAY IT
antici........PATION
Rocky HOrror ponies? Not Sure if want
Incorrect, Transvestites stay male, merely preferring female Clothing. You're confusing it with Transexualism, where they desire a body change.
magenta's the curly redhead
PATIONC
YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON
PATION
antici...........................................................pation
Oh.
Hoovesylvania

He would be Locutus of BOND.
0世界の0What ...
aspecially next week, since the b movie is gonna be awesome

Hoovesexual Hoovsylvania?

....takes the elevator back up. LIKE A BOSS
What am I watching and why am I enjoying it
Yes. Transvestites crossdress, but they still identify with their own gender. Transsexuals identify with the other gender.

i had to mute it :(
And then this movie was best of years
As does everything about dashie

Mason_Trowel: A lot of people view romance as innocent and pure.
Good place for a loudspeaker
Today, we send a candy bar through television!
A couple 2 or 3-parters with a villain, i could enjoy that, but a change of tone to something Dark or GrimDark wouldn't be nice at all.

You do not simply watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show; you experience it.

@Randomdude202 lol

So much fun
I have played Minecraft. I hate it.
Gotta look on the bright side of death!
Nox is epic
I'm very sorry Silver
Tim Curry had far too much fun with this.
But that's one mans opinion

Am I even a man?
Why, if I may ask MUB?
a banana?
11Well, if you say so Dari
No.
...i'm scared
Rocky is amused
07why?
This movie is why Tim Curry will ALWAYS be awesome.
very scard.
Nox?
he's ok...
*scared
kinda sexy though...
I don't like minecraft
Tim Curry always has fun with his roles, that's what makes him such a good actor!
LOL.

KShrike: You play Nox?
11The only time I remember saying anything about in the Mane chat is just mentioning "Bunker", usually to get herospirits attention
6The #bunker thing is really annoying... -_-;
No...
Brent Spiner had a ton of fun with Data, too.
0Damn brad is tall

There are so many sexy updates in 1.8

7Pm hero
Nox, the creater of Minecraft
11I think Hitler would be proud.
Hey the tank is filled with rainbows! That's why it works
11As for how news about it got to BronyStateMods
but, my policy is thus:
Its the type of game I could really get into, but I've played game I like more and are cheaper
I MADE HIM FOR ME.
KShrike: God damnit.
:)
7I mean, when you talk just pm hero
*Notch
shh
His name is Notch
SUDDENLY... GODWIN.
Whoops
What?
Cavestory for instance.
Hitler would be proud, had he not turned Hipster.
so long as their craziness stays out of the main chat (my jurisdiction) let them do what they want
Now I feel stupid
:S
ANOTHER SONG
Dr_Frank_N_Furter: lol XD
WHAT A GIFT
http://notch.tumblr.com/
07of course!
dat reference
guffaw guffaw
Nox is a cheese wheel designed to rule Antarctica by 1500 BC in my mentally unstable mind. Now, why are you reading this? You're wasting your time. Seriously. Stop reading my mentally unstable ramblings.
11Eh, Okay. Herospirit, make sure you dont miss it when I do PM you
KShrike: Nox is one of my favorite games.
it's been like, 40 seconds since the last song. Calm the fuck down movie.
Weights?
I'll try to remember
Every time a song starts take a shot
This is a musical. What do you expect by this point?
Where's the stream schedule list? I can't find it on the site.
11Lol
this movie loves the music.
Dat sugar!
Nox? Like Hubrid Nox? (Someone get that reference)
keep going!
lol. Notch is hosting the leaked version

oh tha'ts what that is

worst gift evar
ohgawd
you will get drunk so fast

Shot heck. I'm taking a full stein.
tee hee
i think i need an adult.
07strong man
STROOOOONG MAN
STRONNNG MAN!
DOCTOR FOR PINKIE PIE?
No. Nox is an isometric action-game. It's vaguely similar to diablo in terms of layout, but it isn't an RPG.
STROOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGG MAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNN
sol more than 20 seconds between songs. Just amke it an opera at this point.
11Agreed.
This movie will NEVER cease to be amazing!
Sorry, Alterego, I don't get the reference.
11And I wasnt really sure if he could force himself upon us or not anyway.
4What is #bunker?
11Just annoyed that I caught shit for doing my job.
13A MAN!
07YES!
I'm not even sure what the fuck is going on
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ppn7T7MpI
RAWRity: Imagine this as a broadway musical.
A MAAAAAAAaaaahaaaaanaanaan
THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME
It's a straight-up action game. You can do stuff like, for instance, see a wizard shoot a fireball at you and cast a spell to swap-location with him
I'M GONNA MAKE A MAN
OUT OF YOUUUU
it's the place they go to bitch about certain mods
forcing him to eat his own fireball and die.
wait
Trust me, it calms down later
I can't stand Isometric games. Then again, I barely play any games.
work that vault
Hero-- you're not really MEANT to.

Sax with Meatloaf. This could not possibly get better.
Only epic bikers carry saxophones instead of guns with them.
07good!
yet i havent seen any weird art or shipping in the neopet culture
Then suddenly, saxophone.
this causes me saxgasm
First time I saw this movie was on New Year's, at about 3am, while on alcahol and energy drinks. If you think it makes no sense on a normal day, just imagine that for a minute.
13Lovely party~
All we ask is that you not advertise on our main chat
Okay, so who are the bikers?
That's all
Challenge accepted.
Nope, Sweet Transvestite is the best.
I was playing Age of Mythology when I started Neopets
good choice Luna, good choice ;)
so why are these bikers here? kicks?
Rule 34 must live.
I think it was that it was more of a little kid thing.
someone should put sweetiebell's face on meatloaf.
TO THE GIMP MOBILE!
shits and giggles
He looks like Jack Black >:
Luna, I know I always end up asking you this, but, how far through the movie is this?
I want to hold his sax.
crazy eyes loaf has tehre.
everything will be explained in time
THIS IS THE BEST GALA EVER
13Dat dancing
!
07not telling :D
Rule 35 in action
0Does Sweet Transvestite have MeatLoaf? Didn't think so.
Neh, it can wait a few hours.
7We try our best not to, Rainbo is the only one who does, and he needs to stop
That's why I said.
07just enjoy :D
As far as I could tell no adult touched it. Unless you were there on the RP boards.
And then they fucked
THIS IS A LOVELY PARTY.
Lordlyhour: Heh.
11Okay, and as for you being interested.. What do you mean? >.>
Who wants to join a mash pit?
oh lawd
"if you mention this place in the main chat"

This calls for a flank slam.

Penetration time!!! You'll see what I mean!
IF you were doing something seriously against our rules here and linking bronystate membes to it.
I never Neopeted
HATERS GUNNA HATE
Tis' a nice Harley..
I neopeted all over the place.
THEY WRECKED THAT STATUE!
Then obviously that's more serious than just some minor channel advertising.
WAT
then Again, i didn;t have regular access to the internet until I was 14
so
11Indeed.
Out of the way chrous!!
11This movie is freaking win.
I feel like such a dork, looking at my neopets account.

Heeerreees Curry!
More random than a Leslie Nielson flick.
Meatolaf wasn't cooked long enough....
damn movie, what are you on about?
... 19. not 19th
Was that a reference to that one guy, killed by an ice pick?
He didn't break in. He broke out!
11Im pretty sure I didnt Silvermane
What?
Well, maybe not that random.
7Not my fault
Neopets is still around?
and various other references to the matrix
He's played by MEATLOAF for a reason, kihihihihihi
Hey, who wants Meatloaf for dinner?
that I can't make
You know, that's a good question. Is Neopets still alive?
This movie is like random scenes forced between songs
What year is it? I need to be exatly sure. Please?
He was stuck in cryofreezing!
due to never having watched any pof the movies
._.
LOL
He crashed his motorcycle through the 3rd floor of the castle and started a musical number. He had to go.
More like a Mel Brooks film.
Are there on a downhill spin now?
>_<
WAIT, THEY KILLED MEATLOAF?
11Im not sure where all the mods got the idea that a link to here was posted in the mane chat

Alterego: Use Solo:, not @Solo. Makes me look like a mod X.X
Its not...
The prerelease is.
It's just an unofficial player test
only had like 150 viewers to begin with
Ohgawd

I think a backstory behind Spitfire and Soarin is needed.
So wait, is this movie supposed to make sense?
if only i wasn't a slut!
Implying we ever left crazy town
MOAR DAT EDITING
We've lost 20 people to this movie.
Solo: K.

FOOD
Dinner is prepared?!
Dinner after sleeping and secks
praparred
True enough
lol

That does not mean we have to put on the delusion that things will be fine and dandy, we can also be realistic.
MATT SMITH
For what? Being sent ot the moon?
They were just sleeping >_>
optional
It's so interesting when your mother is standing over your shoulder watching this with you xD
FOOD!
that means you all should be naked
Timing-- it's everything...
Soda, got accident spammed? :P
11Not really comfortable that you have even that much information Ghosties
This is totally up there with the last supper
AND SAYING EVERY LINE.
Dat last supper
No banana's on the moon...
Poor spike...
Shit dining room for a nice castle
0inb4 best meal ever
The Force is strong with Lauren Faust. She has used her powerful connection to it to fill our hearts with love and kindness.
Some parts of the movie are worth memes
ugh...the screen won't stand still for me....
your mother is awesome
Oh please
But you shall go bananas. and that's bad.
Calm down
Spam? Spam is good on occasion
11You dont seem like you would be the one to keep a secret like this
/me 13is looking sexeh in her dress
We're having Meatloaf for dinner!
cupcakes!
Nice bra, Janet
Like I'm gonna run back to the mods and cry fucking foul
CHICKEN!
Mason: You forgot friendship.
suddenly Texas Chainsaw Massacre
Nice chicken.
being a kid with no cable i saw many shows like Fim on pbs so it never impressed me
Over a fanfic
Me encanta mucho
clang, dang
Every part of this movie has been memed
lol @ electric cutter
13Scootaloo!
Now that sis service
Roast Beast!
Think FiM verse and it's fanbase as yet another form of entertainment that helps you escape life for a moment and enjoy it.
swag
There's a reason why people say mentally unstable men are "bananas"
They cooked Scootaloo.
MeatLoaf!
13Time to carve Scootaloo! :D
chainsaw away
Youre not using power tools are you?
They don't do any talking about mods in there.
Because at the end of the day, we'll have to go back to real life, no matter what.
As long as you don't advertise on our main channel, then I have no concern
Why would you do that to poor Scoots ;_;
NOT SCOOTALOO NOOOO
Texas Chainsaw dinner
They just plot to troll Val.
Most. wkward dinner ever
Poor Scootaloo :(
What-- Meatloaf AGAIN?
nooo poor scootaloo
dammit, stop spoiling everything...
Scootabuse is WRONG! You sickos!
They didn't do the cooking by the book...
leave Scoots out of this movie
rocky just wants a drink
Cartoons > Reality TV
11Even if the fanfic is intended to crush the soul of one of your fellow mods..?
07such a nice dinner
The most murderiffic were "bananas" in their mind.
I'm a mod too you know :P
Put that damn drink down now. You'll drink milk and damn well like it!
I disagree, I try to bring a bit of Pinkie Pie with me into RL.
that's not a chicken, it's clearly a turduken, so it's only 1/3 scootaloo
Calm down, Ghosties is cool, and he gives not a single fuck about any of this. :3
pour wine on all the plates
I dont like my pink napkin...
It's ok to abuse a turkey
Not true, i've passed the midnight hour many a time in this channel
aqward
Toast?
TURDUKEN!
/me throws buttered toast
and really? Just me then?
The only thing that died in this horror movie is poor Scootaloo
TOAST
TOAST!
Beefwine!
YEAH TOAST
I suspected but that seemed paranoid
MICKEY MOUSE EARS!
Filter: Nice one
Birthday Party!
And Meatloaf, of course
...You know I completely hate how Ponychan operates, right?
Well, mom's watching the first epsiode of MLP:FiM.
OH NO I DROPPED MY GRAPE SODA.
lolwut is this
I see what you did there, Trouble!
And Meatloaf.
THey don't talk about you.
And that's why this verse and it's fandom has a much more positive influence on us.
The cap was on so it's okay.
Happy brithday Rocky
Pinkie pie needs to show up right about now
Haha
lol
How does she like it Shad?
11No, I didnt
Killed that song
*gasp* Teh Birthday party!
13Happy Birthday! <3
because why
So if you're implying I'm some kind of herdminded tool, no thanks
A chicken inside a duck inside a turkey. Meatception
/me puts on party hat
happy death day Meatloaf!
She's watching the first few minutes, doesn't find it exciting yt.
This is your singing tellegram I hope you find it well...
They just want to do some epic trolling.
*yet
11SO they're having Meatloaf?
Omnomnom
PINKIE CAN THROW A PART
my mo got hooked on mlp just yesterday night
party*
I'm a "big pony," if you'll excuse the crappy metaphor
I dig Columbia's hat
I'm so mentally unstable, I could beat RagingSemi's fanfic about filly Pinkie and her father-- OK, I don;t wanna be banned, so let's not get into that.
mom*
You're invite to a party cause we think you're really swell!
Oh my.
loooool
MrEvergreen: Do you really think Lauren Faust invented kindness? I mean, seriously. I think most of us were probably nice beforehand.
EDDIE YU SAY?!
rocky gets it, doesn't give a shit.
From the influence it gives us, we strive to do better things.
lol.
Dr. Frank N. Furter has the best hat evar!
LOLOLOLOL
^
why do you being mentally unstable is something to gloat about?
11Of course not, we just cant tell just anyone about this stuff however. =/
07*rage*
What about Ponychan? What does that have to do with this? I'm missing something
._.
rocky's turning one year old so help us celabrate!
wait, Eddie was the biker?
I ganked that pun. No shame!
And then rape
WHEN I SAID I WANTED HIM INSIDE ME, I DIDN'T MEAN THIS.
I am influenced by FiM. It's helped me TONS.
NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooAAAAAAAAAAAHNHHhh!!
I'd RAGEQUIT life..
why do you think*
Columbia no le gusta
But if you actually are trying to "crush the soul of one of my fellow mods" then it's best that I don't remain here
Pony-related or not, it does influence us to strive for better things, it seems.
eddie was the biker, yeah
How long is this?
The meatloaf will be delicious, the festivities first-rate!
the cake will be delicious, the festivities first rate
Solo: Ehhh... I was a pretty happy guy, but no way was I tolerate. I honestly think FIM help change that a little.
Oh... fuck
WHAT A TWIST
Doctor VON Scott!
...It isn't exactly something to be proud of when say you are VIOLENTALLY unstable.
Rage.
HE'LL ALWAYS BE A PART OF YOU, EVEN IF IT'S ONLY IN YOUR COLON
I'm now more outging cus of ponies
didnÄt that movie have jonny depp in there?
again
The cake is nonexistent, the festivities first rate!
I don't want to catch any shit with the others
*Violently
The mentally unstable ones are always the ones who are nefarious. Hence my persona, NefariousBanana.
Blegh
13Trouble
Is there some sort of pissing contest where people are self diagnosing themselves with mental disorders again, 'cause I guess it's cool to have a mental disorder?
taker another shot
me!
Eddie was born unlucky
I'm so glad there's so much effort put to annoy me *sarcasm*
in his mutter's side
13Haha ^
MrEvergreen: I have to agree to that. But the primary way I see it changing people is that it is helping them open up. Be emotionally open instead of cold and closed all the time.
THERE WILL BE SCIENCE AND DANCING, BOB FOR APPLES, CUT A UUG
When really mental disorders ruin peoples lives and make them miserable?
rug*
Real cool, bro.
@Solo: I have no answer to that. But one thing for sure, Lauren Faust seems to be a realistic and reasonable feminist.
11I see, and we dont know how your "Fellow mod" is going to react
Pinkie Pie has given me a very effective way to not be bullied.
Okay I'm back.
Whistler's Mother ftw
why is this guy singing?
My life is tons better.
13Dat singing
SON, I AM DISSAPOINT
A dirge! A dirge!
Oh he'll be fine.
Got dat SWAG
MONSTER MASH
... wait, what's wrong with ponychan?
I love this moment. Everyone here is having an indepth convosaiton... bout ponies.
*snot no 5*
13Dat dancing
this movie is not going to keep me sober with all it's music
and the numbers keep falling
what
WAIT A SEC
dat dancin
13En a motanike!
I *hate* how Ponychan operates
:P
Meatloaf had good taste, rip
ARE THEY EATING EDDIE??
Im pretty sure 80% of the world population could be diagnosed with a mental disorder, seeing as there are so many
Yup
yes
11I dont know how to use Ponychan
Yesd, he IS rocking 0out in a wheelchair.
Except for SINFB, he is mentally unstable.
0The Rock n Roll life
Your right, needs more ponies
11Its confusing to me
Not liking your teddie makes you a killer
I hate it's completely cultish community, and it's circle-jerkish hierarchy
I'll make it up to you afterwards. ;)
ok, no more shots, I am feeling off
Got a little shoulder action going!
Alterego: Happens all the time.
I agree, Pizzicato. This is hardly flattering, and rather insulting.
13Un I did!
There's a little MeatLoaf in all of us
/me hugs Val~
...
He'll be ultimately trolled, but he will only be pissed for 2 weeks max.
6ohbby~
0^
I get the feeling you don't actually go to ponychan, ghosties.
somesing
please stop singing magenta.
sigh
I do, DuskShine
Columbia is Eddie's Scootaloo
Wait.. I don't like my teddie but.. I like my pony. Am I still a killer?
so bout them ponies....
I've been around on Ponychan for months

Since early May

Season 2 begins in 7d:09h:50m:53s
/me 13is such a great singer
Oh I can't wait Dari. What could you possibly have planned for me? Perhaps an entire folder of pictures?
I'm joking about my mild schizophrenia, people. Geez. Calm yo flank down.
Faust does not come off to me as an extremist of any sort.
As have I.
TOO BAD, HE IS DEAD
A week...
Magenta is the low sultry sounding one for teh record
xD
Vanin: They are everywhere!
Just one week.
AGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
How many A's in AAAAAAAGH!
Even right behind you....
und i did
I Guess edie wrote that scream in the note
MrEvergreen: Yeah. She seems to be a very level-headed person.
unt I did
So that means you're one of them if you see absolutely nothing wrong with the pedestals they put other people on
I actually meant something good.
unt i did
But whatever.
She's awesome.
2,14 It's in the castle of....ugggghhhhhhh
aww no there not got my hopes up and everything
And please
...
No not the teddy bear!
13Und I did~
mfw you way UNT, where im at
Hey hey hey!
And that's a good thing to have such a person giving us the influence.
Spare me from the tired diatribe on "Oh, but they're great people"
IT's FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT ALBERT
Sorry Vanin.
Its fat albert
hi
I actually HAVE mild schizophrenia, I'm just making some crap jokes about it. That's what I meant.
mod is right und i did
well, I would appreciate it if it were true :P
I've heard it plenty
O:
Aww you beat me
Dishes are done!
07AAAAARCH!
Ohai
KICK OVER THAT TABLE
Right.
:O
Agreed, Evergreen.
Oh shit
oh man
WHAT A TWEEST
13AHHHHHHY
but experience has taught me to be ever the skeptic
fun fact: only tim curry knew who was under the table
Hey Lily!
11Sent you a PM herospirit
Cool table Decoration
That's a very good argument, ghosties.
Most of us stick too hard on the extremes, either too individualist, or too collectivist.
SO REALISTIC.
If I may present a rebuttal?
There's the birthday cake!
Slap fight.
join in on the conversation! We got muffins!
Best funeral ever
I do like that table though!
Go fuck yourself with a cactus.
CHASE SCENE
I don't care
when someone says "mental disorder" people only think of those with the most severely affecting ones, like aspurgers/autism ect
muffins!
SURPRIZE FUNERAL!
next week I'm totally watching the entire season 1 while on vacation
I always forget about this song
Dat Scooby-Doo chase
SHUT UP

muffins... urrrghhh *retch*
You're cute
Agreed Evergreen. Magic and Science can coexist! Really, Im referring to twilight and Pinkie pie.
I didn't get it Rainbow
apple friters
MrEvergreen: The big problem is that we think of things in terms of "individualist", "Collectivist", etc., these labels make people polarize themselves.
Only struggle between verses!
Ballsy of her!
sry
Und I did
It's no biggie
Which is really hard to achieve, however, one should always remember that.
can never spell that right
And please stop with the rage you two.

EVEN HER RUN IST SO GRACESHFULL
I don't think I really think in those terms.
Labels are not the driving force of polarization.
ugh...must..resist..shot....*phew*
MY VEELS
TAKE OFF THE SHOES.
@ KanyeNorthEast I find that fact hard to beleve as most of the cast was in the BROADWAY version too
Mason: Good.
*sigh*
I can't move my WHEELS!
It's the intentions.
Did I say you were?
great SCOTT

And you're a cantalope!
MrEvergreen: Chicken or egg paradox there.
Sklar, the fuck?
*yawn*
YOU FOOOLLS!

lol
take off shoes?
Mom doesn't really see why it's so interesting yet, then again she's hardly watching it.
I can't move my hooves.
A MENTAL MINDFUCK
:|
why is the twist in horror musicals always "it was already scary and paranormal but now its aliens lol"?
Well, not really chicken or egg.
Was I talkin' to you?
sound waves dont work that way
What I'm saying right now is lying.
STOP WITH THE SCIENCE
Dumb Earth People
why is there a ] at the end of your name, bananas?

That transducer.
2,14 enough sklar
dat sonic screwdriver
What?
THE TIMEWARP
MrEvergreen: Labels rose from people trying to categorize people. Labels also make people try to categorize themselves and others. It's a sort of cycle.
Heh... solid matter.
What?
Looks like someone went insane lol
SPAAACE
Why not?
hm, maybe. I'd just read it as a bit of trivia that they wanted to get a shocked reaction
Oh, I wasn't even paying attention to herospirit's part. Oh well
Sklar a mod?
11...
Filter: He is mentally unstable, don't quesiton him.
You just have to consider both benefits and appropriateness.
nope
from what i know theres hundreds of variations of Aspergers, diferent forms of Dyslexia and so forth
WE CAN SEND CHOCOLATE BARS THROUGH TV
Schmanet!
he german?
a planet of ponies!
:[
Wise up!
Echoes?
MrEvergreen: You see the same thing with tropes. First a work legitimately builds a trope.. but then it gets labelled, and future works try to fit it
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT INTERPLANET JANET
I'm sorry : (
ok
SPAAAACCCEEEEE!
Bracket is wha- Whoops. No need for me to get banned today.
Is Germany a planet?
SUDDENLY WATUSSI.
To herospirit, that is

LOL wtf.
STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP

so we all talking about brain problems eh
DAT TEMPO CHANGE

No doubt, but do remember, Tropes Are Not Bad.

OK. I don't want people complaining over mental conditions, so I'm gonna do this for ya.
You don't go to Ponychan, if I'm correct

No. Don't blink. Don't oh . . .
STATUE MACHINE
FOREVER A STONE
btw, Egg came before the chicken. If your follow evolution
Stone bewbies!
07magic!
MrEvergreen: Indeed. But it does end up building more polarized and stereotypical works. If used correctly, however, Tropes are tools.
Zappity zap zapperton.
Now they are stoned
There's no such thing as true originality, it's mostly based on something previously demonstrated.
11I read over it sometimes
13Da magic!
got any brain problems just watch pony ya will fix ya right up >_>
Oh noes! Friendship!
squeeky rage
11It doesnt make sense to me honestly
I hate you so much I wrote a song about you!
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:09h:46m:25s
You know what stoned is backwards? Denots. It's important.
Don't blink - Don't even blink! Blink, and you're dead. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and DON'T. BLINK. Good luck.
:(
That statue has dangly parts on it
Indeed, and as you can see, it's still the intentions behind what's at hand here.
Seems like they are..
SHTONE
I be back, homehs
11But, I seriously doubt that everyone there is as bad as you say
Nice bush
About a week now!
MrEvergreen: Likewise, labels themselves can be helpful for defining an individual and helping them undersatnd themselves..... but they can also make people divisive.
(Puts on sunglasses)
And now it's "The Dyas of OUr Lives."
Stoned.
stoned
1 week :O
YEAAAAAAH!
lol
BEWBS!
6This movie. . . Why have I not watched it sooner? XD
STONE VEELS!

13Concrete boobs
ha ha! dangly parts!
oh man
INTO STOOOOOOOOOONNNNAAAAA
11There will always be annoying people, but there will always be great people.
Are you striving to make a novelty, or just to seek quick fame for a buck?
Oh crap. 1 week?!
That's 7d:09h:46m:25s
XD Why is Rocky all posed

lol "missing frame"
SCREW THE 4TH WALL!
07seriously Violet?
COCKATRICE
looks like they got stoned!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dang it, would he stop stoning people
I I guess it would be best if I stayed completely out of this argument.
Who want to **** some hard stones!
07first time?
whatwhatwhatwhatwhat.jpg
What.
^
You don't see the internet detective bullshit some of the mods have played, how !!Spike mod used to have favorites which is nothing more than just a symptom of the intense hierarchy of "important" persons on there. And I'm not saying EVERYONE is bad, there are some good people, believe me, but the majority of the users there are just sooooooo hiveminded
Its actually about eight days for me. I need to wait for it on youtube angry face!
13Yeah, poor VV. Missing it all this time :P
<AppleBloom> But, I WANT IT NOW!!!!
Popping the RHPS cherry?
I still have 9 episodes to watch until the new season.
Lol
They're all "rock hard" right now.
Magenta, please STFU
im going to be on a flight all day on the 17th ><
Im going to watch the live stream
Puns!
Watch them, Nefarious!
i cannot contain the pony
In other words, some of the folks there did some bad things.
It seems that Rocky has got....stoned. YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
the moon!
You can't be nice and reason with them, and you can't scream and yell at them
6Oh no no, I have seen this before XD;
That's...at 5 am my time. Perfect. I can wake up to ponies on YT.
Don't take that for granite!
07ohhh!
07I was worried
I can't watch them.
So Ponychan is now a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Hmmm....That was probably bad.
*First-timer*
Lots and lots of nothing!
@Solo: And yes, as you stated, labels themselves are not the culprit.
6Just should have been watching it like. . . twenty times again before this!
I've accepted that Ponychan just will not change its ways
RANDOM FLOOR SHOW TIME!
Magenta looks eerily sexy in this scene
Oh ROCKY!
I have no earbuds at the moment...
It's the intentions, yet again.
I've seen it a number of times, but this is the first time watching it with others.
6th timer.
And also, experience.
Do we get to do the time warp again later?
hehe, just as planned
You better wise up Granite Weiss!
elbow sex, elbow sex, elbow sex!
Bad?
and then they danced because why
The End?
No, no
*Janet
dem statues
lol@Trouble.
ELBOW SEX IS BEST SEX
Ignorance is one thing, manipulation is something else.
11The entirety of the internet is a wretched hive of scum and villainy
13Ahh, I thought this was your first time too VV :P
MrEvergreen: It's not about finding a culprit. This isn't about blame. Labels themselves DO exacerbate the problem to some extent. Of course, we can't do away with them - but we can try to teach people their role in thinking.
And what RD said is true
Yes, one is intentional, one isn't.
Sol Hoof Sex?
11There are more malevolent people than benevolent
Yes
What are you 2 fighting about?
Hey guys! I was wondering if any Bronies wanted to hang out with me?
and then we just stay on a shot of the statues for 30 minutes.
so when do they stop being stone
how much longer is this movie?
Why not Croup Sex?
>Narration, chat stops
not that much more
this is my first time D:
uh.... sure?
Ah, I'm sorry. It's not really about blaming any side involved that I want to talk about.
Why does he even ask?
where do you live
Thank you exposision man
6Heheheh~ It feels like it Magenta <3
good I can watch the end
Are we invitied to a party cuz you think we're really swell?
in a van down by the river
One of my friends has moderately severe dyslexia, makes fun of himself most of the time because of it
11But, judging an entire site based on what some of these "Malevolent" people just seems kinda wrong
Basil Exposition. :D
13<3
Indeed, *smokes pipe
HE'S GONNA TEAR A HOLE THROUGH TIME AND SPACE RIGHT TO EQUESTRIA
But that describes humanity as well
shut up and find your neck!
DANCE!
/me 11only seen this once before.
Since chat has cooled down, does this have the original ending?
Seeing as Pinkie is best pony, maybe.
YUSSS.
DON'T PICNIC
7th song to many uhhh next shot
It's funny because I remember exactly what !!Spike did.
Come on Cinderella, or you'll be late for the ball!
You guys seem to think that I consider all these people "villains" and I don't
Not a picnic... no...
I just want to make sure that, for all it worth, it does lie on the intentions behind actions.
13Those statues gotta arrive in STYLE!
....
RELEASE YOUR INNER RARITY
I've been missing out on a Excellent for years ^_^
Moderate Severe? I'm not hatin, I just find that quite odd.
He quite being a moderator shortly afterwords and was banned from the site.
wot party hu were?
I don't think that most of them have ulterior motives. Well, maybe one or two
Whaaaaaat theeeeeeee fuuuuuuuuuuck
13Rarity would be.... well... maybe not proud, but something!
07dat voice
Time for TEH MAGICKS!

oh of coruse they are all in fishnets

Really Swell!
@Magenta - Shocked comes to mind. LOL
Haha, said that a long time ago Janet
Yeah, it's nearing the end
ehh
hey, tits
sweet jesus!
I missed out on My Little Pony: FiM for a year, think how mind-boggling that is
Lol
how did he get the clothing on them, they all had bases.
magenta Rarity would have fainted 18 times in this movie easily
13Dat makeup
MrEvergreen: Fair enough. I have a tendency to argue semantics on formal topics, sorry. And I do get what you're talking about.
w00t! I'm down for a party.
ending number...if i remeber
I gotta go, my friends.

creepy...
ShadTheCrazed: The first two episodes are not a good way to introduce someone to the show.
Noo.
I like Brad's Falsetto a lot
Down to 115 viewers
I think that most of the users on Ponychan have completely entrenched their lives in "love and tolerance," like it's a cureall for EVERYTHING, and it's not.
Stupid Ads!
>114
Oh haha
0 114
Solo: Hmm...
Cant tell if its a Man or a Women
Yeah, the falsetto was good. LOL
Oh for fuck's sake.
ninja'd
PinkPartyPony: Whoa. Spam.
Pinkie Pie would be the only pony capable of making sense of this.
can't believe people are leaving just as its ending
I'm watching this iand my roommate just doesn't care
ShadTheCrazed: Does she like Looney Tunes?
Fluttershy's innocence has been corrupted :(
That's a goddamn joke, Ghosties.
Well, I'll just explain that to her when she says she didn't like it.
No spam
Solo: Which episode is good to introduce someone?
13Just gotta identify your name I think.
@Solo: The problem with the first 2 eps is that they are very Magical Girl-ish.
Solo: Yeah.
Pinkie Pie would be an actor in the movie
It's how they deal with fucking trolls.
Joke???
Song
This would be an average movie on Pinkie Pie's list
good thing she's afk
13Unless theres a ghost in the chat still.
NorthEast, people just don't like the old, unusual movie.
Boy, now THAT made me laugh
Joke...
sure
Pinkie Pie would be the Dr.
ShadTheCrazed: Show her A Bird In the Hoof
ShadTheCrazed: or Party of One
THE BEAUTY.
I'm not sure Magical Girl theme is a way to target a general audience.
i think it depends on the person solo the first to can be a good starting point it was for me
wait a minute, rko? I thought this was 20th century fox. Shit now i'm confused. we need to start the movie over
They treat them like the jokes they are.
grimfallop Fluttershy would have passed out by now
Yeah, you have to take this movie with the knowledge that it is nuts.
Party of One was the best.
hmmm...that wasn't it
I... I STILL can't find anything to bite. It would just be playing into their paws.
Nah, the one with the high voice.
13Dont see one though.
and then there was magic
Does that mean they'd be eating cupcakes instead of meatloaf?
07will do!
this movie would make pinkie proud
Unless you thrive on high/heroic fantasy.
I nominate WarGames for next movie.
Fluttershy would be Janet
Treat who?
Solo: No worries, I know what I'm doing.
crack snorts this movie to get high
Yeah, we probably should have explained that before
WHERE HAVE ALL THE HEROES GONE?
Seconding WarGames
this movie will be one of pinkie's favorite
>Ghosties can't read, apparently.
._. my innocence....
WHERE ARE ALL THE GODS
Pinkie Pie! The Demon baker of Fleet Street!
Lol, show her the insanity.
The first two episodes were there to establish that it's an adventure series.
I nominate The Wizard as the next B-Movie
11*facehoof*
I think you need to see the first two, and I think that is a flaw.
13Should work. :/
07hah Flutter
I dunno, I think Twilight would fit Janet more...
Shall.We.Play.A.Game?
The rest of the first season was there to build up the inter-personal friendships of the main characters.
;_;
Trouble, NOOO IT MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE!!
Show her that this show did not tone down on personal rejection.
I nominate Stand and Deliver as B movie
Labyrinth! We need Bowie!
no
11NO DISCUSSION OF CUPCAKES
/me 0likes this verse
Oh God Trouble, we need to watch that some time
the first two episodes, I find, are poorly received by many first-timers.
SuperBrony64: Not Wizards!
I nominate Bubba Ho Tep
You know, instead of trying to insult me, you could actually tell me who you're referring to
Pony Jesus.
Because I watched an episode towards the end of the season, and I was so lost on terms of charries.
Hey.
YES!! We must!
WHAT?! WHY NOT?!
07Oh yes David Bowie
I support Bowie based movies
11Why are we arguing about Ponychan anyway.. Who gives a shit?
I'm getting an Error 404 message when I try to go to the Bronyville Livestream...
the trolls I believe
I nominate either "Plan 9 From Outer SPace" "Birdemic" or "Nudist Colony of the Dead" for the next B Movie
what.a.strange.game.the.only.winning.move.is.not.to.play
I STILL say Plan Nine. If ONLY as a cleansing rinse.
WE MUST
Tovler, That was my B movie pick!
Oooo! David Bowie!
DID HE DEAD
bowie is almost as awesome as tim curry
Raptor Jesus is best Jesus.
Yeah, Bubba Ho-Tep would be right in line with this film.
Im speaking of before I watched episode one and two.
ung, I'll just relog
Are you insinuating that the trolls are the ones that "love and tolerate" TO THE MAX?
Party of One was pradictable
Or you could, y'know, read what I said instead of being an idiot and asking me to repeat myself.
SYMBOLIZISM!!
Didn't we show Plan 9?
Greatest Video Game Commercial of all time >_<
what
RAWRity: MLP movie has already been picked
Every episode is predictable.
Wait, I fixed it.
/me is sad the ride is almost over
What is this?
Nope. Pool orgy time!
>Ghosties can't read.
Plan Nine from Outer Space, yall..
Or was that Killer Klowns?
I'm just asking a question
I nominate Radioland Murders.
For FiM Season 1 marathon weekend.
No need to get mad, bro
Plan 9 is FOREVER.
2nd to last song
wheres the fim movir starring tim curry?
Killer Klowns is AWESOME
Ain't even mad.
This ending makes me sad for Frank-N-Furter whenever I watch it
Who are the trolls on Ponychan?
Clarify
ahaha SS titanic
freezeframe I know, that's just what I say we should do the week after
i think its just that no matter what you show em kus of preconceptions they will not like the first ep or 2 they see
dat makeup!
MLP: FiM does not have particularly advanced, convoluted or unusual plotlines. It's mostly a character-driven series.
The Black Gestapo would be an interesting pick too
I think you're being pointlessly silly.
ung
Is Slither an A or B movie?
wait
I want your definition
mfw it still doesn't remember I'm a mod >.<
B Movie
Solo: Not a Bird in the Hoof. That took some knowledge, but yeah every episode was predictable, but for some reason, I still enjoyed the conclusion.
11Wait
11Ghosties
o_o
the ending is amazing!
No doubt, the rest of season 1 is mostly slice-of-life.
dr died?
killer klown from outer space, attack of the killer tomatoes, tremors and little shop of horrors (the one with the giant talking plant) we need those moveis!
Altergo: It's about the journey :P
WATER ORGY TIEM!
Also, A dog and Pony show was not predictable either.
11Why do you give a shit about what people do on Ponychan?
Anyways, this is retarded.
orgy in the pool?
if every episode is predictable then your too damn smart to be watching this show......drat that applies to everyone who isnt an 8 year old girl
Keep it civil Dush
If we don't pick Labyrinth, then we need Braindead for that lawn mower scene!
Slice of Life style does attract general audiences.
WTF?
lol
Dusk*
Well, there's also I'm going home and if this the original ending version, Superheroes and Science Fiction Double Feature (Reprise)
WOOHOO, THE DOCTOR IS IN
Alterego: You didn't find Dog and Pony to be fairly predictable?
There's always Tremors 2, with one of the greatest lines ever...
Stow it, Wheels!
Gay meter over 9000.
Because I actually care
Solo: Ok. Agreed.
For some unknown reason
He doesn't.
13Pool orgy time!
That I've yet to figure out
6It is okay Val, it does not let me change my nick for fun like Luna or Octavia did :3
Well, mind that MLP:FiM is actually a show for all genders, just aimed at a younger audience.
I was also contemplating choosing "Five Across The Eyes" in order to torture you all with one of the worst movie viewing experiences ever.
IT'S OK TO BE GAY
reallky
That's cool, label me bro
Ghosties, he's saying "love and tolerence" is a joke they use to counter trolls
My mind was gone a loooong time ago
11Hm, but would arguing solve whatever problems you see in Ponychan?
YES
but that'd kill the buzz
wait, there's a version without Super Heroes?
WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUU
w00t! Heels and Wheels!
13Hmm...
So…What's the moral of this story? What would Twilight write to Princess Celestia about this movie?
:creepygusta:
we already watched tomatoes
O GAWD WAT
No
GO DOCTOR GO
13Oh wait.
HE CAN WALK, ITS A MIRACLE
whoops
I learned that long ago
OH MY GOD
Which means it ends up being for all ages.
Solo: No, not really. Or not at the begining, like most episodes. Once Rarity began to whine, it became clear.
Oh no! He has been infected!
HHmm...
I tried that and it doesn't work
Gay meter over 9000? We're full grown men who enjoy watching colorful ponies.....
I'd rather be straight TYVM.
Tim Curry doesn't find crippled old men attractive
=.= I desensitized
I think I just saw crack in movie form.
And we have SEVERELY WRONG SIGN.

SEX cures paralysis
IT BEGINS!
one of the weirdest movies ive seen
11So why are we arguing now. =/
He likes his leg alot
13Yeah, try that.
I find every TV show rather predictable, most scenes im looking at i can guess whats going to happen in the next 10 seconds
That's why I said being nice and reasonable doesn't cut it on there, neither does yelling or screaming at them
11Arent we just wasting time and energy?
Watching ponies isn't gay.
because statues
Joker Curry
07did you love it PrincessCelestia?
Well, I had a thought but it might not be applied, so scratch that. xD
oh there we go
Yeah, we are
13I had to do it twice before it would give me OP.
ty sprinkles
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
07I know I did!
It's manly.
Neither is tis.
/me eats himself some delicious apple pie
As far as I'm concerned, the only thing I'm here for right now is the movie.
But DuskShine fines it in his heart to continue trying to berate me
*finds
<3 Pie
Alterego: Yeah. I was fairly sure Rarity would find a way to take them over, though. the show has a sense of humor like that, and it's the easiest way, in that episode, to avoid a violent conclusion. and they always avoid violence in FiM for conclusions. Except NMM.
13Not like I didnt try to help. lol
That;s the point
just because tim curry is a great actor!

How is he doing that?
I Love it, BUT WHY?
I liked the first two episodes up until the ened
Oh PrincessCelestia is here, my we are popular now.
oh doctor, you so silly
NMM got the business end of the orbital friendship cannon.
and you too octavia :P
I wub woo
Yes, indeed.

Celestia, tell Luna I said Hi! :)
And if he's saying "love and tolerance" is used to counter trolls, then he would be right if this was when Arctic Tempest introduced FiM to /co/. He would be somewhat right now. But the majority of people on there "love and tolerate" each other a lot

You're right, they should just treat each other like shit instead of decent human beings.
/me agrees wholeheartedly with Ghosties.
sad song time...
Here it comes :C
I think Magenta is my favourite character in the whole movie
Well, the magical power of Friendship here is the influential power it has that can convert oppositions.
What is mona lisa doing here?
cum again?
<TheLotusTeaDragon>: PenisTrident
it wouldnt be called friendship cannon was destructive
Teh sads. :(
this movie stopped being fun after "Sweet Transvestite" ended IMHO
They should treat each other like human beings, not like sheep
=(
Hey, mods, does this have the original ending? Or is it the happier ending?
13Elky <3
Ohhh-kaaaay. Explain with another musical number. Somehow, that works.
Which, ironically funny, is what Lauren Faust has been doing all along.
hope we see more luna and celestia plot in seasno 2.
I would like to know more about the Friendship cannon....mabie we will get more explinations in S2
This IS the Sweet Transvestite movie!
/me 13yawns

Alterego: "Uhh... I'll admit, I am a little bit concerned at what you're seeing.

Wait. Why are we calling it a cannon?
its friendship
You want to see your own plot more often?

11It would be less of a headache if I just banned both of you, but DuskShine is my friend, and it would be unfair if I just banned you, Ghosties
The problem is, Friendship without Love might fail to lead to Unity.

IT'S A MADHOUSE! A MADHOOOOUUUUUSSSEEE!
Luna Game…2.0?!!
13I was like wtf...
I'm scared now
best error ever
0It was an awesome ending
everyone's dead
Alterego: With a name like discord, how organized can he be?
Seeing Trot reminds me of the song... Trot.
On which boards?
/me Throws roses at discord
And then the movie imploded
07yea me too
everyone's dead
>mfw I actually thought it was part of the movie
ive always wondered how big is princess celestia plot is?
S2 episode: Rainbow Dash races Pinkie
you couldn't have done this better if you planned it
11....
07stream unmuted
11THE END
You need that level of personal interconnection.
It's...the ROCKY GAME!
lol
MrEvergreen: If there's no love, I'd argue it isn't a friendship.
i still hear it!
maybe in season 2 we will find out
I figured it was some sort of trippy 70s acid scene
Ok. Ok. OK. WHAT THE FOAL WAS THAT?
a Luna game that affects you after a few weeks? Nice idea...
oh god i still hear it
lol I can still here the echo
That.... was fucking amazing
XD TheLotusTeaDragon
Original Ending: not got >:
well, that was fun. req time?
Solo: Agreed with Solo.
Did not understand that at all.
This is actually pretty awesome
I STILL HEAR IT
115 people dide while watching this stream
I know /chat/ and /oat/ aren't the place for that. You'd probably get treated like you were a troll on either.
OMG
the sound...it wont go away
slow echo fade out
O.O
Better!
6AAAACIIIIIDDDD~~~~
Oh hai.
WOAH
07and it's back
SEASON TWO! DO WANT!
depends on what you define as love
Awesome
alterego, this is my full name
MrEvergreen: so at this point, we're just arguing semantics.
/meta/, /oat/ before /oat/ was cleaned up, and /pony/
everyone's dead
There it goes
@Solo: It's not necessary, but it's nice.
11That was fucking scary
But…perhaps it was not for the best?
07sorry about that
oh damn the moives back
I just jumped
I gotta be honest...
DesertRose: Yep, arguing semantics.
This movie is trippy.
best error ever
made it so scary
I THINK WE JUST GOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!
Arguing semantics: Serious Business 101
/me 13starts singing
I never played the Luna game, is it really cool?
they worship luna
(for fun)
Damnit, stop making this movie even wierder
That actually fit in with the rest of the movie, considering how batshit insane everything is
Damnit, Janet! Don't do that again!!! :D
they live on the moon!
Now with 11 seconds of new footage!
SuperBrony: Watch a Let's Play
Meh. I would argue that Twilight Sparkle loves her friends though. And its not true friendship unless you care for them...
SuperBrony64: DO NOT PLAY LUNA GAME
But really though, cliche as it seems, this is not something to joke about.
TIME WARP!!!!!
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
Maybe it is not love, but care?
LET'S DO THE TIMEWARP AGAIN!
TIME WARP
13LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
IME WARP AGAIN!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
YESS
Do not play Luna game.
rainbow?
TIME WARP AGAIN!!!
Well, Plan 8 didn't work. Now for-- aw you know.
RAINBOW
WITH RAINBOW
HURRAY, SECOND BEST SONG GETS A REPRISE
The power of friendship!
PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF
Of course it's a space ship…
Care does work.
And why did my mind jump immediately to Care Bears? -facehoof-
1
Love is often defined as the level of connection at which someones wellbeing matters to you as much as your own.
/pony/ isn't really the place for that either.
AND THEN THE CASTLE WAS A SPACESHIP
Original Ending: got?
No doubt about that.
The SPACE castle!
Rainboom
I'm also curious about this Luna game.
DEM SPECIAL EFFECTS
rocket to the moon!
DOUBLE RAINBOW?! WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
WHERE'S MY ROCKETSHIP CASTLE?
11Herospirit, are you still there?
So it may happen now, it may. But I mostly lurk these day...not much for me to say on there, honestly
WHAT
The game closes by itself sometimes then automatically opens up at a random moment to scare you.
Yah
I think Twilight's level of concern for her friends qualifies.
lol they just shift a picture of the castle upwards...
DAT BE A RAINBOOM
Care-Mare Staaaaaare!
It was a sonic Rainboom that destroyed the Castle!
THIS I have not seen.
:D
Or you oen it up again.
Wait, who's this?
Original Ending: GOT! FUCK YES!!!!
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEEEEee
they go now to party with luna!
ALL THE WAY TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Well, I think Love is more than that.
DOUBLE RAINBOW
open*
Yeah, I know /pony/ isn't the place for it
Btw, somepony needs to make Care-Mares
This is the ultimate show down mason?
But it just kinda happened
Kindness, Loyalty, Generosity, Honesty and Laughter
I'm here
/meta/, sure. Not sure why you'd still think the way you do if you posted there, though.
Im bleeeeeeeeeeding
best song.
MrEvergreen: Then it's time to argue semantics... which gets us nowhere.
great ending song
I didn't start a thread about my complaints. Derails and all that
best kind of freinship has those 5
13Dat fog
MrEvergreen: I think we should change topics.
That's Harmony though Desert.
lol care-mare
WHERE ARE ALL THE SUPERHEROES
6Dat FROG
Sounds like Frank ruptured something
FFFRRREINDDSHIP
dat poison cloud
SEXEH CRAWLING
ugh, that doesn;t look good, changing
*shrug* Derails are just the way of things on /pony/ until Season 2 rolls around.
LOL bleeding inside
Who chose this movie?
AND SO THE CASTLE WENT IN TO SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
dat fag
07<<<
Horrible dark pun?
care mare DO NOT WANT
07me
2,14 that would be our streamer
6Janet~
Maybe I should change my name to discord
even when they are dying they can still sing, these guys are like cockroaches!
Cut songs because of stupid reasons are always best (cuagh, Little Shop of Horrors, I'm looking at you)
Mason_Trowel: Mind a quick PM?
everfreenights, :slowpoke:
/me brohoofs Janet so hard the universe implodes
Wow, I wonder whose brilliant mind came up with the plot for this movie...
actually the last song to be made for the movie the 14 hour days show in this number
WHEELS!
No, no, I mean that I mentioned my complaints when the thread derailed into discussions on the community or whatever
I'm fine with derails
0ohai Luna
it was riff raff
SuperBrony64: I'm wondering what they were on.
better
Did they died?
/me gives Luna a hug for that movie
I don't think anyone should change their name to discord until how he acts, just for safety. :)
13Doctor wearing that outfit is hilarious
Soooooo.... what the fuck was that movie about?
/me brohoofs Luna
07and the best news
07tomorrow it's ON !

Only a time lord to keep them alive
End of movie :'(
Meaning.

0I love this movie! Thank you Luna!
Were you entertained?
welp, best movie ever
what
The globe glows.
Great, No neck AND depressing.
13<3
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
*hoof claps*
I have a question about the movie.
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT MOVIE EVEN ABOUT.
<.<
And I think the reason why I wouldn't discuss my complaints on /meta/ is because I can do that anytime of the day since I know Hipster and Cross personally and both of those guys always respond to threads
so, who here has september 17th marked on every calender on their phones/computers?
Now for Reprise
TIM CURRY!
can we watch "back to the future" please
it was about everything
well
little shop of horrors next Luna?
This was twice as fun as the movie normally is!
That chick...

Might I ask? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsqJFIJ5lLs
Love the original ending.
Ooooooookay then. That was... I don't know.
you'll never quite find another movie like that
herospirit it was actually a metaphor for the sexual awakening and eventual psychological decline of the character Brad
I don't. You think I can forget?
postshow?
JANET (JANET)
what a great way to end a night
2,14 no video links please

I told my boss 2 weeks ago "yeah, I;m gonna need to take september 17th off"
I was a little, but getting angry over things on the net is silly.
11FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS
Yes
6Luna, nice choice! ;3
11That concludes Brony Movie Night
I think we can both concur on that
It was going to a pitch black picture with glaring red eyes, and someone on that picture was going to be, "Discord will be release 9/17/2011"
lol
Someone needs to make that picture now please.
11PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR POST-SHOW REQUESTS
13That was fun. :D

DSNesmith expectedly weird.
what is this song called?
Hey, quick question to any Photoshop users here: Is there a way to save a .GIF image as a series (sequence) or .PNG or .JPG images at all? Thanks
rocky horror pinkie pie show WAS AWESOME
/me has to side with Pinkie's crew. can't have a party without soda afterall.
/me is forever loyal to Celestia
Was fun to watch the newbies/
I'm still trying to figure out what was going on o.o
/me respects Celestia... a worthy Alpha. Although Luna is also a worthy Alpha. The two share the role in his opinion.
To be honest, I didn't really get to enjoy Rocky Horror.
Newfriends weren't so keen on it :P
Been trying to do that all day :/
^ yeah
07WAT!
My neighbors are asshats and were making loud noises all night.
More songs will come the more episodes come in
you take each individual frame of the .gif
@kencolt indeed
and save them seperately
They'd been building a shed for the past month. =
=/
NEEDS MOAR LUNA WOLVES
that's annoying
I AM a wolf, after all. I think in those terms.
duskshine try again tomorrow maybe?
Rocky Horro was gayer then I love you Phillip Morris. It was goos
Gasp ghosties!
I will.
if you have a good file manager
4:O
it should be able to do that
good*
You didn't link your thread in the "what's going on thread"
4You're making themes for each pony?
13Themes. <3
I wanted to Mosh Pit during it
nauuuuuuuughty
4...why wasn't I informed
wb
Trot_Rot, well besides that. Is there an automated way to make them save a as sequence such as xxx001.png xxx002.png ect?
Sol, why didn't you Moshpit?
I can do that, but its a 60 frame gif
11...we've been talking about it for months.
he was alone, so thus no pit
You need people irl for that >:
crap, there's a gigantic pony marathon tomorrow....
I just saw the walking video in film class
11It's why Wreck is doing the banners.
We all respect Sun and Moon. IN the sun, we sleep.l At night we hunt. We're... sorry that Luna never noticed that. But we hide.
I was planning to write more of my epic length fanfic for napowrimo

Somehow, this confuses me more than Rocky Horror...

I plan to do 6k words every weekend
dat herdage
DSNesmith I have a lot of time between classes, so it's easy to manage for me

CARAMEL!
Pinkie Pie's favorite show?
numbers are dropping!
My TEETH are melting.
Nom.
there is no such thing as girly treats
...brb, writing while things are boring
:L
>Cakes >Girly >Who cares, they all taste great
...why are we watching this? :P
/me 4stares
Drooling.
:L
13Hehe. <3
I would rather have an Apple Fritter right now...
4Caramel isn't a part of the main cast
Pies, pies everywhere

11Seriously, what the hell are we watching?
13Everyone is mane cast!
Most of the time we find a way to make it pony-related
So yeah, when someone mentioned NaPoWriMo, I TOTALLY thought the "Po" stood for pony. Googled it and everything, and only realized when I got to the FAQ that "po" stood for "poem".
13Yayy~
suddenly buffer
FOOOOOOOOOOD

I have no Idea

Hey Octavia
11Dari, I need a copy of the html and the CSS you're already using.
...I was improvising, leave me alone. D:
6>really only thinks there should be themes for what rooms we have, with some exceptions
yup
what was the second pony ep, btw?
4Exceptions?
I've never heard of ANYONE talking to himself on his facebook wall.
IM AWESOME
You should only sleep if you dream of pony. Otherwise you stay up for pony.
4Such as?
Applebuck season, DSENesmith
6Case-by-case
11> Rooms based on ponies
dammit, this shit again>
elements of harmony
rofl, I love that line
11> themes based on ponies
"hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult"
This makes me lol
>D
4Case by case? o.O
6I think it would be cool, I will put in forum, but if sometime everypony is not busy . . . maybe making a drawing/banner of all of the mods? n.n I think it would look cool. . .
RBD makes the best faces in this vid
Wow. Flash Player just crashed. O_o
:P
"And if you like this, it's cause my little sister wrote it."
4Color me intrigued
or bunny. Angel is best pet
I have to remember how to solve vector partial diff eq.'s
'If you liked this, it's because my little sister wrote this'
This song annoys me more than I ever thought possible

WOAH

Anyone saw that part when she derped.
so I tried to draw RBD on my dorm's whiteboard, but I didn't have enough colors
R-Zack
yesssssss
it didn't come out very well
6As for the case-by-case thing, we're not going to need a theme for both Aloe AND Lotus, for example, it would be better to throw them together
Yes, Whimsical?
Jumanji reference, lol
Alright, Sneezey... if you're here, I came.
i requested "Demented Cupcakes" by Foogoz
Hellou~
Obivously.

it could be worse
This is the 80s.
4OH you guys...
/me 13is totally a hipster
yah totally thats why I stay white
that blue one resembles my ponysona
That animation glitch
They said everybody, what :/
nice math, pony
this is g1?
4Octavia is the new hipster
Where video games were 8-bit
And -967
and nose plugs
The animation isn't THAT bad, just not modern :/
4Wait
13lol
The sad part is that there was some pretty good style and animated in the mid 80s.
4...
:x
maybe not g1
4That makes you a poser
Well in Japan atleast.
but it's not... well, you knoe
6We probably could be if we got Hipster to throw his weight around.
4YOU'RE NOT A HIPSTER >: O
13D:
i like how ALL of them have a VERy similar voice
AND THE RUSSIAN JUDGE GIVES THEM A 4
Sorta glad I wasn't alive in the '80s.
07lol
07Guys!
Same.
The animation is both bad AND not modern.
/me 13is a fake hipster!
because I thought G1 was waay better
The 80s had Gundam.
e_e
13Sorry. lol
Go Dream Team!
4Anyways
07We are here for something!
4Let's discuss this trial
Games where only 8-bit back then and My Little Pony sucked.

Well, if you've ever watched a harem, most of the main characters are 'pricks'.
Question: Which pony is which pony?

I now wish to bite EVERYONE.
TWILIGHT SPARKLE DOES NOT APPROVE OF THESE PONIES' ACTIONS

Smoozy smoozy smooze!
WHY THE TORTURE?!
4Not right now
Are they sailing with a Bra?

80's jingle that sounds like a 50's song
Hey, this is one of the best songs of G1
What is this I don't even
this is why I requested THAT one
....
man, 80's television kinda sucked didnt it?
07We are using a couple tools to make our job easier. We use skype to keep each-other informed
4Really, /kick and /mode are the ones that you should know for now
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
K, back to Little Shop OST
My favorite anime is from the 80s.
e_e
I just don't even anymore

It was the golden age.
Now think how fking awesome a FiM smooze would look like
this song is horrible
Muck use slime, Its SUPER EFFECTIVE!
See, now THIS? THIS is just fricking weird

There was good 80s shows. G1 MLP wasn't one of them

Who is that Rankin-Bass levtover?
07Also we have discussion forums we use for idea's, plans and well pretty much everything.

how can you like this but not sea ponies?
Just think. They're making live action movies every other day now of 80's cartoons. ten to twenty years from now the same will happen to 90's cartoons.
The one where the rarity look alike licks applejack?
4What is this?
Yeah, if we're watching Pre-FiM Poni, then Silly Pony
The early 80s had awesome mecha, the late 80s filled with awesome slice of life.

No wonder the Tea Party is so unpopular

This pinkie sucks at parties
THAT'S A PONY

Scootaloo wants to do butterfly.
Jump out the window.
Would a child even watch this?
D:

ADD for the win
She wants to see Fluttershy!
Oh jesus.
6That is what I have to do
/me passes out torches And pitchforkes.
... Scootaloo would like to do butterfies. What.

I think I have an IDEAR
13Yeah, its easy. :P

62Like this?

DAT MUSIC
eenope
I've shattered my monitor and can't see what I'm doing, so I'm gonna go impale myself on the nearest sharp object I can find now
so for me
I think only infants would enjoy this
6,2Eeyup~
4Oh my, didn't know we had a connoisseur of bad MLP in the house :P
Please no…how long is this?!
my command is ctrl+k: 2,14
That wasn't quite my intention...
i have an idea. why don't we take this cartoon...and FUCKING KILL IT.
this makes me appreciate gen4 so much more
lol
2,14 and it gets me this
and then Scootaloo broke her neck
>yfw this is half over
infants would not enjoy this either
ok
OoooooooooooooohhhaaaaaaaAAA
6,2
Do you think their meat is edible?
So....how long did this generation last?
072 mins left
Infants would enjoy Matlock. They don't know diddly
07hang in there!
Depends…what do you mean by the word "connoisseur"...
BLEED FASTER, STAB WOUND OF MINE.
I'm going to cry
My maniacal laughter is getting a workout
At least G3.5 Scootaloo has good facial expressions, but thats about it
/me laughs manically
I would like to see a bazooka do something to these ponies...
no spaces
Close your mouth Pinkie D:
4It's starting to sound like Sims music
BLEEEEEEDDDDDDDDD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw4pxJcsc
Two minutes left and yet pretty much nothing has happened.
just ctrl+k:#,#
I WILL NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SEA PONIES EVER AGAIN.
anythign else?
6,2There are no spaces. . .
Please tell Celestia to send Luna back to the moon for this.
I like how Scootaloo is not only not cool, but is almost obnoxious.
MORAL OF THE EPISODE TIME
This didn't make any sense.
buh......
DE END
oh
Wait, what.
I'D RATHER HAVE SEA PONIES THAN THIS
.....
DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA
SEA PONIES ARE HEAVEN COMPARED TO THIS.
Fuck this shit, I'm going back to my murder mysteries.... maybe I'll kill some 3.6 ponies....
YAYAY
what even happened
Those diapers with cutie marks on them must be expensive if they have to make one for everypony, and most people know how many diapers a baby can go through. Also, how did they get cutie marks at such a young age?
What moral? It had nothing to do about this.
now we play the opening backwards
no ctrl+k after the comma
13I think Dari has to setup the rest for hop and such.
Horses can stand on there own and even run minutes after they're born; therefore, these must be handicapped.
WAIT WHAT
ya
Meanwhile.
0Now Nittany
Its over.....*cries*
I would get diabetes if I bit.. those... those... they are NOT Ponies as I know pon ies...
only need to press it once
6,2I am an idiot? x.x
FIRE ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON.
So, 3.6 was 3.5 Cheerilee telling stories about being a kid?
dat filler ending/opening stock footage
Dear Princess Celestia, please kill me.
THAT CAN'T BE THE END. What's the morale?
SEA PONIES ARE AT LEAST SO BAD IT'S HILARIOUSLY AWFUL
thar you go!
4Sath, what was this video?
That was the worst thing I have ever seen, till the next time i watch G3.5
er, baby
IT'S OVER
/me hugs violet

Shit, that was... well, shit.

2,14 the first is much more pleasant on my eyes :P
0There was a story board?
Oh, wait, I know. The morale of the story is, when your Flash animators, voice actors, and directors don't give a shit, you produce shit.
that never happened
13You're welcome.
4It's our pleasure, Synros. Thank you for being here
DAMN IN JAMES FARR!!

6This guy is SO high.
silver
6,0Kittens. . . Lots of them. . .
And then the woman at the window had a mental breakdown.
<.<
What do you mean its not AWESOME!?
There's really no point. While I found Portal 1 enjoyable to a degree, I felt it didn't live up to its hype.
*Can't stp chuckling*
when will you need the email images by to make it in time for the newsletter?
one of THOSE
His impression is actually pretty good.
this is amazing
call it what you want still comes off short bus
It's dead on.
Like, if you have a reason for not liking it I'm okay with it. But the least you could do is explain why
Can't tell if they are acting or they are actually trolling the store
THe DRAMA, the DRAMA!!
Yes, MrEvergreen?
so yeah what I did was I had Portal 1 and 2 open at the same time and took screenshots of me looking at the same things :D
And yeah, Portal hype is massive though.
Plus, I never bought Portal 1. I borrowed it from my friend and beat it in a single night.
OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD
Music's not bad
PLUS TAX
Shortbus is a terrible B movie
lolz
the lady sounds terrified
I didn't play Portal 1 :c
Really? I thought the story and the humor was great
well Portal 1 was ment as a fun little Mini game rather than a full on game
Since my friend does not have Portal 2, I can't play it.
PONY TOYS
O.o
I see Sidestroke likes it :D
I did do Portal 2, since I borrowed it from a friend.
LOL
OH MAN OH GOD OH MAN OH GOD
I want a pony toy
But I feel like I'm missing out
Portal 2 is more of a full game
6MR. SOCKLES
MR SUCKLES!!!
/me beat portal2 too quickly :/
Oh, it certainly did have good humor, and I really liked the ending song.
Pony toys?
The music's not bad? The music is awesome
this guy is an amazing troll
Everythings funny
I'm laughing my ass off...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df150UHbBJo
Oh god, there was one Portal 2 room that I just despised
hazz ending song!!!
That man is a boss!
Blizzard makes far better music
which one?
It was one of my least favorite moments in video games
oh silver isn't here
0YES
oh applejack
you are so silly
when?
THAT, just TAHT
so he got his toys?
YES.
The reason I like Portal? Creativity
LOL
YOU IS
Its awesome
yeah
It certainly was that
OH SNAP
It was the giant room with the tower of stairs in the middle
but Plorf
4Well guys, I think I'm out for the evening
Everything involved in that
13Whos a silly pony? You're a silly pony! Who is? You is! Applejack!
AppruJack? AWESOME.
lolwut
i like it for the plot.
just
oh god
4I'll catch you later
APPLEJACK
It was just brimming with creative puzzle-play and witty dialogue.
You sillypony!
I LOATHED it
>.>
The Portal Gun was, in and of itself, quite ingenious.
have a good night ghosties
13Goodnight Ghosties
stairs…in the middle...
uuh...
4*waves*
AppruJack = Japanese Applejack
in the 1950s part
Near the beginning of it
oh
um
lol
use your Horsesense!!
stairs...stairs...
But, as for the rest, like I said, it didn't really live up to its rather MASSIVE internet hype.
13Whos a silly pony? You're a silly pony! Who is? You is! Applejack!
Bye Y'all.
SushiJack = Japanese Applejack
Apple = Ringo
:x
It was quite unlike anything I'd played before, and it was brilliant.
I don't remember stairs.
Mason?
...
There's an elevator shaft
See ya, VeeWave!
That's like asking a king to be a god
AJ is so silly
Just saying. ^.^

MrEvergreen, there is not a lot i can not play aside from wind instruments, though i am primarily a pianist
Super well done!

Aye, I do appreciate pianist skill set, wind instruments are nice also.
Ah, I love the piano.
Summer?

Braeburn is the best part
Bronydom should have all this power!
I, unfortunately, am no good at piano, despite wishing desperately to be so.
And I remembered I have yet to play co-op
Yay
Those two can contribute a great deal to epic background.
/me coughs. He seems to be hacking something up. It's blue, and has lot's of random letters in it. What could it be?
/me pulls a power armor out.
HERE WE GO
