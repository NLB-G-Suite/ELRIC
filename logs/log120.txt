As long as you don't advertise on our main channel, then I have no concern
dammit, stop spoiling everything...
Scootabuse is WRONG! You sickos!
They didn't do the cooking by the book...

The most murderiffic were "bananas" in their mind.

If I may present a rebuttal?
Slap fight.

Fluttershy's innocence has been corrupted :(
Well, I'll just explain that to her when she says she didn't like it.
No spam
Solo: Which episode is good to introduce someone?
@Solo: The problem with the first 2 eps is that they are very Magical Girl-ish.
Solo: Yeah.
Pinkie Pie would be an actor in the movie
It's how they deal with fucking trolls.
Joke???

This would be an average movie on Pinkie Pie's list
good thing she's afk
NorthEast, people just don't like the old, unusual movie.
Boy, now THAT made me laugh

Pinkie Pie would be the Dr.
THE BEAUTY.
i think it depends on the person solo the first to can be a good starting point it was for me
They treat them like the jokes they are.
grimfallop Fluttershy would have passed out by now
Yeah, you have to take this movie with the knowledge that it is nuts.
hmmm...that wasn't it
I... I STILL can't find anything to bite. It would just be playing into their paws.
Nah, the one with the high voice.
13Dont see one though.
and then there was magic
07will do!
this movie would make pinkie proud
Unless you thrive on high/heroic fantasy.
I nominate WarGames for next movie.
Fluttershy would be Janet
crack snorts this movie to get high
Yeah, we probably should have explained that before
WHERE HAVE ALL THE HEROES GONE?
Seconding WarGames
>Ghosties can't read, apparently.
._. my innocence....
WHERE ARE ALL THE GODS
The first two episodes were there to establish that it's an adventure series.
11*facehoof*
I think you need to see the first two, and I think that is a flaw.
13Should work. :/
I dunno, I think Twilight would fit Janet more...
Shall.We.Play.A.Game?
The rest of the first season was there to build up the inter-personal friendships of the main characters.
;_;
Labyrinth! We need Bowie!
no
/me 0likes this verse
the first two episodes, I find, are poorly received by many first-timers.
I nominate Bubba Ho Tep
Hey.
YES!! We must!
I support Bowie based movies
the trolls I believe
what.a.strange.game.the.only.winning.move.is.not.to.play
I STILL say Plan Nine. If ONLY as a cleansing rinse.
WE MUST
Yeah, Bubba Ho-Tep would be right in line with this film.
ung, I'll just relog
SYMBOLIZISM!!
Didn't we show Plan 9?
Every episode is predictable.
Wait, I fixed it.
>Ghosties can't read.
I nominate Radioland Murders.
For FiM Season 1 marathon weekend.
2nd to last song
Ain't even mad.
Clarify
dat makeup!
I think you're being pointlessly silly.
ung
wait
mfw it still doesn't remember I'm a mod >.<
11Wait
11Ghosties
o_o
No doubt, the rest of season 1 is mostly slice-of-life.
dr died?
orgy in the pool?
Keep it civil Dush
If we don't pick Labyrinth, then we need Braindead for that lawn mower scene!
WTF?
lol
Dusk*
There's always Tremors 2, with one of the greatest lines ever...
Stow it, Wheels!
Gay meter over 9000.
Because I actually care
Solo: Ok. Agreed.
He doesn't.
13Pool orgy time!
That I've yet to figure out
Well, mind that MLP:FiM is actually a show for all genders, just aimed at a younger audience.
I was also contemplating choosing "Five Across The Eyes" in order to torture you all with one of the worst movie viewing experiences ever.
IT'S OK TO BE GAY
reallky
My mind was gone a loooong time ago
11Hm, but would arguing solve whatever problems you see in Ponychan?
YES
but that'd kill the buzz
w00t! Heels and Wheels!
13Hmm...
:creepygusta:
we already watched tomatoes
O GAWD WAT
No
13Oh wait.
HE CAN WALK, ITS A MIRACLE
whoops
I learned that long ago
Which means it ends up being for all ages.
Solo: No, not really. Or not at the begining, like most episodes. Once Rarity began to whine, it became clear.
HHmm...
I tried that and it doesn't work
I'd rather be straight TYVM.
=.= I desensitized
I think I just saw crack in movie form.
And we have SEVERELY WRONG SIGN.

SEX cures paralysis
IT BEGINS!
one of the weirdest movies ive seen
11So why are we arguing now. =/
He likes his leg alot
13Yeah, try that.
That's why I said being nice and reasonable doesn't cut it on there, neither does yelling or screaming at them
11Arent we just wasting time and energy?
Watching ponies isn't gay.
because statues
oh there we go
Yeah, we are
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
07I know I did!
It's manly.
Neither is tis.
As far as I'm concerned, the only thing I'm here for right now is the movie.
*finds
<3 Pie
13Not like I didnt try to help. lol
That;s the point
How is he doing that?
I liked the first two episodes up until the ened

DAT MOHAWK
Celestia, tell Luna I said Hi! :)
And if he's saying "love and tolerance" is used to counter trolls, then he would be right if this was when Arctic Tempest introduced FiM to /co/. He would be somewhat right now. But the majority of people on there "love and tolerate" each other a lot

You can keep pretending that Ponychan and it's community doesn't have problems, but the fact of the matter is they do. I accepted that I couldn't change any of that but it doesn't mean I don't go there
And I'm not talking about attraction of any kind.

I meant "can't live without".
