Im playing an onlien game so teh actual stream is muted
Yeah...but i have to agree that some viewers are getting out of hand.... it seems like every Day now I see mods arguing with an unhappy/ungrateful viewer :'(
Time for the ongoing adventures of dickshep
Remplacing the vehicular exploration segments by Tedious planet scanning was BS
Its like wtf people!
I'm doing a personal marathon tomorrow, well thinking about doing it, and those are my choices but I am hesitant to what. http://imgur.com/yNGbv

The Developers must have been stoned when they tought of this, ''Let's replace a vehicular segement by probing each planet one by one''
|---------------| that far kenne
not really a country, but it has legitimate borders and requires a passport check
yeah I know it is
but isn't it geographically in Rome o.o
which I had to go through lol
DeathStar: 16 c and raining caillin in there

02how long ago was this?
The Quarians wear suits because they have a low immunitary system
tumblr gave me the idea
Shane337: Means that they are dead or not found.
mario_pony: da fuq bruh??
Alister: so basically they have aids
uh
several years?
mario_pony: You have created a monstrosity
Shepard is wearing Twilight armor
02ah
Shane377 : No But they could easily get AIDS were it not for the suit
xmasskills: :D
Alister: HIV then
or death
But you can only get aids by...sex and touching people
so im not the only one thinking purple=twilight sparkle? :D
Uh oh, Tumblr?
I haven't exactly seen either happen
Alister : They don't have any disease but they can get one easily
do you know you can win this mission
valoreins, that's why he chose the suit
as in everything good, no downside
Alister: Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human ...
Sumica why does he have purple armor?
Dance ALL the dances
MahBoi777: did you see my mastepiece :3
ill brb
Shane337 : It's different
cause CupcakeWarrior hes a part of the saints

Dat Arse

/me throws iPods
I narrowly avoided it this time
dat mask
LO
L
gasp!
dat alien
dem argueing
there is something fishy about that
00,10that would ahve required me to do the reaper IFF mission first
14you must admit that the last "click wheel" iPods were looking yummy o.o
14especially green/orange ones
00,10which would meen the death of the crew of the normandy
14:3
Use the bottom left

RENEGADE ACTION!
Seems the most dickest to me ;)
wait what?
http://sa-cd.net/showtitle/7558
I wonder if that has surround?
A Night at the Opera doesn't though :/
OOOHHH. She called him a *Quietly* what does that mean? :s
huh, either way if you havent tried this misson with legion make sure you do next time
what is this about??
nothing
at all
Ahole?
Legion was my 2nd favorite teammate after Garrus.
same here
00,10Oh I have seen it already
00,10it's funny but if you do reaper iff mission it starts the events for the end game
Funny reactions from the Quarians
@Sumica : btw who is your romance in this run ?
welp...im back...turned out i wasnt as tired as i thought..
The reporter
00,10and if you do any missions after thse events start it meens you get there too late to save the crew
So if you don't save the crew from the collector ship is the memorial wall on the Normandy in 3 full?
Sumica so you get the bad ending if you do?
A surround version of ANATO exists
I cried when Garrus was on my memorial wall.
What?
Garrus is awesome.
:o
How did Garrus die?
Even if he's best dyer
on SACD?
whoa what is happnin up in here..
on DVDA
also, what's DSD? I see it mentioned for stereo
He stayed behind to protect the elevator from seekers
DSD is the coding used on SACDs
it's worse than PCM
I'm sorry to hear that Scarlet

http://derpy.me/jfgi
/me huggles RainBowJack
valoreins, free distributed web cache
valoreins: webhost of bronystate
its not our host, it sits infront of the host
It's a service where if a website is offline, they provide the cached version
i thought some DA user or something... :s
XD
It *should* increase uptime
what they said^
Krakass, ikr
when the site does go down it caches the fact that the site is down, and breaks things
So if NFS still having problems, or is it just us?
is*
oh Sumica is there anyway to change ones /nick password?
dat AI
ok thx
The register feature/service is one of the best things the IRC server has
seems all good right now

Cypresswolf, how'd it go?

Very Important Brony, probably
Fair enough
hello everypony
Phase4: 7 installation got as far as near the end of step 2 - gathering files, settings, & programs, then vista stopped it - error 0x80070570 - Error End fixed it...
Hello LightTrooper105_.
wops let me change that
there we go
And hello LightTrooper105.
lol hello Twi_Fi
Cypresswolf: have you done a full disk scan? including searching for bad blocks?
true
Sundaysmile, if you have just entered a moment ago, then I say hello to you too.
Tried again - got 2 minutes into copying all the files - error 0x80070020 - stopped again...-_- Ran Error End again...now installation wont run at all without "an unknown error"
thanks Twi_Fi
took forwever getting in, website's down apparently
Cypresswolf: run disk cleanup, i'm guessing that will fix that error
Yeah, I heard from others that there were problems, but I didn't encounter any when I logged in.
i dont know why the site is slow
yeah, its usualy better than this
06just woke up, almost 2 PM =W=
Slow? The site bronysatate site doesn't even work for me :'(
So, even though there is supposedly about 98 individuals in chat, in reality there is less?
In about ten minutes, guess what...
Who is actually chatting on bronystate?
Im bak
Hello TheRandomkid321.
Welcome
hello TheRandomkid321.
Twi_Fi: quite a few less, theres a few bots and lots of people just idle in this room
Contex[Away]: lol @ your nick
Sumica, ten minutes.
00,10djpon3 stull no
Ah
Sumica: ???
Seemed like less were talking.
sumica says nah
disc cleanup complete...really dont want to run 7 again right now...I've lost count of its upgrade failures -_-
o.o
Sumica says, "Talk to the hoof!"
/me hugs SuperBrony64|VIB for his awesome game sense
Cypresswolf, I take it you don't want to do a clean install?
Vista shouldn't be this darn impossible to upgrade
Time: 6:55a Eastern/5:55a Central/3:55a Pacific.
Ohai Bronystate! :)
Been about 6 months since I last used Vista.
Is that just clicking Install whent the 7 menu comes up?
Hello MadSurge.
Who's on? Sumica and SuperBrony64?
MadSurge, yes.
Yes.
Maybe? It's been awhile since I've installed 7. But it formats your HDD in the process.
If you install W7 over a older windows install it moves all files into 'Windows.old'.
Pound
Puppies

minutes.
Nobody wants to watch pound puppies.
^ That.
I went on sloganmaker.com and typed in sumica and this was my result... Always the real thing, always Sumica.
Not in two minutes, not in one minute.
00,10Lol
Infamous is a pretty good sandbox series.
Im 13 and I wish I had an NES.
Now less than 100 seconds.
Retrogames are the best ones, graphics are secondary.
Stop spamming the fucking pound puppies
Having graphics isn't a bad thing, the first Crysis was awesome and had godlike graphics.
1 minute!
Crysis 2... no. Just no.
Pound puppies fans here, go turn on your TV now! Becasue it's in less than 1 minute!
/me is listening to both chat and Party With Pinkie at the same time.
graphics are a tool for artists
Gameplay should come before graphics
Rhythm Heaven is actually my current favorite Nintendo series!
lol graphics has always been a selling point!
00,10lol nope
00,10it's a new thing
I must say graphics are a nice touch to a game but I hate people who are all like WHY WOULD YOU WANT A NINTENDO THE GRAPHICS SUCK CRYSIS 2 IS THE BEST! Crysis 2 is not a good game (in my opinion) and tehy just fool people with good graphics.
MysteryPony: untill recently that mattered. consoles were limited
now everything is powerfull enough it doesnt matter
and yeah, music is overlooked
Hell i love video game music
Crysis 1 was awesome, Crysis 2 was meh
Sunday April 29, 2012, 7:01am.
Whenever I play BF3 I always need to put music on.
games are not all about gameplay, its a multimedia expeience and if any aspect is lacking it reduces the whole
-_- I'm going to look up some patterns on AC wild world, to ponify my game - then I'll give 7 another run...a few hours from now...6 am is too early for that aggrivation
Phase4, dat philosophy.
Sumica likes to smile, smile, smile
In Crysis 1 it was great to mess with the guards and throw shit at them :D
oooo
If you say pound puppies...
Cypresswolf, how long have you been working on that?
should be fun
Ah
Interesting
Sounds spiffy Sumica!
ooh this should be interesting
... did he ever do skyrim... Im just saying...
background music in mlp is epic good
TheRandomkid321: yes he did
Spectrum_Rush besides that small look and why is teh stream down... Im sure he is just doign something.
I bought windows 7 last summer and every couple weeks since then I've attempted installing it - Vista is ---- near impossible to upgrade in my view
oh thennevermind
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDvvPYsTXm0
How come Cypresswolf?
Vista keeps making up or finding new errors to stop the upgrade process
The stream is down for everyoen whiel he does his thing right?
Yep
all it takes is 1 to stop it
Yes, just like he said it would
00,10gimi just a moment
Hello everypony
Cypresswolf: its tourmenting you
Cypress wolf. What did you pay for Windows 7?
You could try just backing everything important up on a external drive and formatting your current drive.
Hey BronyinJapan!
yes, Phase4, soo much - the flames, flames, flames...all over my face....
Hey BronyinJapan.
Hello BronyinJapan. Or shoudl I say. BronyinJapanこんにちは
Hiho BronyinJapan
Does any pony want a copy of Modern Warfare 3 and Gears of War 3 for the Xbox 360?
Cypresswolf: have you tried installing by booting the dvd instead of running from within windows?
BronyinJapan, I'm not getting naked for them again.
google sugests its missing files
?
BronyinJapan なし
What?
o_O Cypresswolf you were trying it from the windows install? Argh :O
Nashi?
You probably don't want to know.
Phase4: I didnt know that was a possibility
xD How did you think people without OS's installed Windows?
Cypresswolf: the down side is you would need to formate frive
11,02MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
dont need to format

Silent film version?
Its not that bad yet
^_^ Silent ponies
/me throws Barrel_Of_Fun
heya TheRandomkid321
Music! :)
Cypresswolf: its a little faster than from windows but you cant do much while its installing, timed it at 20 minutes to first boot once. depends on how fast your pc is
Someone needs to remake this in the style of early silent movies with talking cards
%moometer manechat
00,10so show you just how much background music is taken for granted
00,10and how music sells a shot
It's like one of those black and white movies
A vaccine for moos......
%moometer manechat
What could it be?
Command is spelled wrong
MY LITTLE PONY
I just noticed that
Echoing vocals :D

when you dont realise the background music is there and it improves the show anyway is when its done right

Who did this editing job?
Not high enough.
someone should do this but pull out sound effects
its early in the us, most of them are asleep right now, so thats probably accrate
like the birds
accurate*
How do you know the age?
the birds give it such a relaxing feel
Hey
hey
Bye their actions
00,10that would require acess to the raw tracks
Wow, my mind is full of bananas.
Its more of a maturity thing than their actual physical age
what's this? background music focus?
Eeyup
Interesting indeed.
MEntal Age if you will.
Hey, I have an idea. Let's demand Sumica stream Pound Puppies.
derpy_pony yes. And congrats on winning the lottery.
I have never realized how the background music has that much of an effect.
Woo
/me headphones on volume max LESDOTHIS
Derpy XD
Twi_Fi: you dont, thats the point
00,10they got the suround sound encodes and killed the front channles and boosted the rear channles
Then what is my mental age?
:l Why can't I hear anyone talking?
I can barely hear the voices
These ponies are so cool
they rerolled 5 times, until finally my name came up, TheRandomkid321 ^^
derpy_pony: why the 5 rerolls?
/me wishes he had seen that
Spitfire is sooo wrong there
@twi_fiagemeter
6 You are 8% twi_fiage. (1292)
PrincessDismo: It's edited to focus on BGM
this is winning how I like it. because the other movies where trolling or b material
Hmm, that didn't come out right.
Spitfire has different hair colors
wut
MadSurge: Oh, Cool. :3
I think it means you're 8.
such dramatique
one choice was mlp the movie for example
How did it know!
I mean.....
00,10SB and me got to talking how music can can be a huge part of things
So I guess grannys hip was eventually fixed...
00,10especaly background music
00,10and how it makes things so much beter even if you dont notice it
This is how season 3 will be.
any way to filter out the background music and watch without it?
Any Ideas for season 3?
Mute Pinkie? What witchery is this?
wow
umm ow
00,10yeah you could do that if you had 5.1 or 7.1 audio versions of the eps
now that i can pay attention to the music, this song is really cute :D
This is actually very interesting.
00,10not many people seem to know that some one did this
I call them '12 year olds' as a sort of maturity level.
I'm sure most of them aren't actually 12.
00,10so I like to share it
I can imagine how little attention gets anyone who makes these sounds?
Princess_Cadence, now I hope that since they pulled out a member of the fair folk, they do a Nuckelavee villain :D
Sumica link if possible?
But it's a catch all remark, and it fits.
Princess_Cadence: I have 36 ideas and counting for Season 3 already :)
Sumica, this is amazing. I never noticed the little cues before.
And I'm 8!
Some claim to be 14 but act like 7.
it's the same in video games. graphics are massively overrated. the musicians provides half of the experience. many indie developers neglect this
wow
And spell like 6.
i just came here... is this kind of a silent movie-version of the episode?
guddn moin everypony :)
Because if we were actually calling people out on their physical age, then ScootaChicken would have some problems
Roayal wedding, heh.
hi Invi
:[ <-- This is how i look like when Applejack Is just using his apples and talking about saving Grannys hip or fighting with Rarity.

Hell, Journey is pretty much all music and graphics and it's a great game to explore
/me hugs somepony_else Spectrum_Rush and Twi_Fi
RX-78-SweetieBot: If I was calling people out because of their actual age it would be hypocrisy at it's finest
Rarity's dress in her fantasy wedding looks close to the dress Cadence wore
moin derpy_pony ^^
exactly
/me hugs Invi back
Wait. She has a nephew.. How does that work?
00,10it's all of s1 with voice off eps

@Cypresswolf HEY!
thanks for link Sumica
Sumica, I first read that as "all of G1 with voice off"
Wait just a minute!
DASH TALKED???
Princess_Cadence: :) What?
Dash is 20% louder
Does anypony want a copy of Modern Warfare 3 and Gears of War 3 ?
00,10she was off camera so was part of the background track
Dash broke the wall of silence
Dash is too loud to be muted! :D
oooo, mini marathon of pound puppies on hub

It's Fluttershy, she's never heard

SuperBrony64|Zzz I have a copy for the 360 I'd like to sale
Pound puppies.

Hay fries :D don't they eat potatoes?
You cannot escape.

11,02Where do you live?
00,10voice track is off
Japan....
11,02:<
I miss those early days when Equestria was even more horse- and fantasy-ish. I love that mushroom table with stacks of hay as seat.
lol
but why Sumica?
00,10it's just the sound efect and music track
JAPAN IS MY FAVORITE!!
MW3.... Id prefere BF3 but any are good.

OW thankyou.
SuperBrony64|Zzz, but shipping is magic.
:D
11,02Thanks anyway though
Echo again?
11,02Twi_Fi: O U
Probably because it was indoors
what are we watching
00,10tree house has thicker more solid walls so there is less echo
does any keep hering aww come on spike
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Ill sell you some terrible wii games for £10 each
yay
Sumica: Damn, I wish I could highfive anyone who thought of that.
without the voices this song is even more surprising :D
Too bad you won't notice it in show.
I also miss the abundance of Pinkie songs out of nowhere
11,02That still cost a lot to ship :(
the fun thing is, fluttershy actually did it because she wantec to help a friend. then angel happened
wooooow
wow
I really like her mane!
Why did I have my volume up so high.....
Suddenly benny hill
dat benny hill

Allow me to express myself by saying, "wut."

/me trees too
*ba dum tisk*
in texas she could shoot them all
YOU B!ITCH!
/me lolol booooo~
i like how they put a lot of echo indoors, that isn't really something you can really notice
Rainbow Dash is a jerk.
relief
Twi_Fi why?
00,10but the thing is it's always around Barrel_of_Fun
shouldnt she give one to spike, and one to herself?
Why is the music louder as usual?
why did he need a window?
:O WHAT DID YOU DO TWI?!
00,10and you would notice if it was gone even if you could not figure out why you would just feel it was wrong
Invi, she was dancing and singing about how she was the one who was going to get the tickets.
why cant we hear the retching?
Knew she had 6 friends. Only gave her two tickets. TROLOLOLOL
And so trollestia was born.
jackpot
its a background noise
;) Yay They get to go all in there wait
SPIKE?
:S
AHHH!
voices
Dashie being loud again xD
why didnt celestia just send 6 tickets?
haha
dat face.
i wonder if other shows put so much detail in their sound
chortling
dat giggle
ohgod louder laugh.
what does chortle mean?
Barrel_of_Fun: they do
WE FUCKING LOVE PONIES!!!!!!!!!!
6_9 DAT FACE APPLEJACK.
00,10I would bet no
lolol: because she's a troll
many shows do, Barrel_of_Fun, you just rarely notice it
BARREL!
I wish more people in this fandom would try watching pound puppies instead of just going "hurr durr seekret butt fuuun lulz"
Why is the background music louder as usual?
TheRandomkid321: its a type of laugh
00,10i think things like this add alot to why people like the show and cant realy figure out why.
Never knew backround music was that awesome
lolol, maybe it's usually expected to bring a date instead of a gang to a gala like this
wat
I liked it more when the show was called Hogan's Heroes.
Moar
Wait, I just realized, we watched a whole episode.
utueb
lol
^
most of the emotional guidance in the show comes from the music
That's the important part to quality products Sumica. The combination of the whole. If the sound's bad, good acting won't save it, and vice versa.
00,10exactly
wat
applejack has a REALLY long neck in that front shot
can any one else not hear the voices
00,10which is why I am glad you are all likeing this as well
They managed to strike the right balance for this series, which is one of the reasons for the huge fanbase.
alexmm yeo
I don't care for pound puppies.
alexxm thats the point
alexxm, that's the point
DAT FACE :$
AAAAAAA
LOUDAAAA
sorry Rage-Bit and Krakass
Rage-Bit, Krakass shit snapples man!
wut
Fance
LOUDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That echo makes it awesome
You're just to fast lolol
alexxm: you better be sorry >:C
It's definitely an interesting idea Sumica.
My little ponies, you are missing the point!

00,10noticeing AJ has a bit of a theme song too.
i am lolol
You mean 'banjo'? :P
stampeeede
random yay
^_
Lick my feet alexmm
how many series has the fanbase thereof actually modified episodes of just to hear the background music? I love this fandom :)
MOOO-
rainbow!!

That is all.

You heard me alexmm, NOW lick my feet!

THE KIND OF DAY WHICH IVE DREAMED SINCE I WAS SMALL

INSTEAD OF HAVING CAKE
I wonder if that's there even in other locations like the everfree forest
hillbilly leitmotif
00,10enough with the all caps
lolol, pets don't talk for some reason
hey CrazyCherry hows your day been
i was just wondering the same Krakass
So...what is this exactly?
but ponies are technically a pet!
and spike is a pet!
Who has a pet pony?
they are technically rubber ducks
rich people
00,10I like dashes theme here
Krakass, who doesn't!
ponies ar technically marhmallows
lolol, in the real world yes, but in equestria they are the dominant sentient species
Me. :-(
Oh this scene :D
Dat music.
dat rainbowdash's face
Pinkie :D
Soo Awesomw /)^3^(\
never noticed this
*Awesome
Oh nearly silent movies have never been so good
Fluttershy: *trollface*
Well that sucked!

I've found silent movies are too quiet
So mayor D'awww in Fluttershy's music
dash always has the best themes

00,10dat music skip when Aj is not there

Yo Twilight I'm really happy for you and I'mma let you finish...
Is there anyone here from yesterdays movie night?
WAAA

Yes CrazyCherry, why?
Well it's 0630. I should probably go to bed or at least try to get a nap. You kids enjoy your ponies.
I am CrazyCherry
i am CrazyCherry
haha, the bgm is so goofy here
I think that ponies were dominant in a previous universe, then twilight destroys the universe to spare everyone from a terrible infinite torture from an infinatly powerful luna/discord/god type figure, then universe compresses, and make a new big bang, that gave us the universe we are in now, more realistic and with humans
/me skipped movie night like a boss.
Woo!
woo
cya Krakass
Dat wall of words
Just askin'!
..is AJ drunk?

"lol"
being sleep deprived is like being drunk
but luaran faust is a surviving pony that cant remember her past life and was remade as a human, and is now discovering her memories and episode plots
hmmmm.....
too much cider i suppose :/
lolol, that thing Twilight saved everyone from must have been really, really terrible if humans were the better alternative
yep
[lol]
not that either
ALL THE HUNGRY PEOPLE LISTEN:
lolol, I question your hypothesis.
:D Pinkie was barely hearable there :D
am i done now lolol
RainbowAsh: no she saved all the ponies from infinite torture and misery from this new ruler
Phase4: if thats so i dont see what all the fuss about getting wasted is
IM EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CReAM RIGHT NOW
¨lol¨
herp
the human genetics and realistic no magic physics are just random
HA! Get it!? "What on Earth is that pony doing?"
-lol-
Princess_Cadence, I is jealous.
alexxm did i say you were?
/me smacks Princess_Cadence with newspaper
no
Spectrum_Rush: alcohol has other effects
NOW getback to licking my feet!
lolol, "This is going to be real bad. Better end the universe before we got to endure it."?
<HEY
I just had a chocolate muffin Princess_Cadence :)
omg
One side effect of alcohol is.........DEATH.
I made muffins yesterday
THEY TALKED!
How do you do the thing that everypony uses for something they do?
sleep deprivation can also lead to death
So much teleportation
Phase4: i wouldn't know entirely i've only been 21 one for seven hours now
lol
RainbowAsh this is INFINITE, meaning if she didnt, they would be tortured for an INFINITE pain for an INFINITE amount of time, killing everyone and the evil figure would relief them from having to go through that
Spectrum_Rush, oh, happy birthday then
Well happy birthday then!
drinking age is 18 here
ok lol
I would admit, it would be a hard decision, but what would you do?
happy birthday Spectrum_Rush
RainbowAsh: thank u kindly

Spectrum_Rush: I will offer you a ONCE in a lifetime, honarary glomp, from me to you, once in a lifetime

for your birthday
Twi_Fi: thank you
audio's a little out of sync
.....jaaaaaaack!
lolol much ablogized
So long as you at least tried watching the show is all I care about. I just hate how the brony community tends to hate things just for not being ponies
Twilight is displeased.
*gooooonnnnggggg*
This part is so much better without the voices.
so...rainbowdash was only launched only about 200 yards from her orginal position??
Princess_Cadence: thank you princess
@Spectrum_Rush If I could i would give some of my chocolate ice cram for your birthday.
That_British_Guy, no, she circled the world once before crashing into Twilight's balcony
thx RankWinner
RainbowAsh: well Princess celestia issues it, and she knows her shit,
I can't say I hate the show.
'i dont even like seaweed' that implys they eat seaweed, which is cool
But, I haven't tried watching it either......

1 pony + 100 trees?? LOL!! no.
That_British_Guy, and yet they would go broke without the Cider business
dat buffer
/me sleeps
Half the acres is still a pretty good acievement
twilight the troll
well considering Granny Smith is pretty much the feudal lord of ponyville it'd be expected
hax
yep.
RainbowAsh well their taxes must be through the roof!!
wtf why no sound?
wtf rarity can do an entire acre in one go?!?!?
Lesson: we all suck as individuals but together we can suck less.

Why do they even wear saddles?
to keep them warm
Its winter and no snow?!?!
What do they need saddles for anyway?
00,10to keep warm
This is what happens when we don't have new episodes, we end up dissecting the old ones and analyzing everything.

Fair enough 6_9

LOL!
Very good, Some of the other ponies even visit us sometimes Glad you asked CrazyCherry :)
HAHA
This Day Aria? I can't stop listening. It's the best villain song I've heard in years.
i think we're going to see an increse in the quality of tv
Because MTV isn't about music anymore :D
^
Those were good times
Everyone knows that you don't go to MTV for music anymore.
:[ Not again
you go to the internet
You're welcome your Majesty!:)
MTV is depressing now
Only for shitty reality shows with inflated bimbos
These songs need a Grammy award.
and hi guys

Wait for the full songs before demanding Grammies.
Hi Rocklobster.

Do you remember Fluttershy saying "I wish i was a tree."

Well she's a tree
Monfang those links dont work

Also
Raindrops is best background pony

From the opening where Rainbow Dash is gathering the pegasi and can't find fluttershy and finds her as a tree easily.

Fun fact: i'm working on the cache plugin for this site
Pony with a gun! Hit the floor!
Thats cute :D
without it the site runs (my local mirror) at 7 requests a second
We Ultra Marines are proffesional :P

Goodbye JRP2234
Where did Fluttershy learn to take down Rainbow Dash in the episode Dragon Quest?
my modifications have bumped that up a bit more when running in the normal mode
plus it caches more efficently
............Iron Will?................
Ding
man I'm getting tired but i don't want to sleep yet
Dong
Easy one.
Need to find some cross season ones.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1982/ realistic Applejack and Applebloom :D
the fun bit is when you add in my largest change, static files + url rewriting
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs
site reaches 2.3k requests a second on my laptop
XD
Count the words Luna said in normal voice in both seasons.
GO
What did RD try to use as leverage in that episode, to make Fluttershy come see the dragons?
The fact that she also went to some kind of Butterfly thingy?
correct
):
Count the words Luna said in normal voice in both seasons.
GO
Radu: 11 not including the haloween episode
Define normal
Oh my.
You're good.
/me is counting from memory
wait... 12
missed one
Not counting the halloween episode?
Normal? NORMAL!? What is "Normal?" :P
Did you count "Halt! Who goes in there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle..."?
"I missed you so much big sister" from season one
Radu: wouldnt call that normal
"What did I miss?"
normal as in not canterlot ?
Monfang: i was remembering that wrong
Yup
"Rest, My Sister. I shall Guard the Night."
Monfang: the second one i remembered as "hello, did i miss anything"
That's most likely it
Wasn't it Hello everypony, did I miss anything?
And "Who Goes there! Stay inside Twilight Sparkle!"
TO THE VIDEOS!
Halt^
Yall pay more attention that I do.
xD
Maybe I should rewatch all the episodes just for the heck of it
Still more quizzing?
Eeyup
"Hello everypony, did i miss anything" is the correct line
We're trying to count how many words Luna has spoken in non-canterlot voice
After this, I got a blast
As in not volume boosting
Rest My sister,as always i will guard the night
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2RBsBOOgMc - Pinkie Pie IS WATCHING!
Madame mayor , thy princess of the night hath arrived
That's it, Cadence.
Okay, okay. When you're ready, next one coming.
I knew I was missing some part
"i'm so sorry, i missed you so much big sister" is the line from ep 2
Wait!
or ep 1 part 2
I got one no one can answer!
depending on how you number
Okay new one:
.....
A warning would be nice.
she may have boosted the "halt who goes there..." part, since she was way up in the tower, needed a voice boost for twilight to hear her
I was just trying to keep up
How many times has Trixie reffered to herself as "The Great and Powerful Trixie"?
Radu: all the times
I shall guess... 6
Monfang: its an automatic thing
6 times
Moonfang, I think way more
Better to undershoot it than overshoot it.
what number is boast busters again
5, wasn't it?
5
ah nvm, have to get back to my code anyway
6
5 was Griffon the Brush-Off
What's up everypony, this is your favorite #Enigma saying: SHOW_ON
Ahaha, sorry for keeping you busy Phase4 :p
British guy, I do not approve
Radu: its not a problem, need a bit of a break
theres much less actual coding than you might think
I am of the mindset that you do not ship an OC character with a canon character.
Okay. Count the squees in both seasons.
Go, they're not many
7
most of your time is spent figuring out how things are suposed to work
Moonfang: You sure?
No
BEEEEEEEZ. How do they work?
But I'm going 7
freking wordpress and its hyper complicated actions system
I think it's 5
Don't you have the answers?
more than 5
Boast Busters is 6
EEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nope
To pass the time heres a short story
/me rises from his grave and kills headless zombies
Then why are you asking the questions?
Radu: a positive integer that is greater than zero
Indeed.
2078: Matrix created.2078 and one day: An old man enters the matrix to﻿ spend the rest of his life prancing with ponies.
Who does Spike get the ball from in secret of my excess?
What pony does this remind you of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKRgktzRvZ0
Ok, I got a question that no one can answer:
/me licks lolol
Oh my.
keep going
I'm off online on MK7, lets see how much I fail ')
In what scene.. did we see two of the main cast kiss?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gMlhCcwElI&feature=plcp
Little Girls:﻿ Oh no, Princess Celestia is mad at Twilight! I'm now feeling somewhat sad!Us: Freaking bawling.
when can i stop lolol
Monfang: Rarity kisses Spike
reactions to that^ scene
I wasn't bawling
Spike isn't part of the mane 6
I was pissing myself laughing
when i say you can
Monfang: i'm trying to think, there was one that looked like a kiss iirc
you said mane CAST not mane 6
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICteTrd1UkY - contains psycho twilight
spike has no mane, your argument is invalid
Mickedly Split?
I cheated :p
In the Mare Do Well episode it looked like Applejack and Rainbow Dash may have kissed.
Nope.
rainbow dash and fluttershy during epic changeling fight scene
Try again.
DING!
Also, it looked like Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash may have kissed in the finale.
only crazed shippers think any of them mane 6 have kissed in any scene
I got it?
The animation doesn't show it, but there is a short kissy sound when Fluttershy kisses Rainbow Dash on the nose just to taunt the shipping fans.
*'kisses'
No, Rush got it
because its on my mind: when twilight tackles twilight in the changling battle and it turns out the real one was on top, that was awesome
Monfang, ah but Sumica slowed down that scene for us and we all analyzed it. There was no actual kiss, sadly.
Its Twilight sprakle not Twilight.
you just naturaly assume she's the one that got tackled and the shows like 'nope'
I said that. The animation doesn't show it
Monfang......the main cast......OH you mean that scene where Fluttershy was surrounded by RD clones, but the real RD KO'd the clones, and then she lifted up Fluttershy, that looked like a kiss
However, there is that sound.
Twilight is: AAAAAAAAAH THE HORROR THE HORROR! Twilight Sparkle is: YAAAY!
Monfang, yes true. The sound is indeed there.
wondered what that sound was
it was a perfect tease
ha i got it
I think Rarity and Fluttershy would be a good couple.
/me waits.
....
I don't think any of them would make a good couple with the other
I have nothing to say on that matter
crazed shippers everywhere
ugh
I think only bromance works with the mane six
celestia is calling me
they're all best friends, they're all girls, therefore they must be lesbian
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km1YqjzIsJE
brb
They didn't kiss
They just poked their noses
/me is back
acctually, rd's snout was at the side of fluttershys the entire time
Radu: dont try arguing with the crazed shippers, you cant reson with them
reason*
lol
Princess_Cadence You said it. If Twilight (Sparkle) would say ''Please don't hate me'' I would say: ''HOW could I hate you?'' and then i would pick up one of the Twilight books (which i don't have BTW) and i would say'' YOU, ON THE OTHER HOOF''!!!!!!!!
wtf
Radu: It looked pretty much like a kiss, however
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGboyipxUU - Ponies in my attic
wait Celestia is calling me.
brb
i'm not shipper, i mean i can find the matter cute but that about the extent i'll go
back

The finale has now established the power of love. It is only natural that to increase the power of the Elements of Harmony that friendship be discarded and replaced with love.
Also dat link
OK take your time Princess_Cadence!
The board is now set for season three.
Twilight is dumb romance for stupid girls-
Twi_Fi: *takes off glasses , my god
Twi_Fi Maybe LOVE was the missing Element of Harmony.
no
love is what you get when you combine them all
Spectrum EVEN DBZ HAS A BETTER LOVE STORY!
or something idunno
I've got a sudden urge to watch pony YTP

You're a little late
hi pony_zen!!!!
Speaking of fanfiction, can I rant about a few things I don't like seeing?
GilDash
Hello Gildash...?
Monfang, sure
@CrazyCherry: Fashionably late? ;)
Hi CCCP long time no ABC
Hi bronystate.
Treating Celestia and Luna as 'goddesses'
That is my number 1 peeve
06humpadumpabumbzzzzhup
Princess_Cadence: Hello, Princess! How was your wedding?
HA!!! that pun pony_zen!
GilDash protipp: just type the first letters of a name and press tab
06or just trololol
GilDash: Definetly
hi FillyFlam!
They have done nothing worthy of making them 'deities'
Very good Glad you asked GilDash :)
Lot's of greetings here today I see
moin FillyFlam
this is creepy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPSY9QLNRY0
/me sips tea
Stop treating them like they are.
pony_zen: It's like I'm popular. :O
Monfang: They do raise the sun and moon
then why should i click it CCCP? xD
/me kisses GilDash
Invi: I'm too hardcore for that. :)
GilDash, be a star
/me kisses CrazyCherry.
Invi: idk lol
because ponies
GilDash lol
NO YOU'RE NOT PINKIE PIE, IMPOSTOR!
/me rubs temples
i feel a headache coming
/me is confusseld
Digit|ArtMode drink a lot ^^
/me GOES BACK TO vectoring... woops canterlock
Monfang, well, there is some backing of them in the show, for instance when ponies say "Celestia is my witness", which is of course derived from "God is my witness"
MadSurge: XD
They're Superheroes! :O
lol xD
pony_zen: But stars are really hot... Oh...
lol what?
I haven't drank enough, I want some more hot chocolate
/me continues to kiss GilDash
Digit|ArtMode especially alcohol, so you have the headache later xD
You mean like how they said int he middle ages "The King as my Witness"?
Gildash: :O
/me snuggles against CrazyCherry.
Nah I don't drink that stuff.. err yet
..?
WHERE IS CANADA!?!
hey guys
OMG
you are not Canada
pony_zen: We must find him!
Monfang, I wasn't aware of that. It's understandable how people could confuse that at least.
moin Chrysalis
/me Snuggles back to GilDash
pony_zen: It will be our grand quest!
Although there's a lot of chicks that can do a very good Pinkie impression, and that's awesome
Digit|ArtMode or use the force of caffeine ^^
/me noms CrazyCherry's ear.
hey Chrysalis hows your day been
GilDash a Quest, you say?
hey anyone know any good car chase scene
"King and Country" and "God and Country"
Ah i do feel like having coffee, but it gives me terrible indigestion for some readon
i looove ponies
*reason
thegt90: Bullitt.
For Celestia and Equestria!
omg its Chrysalis :O
yes love that one
CCCP mee toooo
Hey hows everypony
I've still never figure out why
pony_zen: I'm the new Canada remember?
hi DeRpy4Eva
Hi, DeRpy4Eva
I don't like coffe, only fizzy drinks :D
hi DeRpy4Eva!!!!!!!!!!! :D
06Umbreons. that is all
Yes 'New Canada', but you are still not 'Canada'
MadSurge: You're missing out
hello
/me noms GilDash's mane.
@CrazyCherry: But it's just not the same... Sorry...
Digit|ArtMode I have that too, but i grnore that ^^
It's like York versus New York.
06breeonzz
Ah so I'm not the only one, lmao xD
*ignore
but it bothers me D:
Monfang, also ponies don't seem to have any god at all. Considering that monarchy is usually founded by a divine connection, the princesses could be the highest spiritual beings in existance in the pony belief system, which would coem somewhat close to god-ness
chrysalis..
Digit|ArtMode caffeine is laxative, that could be a reason ^^
Whelp i hope Canada comes back...
yes?
O_O
CrazyCherry: So do I. :)
Well... She controls the sun... that's more than we have seen in any religious systmes we have
Careful Cadence, textwallls can get you banned.

/me hugs Nyria
RAWRity shipped you wit her, FlareChaser :D

/me hugs alexxm ^^ "Oh hey there"
lag is making me sad
i dont wanna choak my connection :o
pikorar: yes, that's why i said is was built to fry enemy optics
If anmyone tries to ship with me, Imma go Renegade on them
Tesla created a "death ray" that fired ionized mercury, but the military thought it wasn't practical, though it was powerful enough to take down planes.
i f**king hate fire ants
RAWRity: Now we just need clopfics....
litwick x lyra
pikorar: you gotta listen to me girls... boy... thing
If anything I should be shipped with Derpy :D

/me slaps himself
Biglaw it was a pink gameboy advanced, and I left it on the couch. My dog then proceeded to chewing on it x.x
Looks like it CupcakeWarrior
/me Hugs That_British_Guy
02I think I got to number 3 once
mine's been measured at 143
I've broken two collerbones.
my first gameboy's battery melted, i hid it under my pillow so i could play it after my mum put me to bed
I AM BEING HONEST!
Yeh you never stfu either
Trixie wow, you are genius. literally
Trixie: Impressive!
:)
You are dead not big suprise
I dont think Ive ever had an iq test
02:D
pyrocatboy: how?
silly u
but I still cant vanquish that bloody ursa major...
I remeber in cheerleading, we were doign a new stunt, and when we threw the flyer in the air, she fell back and her foot smashed on the gym floor.
You know it's a bad sign when you fail an IQ test
*doesn't have a measurement of his IQ* :(
I'll get one soon
Trixie: *pats back consolingly* in due time, Trixie. you'll get your shot
02Jet has been number two a few times as well

Shiny!
RainbowcrashNburn I was joking
you can only get an IQ test if you pay or if they believe you are stupid or above average

Oh Hai
Biglaw: actually ive never taken an iq test
I remeber a time when i was 7 and i was in PE, we were playing a game then i got a nail stuck in my back and it went from the bottom of my back all the way to the top :P
Well, failing an IQ test... so in other words, you ranked low?
