10Oh, drf
exactly
03?
I'm a little jealous of the Kinect. Wish the Wii would have something more like it.
Hello everyone
so...how bout that kinect?
03Not sure
03but LOL paying for games
03I'm gonna just get the ROM
kinect = DO NOT WANT!!!
I still can't believe that the Wii U is actually a thing.
agreed, the mods are the only cool thing the kinect has been given
The Kinect has... potential, I'll give it that. Yet, I'm still not interested. :D
10I may ask GameStop sometime, but they may lie/not answer because they WANT you to pay the extra $5
03of course
03which is why I avoid that place like the plague
hello everyone
Kinect is basicly the Eyetoy but with crapper games
10Actually
10they'll probably be like, "I don't know" but really do :P
Should be loading the livestream imo right now :p
The worst thing about Kinect is the terrible demonstrations with the kids
10Since lying looks bad if they get caught
03well
Pro controller for Wii U. Discuss.
I like it :)
Ripoff.
05perfect end dont you think?
Pro controller, good because its a propper controller, now gte rid of all the other ones
./thread
refresh tie *click*
10I don't have any hacking devices
03whose fault is that
/me hides
ripoofs of good ergonomic design is good
/me points to the Dreamcast controller.
ripoffs*
I dunno if I'm gonna buy a wii u for Darksiders 2...
Probably not.
10I'm kind of thinking they won't be unique
I rarely update my drkivers
6.9
every ripoff is a ripoff of the first ripoff
10I mean, Serebii has codes for the Japanese version http://serebii.net/conquest/passwords.shtml
dat livestream
Bye everyone, I'm starting to sense stupid arguments and discussions about things, and i don't digest this well :/ bye
03well then
oooooooo
Dat Halo 4
E3 E3 E3 E3 E3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
old trailer
03:P

10DW is an online server
10so.
never seen this
e3? 10^3?
Halo? Again?

Ive only palyed Halo 3 multiplayer
Hello everypony
Shooters weren't good before Halo either

LOOK GUYS BRO..I MEAN TERRORISTSSSS!
Too easy
DARN ROBOTS
FPS. Fraking Potty Shite
good shot!
Fuck aiming!
there is nothing good about CoD... nothing at all
looks easy
yeah, might've been a good idea to use that thing BEFORE THEY MADE THE FIRST OVERPASS???
CoD is just overdone
Oh great another FPS:|
they need to get beyond the thunderdome
hes on the floor again
It just looks like everyother one
prom night?
Dat hand
I'm not gonna buy this
Call of Booty:Big !@#$% 2
I like it but it's only good for one playthrough
at the end of the day. CoD doesn't suck.
This looks like everything that made the FPS genre horrible
I'm not buying this either
I'm buying because I can make Pony Emblems :P
CoDtards everywhere are gasming...
11,01This campaign really doesn't look fun.
The President has been kidnapped by robots. Are you a Bad enough Dude to rescue the President?
Wtf is the president doing there anyway?
hello all
LASER GUNS?
applejcak emblem
00,03>xray guns
Why would you even fight in this war you die in a second
11,02Call of Duty: Halo?
00,03>multiplayer
USE UR SCOPE SECTION
Pinkie Pie emblem, she is best pony after all
09,01hmm you could choose either to Snipe or Rappel
ref*
Gauss Sniper
Like how no one notices him sniping
Dat reload
This is set in the future
somehow i'm absolutely unexcited
11,02Their demo is just him sniping?
I play games with no crosshairs like a boss.
11,01Dark_Horst: Same.
xray, really? And you thought modern shooters couldn't be more easy
8,6it's like he knows right where they're going to be
00,03SOO MLG PRO!!!!
11,02kirzstryfe: Nanobots :I
Action packed footage
Zzzz
He's needs to upgrade his scanner to aim for the glands
30 clip sniper? wow
...
lol garrett!
All the momentum was lost in the sniper section
ShiiiiiiiiiiiT
In the interest of time....
00,03...
Interest of time again..
um
lawl
fast forward
Wut
:D
lets do the time warp again
Same animations
Interest? I have none
I despise fps's!
CS is sooo last decade.
CSGO...
2142 was great
Call of Duty is boring
The gun looks like it's from boarderland
09,01admittedly, I like the setting
NOT CS
CSS
yeah this look very slow-paced
Counter strike source
this just looks fucking boring...
Still looks like http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/halolz-dot-com-callofduty-genericfps.jpg
09,01I think I'll get it if it really has branching paths
You know this look sactually pretty cool...
Good pic
Drones
00,03Robots are NOT MLG Pro >: (
11,02If it comes out on the Wii instead, I'll be getting it on the Wii :)
This makes me want to play Doom
MegasXLR
i have BF3. there are ponyservers. but they're always empty
And here I thought they would show some Dawnguard news considering they bought the rights for first release Skyrim DLC
I'm excited alien:CM and Borderlands 2
someone needs to organize and event4
Call of Duty: poor attempts to make more creative ways of killing people.
00,03MLG Pro's are SRS BSNS
snake? SNake SNAAAAAAKEE!
mhm
00,03Well, I'm not feeling very MLG today~
yeah, we could play terraria :D

Oh
11,01Not only stagnation. Exploitation.
11,02I know the point of Rhythm Heaven is to be weird and different, but from a financial perspective, it was going to be a gamble I think.
11,01Because gamers are very exploited.
