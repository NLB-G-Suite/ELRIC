Wrek|Dusty: makes sense. I'm sure he wasn't planning on a sudden bike renovation that day
okay enough rp in here
05took the reg plate and filed him in, apparently lost his lisence a few days later
10That didn't sound too dubstep-y
the drivers tried to peg them off

Sylandest: Not too bad, actually. :)
Sylandest: I got less sleep last night, but I'm not as tired, so whatever. :D
06well, back to minecraft
GilDash: good to hear. I'm nomming on breakfast at the moment. I only got up an hour ago myself, lol, so I know that feeling
dat symphonic metal :)
symphonic metal? /me goes on the stream.
Sylandest: Well, I had lunch about a half hour ago, so... :D
GilDash: you and your time zone :P
this metal... IS AWESOME!@!!!!
hm, sounds more like a power ballad to me.
I don't know much symphonic metal, but what I've heard I do like. :)
GilDash: its good to have you here though :) Ninjazz is currently undertaking the Brony Challenge
Sylandest: I know... :S
awwwwwwwww I was going to ask if Legends of the Hidden Temple can be streamed
brony challange?
so much badassness in this the music stream...
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m523nnOM6c1r3xauuo1_1280.png
Dken2021: All the episodes without breaks.
I prefer Swing/Spanish Metal myself.
oh god
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m526oriTnS1r3xauuo1_1280.png
GilDash: hehe, leave him to it. He hops in every once in awhile when he gets a break. At least you have us! :)
i love molestia
Dken2021: Yeah, exactly. I think it's 19 hours in 24 or something stupid. :D
what do you guys say to a LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE episode or two?
GilDash: wats the brony challenge now?
Sylandest: It's his sleep, or lack therof, that I'm worried about. :S
Bronysith: All the episodes in 24 hours.
GilDash: thats it?
GilDash: I'll make sure he goes to bed...though you can help me make sure he does too, hehe.
Bronysith: Basically.
GilDash: hmmmm
Sylandest: Unless I need to go to bed too, I will do. ;)
I ACCEPT
I can do that in 30 mins
to an hour
I have no objections to that, although I've eaten those words too many times already.
its not that difficult
GilDash: hehe, I have no doubt of that :$ You can be very persuasive
It's not difficult, I just don't really have a free day to do it. :D
Sylandest: Oh, I know... ;)
05almost got that ledge >.>
GilDash: meep! :$
sounds like he would need Pinkie's Epic Cupcakes (as in Epic Meal Time spoof) to finish the challenge
Wrek|Dusty: you can do it!
Sylandest: It's just a shame there are others more persuasive... :|
GilDash: who could be more persuasive than you? I've yet to see them
Sylandest: *ahem* Never mind. :D
Sylandest: I'm still waiting for a certain person here to notice me...
hrup
god damn I'm tired
hey guys I can do the brony challenge in about an hour
ewdubstupidz
and be done with it
DitzyHooves: You have to do one at one time, all after the other.
DitzyHooves: No cheating. ;)
GilDash: ahhh, I gotcha, hehe. Well, I noticed you!
Games made by hipsters for hipsters
Sylandest: True. :)
I'm not, I'm watching all the episodes
Sylandest: If she's not careful, I might have a new favourite. ;)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a25ERFjygOA
see
GilDash: then again, I always notice you...if you're not on, things seem somewhat dull
DitzyHooves: One at once. :D
GilDash: f-favorite? :$
Sylandest: I do like to live things up. :D
DitzyHooves: bad move
GilDash: well, you always make things more fun when you're around, hehe :) thats my view anyway

/me is annoyed that only cold honey dissolves in tea properly
05finally getting my sniping act together

Go, Wrek|Dusty, go!
urgh
considering I started with no references at all, which includes time sig, key sig, etc.

fuuuu
*watches tumbleweed pass through chat*
/me watches tumbleweed with YokuPony
where do those things even come from...
I think there an actual plant
TF2 STILL!?
YokuPony: you would think I've seen one myself, living in Kentucky, but nope. things are scarce as anything
05what do you mean still?
Has it not been on for hours?
Or DO I just attract times that TF2 is on?
Sylandest: well don't ask me, I live in the UK :$
YokuPony: :D
Ouch
05i began like... max 30ish minutes ago
Wrek well then... I guess its just luck
wrek, someone stream tf2 right beore you did
*before
this song is dark
WingedCurse taht explains it
kinda reminds me of lavender town... dat song...
I must say this game is much better
valoreins: please don't remind me of that song.....
valoreins: you just reminded me that my silver version died two days ago...:(
TF2 has changed so much since I have played it. =\
My gold died years ago :(
:s
my head was sore when i played it for the first time
YokuPony: I know dat feel *brohug*
05nooo out of tea
NOOOOOOOOOO
THE HORRO

no, not the tea!
ffs I have to restart to get onto windows so I can score this on some notation software
urgggggggggggggh

*hugs Sylandest back* these feels bro....
YokuPony: manly tears were shed for my childhood
guys i have some bad news
eh?
i lost the game
Oh. I thought you where going to say I got you pregnant.
XD
lol
I'm hoping to get heart gold latr this month......but it's not goin to be the same :'(
Stream die?
stream derped?
Starchaser: fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
nmnnnnnope
oh no, it's fine :)
Refresh it. Its still up.
my big bro looked at the stream just now, he said the game looks the same like CoD and he was all like "meh"
rip trololo guy
valoreins: slap your bro a couple of times, to straighten him out
Goodnight all!
TF2 that same as CoD? Thats blaspheme.
aw he left to his room
night, Twi_Fi! Take care!
sweet dreams Twi_Fi !
Or it could even be blasphemy. one of those
epic song is epic
These head shots are amusing.
YokuPony: epic music increases combat ability by a factor of 5
Who uses the back burner anymore?
It does seem to be working.....sorta :\
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
GG wrek. We all did a damn good job
It would appear to be inappropriate music time.
wow epic music
Allo everypony.
howdy, Meanwhile!
lol that scout got owned
i want to join this game :(
'sup meanwhile!
this music makes me feel like i need to do something dramatic and important...
This music sounds like it's part of a post battle montage.
The new Tomb Raider is either going to be very good, or very crap. Too early to tell yet.
the song is brothers in arms by the northern kings
GilDash: welcome back! :)
Sylandest: I was watching you the whole time, just so you know. ;)
Hello Bronystate I regret to inform you that Eduard Khil the trololol guy has died has a heart stroke.
The new Tomb Raider will probably be very much like the old Tomb RAider.
05no its Dire straits - brotehrs in arms covered by northern kings
Meanwhile: I hope so...
Which'd be fine if Tomb Raider weren't old enough to be sibling.
GilDash: y-you were? :$ I hope I kept you entertained
Seriously, what is it with the industry and milking franchises?
Is it /that/ hard to think of something new?
Meanwhile: I dunno, but I just want a nice adventure game.
Meanwhile: lately, it seems that way
Nintendo are the worst offenders but everyone seems to be doing it.
ohai everypony
Allo Jim.
howdy, Jim!
Meanwhile: No one takes risk because... well, risk is risk.
Adventure Time is having a game on the DS soon.
Jim: Holla! :)
Stayed up all night working on this school thing, so tired
Yeah no one takes risk because they can just make the same crap over and over and stupids will still buy it.
Which is the only reason anything Nintendo makes actually gets bought.
GilDash: I was actually waiting for you to return before I went to wash up, hehe. I didn't want to be rude and leave you hanging
Meanwhile: Welcome to life. Have a pleasant stay. :D
Sylandest: Tsk, I'm sure I wouldn't have minded. :D
How dare Nintendo make sequels.
Nintend make nothing /but/ sequels.
GilDash: just trying to be a gentlecolt, hehe :$
Sylandest: That does mean you can't procrastinate from washing up now though. :p
GilDash: .....shoot. did not think of that consequence
Sylandest: Off you go... :D
lol dat FlutterSPY! poster
GilDash: yeah, yeah, I'm going...bah, washing up...I'm plenty clean
Because Dillon Rolling Western, Pushmo, … aw fuck it. *ignores Meanwhile*
brb in a little while, everypony
Nintendos main buisness plan is to remake Mario Zelda and Metroid and the fact that it's working is the really depressing part.
Sylandest: I'll make you messy later. ;)
I think I'll join this tf2-y goodness
GilDash: wh-what? *blushes* :$
Meanwhile: that's what people ask for
GilDash lol sounds like something Princess Molestia would say :D
Meanwhile: To be fair, why would you expect them to do anything different when people buy them up?
People are stupid as fuck.
I hate people.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: You think Molestia is bad. ;)
Anyway, dinner time. I'll be back to complain more later.
Y'all have a good one.
Meanwhile: Please do. :D
call of duty will be the big one for the fanboys out there
Nintendo's only made 6 traditional 2D mario games in the past 25 years excluding the 2 coming out this year.
Hm. I get the impression Meanwhile thinks people are stupid.
GilDash 0_o oh god... lol
And Lets ignore Operation Rainfall which was all about 3 new hardcore Nintendo IPs
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I've been referred to as one before. And a godslayer, iff I recall correctly. ;)
i miss much
GilDash ah i see lol
I like Nintendo, but Mario is my least favortie of their franchises
/me snuggles Sketch_Toku_Brony.
how come YokuPony
I don't really do Nintendo, so it doesn't really concern me.
hey
alexxm: I dunno, it just never appealed to me as much as Zelda or Star Fox
hey derpy_pony hows your day been
as if you'd care
how was yours?
i'm good derpy_pony and i do care what happened
Nostalgia is best mind control
although I have to admit, I did like Mario Sunshine
do the differant weapons have differant effects
YokuPony perhaps you prefer the nintendo games with deeper story lines
hi
05all weapons have their unique trait
hey My hows your day been
thanks Wrek|Dusty
My: Holla! :)
this is getting intense.
hi

GilDash: all washed up now, hehe. I hope you're satisfied? :D
Sylandest: Time to mess you up again. ;)

Mini crossbow!
Crossbows. For when you don't have time to train archers.
Jim: ikr
Petrified_Discord: eeeyup

Pretty not awesome?
Only 30 minutes for lunch.
Gordon Freeman style
Crowbar, because fuck everything else
Hello.
When do they send out the newsletter?
once or twice a week
GilDash has the Chainsaw fuel?
/me gives Lil_B a matchate
alexxm: Combination match and machete
Lil_B: If it does it doesn't run out...
alexxm now THIS is a knoife
Petrified_Discord i'm sorry but what
It's okay I'm sorry too :(
*hugs
What the hell is Chasing Aurora?
10 hour videos are so pointless
Lil_B now why did yiu want us to give you weapons
/me hugs Petrified_Discord
:) gotta love slow mondays
alexxm i didn't :/ GilDash just gave me some
Cypresswolf: eeeyup
Lil_B: Was that a Crocodile hunter reference?
Cypresswolf mmhmm
hey Cypresswolf hows your day been
urgh
Jim yes
allo Cypresswolf
all the office had was a circuit breaker delivery, now they're trying to make stuff up :D
GilDash did you get the Maniac Mansion reference?
8 min until Microsoft E3 Conference
If necessary, they'll give me someone else's to do list :P
Lil_B: woot?
sounds like gibberish
Lil_B how long do these things usaully last
For a few hours, don't they?
I think one hour iirc
Is this half life?
alexxm as far as i know about 60-90 min i think
Idk I thought it was more than an hour
Cypresswolf: no
it's Deus EX
thanks Jim Dken2021 and Lil_B
Wrek|Dusty: how much depth and complexity does this game have?
Bronysith: 5 depths and complexities
Lil_B: Uh, no. No reference I'm afraid. :$
I didnt know you could get a crowbar in that game
/me hugs Petrified_Discord
I'm pretty sure it has 6 complexities though
/me returns hug
miah he miah hoo miah haha
I'm doing my music presentation
was that a cat I heard?
now does anyone have any ROCKET FUEL for the SPACE SHIP
alexxm: I do have a party cannon if that works
Ask Nic Cage
dead?
Wrek|Dusty: haha you tazed his ass
Bronysith: So he's a bumtaze?
/me wishes he could see the stream :/
GilDash too bad, its a known (freaking old) reference, because in Maniac Mansion, you could get a chainsaw, but its empty, a year later the same people made another game, and on mars you could find fuel, but you couldn't take it, because "This Fuel has no use in THIS game"
Jim: ba dum tish
lols
:p
why can't you Petrified_Discord
artistic
so....what game is this?
Lithium: its deus ex
Lil_B: Is it a game of some kind? Sounds like an adventure or a horror...?
cool, thsns
thanks*
alexxm: 'Cus I'm at a place with dumb internet
/me waves "hello everypony! i have not much time but i bring goood news!"

Magical_pablez94: Wort, wort, wort.
Magical_pablez94: Which is his favorite pony?

Dermathil: Never underestimate the usefulness of a good crowbar.

Radu: *points gun* not today!

D:
Magical_pablez94 I wish i could do that :/ how did you do that?
Dermathil: There's gotta be a name for that. Like when they reboot sci-fi stuff and the tech's always more advanced. Like the Star Wars prequels, yaknow?
So tell us Magical_pablez94, what did you do to bronyfy him?
Not on twitch
Ponies
Dermathil: Sign of the times. This was a long while back.

05then show it here maybe after E3
alright.
Gonna watch it later
Im back.
You're gonna love it Wrek.
E3. Forever meh.
so, when is the E3 conference gonna be streamed?
Me and Sith had a great time.
It has that OH SHIT feeling you got in S1 finale
of course my car is smoking underneath. -_-
I have 3 Streams on right now XD VGA, waiting for E3 to start, LordKats Stream also waiting for E3 to start and Bronystate XD
microsoft starts it at 9:30
03:P
11 mins
awwwww yeah!
after I just got an oil change.
shame it's gonna be mostly kinect stuff :\
yeah :p
I can already forsee E3 being very boring.
they aren't bad
but i can't eat them because my stomach doesn't agree with them
10Oh, drf
The problem with Kinect stuff is that its Wii stuff
Insert_cupc4ke: Except worse controls...
exactly
I just am not a fan of motion control in general.
And the problem with Wii stuff is it's Wii stuff.
03?
dead
Meanwhile at least watching all the coverages by the Funny Internet People afterwards will be fun... less so the immensly Stupid debate on "Who WON E3 this year"
I think Rainbow Dash will win E3
For once I get what you're saying GilDash.
10I have a question regarding Pokémon Conquest. At GameStop, if you preorder from them (pay $5 extra than Target, Best Buy, wherever), you get codes to unlock Pokémon in the game. Do you think those codes are unique like the BW Dream World Lucario, or?
I'm a little jealous of the Kinect. Wish the Wii would have something more like it.
mane6 will win E3
Hello everyone
so...how bout that kinect?
Hello Cobellanez
Meanwhile: :O
hallo Cobellanez
Cobellanez: Holla! :)
03Not sure
Allo Cobellanez.
03but LOL paying for games
03I'm gonna just get the ROM
kinect = DO NOT WANT!!!
Kinect could be good, its just not. Some of that Pc modded stuff was pretty cool
I still can't believe that the Wii U is actually a thing.
agreed, the mods are the only cool thing the kinect has been given
The Kinect has... potential, I'll give it that. Yet, I'm still not interested. :D
10I may ask GameStop sometime, but they may lie/not answer because they WANT you to pay the extra $5
03of course
03which is why I avoid that place like the plague
hello everyone
Kinect is basicly the Eyetoy but with crapper games
time to end this game?
Allo Strange-Benhur.
10Actually
10they'll probably be like, "I don't know" but really do :P
Should be loading the livestream imo right now :p
The worst thing about Kinect is the terrible demonstrations with the kids
10Since lying looks bad if they get caught
03well
Ass-tazing ? must be wrek streaming
oh btw guys
Pro controller for Wii U. Discuss.
12ah finally back, stupid amd 12,4 driver made my laptops card unstabl,e donwgraded back to much more stable 12.1
I like it :)
Ripoff.
03you can probably just hack the save anyway :P
a dressed up dualshock
Nintendo is copying the 360 controller. Pathetic
05perfect end dont you think?
Pro controller, good because its a propper controller, now gte rid of all the other ones
EVERY controller is a ripoff of the snes so who cares?
./thread
refresh tie *click*
03whose fault is that
/me hides
mysticlugia, ATi drivers?
Meanwhile: everything is a rippoff in today's gaming industry
ripoofs of good ergonomic design is good
Indeed Wrek
/me points to the Dreamcast controller.
ripoffs*
I dunno if I'm gonna buy a wii u for Darksiders 2...
Lithium: Sucks doesn't it.
Probably not.
GilDash: Gildy!! Where did you hide into?
12yeah, the new cataclyst 12.4
Nintendo rips itself off :p
it's cold at 2:30am in the morning
10I'm kind of thinking they won't be unique
I rarely update my drkivers
6.9
Meanwhile: yeah, that's why me and my sis are retro gamers :)
every ripoff is a ripoff of the first ripoff
CrazyCherry: gildash is hiding?
woot! ^^
10I mean, Serebii has codes for the Japanese version http://serebii.net/conquest/passwords.shtml
dat livestream
Bye everyone, I'm starting to sense stupid arguments and discussions about things, and i don't digest this well :/ bye
12made my card so unstable that it crashed my driver just on opening firefox and watching a flash animation
03well then
oooooooo
I spy a trailer
Dat Halo 4
CrazyCherry: Implying I'm hiding. :D

Lil_B: Bai
03:P
oops
goodbye Lil_B
Sylandest: You heard him.
Lil_B: See ya! :)
10I don't think they can really regulate it either like the DW Lucario
only minutes before e3!
Byea Lil_B!!!
CrazyCherry: hehehe
10DW is an online server
10The game itself is not

I blame Halo for todays decline in shooter quality.
So guys, how about them video games?
/me dust's Wrek|Dusty.
I hope Sesame Street makes an encore this year.
Meanwhile: What about CoD?
halo was cool the first time, haven't played the other games though
Ive only palyed Halo 3 multiplayer
Wrek: There ya go.
Hello everypony
05im jsut waiting for the next deus ex game
Meanwhile: I agree
hi SirGanjalf
allo SirGanjalf
Shooters weren't good before Halo either
Meanwhile: I think it's unfair to blame any one game. I prefer to blame the big publishing companies.
in 2 mins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ninjazz|Challenge: A result of Halo.
Hey, Wrek are you gonna stream GoT today?
/me hugs and kisses GilDash.
Ironic that Halo is it's name because it's so obviously made by satan

Hmmm.

I like Halo 1 a lot, first good controls for an FPS
CrazyCherry, GilDash: might I join you two while we watch the stream? I would like the company :)
11,02Alright, back up

Kind of like F.E.A.R. 3
03most expect their kids to follow their religion
this game just looks like a brown and red blur to me.....
03which just pisses me off
I'm going to miss Chaos Theroy stealth.
with just one click on x
10My grandpa gets upset that my mother doesn't though
i don't rember being able to do that in the orignal
Ninjazz|Challenge: this doesn't look like it would hold much gameplay value if the game does all the work for you
Mushroom mushroom
03they're never given a choice whether to follow or not
twilight_sprinkle I only played a few of this current gen games, and those were on the wii
Sylandest: Who's to say the schmucks on stage aren't thinking what we all are?
Because I want the game to play for me. I'm too busy to actually do things.

Don't cheer a kill
Dken2021: i dont have any consoles either though, so i pretty much play nothing. doesnt look like im missing much
HEY! LISTEN!

11,02kirzstryfe: Okay, I can say that isn't true. That's the same as saying Wii Owners that only own a Wii aren't gamers or PS3 owners who only own a PS3 aren't gamers.
Articuno I have no idea how to even start commenting on all the honeymoon stuff you know!
:D
but can it bake cookies?
ARTICUNO
RustyMeat: xbox:"fu** you"

Nittany_Discord: IKR
[02:54:03] <~Articuno> I can't think straight
kirzstryfe: Again, I only own an xbox for gaming. Wish it wasn't so, but am I going to be labled a none-gamer now? :p
why doesn't xbox just come with its own tv screen
What if you have to pay for it....
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/homework-class-test-that-actually-sums-it-up-pretty-well.jpg
Well if you own an Xbox just for sports, you are not a gamer
you can't be as tired as I am ;_;
it's 3am right now
Kinect seems like a waste of money
Because everyone buys an Xbox to watch sports.
11,02Some people only own one console
no gamer alive owns a wii
09,01Games, who wants em? Have some shitty sports!
I'm still attempting to finish my music project
12Well I dunno.. I haven't had any sleep since Friday >v>
11,01It's another E3 of sequels, motion controls, and Kinect.
x_X
jetlagged
2You should sleep :<
XBOX, destroy that tank!
that can really mess with you
THESE PEOPLE ARE SO PHYSICED
GilDash: I dont have an Xbox, only a Wii. but I love it
i find your lack of tennis disturbing
Confirm you need to pay money to see this crap...
X-Box , selfdestruct!
:( I only own a Wii and 3DS. I'm a convenient stereotype for anti-fanboys.
Nittany_Discord: Disappointing, isn't it.
it passes after a few days, 'Cubo
:>
11,02Woah
12Yeh 11 hours is the biggest I've ever done >v<
11,01I mean another GoW?
Yankee: ikr?
Nittany_Discord, that's the same shit as last year
Sylandest: Not a fan of the Wii, to be honest.
11,02What did that lady say?
OMG MUSIC
05i dont consider the wii as a console. i consider the Wii to be a home entertainment tool. sxbox and PS3 are jsut money whores
so basically, Microsoft is appealing to one group of people and one group of people only -_-
or games, but apparently Microsoft can
12Lol Cubo ^^
And paying...
so far no games that mindblows me...
Xbox, porn.
The exact same shit
Napster?
Oh great...
Nittany_Discord: it was going to happen
11,01It's the same shit for 3 years.
SO HYPE
12I kinda missed that
/me knows how to push all the buttons :p
Haha it's been ages since i called you that XD
what about porn?
whatever your name is will we need money for this shit
Don't tell Metallica
I have cold feet again
Meanwhile: I actually hope it does that. :D
11,02I swear she said 'Yes you can'
Oh can you put pony songs inside?

OH BOY
and I damn, I dont' think I'm going to get much sleep today
it'll be more crappy pop songs
NewDCD: IKR
GilDash: I can understand that, hehe. The Wii is more for the Nintendo diehards than anything. And Admittedly, I bought it for Zelda, Super smash bros, and Metroid. also Red Steel. Thats about it
NewDCD: YESSSS
Yeah...nobody will care about that music thingy
DAT MUSIC

09,01I love how the feedback bar in Giant Bomb is on the low red
12When?!
GilDash: Nope. Just flash fail, lol.
Sylandest: I'm not too much of a Nintendo person, really. But I agree they are better on levels.
XBOX used to be a console... for gaming ONLY
SuperBrony64, isn't that Wii U?
GilDash: no, you're right, I'm being unfair. I apologize :$ *bows head*
I thought this was about Xbox
now? its getting retarded...
SuperBrony64: I wonder who could do that first?
12Beginning of the month extremely unlikely >v<
not nike
ummm is this a conference about sports? where are the games?
Not sure! I'm trying to find an apartment
2I want to see a lot of England if possible, it's so different from Ireland

12I am so glad about you moving ^v^
NikeBox?
I'd never work out with $500 dollars of technology on me.
09,01Hey guys, I play vidya because I'm an ugly fatass. I'm supposed to hate sports :I

09,01MLG PRO-SQUATZ
any clue when the PS conference is
12and by the way, what do you intend to do when you're there? Studies?
but been into writing letters lately, so i have thought about doing that! Or do you prefer emails?
Sylandest: Don't get me wrong, I think Nintendo is a better company overall. I just don't think they're worthy of the hightened respect they get.
11,01Microsoft really knows gamers.
Hmm, spend 50 euro for a fitness game or go outside for free. Tough choice
ah
and many lulz were had, and there was much rejoicing
yes
basically giving workouts a levelling system
At least theres good music.
LOL
Sociology, for a year
Nittany_Discord: HA!
12I love letters but I worry that people get upset that I don't write back :<
then onto languages methinks.
11,01I was being sarcastic.
GilDash: No Nike at Nintendo's press conference
GilDash: you would think I owould disagree, but I actually agree
Pf
2Ohhh so you decided to move, that's cool :D
Wait, what are the apps that make this work with 360 again? I zoned out.
pyrocatboy: This song is annoying
Nittany_Discord: And that's why I laughed.
09,01I watch the M$ Keynotes because they are great comedy.
Sony people say.... Microsoft you put too much crap into your stupid XBOx...
Well, I guess I can't fault them for trying to make gamers more physically active.
mitamaking: I struggle to understand you point.
/me has her palm in her face.
Wow...what low have we come to?
NewDCD: I give you +1 for making M$.
11,02"Who's that fat blue suited guy on the screen? Looks soooo FAT" "Umm...that's you Bob."
HOw long ago did this start?

Meanwhile yes you can, and you should

You know what I find funny about XBOX? It's trying to become a PC. :P
11,02TABLET
SuperBrony64: lol you called it:D
I've been into writing them lately; you could just prod me with an one-liner via email if you feel like it XD or anywhere, i know that they take money and time to send, and can be a bit inconvenient, so no way would I get upset!
OH GOD HERE WE GO

Oh great a XBOX Tablet...

Nothing of value was skipped that day
Mason!

09,01I think BO2 can be pretty good
You can make Pony Emblems YOU KNOW :D
COD:no need to innovate
There should be a Call of Duty game in a post-EMP world.

PONY EMBLEMS!!!
A WOMAN IN CALL OF DUTY :O
Ninjazz Call of Cutie Blank Ops 2
Black Ops SP I enjoyed at least it isn't MW again
We need episode 3
pyrocatboy maybe, though I thought dance central was neat
Holy shit
My reaction: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/314/309/c11.png
Well Tomb Raider, RE6, and South Park look good
aal dem spyplanes
EVERYONE! Attention, Let me explain call of duty:Get gun shoot people in face unlock new gun which looks diff and has diff stats and shoot more people in the face.
09,01but the rest of the series is pretty shit
NewDCD: We can only hope Treyarch knows what they are doing.
GarrettBrony: If only! :D
05gona brb
11,02SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN
they missed that with a BUS?
00,03SLOOO MOOO
This is 300
Doubt
So much directing by Michael Bay here!
Hey look guys we got explosions
Plot: yadayadayada the US is in danger, beat up some foreingers
11,02MOOOOO
epic slowmoooooooooooo
Directed by Michael Bay
PoS Black Crap 2....
EXPLOSIONS WILL DRAW YOU IN HUH GUYS?!
MICHAEL BAY. THE GAME
That was it?
Ninjazz: I thought Treyarch were the one's who had no clue? :S
Dusty_Nomad: that is pretty much the game
SO INTENSE!!!!
Oh
Eeexplosiiiooons wiiiithhhhh slowmooo effects
ONLY SURVOVIOR?! GOOD :P
theres more
Motion blur, the game
11,02COME ON, RANGERS LEAD THE WAY
dat shellchock again
09,01nah Treyarch are the creative ones
blaaaaboooooooooooom
Animal Crossing needs more explosions.
Darkts3 that is every Call of Duty ever
i now wonder if everything is directed by Michael Bay
09,01they had Zork playable in the title screen of BO <3
Treyarch is better than Infinity Wards
MORE FPS BULLSHIT
Imagine if Gabe just walked in
BLOODY SCREEN SO REAL
00,03Kool aid on the screen is back :(
DERP
Nice jump stupid
GilDash: At first, IW fucked EVERYTHING up with MW3. BO was actually pretty decent.
Why did you do that?!
11,02NewDCD: Yup, Treyarch >> Infinity Ward
I would kiss gabe newell cause he is Gay ben.
I wonder this game will be on Wii U?
also no Health bar
pewpewpewpewp
NewDCD: only good thing of Black Ops :D
LOOK GUYS BRO..I MEAN TERRORISTSSSS!
Too easy
DARN ROBOTS
FPS. Fraking Potty Shite
good shot!
13 year old little Shitheads magnet-the game
So far... Not bad...
The first Black Ops was all told in flashback form, right?
Fuck aiming!
Now do the barrel roll!
I <3 Gabe newell cause he is a brony
there is nothing good about CoD... nothing at all
looks easy
yeah, might've been a good idea to use that thing BEFORE THEY MADE THE FIRST OVERPASS???
he is going to fire a missile launcher while the vehicle hangs from the highway
It won't be a bad game
They should rename the CoD series to Michael Bay's Wet Dream 4.
Carl on Duty: Black Cops 2.
11,02IF this game is coming out on the Wii U, I'm getting it on the Wii U >>
CoD is just overdone
makes so much sense
Oh great another FPS:|
Gabe looks awesome with a beard.
they need to get beyond the thunderdome
hes on the floor again
I don't care I'll still get this game...
SuperBrony64: IKR
The President is captured? No way? :|
mr anderson
It just looks like everyother one
Ninjazz: Meh. I never gave Treyarch a chance with BO after they fucked up so badly with their previous games.
prom night?
Dat hand
I'm not gonna buy this
Call of Booty:Big !@#$% 2
I like it but it's only good for one playthrough
BTW, When's the Sony Conference?
at the end of the day. CoD doesn't suck.
GilDash: Well... As far as CoD goes I meant.
This looks like everything that made the FPS genre horrible
I'm not buying this either
Gabenewell is santa clause he made TF2 Free
I'm buying because I can make Pony Emblems :P
00,03Sooo... anonymous are the badguys?
09,01wish they showed some of the supposed branching stuff
CoDtards everywhere are gasming...
11,01This campaign really doesn't look fun.
Sony is at 9pm EST today
The President has been kidnapped by robots. Are you a Bad enough Dude to rescue the President?
Scoot-Scootaloo as usual
Was gta v shown?
Nittany_Discord: EMP.. CREDITS
NEW ZOMBIE MODE PLS!
Wtf is the president doing there anyway?
Already looks better than MW3 EVER WAS.
zombiebrony nope
Better yet...
ZombieBrony: Nope
What Emblem should I make Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie or which pony
Oh yay, more rappeling...
hello all
Kakumy: that will be the only reason I'd consider this
LASER GUNS?
applejcak emblem
Hye RainbowcrashNBurn!
Ninjazz these soldiers need to get beyond the thunderdome
Nittany_Discord when it's 6-8 hours, it really isn't
00,03>xray guns
Why would you even fight in this war you die in a second
Gta v is the only good game it seems
11,02Call of Duty: Halo?
00,03>multiplayer
USE UR SCOPE SECTION
The President has been kidnapped by robots. Is this a Black enough Op to rescue the President?
Pinkie Pie emblem, she is best pony after all
GarrettBrony: I don't get the red, sorry. :S
hey RainbowcrashNBurn hows your day been
09,01hmm you could choose either to Snipe or Rappel
GTA V will be the best game ever
ref*
bye Articuno
Like how no one notices him sniping
xray guns? what the hell? this isnt Black Ops, this is fucking Modern Warfare 4...
alexxm: hiya, its been good
Dat reload
Kakumy: I Agree
Odd are, the Wii U version will just use the Wii U 360 controller.
Ninjazz: i never could get into fps...it just didnt work
COD is Mediocure at best, What really rustles my jimmies is how it's praised by 13 year old C*nts who think it's the best think ever >_>
This is set in the future
somehow i'm absolutely unexcited
11,02Their demo is just him sniping?
So in 13 years we will have all this tec?
I play games with no crosshairs like a boss.
11,01Dark_Horst: Same.
xray, really? And you thought modern shooters couldn't be more easy
8,6it's like he knows right where they're going to be
Lithium: especially when they are 5 years below age rating
00,03SOO MLG PRO!!!!
Lithium: If you were a brony you would notice that you can make Pony Emblems in this game....
call of gears of Halo : Modern Battlefeild 3
Lithium: indeed :(
this is so lame...
11,02kirzstryfe: Nanobots :I
Sylandest: FPS happens to be my prefered genre... Then again I just don't game alot now.
Action packed footage
Zzzz
Lithium: a TRUE Brony
He's needs to upgrade his scanner to aim for the glands
...
lol garrett!
Ninjazz: mine's RPG, hehe. I'm no good for fps :$
ShiiiiiiiiiiiT
thank god
In the interest of time....
00,03...
Interest of time again..
um
NOOOO
lawl
fast forward
Wut
Who likes CS:S?
What interest
What happend
:D
Half life 3
Sylandest: I like RPGS too.
lets do the time warp again
Same animations
Interest? I have none
I despise fps's!
i also like how battlefield made the jump into the hightech future YEARS ago with 2142 and yet they praise this stuff as new and innovative
CS is sooo last decade.
Sylandest, Ninjazz: I like RPGs and FPSs both. :)
In the interest of how many fucks you actually give about this game we're skipping to the last 5 seconds.
11,02This game looks like ODST for some reason >>
CSGO...
2142 was great
THE GAME GOT BORED OF ITSELF
Ninjazz: yay! :D
Kakumy: If I were a realy brony, I wouldn't flaunt my love for greatness in mediocre crud....
Call of Duty is boring
GilDash: Yay!
Dusty_Nomad: I haven't palyed CS in forever
The gun looks like it's from boarderland
09,01admittedly, I like the setting
NOT CS
CSS
ODST was at least a good game...
Y'know what I like to see in call of duty? the army fighting robots
so whats the difference it looks like any other cod game
yeah this look very slow-paced
Counter strike source
NewDCD: Same here.
GilDash: I'm an rpg whore...you should see my game shelf, lol
this just looks fucking boring...
Lithium: I'm just getting Black Ops 2 to make pony Emblems :P
Fps with RPG elements. ANd by RPG i mean rapid pulse GUns
SuperBrony64: futuristic, focus on civilian areas, i see what you mean
Okay, I need advice, my hater freind is going to watch an episode... Which one do I reccomend?
hey, anypony want to find a multiplayer game we could play?
09,01I think I'll get it if it really has branching paths
You know this look sactually pretty cool...
Dusty_Nomad: I know which one you mean
I suppose that now that Portal 2 ended with Chell escaping Aperture Science, the time is ripe for a Half-Life/Portal crossover. How does shooting bullets through portals sound?
AlienEd27: BF3?
So Intense!
Ninjazz, Sylandest: I do like a range of genres, but beat 'em ups and sports/racing aren't really my thing.
Good pic
Drones
Dken2021: or anything other than the same human over and over
Mr Anderson
GilDash: Same here! :)
00,03Robots are NOT MLG Pro >: (
THIS IS SO Boring
save the president only he/she can save us now
Cedridor cereal velocity made a list for this. look it up on EQD
you know what i want to see a zombie game that just gives you a city and says have fun
i will pirate this to see if it is as crappy as i thinking its gonna be
11,02If it comes out on the Wii instead, I'll be getting it on the Wii :)
This makes me want to play Doom
MegasXLR
soulrider95 , sorry, i don't have it
i have BF3. there are ponyservers. but they're always empty
GilDash: I appreciate RPGs and fps', but sports and racing are definitely a no in my book, hehe
And here I thought they would show some Dawnguard news considering they bought the rights for first release Skyrim DLC
Scoot-Scootaloo but it's a videogame. . .
Omg imagine GTA V gameplay...
I'm excited alien:CM and Borderlands 2
someone needs to organize and event4
GTA V GAMEPLAY!!!
PC version probably $110 in Aus
Call of Duty: poor attempts to make more creative ways of killing people.
SuperBrony64: possibly might come out on Wii U

Nittany_Discord: I wouldn't be surprised.
Nittany_Discord: As long as they don't make it boring, its fine.
Dken2021 NOTHING ABSOLUTLY NOTHING
Nittany_Discord: What are you talking about. It's a whopping 4 hours long!
Dusty_Nomad: Terraria is a fun game. I got it a couple days ago.
that dust was so extreme
Sylandest: Yes...

Bf3 ripoff?
Ninjazz: mouth is agape, sir
FPS flight game?
BF3 did this better
LOL SOUND FAIL

Goddamn, how much screentime is this game gonna get?

A convoy mission!!
It's flying like a helicopter not a Jet...
Escort i mean
wow it keeps screwing up
Okay... I'll rent this.

Is he flying a Warthog or soemthing?
Is that a jet or a chopper?
i didnt buy MW3 and i wont buy this
thats it... im boycotting every CoD game for the rest of time... this is just fucking stupid
xD dat Lyra
I know its the future....
/me hugs alexxm :)
They are showing this so no one has to get CoD
well, this is some over dramatic shit
The jet is just usng the Helicopter system
00,03SO EM ELL GEE!

Ok...
he jumped to hyperspace!
NVM
09,01this actually looks pretty good...might as well support the CoD entries that aren't a rehash of a rehash
Can we even tell whats going on?
Shouldn't Black Ops involve missions that are more, oh I dunno.... Covert?
I'm glad I never got into the franchise
Nittany_Discord: for all 13 year old
This is just a clusterfuck of death and explosions
11,02ACE COMBAT WOOO
After 9 years of development, hopefully it will be worth the wait COUGH COUGH WEIGHT COUGH
Dark_Horst: They fly at speeds of like 35 mph

This is the legit flying part...

Ubisoft will show AC 3 :P
Malavolent: *chuckle*
AND NO PORTAL 3
Nittany_Discord: I know, which really only makes it worse.
I heard of the hubs after I saw reaction videos of people watching ponies
hidden rule of Bronystate: If you demand for ponies it will end up bad, got it newfillies?
Nittany_Discord: No one knows restraint these days.
/me gives SuperBrony64 min

How does ponies end bad?
Leave Portal alone, Portal is fine with 2.
Sylandest, GilDash, CrazyCherry: So what now?

Meanwhile: True, true. Half Life 3, then.

Ninjazz: I dunno.
Ninjazz, GilDash, CrazyCherry: Not sure. Depends on whats streamed

Walken
Nittany_Discord: It wouldn't be so bad if they'd at least spend elsewhere... :(
True though I never heard Valve do a 3 before...
Well, see you all later everypony.

Wow lag

GilDash, CrazyCherry: meep! :$ *blushes*

Rythym Heavan : the Game for Repetitive Strain INjuries
Ninjazz: This challenge is far more fun. ;)
00,03Yeah... but I'm not playing it 0_0
Nittany_Discord But wouldn't they show Dead Space 3?
/me has just fished up a Sea Pony. Seriously.
Scoot-Scootaloo: In all honesty, it's the feedback
derpy_pony whats the context of that
11,02When is Ubisoft's Presentation?
lawl!
derpy_pony: I laughed my ass of when I first saw that
/me hugs alexxm again :D
superb
SuperBrony64: DUuuuuude! You need to "Waste" more of your dead time! :D
SUPERB
GilDash: I planned for only ONE long and intense challenge, sorry bou that. :3
Wiiyuu
11,01Problem with EA: They're going to ruin their games with their awful business practices.
I kinda Like Ubisoft... It's a French Video Game Company who bough almost all Games Developer in Germany XD (at least all the Good ones)
Wii War 2
dang Crysis 3 is at 4:00 pm
Ninjazz|Challenge: Then I'll just have to wait for you, won't I? ;)

suprebrony64 ubisoft is 3pm
Crysis 3 would make even the Hal 9000 Lag
11,02Oh okay
GilDash: You're in for quite the wait. :$
3 pm is in what?50 mins?
REMIX 10
Nittany_Discord: if that E3 presentation showed me anything... games have already been ruined...
Come on
Ninjazz|Challenge: I might get bored of waiting... ;)
play a game
Thanks for E3, SuperBrony64!
Nittany_Discord i don't really pay attention to business stuff whats so bad about e.a
11,01Midnight_Tempest: Games were ruined for me years back.
and now Ducks!
Quack
GilDash: And attack me while I'm in the middle of it?
BANJOO AND KAZOOI! Child hood memory ftw
Nittany_Discord: indeed... though there are a few diamonds in the rough from time to time...
Pixel Junk makes some good stuff
Ninjazz|Challenge: ... ;)
and ed edd and eddy :D
GilDash: ... :$
11,01alexxm: Pretty much bad business practices. You should pay attention because you're getting an inferior product.
DUCKTALES!
Ninjazz|Challenge: Hi there!:D
Well I'm off for now guys!
WHOO HOO
DUCK TALES IS ALSO GOOD :O
Ninjazz|Challenge: You know you might need a break some time... ;)
Midnight_Tempest Like SSX!:)
bye MegaMoonShine
Dusty_Nomad: Flim's VA is the same as Double D's VA
Magical_pab|Accepted: Ahhahah! I get it! :D
11,02Microsoft Quality Control
Oh, this
pyrocatboy: maybe, never played snowboarding games... never liked them personally
Films VA is the same as Double D's VA?What?
Ninjazz|Challenge: :D:D
Nittany_Discord I wouldn't let the current state of gaming get you down though. This is not the first time that the gaming market went through something like this. Back before nintendo there was a lot of shovel ware.
GilDash: I just took one long break. :$
Dusty_Nomad: VA=Voice Actor
SuperBrony64: I lold.
LAAAWL
Ninjazz|Challenge: I think Magical_pablez94 has the right idea, actually... ;)
failing on purpose?
/me noms kirzstryfe
/me buys expensive new Monitor, Turns the power to 50% because eyes hurt :/
you hit a spider :(
WhAat film is double d's VA
8,6:p
hi Invi :D
"Microsoft Quality Control"
11,01It's not shovelware now. It's zero innovation.
hi Lil_B
Midnight_Tempest Look it up on TVTropes.
GilDash: :D about what?
GilDash: What idea is that?
Dat face
pyrocatboy: nah, too lazy to do that
superbrony64 failin on purpose?
what if i want spiders in my candy
Ninjazz|Challenge: Accepting you as a challege, silly. ;)
mmmm Spider Candy
Why the box is there, nothing goes in it?
alexxm: Dunno how about you but I don't like candy in my spiders.
lol
Well, at least there's indie gaming.
Nittany_discord the innovation can still be found from the IPs that are not apart of some corperate agenda atleast.
LOL
Midnight_Tempest http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/ssxtrickyps2_004-large_1052.jpg
GilDash: I'm no challenge. :<
11,01Even with sequels, zero innovation.
REMIX 10
YOU HIT SPIDERS CATCH CHOCOLATE
Ninjazz|Challenge: I disagree. ;)
i kinda liked the fitness stuff
hi
pyrocatboy: yeah, as i said... not interested in games like that, im an RPG buff... not a sports fan
GilDash: i have the right idea about what?
GilDash: You're just trying to keep me from heading off arn't you? :)
blimp!
OH THE HUMANITY!
Magical_pablez94: I'm a challenge, apparently. :$
Magical_pablez94: Ninjazz being a challenge. ;)
11,01Because innovation is risky, and major publishers can't afford risks, so major publishers can't afford to innovate.
Guys chocolate or sweets?
HOW can we make this scene funny...?
the sun looks pissed of
Did did ya did did ya
Ninjazz|Challenge: GilDash ... i guess i hadn't :D
Stop doing me
I don't know what in the hell I walked in on
Ninjazz|Challenge: I'm not trying to do anything. You're letting yourself get distracted. ;)
What in the hay are we watching?
Donk
/me 11,01hugs PrincessLuna
GilDash: Stop distracting me. :3
DID DID DA DID DID DA Damb damb num num gumball did did da
BONK
Nittany_Discord: Which is why some Indie games are doing so well, obviously. :D
/me cuddles Nittany_Discord
11,01Yep.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Stop *being* distracted. ;)
To the mooooooooooon.
Meanwhile: :D
11,01Games being the same every time gets old.
/me hugs PrincessLuna.
To the MOO
Hey PrincessLuna.
REMIX 10!!!
/me stops being distracted
/me hugs GilDash
11,01And forcing crap like heavy DRM, online passes, and day one on-disc DLC turns people away.
11,02This was a huge risk :)
/me goes to the moon then eats moon cheese and dies.
11,02And it succeeded :3
lol E3's interest levels were Halo 4 and South Park
Why SuperBrony64?
hi PrincessLuna :D how're ya today?
LAWL SuperBrony64
Hey, how're you Ninjazz|Challenge ?
Dammit ads in my face
SuperBrony64: Nostalgi Remix 8? :P
185 Love? I dont care
18%
11,02Well, it's a weird game that might have turned off a lot of buyers, but instead, it was awesome and fun enough to draw a crowd.
Magical_pablez94: hey pablez :) I'm good, how about you?
Well, this is why we need to vote with our wallets. If stagnation becomes a greater risk than innovation, the big companies are going to feel the pressure to innovate.
hey PrincessLuna hows your day been
Oh
Good, PrincessLuna. Doing that stupid ULTIMATE BRONY CHALLENGE, right now. :)
alexxm: Hot T_T
alexxm how is YOUR Day Been?
WHATS THE ULTIMATE BRONY CHALLANGE?
11,01Not only stagnation. Exploitation.
Ninjazz|Challenge: ultimate brony challenge?
11,02I know the point of Rhythm Heaven is to be weird and different, but from a financial perspective, it was going to be a gamble I think.
11,01Because gamers are very exploited.

Oh Kandarihu already posted it.
What is g3?
Nittany_Discord: To be fair, a lot of us let them exploit us.
Dusty_Nomad YOu dont want to know.
I love the Slow paste of this song !
11,01GilDash: Yep.
Ninjazz|Challenge: o0o
11,01I don't.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Needs more pony.
Dusty_Nomad generation 3 we don't speak of it here
11,01I stopped buying games that try to exploit me.
Its so laid mack
Malavolent: Impossibru.
I dont know whats generation 3
Ninjazz|Challenge: i might do that this summer
11,01Dusty_Nomad: Just Youtube it.
twilight_sprinkle: I'm only doing it now cause it is summer for me.

Dusty_Nomad the ponies before friendship is magic
Ninjazz|Challenge: is that the cause of your name?
woah camera
Lil_B whos mack

11,01Gen 3 is very girly and poorly animated and poorly written.
Oh the kiddy one......BARRGFGHRHGRHGHRGHRGHRHGRHGHRHGRHGRHGHRGHRGHRHGRHGRH
Ninjazz|Challenge: Nah, you got 5 more hours to fill with ponies.
That Monkey, lol
Dusty_Nomad its the generation of MLP before Friendship is Magic
Yes, indeed, Magical_pab|Accepted.
Malavolent: I've been doing this since yesterday afternoon. o___o
alexxm the song is *was* laid back
why is it every time i see family guy and hear Meg talk i hear Twilight?
11,01I'm not sure if any effort was put into the G3 ponies.
Ninjazz|Challenge: See, not it's not even me distracting you. ;)
The rescue of NINTENDO and why NINTENDO is still strong is cause of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_SPD
ah right thanks Lil_B sorry about that
Ninjazz|Challenge: well i'm not gonna start this today cause it's fucking late. i'm gonna do it during my summer vacation.
/me waves hooves infron of GilDash's face
Mah.
Wear condoms or get std's
alexxm no probalem, I was not offended XD
Lolol
Magical_pab|Accepted: That is a good idea.
Ninjazz|Challenge: You're no brony!
/me kisses Ninjazz|Challenge.
/me is waring a maid outfit
Malavolent: HOW DARE YOU!
:O
Ninjazz|Challenge: oh, wait *teasing voice* i already won that challenge the day i watched the last episode!!
Pinkie pie needs to go to sugar cube corner and get me some chocolate
Hah, welcome back SR.

Ninjazz|Challenge: You either watch ponies 25 hours daily or you're not a brony!
Wishing me luck, GilDash?
Oww
DUUUDE SuperBrony64 D:
11,02Not my day ;A;
Ninjazz|Challenge: Wishing for something else, but luck'll do for now. ;)
Malavolent: Too much of a good thing is a bad thing.
I don't watch MLP Daily but I hear its song everyday(Themes/remixes whatever)
GilDash: Oh you... :$
You got tons of PMs I guess, SuperBrony64 ? D:
Ninjazz|Challenge: Too much of pony is pony.
mlp on netflix plox1
Who is playing the wii?
PrincessLuna you want some ice
MLP IS ON NETFLIX PLOX1?
What?
/me 11,01accepts Magical_pablez94
Malavolent: I'm going to walk away now... *steps back slowly*
11,02MLP is on Netflix
Vordox Nintendo had a lot of losses in their income over the last year, because they were busy building the Nintendo Network+ Developing the WiiU + Building this Huge new Development Facility. Plus the Yen got very Strong and Nintendo transforms all their Profits Into yen, So they still got the same asmount of money, but it was just worth less
Whats netflix :|
Air Rally? D:
alexxm: Yes!!!!
Vordox dear god my wall of text :/
Ninjazz|Challenge: Please love me!
i know!
I wanna go to netflix now
/me gives PrincessLuna ice
Nittany_Discord: :D
Youre supposed to accept me, Nittany_Discord! D:
SuperBrony64, please don't say that
there are some people that are not in the USA
Malavolent: Noooo. I don't think so...
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We have Netflixs here in the UK.
Ninjazz|Challenge: so... am i brony enough?? YES I AM!
i assume sony will bring the house down, there talks are at an all time low, they HAVE to suprise us
Lil_B: Still saying that research they do in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_SPD is pretty damn safety investment of trying out new things. THey are the "THink party" of NIntendo
canadian netflix sucks
*stalks
Ninjazz|Challenge: Come over to me. I'm sane. ;)
Radu netflix is in the uk don't know about the ponies though
Magical_pablez94: Personally, I still think this challenge is stupid. But I'm doing this cause I have the time.
CrimsonPhoenix: well in the USA, MLP FiM is on Netflix.
GilDash: Not so sure about that. :$
Theres no ponies on the UK netflixs.
Ninjazz|Challenge: I'm perfetly pony, I just need my pony dose.
Yea, but I don't get why Netflix is only in the major countries
Kandarihu, I know that's why I said not everyone is in USA
So how'd Nintendo's E3 go?
Ninjazz|Challenge: mah. that's cause u dind't won this already:D
Malavolent: Who is stopping you?
Nintendo's E3 is tommorrow.

Isnt this the third time Wrek will be playing this game?
RAWRity: Fair point.

I can be a furry jedi
i'm good ingwaz

/me wants new MLP episodes NAO! :'(
Makeb
this looks good
They've already dropped down to a F2P model that WoW just started using RECENTLY after years of success, and they're not even a year old yet?
akeb lol
That's the sign that this game is dying fast.
I am close to become bored out of my mind, I don't even have friends hang out with :S
oh great another playable race, and they look like kittens
i liek the pvp idea :3
CK|MoarDed: wow is f2p now?
AlienEd27: .. draw something :P
mmeh
Medal of Honor
MEDAL OF HONOUR YEESS!
Medal of Honor time.
MOH
MoH oh god
ingwaz: They're dropping the first 15 levels down to F2P.
CK|MoarDed: they lost like 200 jobs last month, it's not surprising.
Global?
lol who gives a sh** about MOH
Oh my.
Somalia
However, I wasn't too comfortable with the last release of the Medal of Honor franchise.
CK|MoarDed: sounds lame
RAWRity: I love how he's spinning it as a great success, though
Yarrr! PIRATES!
AlienEd27: ..either.. draw... or watch more ponies.. :)
Kill the brown people!
It was still good, but not amazing.
RAWRity: WE'RE DOING SO WELL THAT WE JUST DECIDED TO GIVE AWAY THE EARLY LEVELS FOR FREE
Wow, they're really running out of names aren't they? "Warfighter"?
j/k RE5 was a decent game.
RAWRity: Yeah, soon, everypony runs out of names/ideas.
RAWRity: cant wait for GUNSHOOTER
im still at the old republic teaser

wow ded already
TheRainbowDash: Indeed. :3
AlienEd27: .... Want does not simply watch "too much" ponies
Oh good, more chest-high walls with cover based shooter scenarios. MY HOW RIVETING
The Medal of Honor Warfighter game uses the Frostbite 2 engine, am I correct?
Ya
yeah...with shades like these BUILT INTO YOUR FACE, you're ready for anything
just said it
Back :)
TheRainbowDash: Yes
I see...expecting a lot of bugs and problems then.
I kinda wish someone would make a FPS where you just tank the shit out of enemy bullet fire like you did back in the 90s, just to stir the pot some.
LOOK HOW MUCH GREY WE CAN FIT INTO THE SCREEN!
Da Choppah!
So this is Dues Ex On stream?
lol nice A.I
This "realism" crap puts me totally out of it.
I'm here!
well, I can't stand watching 480p mlp youtube uploads :'( i need quality ponies...
Yes, the graphics are amazing, but the new updated engine of Frostbite needs more stability.
hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
OOH
COOL
Breaching options
AlienEd27: then find some!
RAWRity: Behold, as you leave the grey ocean waters and enter the grey ruins in a dusky time of day!
AlienEd27, I've got all 720p rips, they werent extrodinarily hard to find
DEUS EX machina REVOLULUTION

Don't go COD
Ugh, cliche slow motion shots again.:\
Medal of Honor: Modern Greyscale
We need more arctic warfare games. These desert shooters have too many colors.
Aaaaand, here goes the only new feature
oh god
/me hugs Aliened27 i'll pm you some sites that have quality uploads

Also, Valve confirmed Half Life episode 3 not coming out on E3
Radu: omg
BULLET TIME OH SHIT THE ORIGINALITY'S KILLING ME
but I've done nothing else than ponies for three weeks 6_9
alexxm a little saddened, because Edvard Gil AKA Trolololo Guy died last night
Darkts3: I said NOT
Destructible areas
fucking about on tumblr right now. DND.
CK|MoarDed: behold, you're such a great soldier you need 4 HEADSHOTS to down an enemy
Valve is too busy with its hat wearing simulator.
i didnt know MOH went Halo on us
Vordox: How original, they did that already with the Battlefield series.
oh the trololo guy died? damn :(
Ooooo, grey smoke/.
I've never seen a game with grey smoke when stuff blows up!
cachi01: sadly yes... damn disease
Cool your playin DEUS EX
Oh my Celestia, 50% of the fucking Medal of Game game is gray.:D
HIS TROLOLO WILL LIVE ON
*Honor game

medal of honor warfighter now thats an original name :l
I myself have yet to play it

Medal of Honor: Nothing's Happening Yet
WHOAA ORIGINALITY
So, are you guys like watching TV and chatting about it here or something?
Whoa
Nice use
hmm, maybe i should continue my second playthrough of this game :P
Pre-render cut scene song is better than this pre render.
My god, using tactical drones?
NewDCD: :D
trololo guy = Eduard Khil, to be precise
Ninjazz|Challenge: Yes. And I don't even know.
hey everypony
Aussie!
Om: No wonder... Thanks.
That way you can do what you should be doing, BEING A BADASS WITH A GUN WHO JUST SITS THERE.
throw a box at the solidiers
NewDCD: The graphics look good though
its sad when a robot with guns and a grenade launcher is boring
/me hugs AJTheMightyGamer
Ugh, more of tricking the consumer into buying the same game over and over again. Medal of Honor: warfighter, doesn't even look that good as of Battlefield 3, and even that game did not live up to my fullest expectations. I refuse to buy a similar game, for the sake of destroying my waller, EA.
shut up a robot is killing people in a realistic fps :O
The trailer is kinda long
Ninjazz|Challenge: If you expected more form me. I feel sorry for you.
its funny because the exact same thing is from Mw3
I am liking the smoke effects though.
um.... thank you for the hug Yellowquiet (hugs back)
Meh...
Om: :D
Om: No... I don't ever except much from you, man.

Okay, we get it. The guns work.

Now show us something....wait that's it?
Ninjazz|Challenge: Oh good :)

okay shoot shoot and shoot got it
AJTheMightyGamer : always a pleasur ;D
THAT IS IT?
drones
"Yeah"
South Korea? Really?
/me pats Om's head
1 reason I love ponies is to spite stuff like this.
Dken2012_: no its a gun manning a robot
That was okay, at best.
Dken2012_: err guy
No Swedish? With our Fifth best military in the world? WELL SCREW you EA:
what we watching?
Medal of Honor, eh..
omg 12 tiers how interesting
DeusEx
ah
Radu: Why not, maybe they have kickass special forces?
i think
Darkts3 I want my army vs robots game :(
OMG FROSTBITE 2 Give it GOTY
"No shooter is complete without a multiplayer" and by that we mean, no FPS is a game without a multiplayer, because you sure as hell won't get more than 4 hours of our half-assed attempt at single player.

Literlly the only thing I care about in the nintendo conference is the announcement of B/W 2's release date.
Buck the Police
/me puts up a "No Umbreon" sign
Lambo: thats what I said
I love how they use the slo-mo cam to make that crash seem more exciting than it was
Wrek|Dusty: dont stop me now. im having a good time im having a ball

Om: Wooot! :O Thats totally awesome! :D
LOL
Gildy has been found Guilty of her crimes.

Co-Op? are you fucking shitting me? Being alone is part of the definition of SURVIVAL HORROR
DRINK! *Drinks whole bottle*
8,6that's 2
Airpuff: I didn't want to cook anything.
Sometimes you want to be with your friends, dying in space
Litwick: Excuse me? ;)
Come to papaaa-GODDAMMIT
13:<

All it needs is a kickass soundtrack!
Lambo: DS is not survival horror
Om: Well Pizza and cake is legitimate :P
13!soital
12Sorry, you are not qualified to own me. How about a Latté instead?
I said what I said :)
Police car, ded.:D
Litwick: Does that mean I'm to be punished now? ;)

DS used to be an "action-horror"
Lambo: yeah only the first game...
DAMN WALLS

GilDash: Punishment for you would be to say you get not punishment >_>
Lambo: damn it really scared xd
Ah, nice, Deus Ex 3
MERE STREAM!!

kirzstryfe: 5 guys burgers and fries?
Holy. Hay.
DCD IT'S SO INNOVATIVE AND REALISTIC AND SHIT
cachi01: I am still playing it right now. Only 20 minutes at a time...
Hai CrazyCherry :P
Now it's only action shooter
NOW ALL IT NEEDS IS A FACEBOOK APP AND IT'LL BE THE PERFECT GAME
In B4 half the crowd gets mauled down by a car
Lambo: lol
so plenty of destruction?
i dont want innovation in my need for speed, i want the original most wanted back again
God Save the Queen!
He's working for an achievement?
Airpuff: Hiya!!!

Twist ending to this conference: WE'RE REBOOTING THE ULTIMA SERIES
Wrek|Dusty: Is the 8th wonder
....he's in Jurassic Park?
But, to be honest, british Queen was celebrating reign jubilee yesterday
Airpuff: Great!!! :)
Airpuff, Om: Don't you go mocking my Queen. :|
8,6if you hunt out everything and knockout everyone prior to the first praxis kit, on hard mode you'll have enough exp to have 2 praxis points
RAWRity: ....ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Ultima 9 was such a good game.

Fuck Yeah
THEY'D REBOOT THE SERIES FOR 9 GAMES, JUST TO FUCK UP ULTIMA 9 WORSE
I've never played stuff like this. Is it good?
RAWRity: I KNOW THEY WOULD, BUT WHY WOULD YOU EVEN MENTION THE IDEA?!?

Lambo 2: You too?
Bronysith: There is a leaked tech demo

CriticKitten: YOU TAKE THAT BACK YOU DAMN DIRTY FELINE

Airpuff: No, it gives me the illusion of fredome.
And there was a trailer
Princess_Molestia: are you here?
RAWRity: NOPE
Om: :D Or that
There has to be BGAE2
Darkts3: idk i think he did die

Yes.
Wrek|Dusty: is dat ze stun gun of pain?
How can they not make BG&E2?
GilDash: .. Your queen is ol' :P
Princess_Molestia: well you want to you know...
Hey, this is a really good demo of Medal of Honor
So many acronyms
Darkts3: yep alcatraz killed himself
cachi01: aww
I feel old not recognizing most of them
that was fun
Oh, wait, this is Crysis 3?
CriticKitten: I HOPE THEY RLEASE AN 80 DOLLAR MASS EFFECT DLC THAT'S NOTHING BUT 2 HOURS OF SHEPPARD'S CORPSE DCOMPOSING.
Silly me
Airpuff: OFF WITH YOUR HEAD! :S
GilDash: Can I be the executioner?
DRINK!
RAWRity: Wouldn't bother me. :D
GilDash: But thats not allowed in these days! :O

Bronysith: Nothing much in you?
GilDash: You made Om superhappy. xD
GilDash: Well excuse me if we fought against you :'(
Wow, that was a great Call of Duty trailer!
Airpuff: Hi :$

Irish_Pony: how's the day?
So they wussed out bringing Crysis 3 on Wii U.
Airpuff: Torture....

DUDE YOU HAVE FAAAAAAAILED
Irish_Pony: Torture? That bad? really? :D

Hat: ya
Oh, my god, seriously, Microsoft? That Halo 4 trailer? Why don't you just make a Halo movie already
Irish_Pony: Like that was personally my fault. :D
Crysis 3: Time to Upgrade your Computer AGAIN.
Airpuff: yes......
Airpuff: And all it took, is an exicution
final wrap-up
Lambo: IKR

Hat: crysis is eppic dude
NOPE
SCREW ORIGIN
Lambo is watching the M$ conference?
sooo whats the wra???
Crysis 1 and Warhead are great but didn't like 2
i played first crysis and it was meh imo
Airpuff: I think I can handle this... one sec...
Airpuff: That really isn't any of my concern. Gotta obey orders and what not.
Crysis 1 was fun, didn't like the story but the gameplay was fun
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SHOVE EM SO FAR UP YOUR ASS
GilDash: ..Handle.. what?....
Hat: thats because of piracy forcing them to go to consoles
CriticKitten: THEY'RE TOTALLY GONNA DO IT.
Om: Omfee, if you do this, you have to replace Airpuff for me. ;)
the story in first crysis was retarded and cliche
Om: D:
I still mess around with the North Koreans and super strength
GilDash: Still! Like it was my fault that England killed 1/4 of our population :'(
09,01I hate the whole social aspect
09,01I mean
09,01I'm an antisocial fuckhead
Irish_Pony: You were the one who brought it up. I don't care. :D
GilDash: Sure, I'll take off your head too.
DCD: Ditto
/me hugs Irish_Pony
Play games to play games
Chalk another conference up for the disappointment column
09,01and gaming is supposed to be my mostly antisocial hobby
Rp,
If I want social experience I'll play an MMO
GilDash: Phew. Safe. xD
Om: I haven't given you the axe yet. :|
/me throws a Latté to SS
That Sim City facebook seemed worth checking out
NewDCD: Now I love you.......
12:D
Man, that trailer with the ship looked like it set up a Dead-Space Style Halo with a woman as protagonist. That would be an interesting change, actually
CriticKitten: ULTIMA X, AND IT'S GOING TO BE ENTIRELY ON FACEBOOK. AND NEW DLC EVERY WEEK.
I CAN'T HOLD ALL THIS INNOVATION
sneaky sneaky
GilDash: I have my own. Made it myslef.
R.I.P Mr. Trololo
NewDCD: I know how that feels, bro
xD
THIS INNOVATION ALMOST KILLED ME
RAWRity: That would be so shit
/me drinks :D
XD
Om: .. you made your own axe?
lol
the Trololo man died
Derpy-Master: indeed :(
COMPUTER Y NO U DIE ALREADY!?! :[
Haha
09,01In all seriousness, though
Derpy-Master: ikr
Airpuff: Doesn't everyone?
craap. I gotta awake for 2 more of these press conferences.
aww
Ponies47: roflcopter

cachi01: Y U N O
CriticKitten: AND ALL THE DLC IS ON THE DISC ALREADY.
Om: ... nay.. not really.. xD
RAWRity: And they'll make the Avatar even more of a mindless dipshit!
09,01I like multiplayer, but not when it overrides the single-player experience
YUNO Shamroc!
8,6so are we up to 8 or 9?
kirzstryfe: 5
kirzstryfe: for wat?
Shane377: DAMN THATTAB FAIL LOL
NewDCD: You are right though, the more social and online aspects that are forced into SP games, the crazier the DRM and harder it is to play without internet
Bronysith: what?
Om: I might just have to cover it in chocolate sauce. ;)
Does Wrek have the Tranquilizer Rifle?
CriticKitten: THE AVATAR NO LONGER KNOWS WHAT BRITANIA IS. HE ALSO NEEDS A 2 HOUR TUTORIAL ON HOW TO EAT.
cachi01: how is it a tab fail
8,6no, I know he's restarted at least 7 times, if not more
Airpuff: Oh, and I have a friend that would love to meet your soon to be headless body
GilDash: You and that chocolate sauce.. xD
kirzstryfe: oh lol
cachi01: i tabbed u ddidnt i
Okay, time to go watch Microsoft's conference and see how badly they fucked up. I imagine it couldn't have been that much worse than EA....right?
....right?
>_>;
Om: ...... Wha...?
GilDash: The axe? Sure, why not.
RAWRity: What's a paladin?
Shane377: but i tried to tab you and i fail
Even Splinter Cell is getting streamlined. Desert? Future warfare? No more stealh, but more action? What is wrong with the industry
Hello Everypony :)
lol cachi01
Om: You know a person who what now?! xD
Tov: SHOW IT AGAIN.
Om: I was thinking you. ;)
Hi Gamer_Luna
Shane377: xd
Crysis 3 lost to Dead Space 3 by 10 percent =/
xD
Lol nice work Wrek|Dusty xD
Fail lol
Fail
8,6the trick here is to just say you're going to shoot him, then hit him fast enough
cachi01: XD---D
XXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDD
The industry is being raped by bad indie games and bad movies
hey Gamer_Luna what have you been up to
Airpuff: To give you an example, he killed chickens with his bare hands as a child.
NewDCD: I think Blizzard just passed the line: You have to actually play multi, to play single.
8,6which Wrek failed to do
8,6and 8
I takled him out of it
Om: .... da fuq.... o.o
crysys 3 and dead space 3 will be awesome i know it
who did Om
GilDash: I have beheading to do!
Irish_Pony: :)
alexxm: Friend o' mine. Nice guy
/me walks towards GilDash With axe...
Gamer_Luna: <3
really, you liked the look of ds3?
Hey hey hey Gamer_Luna :)
/me sprays GilDash In the face with the axe
cachi01: inb4 Crysis 3 and DS3 both suck bricks
:D
ill give you crysis looked good
o hai Gamer_Luna
Wii U will have so much online that you can't play single player unless ur connected to the internet.
RAWRity: Ultima X takes place entirely in Texas. No Britannia at all!
but ds3 looks pretty lame
/me hugs Irish_Pony
RAWRity: xd
RAWRity: dont be a hater
Is it true, Diablo 3 muuust have internet enabled at all times?
Gamer_Luna: Hi honey <3
Airpuff: ... Why?
RAWRity: And you fight ROUS and park pirates the entire game!
8,6Vivix: yes
GilDash: Cuz i could!
GilDash: Irony, I would think.
THat's terrible-
Irish_Pony: Hello,muffin :)
Whitney Houston dies: Who? Trololo dies: NOOOOOOOO!!!!
CriticKitten: YOU FIGHT NOTHING. ALL YOU DO IS LEARN HOW TO EAT AND TALK TO GYPSIES.
Om: ima iron this chat down to the ground!
soooo next is ubisoft in 1 hour
I love sp games, and you know story games, it just seems wrong to force yu to go online
8,6it is a large amount of suck
lol EA being game focused
lets see with what bullshit they will come
Om: I'll go get my iorningboard. :D
Airpuff: Good luck doing that without a head.
RAWRity: YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAND SHALL BE GREAT
Bronysith: u dont say
Vivix: There's also so many issues with connecting to their servers at the moment
"Pickles on my hamburger? - I never asked for this!"
Bronysith: whoa. I actually got offended
CriticKitten: WHAT'S A PALADIN
Ahh--it's sad
jenson wants your wife as his reward
Om: Pffff. One does not simply cut of my head.
Shane377: may he rest in peaace
Wrek|Dusty: SPAAAACE
Blizzard made a lot of good games before MMO fad
well, im gona go. bye
Gamer_Luna: Do you know how much I wub you? <3
GilDash: Good thinking, we shall want his head presentable.
Vivix: star craft was pretty good as well as warcraft 3
Game devs must remember that a lot of the world has poor internet still, and choose games that do not require it-
RAWRity: WHAT'S THE CODEX OF INFINITE WISDOM?
"Adam Jensen: Non lethal take-down? -> Breaks every bone in the body."
Airpuff: Oh?
Yeah, but dont those predate MMO?
CriticKitten: I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
Wrek|Dusty: Dare you to sing the Winter Wrap song
RAWRity: XD

Airpuff: I don't think Gillysuit can save you now.
NewDCD: Do a count down

If they would make a game in the Ghost In The Shell Universe. A mixture between Deus Ex 3 and Mirror's Edge -> ZOMGNERDGASM
Shane377: he just said he will be remembered
alexxm: the camera, the music, the pacing, the dreary tone, the lack of social networking.
Wrek|Dusty: is it reeses pieces?

omg
09,01anyways, one

Wrek|Dusty: dat crash
Scoot-Scootaloo: Did I say you could come out of the corner?!

alexxm: :D
/me waves old man cane
/me Cuddles up with Irish_Pony
Vivix: I could only get from ep1 to about ep 16, because the rest wasnt released yet back then :)

ScootaCorner: now, what have we learned?
Vivix: thats a LOT of ponies man :D
00,03Not to interrupt...

Being able to designate targets before advancing for fluid badassery is a solid design,

alexxm: He would most likely not watch it as he is plaing skyrim
poor Scoots
Ninjazz|Challenge: hows it going
ScootaCorner: and?

Right after I finished school, so probably noember?
....and there goes my excitement in that it features the Kinect.

Ninjazz|Challenge: :O
Irish_Pony if you say so but i think thats impossible
Ninjazz|Challenge: So the goal is to watch Seasons 1 and 2 with no coffee or anything!?! :o
Scotch sounds delicious, the name-
dat fire chainsaw
Om: Responce to an OLD comment long time ago.
Vivix: I think the concept of a Noob is non existant when it comes to liking a show. what should we hate someone new? for not knowing all canon and/or terminology? thats ridiculous. :)
yyeah
all dem tranqs
Ponies47: No. Just watch everything.
Ponies47: In one go.
Wrek|Dusty: get yourself one of these weapons http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3865/
Ninjazz|Challenge: Okie doki loki :)
Ninjazz|Challenge: But I just read "I wub you too GilDash" I knew it!
I've seen people , on other mlp chats, be kicked for "being annoying", like typical kid stuff "I loove fluttershyy! " etc
10I can play fancy emoticons with you now (・｀ω´・)
Bronysith: .. soo... awesome!
Wrek|Dusty tranqulise the homeless people
Before I go,do you guys think a Pony that loves bombs and is named TNT would make a good OC ? :)
/me kisses Ninjazz.
Whaat
sure why not Gamer_Luna
Damn it, Adobe, don't crash one me like that... Om, Ponies47, repeat that?
12I still have my new years resolution
That reminds me of Dynamitt Harry from olsenbanden Luna
Ninjazz|Challenge: Okie doki loki :)
So I was right. The entire Microsoft show is just going to be one very long attempt at convincing people to buy the Kinect, isn't it? God.
Ninjazz|Challenge: I don't need to o3o
Gamer_Luna: if he uses the TNT for minig/construction, why not?

Wait!I have 5 mins!Woo!
GilDash: Look at topic pl0x
GilDash: Get out of here....
/me hugs |Discord|
FIFA 13 is going to have a feature in which you can't curse out the refs without the Kinect detecting your language and flagging you? WHY WOULD YOU DESIGN A GAME LIKE THIS?!?
Alchemist: you only live once...its an acranim
Ninjazz|Challenge: No. ;)
Ninjazz|Challenge: Don't be rude to your love.
YOLO is crap.I go by YOYO
Well... Damn.

Chrysalis: There is no NO rp rule lol

Then again...

Airpuff: Good to see you've recognised this, now please act accordingly.
Darkts3: I LOVE STAR WARS
Ponies47: something wrong with my other nick NewDCD is being ossim and some how fixing it
Bronysith: do you love the new star wars kinect?
Left leg BROKEN!
ScootaChicken: What? Im not rping now?

00,03If you express your love to someone else in the chat, you are doing excessive RPing, and you will fail...
Bye everypony :)
Airpuff: Yeah, you're not RPing now. Bit like a murderer in court saying 'What! I'm not shanking anyone now!'
GilDash: There is no argument really. just the RP haters claiming it to be strictly forbidden in all forms -.-
/me flails in chat
I like this music.
/me Hugs Alicorn_Shane and Irish_Pony
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21481939
RP isn't strictly forbidden, just restricted.
Airpuff: I'm not talking about it. That's my only line.
Airpuff: That's because it fucking is.
In fact. I love this music.
Gamer_Luna: <3
<Angel_Umbreon> chill o.o; <-- I am chill, but Jun seriously annoys me and he should take a hint an leave me alone.
ScootaChicken: Lol its not. Read the rules over.
So... I never really noticed how evil Discord is.
chat derped
00,03If your kissing and licking, that is not cool :|
GAMES, Y U NO STAY UP!?
lol
Crashed Agaain?
Irish_Pony: Maybe see you tomorro Love,Oay <3
D:
If you have a problem with the RP rule you are encouraged to write a thoughtful letter to the mods, or otherwise shut your fat fucking mouth.
crashed
Gamer_Luna: Ok <3
Wrek|Dusty: this is for you http://memegenerator.net/instance/21481982
Jesus, I can't believe this crap has gone on so long.
Noone was moaning abou the rule though
Kissing and licking is definetly NOT okay.
maaan. I'm gonna miss Matrix 2 Rifftrax tonight.
Meanwhile How do you take the words right out of my mouth? Are you a wizard?
Way to intenify it.
Airpuff: something wrong with my nick
They were moaning about the interpretation
00,03If you're being a jerk, you're not cool :|
Bronysith: i must say he is taking the crashes really good o.o
8,6the arguement is when people starting with the love RP, the licking, etc, you're forcing that on people that are here because this is NOT an RP channel
Meanwhile: I just think that RP is too lengthy to be in reg chat servers.
Meanwhile: Yeah, the argument is becoming more of an issue then the problem.
Alicorn_Shane: Woot? How come?
I left my robe and wizard hat downstairs.
XD
00,03If you are moaning, you are not cool :|
Wrek|Dusty: http://memegenerator.net/instance/21481982

Airpuff: i haz not a clue
Scoot-Scootaloo: people moan?
/me moans loudly

lol
....is that
Vivix: srsly
Oh god
Scoot-Scootaloo: Moaning? WHO!? that is my job
Well, I get htat, it's awkward when people try to rp with you
then maybe
8,6there are quite a few RP channels on the network, and if you feel the need to express your love in character to someone, go to one of them, create your own, or take it to PM
ask him nicely
They're trying to sell a racing game with dubstep?!
cool desktop
the game has crashed. again. there is f*ck all you can do about it. Is that clear? : Okay Cancel Resume
I dunno, just a thought.
Great, Scoot-Scootaloo. Now ponies will start moaning.
Some nice coverage on MGS.Rising on Spike
kirzstryfe: is hugging fine?
My brane is brokeded
00,03If you feel the need to express yourself to another person on the chat, please do it on PM
